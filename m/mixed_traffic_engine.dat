5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Thompson built {{one of the}} most {{successful}} LNER designs, the class B1 4-6-0, which was a simple two-cylinder design <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>engine.</b> The B1 was based loosely on Gresleys class B17. The prototype for the B1 was a B17/1 modified with a higher pressure boiler and with its centre cylinder removed. The design proved to be free-steaming, economical and simple to maintain, though some details caused issues in due course. The small amount of balancing of the reciprocating masses (in order to reduce hammer-blow) made for a rough ride and a significant degree of vibration in the cab, and eventually the reciprocating mass percentage was increased. More than 400 B1s were built between 1946 and 1952: British Railways continued B1 production after nationalisation. The Diagram 100A boiler used in the class formed the basis for the rebuilding of many pre-grouping classes, including the class O4 2-8-0 freight locos. The Thompson B1 equalled the LMS Black Five locomotives during the inter-regional exchange trials in the first year of British Railways. The B1 was also cheaper to build than the Black Five. The B1 had poor and very inconsistent ride quality, unlike the relatively smooth riding qualities of a number of Gresley designs, though it must be considered that fundamentally a locomotive with a rear truck/Cartazzi arrangement does generally ride better than one without, and even Gresleys classes reflected this. Poor riding remains [...] a characteristic of the two preserved B1s.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} in 1918 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for use in Russia as a class Ye locomotive. However, it, along with approximately 200 other locomotives, remained in the United States, due to {{the inability of the}} Bolshevik government to pay for them, following the Russian Revolution. 1630 was converted from [...] Russian track gauge to [...] standard gauge. After being re-gauged, #1630 was sold to the USRA and was numbered 1147. Shortly after, 1147 was briefly leased for use on the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1920, the locomotive was sold to the St. Louis - San Francisco Railway, where it was used as a <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1951, the locomotive was sold to Eagle-Picher, who used it to haul lead ore from a mine to their smelter. In 1967, the locomotive was donated to the Illinois Railway Museum, in Union, Illinois, where they began restoring it in 1972, it returned to operating condition in 1974 and made its first revenue run. Sometime after arriving at the museum, 1630 was restored from her Eagle Picher appearance back to her Frisco appearance. In an episode the 1982 TV series American Playhouse named [...] "Any Friend of Nicholas Nickelby is a Friend of Mine," [...] the decapod was used for some sequences. In 1991, the locomotive appeared in the movie The Babe in the transportation scenes, which were filmed at IRM. 1630 was taken out of service in 2004, and after more than six years undergoing repairs and a federally mandated rebuild, it was returned to operational condition on October 30, 2013. On Memorial Day weekend 2014, the locomotive returned to excursion service. In 2016, the locomotive received a cylinder overhaul, which according to Steam department curator, Nigel Bennett, made the locomotive, [...] "probably more powerful than she has been since he sic first arrival at IRM in the 1970’s."

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a gray system theory-based method for the quantitative evaluation and ranking of the operational and safety performance of signalized intersections {{in urban areas}} under <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions. <b>Mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions refer to traffic situations in which motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians share a signalized intersection. Such <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> is a typical phenomenon in many cities {{around the world in}} which the populations of urban areas are extremely large. Five index parameters are used in the proposed method: the degree of saturation, the average stopped delay, the queue length, the conflict ratio, and the separation ratio. These parameters represent the operational and safety performance of a signalized intersection with <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic.</b> They are inputted into the evaluation equations, which are developed according to the gray system theory. The method is applied to the performance evaluation of the intersections and network in the urban area of Changsha, China. the results show that the method can be used to conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation and ranking of signalized intersections under the <b>mixed</b> <b>traffic</b> conditions that are associated with urban road network systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
