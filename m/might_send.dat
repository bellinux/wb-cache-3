25|$|Allenby {{arrived on}} 27 June 1917. Robertson (31 July) {{wanted him to}} keep active so as to prevent the Turks concentrating forces in Mesopotamia, {{although}} he scoffed at intelligence reports that the Germans <b>might</b> <b>send</b> as many as 160,000 men to that theatre. Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but {{the extent of his}} advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in “secret and personal” notes (1 and 10 August).|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} fresh {{information regarding}} Ottoman deployments on 10 April, Dobell modified {{his plan to}} incorporate a more flexible approach. While the first stage would remain unchanged, during {{the second stage of}} the battle he might attack directly by swinging his line slightly northeast, with only one division attacking Gaza to create a gap for Desert Column, depending on whether the hostile Atawineh defences were reinforced by units from the Hareira detachment. Or he <b>might</b> <b>send</b> most of his force to the coastal side of Gaza to make an attack there.|$|E

He was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression. Wishing to avoid a conflict with Morocco, Louis-Philippe sent an extraordinary mission to the Sultan, mixed with displays of military <b>might,</b> <b>sending</b> war ships to the bay of Tangiers. An ambassador {{was sent to the}} Sultan Moulay Abderrahmane in February 1832, headed by the Count of Mornay and including the painter [...] The Sultan, however, refused French demands to evacuate Tlemcen.|$|R

25|$|School {{districts are}} rarely {{precisely}} coextensive with the cities, towns, villages, or hamlets that bear the same name, meaning {{that a person}} living in one hamlet or village <b>might</b> <b>send</b> their children to a school associated with a different hamlet or village. Residents pay school taxes to the same school district {{in which they live}} and any children living with them attend school. All tax-paying residents are eligible for the STAR Program tax rebate, which in effect lessens the value of an individual's primary residence to lessen the tax burden on the residence.|$|E
25|$|For example, one switch <b>might</b> <b>send</b> {{only the}} last four or five digits of a {{telephone}} number. In one case, seven digit numbers were preceded by a digit 1 or 2 to differentiate between two area codes or office codes, (a two-digit-per-call savings). This improved revenue per trunk and reduced the number of digit receivers needed in a switch. Every task in electromechanical switches was done in big metallic pieces of hardware. Every fractional second cut off of call set up time meant fewer racks of equipment to handle call traffic.|$|E
25|$|From October 1933 to June 1935, the {{committee}} of six looked into many options. They covered Brazil, British Guiana, Niger, however, all failed. A further {{suggestion that the}} British Red Cross <b>might</b> <b>send</b> a relief party to Mosul was also objected to, apparently {{on the grounds that}} this would discourage the activities of the Iraqi Crescent, which has not carried out any relief work among the Assyrians. In September 1935, the plan of settling of some of the Assyrians in the Khabour and Ghab areas in Syria was approved. History shows that the plan was never followed up so it too has failed.|$|E

25|$|The ninth {{meeting of}} Parliamentary Union of the OIC member states (PUOICM) {{was held on}} 15 and 16 February 2007 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The speaker of Malaysia's House of Representatives, Ramli bin Ngah Talib, {{delivered}} {{a speech at the}} beginning of the inaugural ceremony. OIC secretary-general Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu said prior to the meeting that one main agenda item was stopping Israel from continuing its excavation at the Western Wall near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site. The OIC also discussed how it <b>might</b> <b>send</b> peacekeeping troops to Muslim states, as well as the possibility of a change in the name of the body and its charter. Additionally, return of the sovereignty right to the Iraqi people along with withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq was another one of the main issues on the agenda.|$|E
25|$|After the German {{invasion}} of France had been halted at the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914, {{the war of}} movement ended at the Battle of the Yser and the First Battle of Ypres. The Germans built field fortifications to hold the ground captured in 1914 and the French began siege warfare {{to break through the}} German defences and recover the lost territory. In late 1914 and in 1915, offensives on the Western Front had failed to gain much ground and been extremely costly in casualties. According to his memoirs written after the war, the Chief of the German General Staff, Erich von Falkenhayn, believed that although victory might no longer be achieved by a decisive battle, the French army could still be defeated if it suffered a sufficient number of casualties. Falkenhayn offered five corps from the strategic reserve for an offensive at Verdun at the beginning of February 1916 but only for an attack on the east bank of the Meuse. Falkenhayn considered it unlikely the French would be complacent about Verdun; he thought that they <b>might</b> <b>send</b> all their reserves there and begin a counter-offensive elsewhere or fight to hold Verdun while the British launched a relief offensive. After the war, the Kaiser and Colonel Tappen, the Operations Officer at Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, General Headquarters), wrote that Falkenhayn believed the last possibility was most likely.|$|E

500|$|The only sermon of Stoughton's to be {{published}} was entitled New-Englands True Interest. [...] The sermon was originally delivered at the election of 1668, and was published in 1670. [...] In it he harkened back to {{the founding of the}} colony, saying [...] "God sifted a whole Nation that he <b>might</b> <b>send</b> choice Grain over into this Wilderness", but also lamented what he saw as a decline in Massachusetts society, and urged the lay members of society to defer judgment to their clerical elders.|$|E
500|$|Billingham has {{suggested}} that a civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity {{is also likely to}} be culturally and ethically advanced, and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects that would harm human civilization. Such projects could include Dyson spheres, which completely enclose stars and capture all energy coming from them. Even if well within the capability of an advanced civilization and providing an enormous amount of energy, such a project would not be undertaken. For similar reasons, such civilizations would not readily give humanity the knowledge required to build such devices. Nevertheless, the existence of such capabilities would at least show that civilizations have survived [...] "technological adolescence". Despite the caution that such an advanced civilization would exercise in dealing with the less mature human civilization, Sagan imagined that an advanced civilization <b>might</b> <b>send</b> those on Earth an Encyclopædia Galactica describing the sciences and cultures of many extraterrestrial societies.|$|E
500|$|Labour {{defeated}} the Conservatives by four {{seats in the}} British general election on 15 October 1964, and formed a government the next day. Both Labour and the Conservatives told Smith that a positive result at the indaba would not be recognised by Britain as representative of the people, and the Conservatives turned down Salisbury's invitation to send observers. Smith pressed on, telling parliament that he would ask the tribal chiefs and headmen [...] "to consult their people in the traditional manner", then hold the indaba as planned. On 22 October, 196 chiefs and 426 headmen {{from across the country}} gathered at Domboshawa, just north-east of Salisbury, and began their deliberations. Smith hoped that Britain, having taken part in such indabas in the past, <b>might</b> <b>send</b> a delegation at the last minute, but none arrived, much to his annoyance, particularly as the British government's Commonwealth Secretary Arthur Bottomley was only across the Zambezi in Lusaka at the time.|$|E

500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, there must be something in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi <b>might</b> <b>send</b> down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E
