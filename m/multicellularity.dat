5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of <b>multicellularity</b> occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of <b>multicellularity.</b> It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of <b>multicellularity</b> was a pivotal {{point in the}} evolution of life on Earth. Shortly after <b>multicellularity</b> arose, there was an immense increase in the diversity of living organisms {{at the beginning of the}} Cambrian Era, called the Cambrian Explosion. <b>Multicellularity</b> is believed to have evolved multiple times on Earth because it was a beneficial life strategy for organisms. For <b>multicellularity</b> to occur, cells need to be capable of self-replication, cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell communication. There also must have been available oxygen and selective pressures in the environment.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that prokaryotic cells {{contained}} the building blocks required for <b>multicellularity</b> to arise, this transition did not occur for around 1500 million years after {{the origins of the}} first eukaryotic cell. Scientists have proposed two major theories for the reason that <b>multicellularity</b> arose so late after the appearance of life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>multicellularity</b> from unicellular ancestors has been replicated in the laboratory, in evolution experiments using predation as the selective pressure.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{major change}} was {{the advent of}} <b>multicellularity.</b> The presence of oxygen allowed eukaryotes and, later, multicellular life to evolve.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the transition to <b>multicellularity</b> during the Precambrian, it is important to look at the requirements for multicellularity—both biological and environmental.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multicellularity</b> {{has evolved}} {{independently}} at least 25 times, including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and plants. It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), {{once or twice}} for animals, once for brown algae, and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and red algae. <b>Multicellularity</b> may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.|$|E
25|$|Cell walls evolved {{independently}} in many groups, {{even in the}} photosynthetic eukaryotes. In these lineages, {{the cell}} wall {{is closely related to}} the evolution of <b>multicellularity,</b> terrestrialization and vascularization.|$|E
25|$|Sponges {{have around}} 6 {{different}} types of cells that can perform different functions. Sponges are a good model for studying the origin of <b>multicellularity</b> because the cells are capable of communicating {{with one another and}} re-aggregating. In an experiment conducted by Henry Van Peters Wilson in 1910, it was found that cells from dissociated sponges could send out signals and recognize each other to form a new individual. This suggests that the cells that compose sponges are capable of independent living, however once <b>multicellularity</b> was possible then aggregating together to form one organism was a more efficient way of living.|$|E
25|$|Seeds {{protect and}} nourish the embryo or young plant. They usually give a {{seedling}} a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, {{because of the}} larger food reserves in the seed and the <b>multicellularity</b> of the enclosed embryo.|$|E
25|$|The first {{evidence}} of <b>multicellularity</b> is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived between 3 and 3.5 billion years ago. Other early fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested Grypania spiralis and the fossils {{of the black}} shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon.|$|E
25|$|This theory postulates that <b>multicellularity</b> arose as a {{means for}} prey to escape predation. Larger prey {{are less likely to be}} preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that <b>multicellularity</b> arose when the first predators evolved. By {{assembling}} as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore <b>multicellularity</b> was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory protist, Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of Chlorella vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting because before the predator was introduced, the population of Chlorella vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.|$|E
25|$|These are the {{earliest}} multicellular organisms in Earth’s history, {{despite the fact}} that unicellularity had {{been around for a long}} time before that. The requirements for <b>multicellularity</b> were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|E
25|$|Rb {{belongs to}} the pocket protein family, whose members have a pocket for the {{functional}} binding of other proteins. Should an oncogenic protein, such as those produced by cells infected by high-risk types of human papillomaviruses, bind and inactivate pRb, {{this can lead to}} cancer. The RB gene may have been responsible for the evolution of <b>multicellularity</b> in several lineages of life including animals.|$|E
25|$|In {{analyzing}} which environments {{are likely}} to support life, a distinction is usually made between simple, unicellular organisms such as bacteria and archaea and complex metazoans (animals). Unicellularity necessarily precedes <b>multicellularity</b> in any hypothetical tree of life, and where single-celled organisms do emerge there is no assurance that greater complexity will then develop. The planetary characteristics listed below are considered crucial for life generally, but in every case multicellular organisms are more picky than unicellular life.|$|E
25|$|Signal {{transduction}} {{mediated by}} the superfamily of GPCRs {{dates back to the}} origin of <b>multicellularity.</b> Mammalian-like GPCRs are found in fungi, and have been classified according to the GRAFS classification system based on GPCR fingerprints. Identification of the superfamily members across the eukaryotic domain, and comparison of the family-specific motifs, have shown that the superfamily of GPCRs have a common origin. Characteristic motifs indicate that three of the five GRAFS families, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, and Frizzled, evolved from the Dictyostelium discoideum cAMP receptors before the split of Opisthokonts. Later, the Secretin family evolved from the Adhesion GPCR receptor family before the split of nematodes.|$|E
25|$|Archaeans, bacteria, and eukaryotes {{continued}} to diversify {{and to become}} more complex and better adapted to their environments. Each domain repeatedly split into multiple lineages, although {{little is known about}} the history of the archaea and bacteria. Around 1.1 Ga, the supercontinent Rodinia was assembling. The plant, animal, and fungi lines had split, though they still existed as solitary cells. Some of these lived in colonies, and gradually a division of labor began to take place; for instance, cells on the periphery might have started to assume different roles from those in the interior. Although the division between a colony with specialized cells and a multicellular organism is not always clear, around 1billion years ago, the first multicellular plants emerged, probably green algae. Possibly by around 900 Ma true <b>multicellularity</b> had also evolved in animals.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{majority}} of Earth’s history life has been unicellular. However, unicellular organisms had the ingredients in them for <b>multicellularity</b> to arise. Despite having the ingredients for <b>multicellularity,</b> organisms were restricted {{due to the lack}} of hospitable environmental conditions. The rise of oxygen (The Great Oxygenation Event) led organisms to be able to develop more complex body plans. [...] In order for <b>multicellularity</b> to have occurred, organisms must have been capable of cellular communication, aggregation, and specialized functions. The transition to <b>multicellularity</b> that began the evolution of animals from protozoa is one of the most poorly understood of history’s life events. Understanding choanoflagellates and their relation to sponges is important when positing theories on the origins of <b>multicellularity</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{looking at}} the genome of the Choanoflagellate, [...] "Monosiga brevicollis", {{scientists}} have inferred that choanoflagellates {{play a key role}} in the development of <b>multicellularity.</b> Nicole King has done work {{looking at the}} genome of Monisiga brevicollis, and has found key protein domains that are shared between metazoans and choanoflagellates. These domains play a role in cell signalling and adhesion processes in metazoans. The finding that choanoflagellates also have these genes is an incredible discovery because it was previously thought that only metazoans had genes responsible for cell-cell communication and aggregation. This suggests that these domains {{play a key role in}} the origins of <b>multicellularity</b> since it ties a unicellular organism (choanoflagellates) to multicellular organisms (metazoans). It shows that the components required for <b>multicellularity</b> were present in the common ancestor between metazoans and choanoflagellates.|$|E
2500|$|The snowball-Earth episodes {{occurred}} before the sudden radiation of multicellular bioforms, {{known as the}} Cambrian explosion. The most recent snowball episode may have triggered the evolution of <b>multicellularity.</b> Another, much earlier and longer snowball episode, the Huronian glaciation, which occurred 2400 to 2100Mya, may have been triggered by the first appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, the [...] "Great Oxygenation Event".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that organisms had the {{potential}} to become multicellular it is likely that it was not actually possible until the late Neoproterozoic. This is because <b>multicellularity</b> requires oxygen, and before the late Neoproterozoic there was very limited oxygen availability. After the melting of the “Snowball Earth” during the mid Neoproterozoic, nutrients that were trapped in the ice flooded the oceans. Surviving bacteria flourished due to the increased nutrient levels. Among these microbes were cyanobacteria and other oxygen producing bacteria, which led to the massive rise in oxygen levels. [...] The increased oxygen availability allowed it to be used by cells in order to manufacture collagen. Collagen is the key component for cell aggregation, It is a rope-like molecule that “ties” cells together. [...] Oxygen is required for collagen synthesis because ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is essential for this process to occur. A key component in the ascorbic acid molecule is oxygen (chemical formula C6H8O6). [...] Therefore, it is evident that the rise in oxygen is a crucial step to the rise of <b>multicellularity</b> since it is essential for the synthesis of collagen.|$|E
2500|$|The earth {{formed around}} 4.6 billion years ago, with {{unicellular}} life emerging somewhat later after {{the cessation of}} the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of intense asteroid impacts possibly caused by migration of the gas giant planets to their current orbits, however <b>multicellularity</b> and bodies are a relatively recent event in Earth’s history. Bodies first started appearing {{towards the end of}} the Precambrian Era, during the Ediacaran period. [...] The fossils of the Ediacaran period were first found in Southern Australia in the Ediacara Hills, hence the name. However these fossils were initially thought to be part of the Cambrian and it wasn’t until the late 1950s when Martin Glaessner identified the fossils as actually being from the Precambrian era. The fossils that were found date to about 600 million years ago and are found in a variety of morphologies.|$|E
2500|$|Neither sponges nor the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens {{appear to}} be {{equipped}} with neuron synapses, however they both possess several factors related to the same synaptic function. [...] Therefore, {{it is likely that}} central features involved in synaptic transmission arose early in metazoan evolution, most likely around the time that much of the life on Earth was transitioning to <b>multicellularity.</b> It was found that the Munc18/syntaxin 1 complex could be an important component for the production of the SNARE protein. The secretion of SNARE protein from synaptic vesicles is believed to be critical for neuronal communication. The Munc18/syntaxin 1 complex found in M. brevicollis is both structurally and functionally similar to the metazoan complex. This suggests that it constitutes an important step in the reaction pathway toward SNARE assembly. It is believed that the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans used this primordial secretion machinery as a precursor to synaptic communication. This mechanism would eventually be used for cell-cell communication in animals ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that for eukaryotes alternative splicing {{was a very important}} step towards higher efficiency, because information can be stored much more economically. Several proteins can be encoded by a single gene, rather than requiring a separate gene for each, and thus allowing a more varied proteome from a genome of limited size. It also provides evolutionary flexibility. A single point mutation may cause a given exon to be occasionally excluded or included from a transcript during splicing, allowing production of a new protein isoform without loss of the original protein. Studies have identified intrinsically disordered regions (see Intrinsically unstructured proteins) as enriched in the non-constitutive exons suggesting that protein isoforms may display functional diversity due to the alteration of functional modules within these regions. Such functional diversity achieved by isoforms is reflected by their expression patterns and can be predicted by machine learning approaches. [...] Comparative studies indicate that alternative splicing preceded <b>multicellularity</b> in evolution, and suggest that this mechanism might have been co-opted to assist in the development of multicellular organisms.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{technological}} singularity is usually {{seen as a}} sudden event, some scholars argue the current speed of change already fits this description. In addition, some argue that we {{are already in the}} midst of a major evolutionary transition that merges technology, biology, and society. Digital technology has infiltrated the fabric of human society to a degree of indisputable and often life-sustaining dependence. A 2016 article in Trends in Ecology & Evolution argues that [...] "humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels... we trust artificial intelligence with our lives through antilock braking in cars and autopilots in planes... With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction". The article argues that from the perspective of the evolution, several previous Major Transitions in Evolution have transformed life through innovations in information storage and replication (RNA, DNA, <b>multicellularity,</b> and culture and language). In the current stage of life's evolution, the carbon-based biosphere has generated a cognitive system (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. The digital information created by humans has reached a similar magnitude to biological information in the biosphere. Since the 1980s, [...] "the quantity of digital information stored has doubled about every 2.5 years, reaching about 5 zettabytes in 2014 (5x10^21 bytes). In biological terms, there are 7.2 billion humans on the planet, each having a genome of 6.2 billion nucleotides. Since one byte can encode four nucleotide pairs, the individual genomes of every human on the planet could be encoded by approximately 1x10^19 bytes. The digital realm stored 500 times more information than this in 2014 (...see Figure)... The total amount of DNA contained in all of the cells on Earth is estimated to be about 5.3x10^37 base pairs, equivalent to 1.325x10^37 bytes of information. If growth in digital storage continues at its current rate of 30–38% compound annual growth per year, it will rival the total information content contained in all of the DNA in all of the cells on Earth in about 110 years. This would represent a doubling of the amount of information stored in the biosphere across a total time period of just 150 years".|$|E

50|$|While the {{evolution}} of cooperative interactions allowed microbial taxa to increase their fitness, it is hypothesized that cooperation provided a proximate cause to other major evolutionary transitions, including {{the evolution}} of <b>multicellularity.</b> This idea, {{often referred to as}} the Colonial Theory, was first proposed by Haeckel in 1874, and claims that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the symbiotic theory, which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. In a few instances, <b>multicellularity</b> occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g., cellular slime molds) whereas for the majority of multicellular types, <b>multicellularity</b> occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division.
