2500|$|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them {{shows that}} {{different}} wizarding governments {{around the world}} may have different levels of relationships with <b>Muggles</b> depending on their social and political climate, and that these relationships may even change over time like other political policies. In the movie, Newt Scamander describes American wizarding law in regard to <b>Muggles</b> as [...] "rather backward", and further explains that American wizards are forbidden from having any contact or relationships with <b>Muggles.</b> This would indicate that at the time, laws {{in other parts of}} the world would have been more liberal in their stance towards wizard-muggle relations.|$|R

5|$|The word <b>Muggle</b> {{has spread}} beyond its Harry Potter origins, {{becoming}} one of few pop culture words to land in the Oxford English Dictionary.

The flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride. Universal also added a completely functioning recreation of the Hogwarts Express connecting Kings Cross Station at Universal Studios Florida to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure. Both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley contain many shops and restaurants from the book series, including Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and The Leaky Cauldron.|$|E

5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated <b>Muggle</b> world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the six {{previous}} {{novels in}} the series, the titular character Harry Potter {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only wizard to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by the evil Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, who had murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, in the belief this would frustrate a prophecy that Harry would become his equal. As an orphan, Harry {{was placed in the}} care of his <b>Muggle</b> (non-magical) relatives Petunia Dursley and Vernon Dursley.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the three}} {{previous}} novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, {{has struggled with}} the difficulties of growing up, and the added challenge of being a famed wizard: when Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, the most powerful Dark wizard in history, killed Harry's parents but mysteriously vanished after unsuccessfully trying to kill Harry, which left a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead. This results in Harry's immediate fame and his being placed {{in the care of}} his abusive <b>muggle,</b> or non-magical, aunt and uncle, Aunt Petunia Dursley and Uncle Vernon Dursley, who have a son named Dudley Dursley.|$|E
5|$|Rik Mayall {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Peeves, a {{poltergeist}} who likes to prank students in the novel.

5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the <b>Muggle</b> world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} Rowling created {{is intimately}} connected to reality. The British magical {{community of the}} Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, European folklore, classical mythology and alchemy, incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands, magic plants, potions, spells, flying broomsticks, centaurs, and other magical creatures, the Deathly Hallows, and the Philosopher's Stone, beside others invented by Rowling. While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings Middle-earth a mythic past, the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within {{the real world and}} contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life, with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in southeast England. The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the <b>Muggle</b> population.|$|E
5|$|Despite Harry's {{aunt and}} uncle's desperate {{prevention}} of Harry gleaning about his powers, their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, Rubeus Hagrid, {{who is also}} his first contact with the Wizarding World. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts {{as well as some}} of Harry's history. Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who subsequently attempted to kill him as well. Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the Wizarding World. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant <b>Muggle</b> relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and torturing him like he is their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, American author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer alleged {{copyright}} and {{trademark infringement}} by Rowling of her 1984 works The Legend of Rah and the <b>Muggles</b> (...) and Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly. The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested {{in her own}} purported invention of the word [...] "Muggles", {{the name of a}} race of mutant humanoids in The Legend of Rah and the <b>Muggles,</b> and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair, though he is not a character in The Legend of Rah and the <b>Muggles.</b> Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors. Portions of Rah were originally published in booklet form by Ande Publishing Company in 1986, a company founded by Stouffer together with a group of friends and family. Ande Publishing filed for bankruptcy in September 1987 without selling any of its booklets in the United States or elsewhere. Rowling has stated that she first visited the United States in 1998.|$|R

50|$|Harry {{survived and}} was rescued by Hagrid. Sirius asked Hagrid to give Harry to him, {{since he was}} Harry's godfather, but Hagrid, under Dumbledore's orders, refused and instead took Harry {{to live with the}} Dursleys. Sirius gave Hagrid his flying motorbike, saying he wouldn't need it. In his rage, Sirius tracked Pettigrew down and {{challenged}} him. During the confrontation Pettigrew faked his own death and killed twelve <b>Muggles,</b> framing Sirius for betraying the Potters and the murder of Pettigrew and the <b>Muggles.</b> Sirius was arrested and sent to Azkaban without trial by Barty Crouch Sr. Unlike most of the other Azkaban prisoners, Sirius was able to keep his sanity because he knew he was innocent; and because as an Animagus he was less vulnerable to the effects of the Dementors when in his dog form.|$|R
25|$|Wizards and witches who are Muggle-born, or are half-bloods (of mixed <b>muggle</b> and magical parentage) find {{it easier}} (or even commonplace) to {{integrate}} into <b>Muggle</b> society and take on <b>Muggle</b> trends as they are predisposed to <b>Muggle</b> ways growing up. Gryffindor student Dean Thomas has frequent references to the adorning of {{his part of the}} dormitory with posters of West Ham United Football Club. Albus Dumbledore has expressed interest in <b>Muggle</b> knitting patterns and ten pin bowling.|$|E
25|$|Many {{aspects of}} the British Wizarding World have <b>Muggle</b> equivalents. For example, after {{reaching}} age of 17 wizards can be licensed to apparate, while Muggles can learn and be licensed to drive cars. In the fifth and seventh years of Hogwarts or <b>Muggle</b> secondary school, external examinations take place. Some aspects of <b>Muggle</b> pop culture are also mirrored in the Wizarding World such as rock music, posters, and tabloids. A few young wizards embrace <b>Muggle</b> culture whole-heartedly: as a teenager Sirius Black's room was filled with pictures of <b>Muggle</b> pinup girls, motorcycles and rock bands in rebellion against his prejudiced Muggle-hating parents. <b>Muggle</b> music is heard in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - music by The Ordinary Boys is heard playing {{in the background of}} the Gryffindor common room.|$|E
25|$|A {{great deal}} of effort is {{expended}} in keeping the Muggles unaware of magic. Originally the two worlds co-existed, however, persecution of those with magic meant Magical Laws {{have been put in}} place over the centuries, designed to keep the existence of the Magical World hidden from Muggles, the first and most important being the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692. Enchantment of <b>Muggle</b> artifacts is forbidden; under-age wizards are restricted from using magic outside school and any deliberate revelation of magical ability to the <b>Muggle</b> community is punishable, although allowances are made for the use of magic {{in the presence of a}} <b>Muggle</b> in case of life-threatening situation (for the wizard or the <b>muggle).</b> These laws are enforced by the Ministry of Magic, while a special arm of it, the Obliviators, has the job of making certain that Muggles who have seen magic in action will be left with no inconvenient memories. Exceptions to the secrecy include wizards' <b>Muggle</b> relatives and the high political leaders, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for instance.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to restricted {{access to the}} Harry Potter books children began a letter-writing campaign, forming clubs and organising petitions, which ultimately merged into an internet site called <b>Muggles</b> for Harry Potter. The site evolved into kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle censorship in general, and to fight for Harry Potter specifically.|$|R
25|$|Pumpkin {{juice is}} a cold drink favoured by the Wizarding world, and among the {{students}} at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
