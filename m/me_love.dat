500|$|In his lyrics, Harrison expresses {{his vision}} for life in the {{physical}} world. Following the opening instrumental passage, the song begins with a chorus in which he first pleads for a life devoid of the karmic burden of rebirth, or reincarnation: [...] "Give <b>me</b> <b>love,</b> give <b>me</b> <b>love,</b> give me peace on earth / Give me light, give me life, keep me free from birth." [...] These lyrics bear a simple, universal message, one that, {{in the context of}} the time, related as much to the communal [...] "peace and love" [...] idealism of the 1960s as it did Harrison's personal spiritual quest.|$|E

500|$|During [...] "Without Love", Link sings to a {{photograph}} of Tracy, which comes to life and sings harmony with him.

500|$|Writing in Still the Greatest: The Essential Solo Beatles Songs, Andrew Grant Jackson {{considers}} that with [...] "Give Me Love", Harrison [...] "captured {{the essence of}} what he had set out to do with the [...] concerts – and what the Beatles had tried to do in their more idealistic moments". Describing it as Harrison's [...] "finest plea to God", with a vocal that [...] "perfectly suits the yearning" [...] implicit in the lyrics, Jackson adds: [...] "'Give <b>Me</b> <b>Love</b> (Give Me Peace on Earth)' stands alongside 'All You Need Is Love,' 'Let It Be,' and 'Imagine' as the purest expression of the Aquarian Age dream." [...] In his Harrison obituary for The Guardian in December 2001, former Melody Maker critic Chris Welch concluded with a reference to the track, saying that the ex-Beatle's [...] "feelings and needs were best expressed in one of his simplest songs – 'Give <b>Me</b> <b>Love</b> (Give Me Peace On Earth)'".|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{performed}} [...] "Give <b>Me</b> <b>Love</b> (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] throughout {{both his}} 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton, and during his 1992 benefit {{show for the}} Natural Law Party.

500|$|... "Give <b>Me</b> <b>Love</b> (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] {{continues}} the precedent that Harrison set on [...] "My Sweet Lord", through its fusion of the Hindu bhajan (or devotional song) with Western gospel tradition.
