50|$|Many {{of these}} troops were Estonians, few genuine volunteers, but many were {{forcibly}} conscripted {{into the ranks}} of the advancing Red Army, as was usual as the Soviets recaptured (or, in this case, re-invaded) territories. While boosting the units' combat strength on paper, this influx of untrained and often unwilling civilians into military units often left something to be desired considering their combat capabilities. Also a Finnish detachment Arho took part in the operations especially on 4 and 5 October providing logistic support to the Soviet infantry units. The allied controlling committee for Moscow intermediate peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland had asked for 100 galeases and 100 motorboats with their Finnish crews, but Finland bargained the number of vessels to half of what was asked, 50 galeases and 50 motorboats. There were a captain, a chief <b>motor</b> <b>operator</b> and two other crew members on every galeas and two crew members on every motorboat.|$|E

Obesity will {{increase}} the risk of developing serious medical conditions that may cause harm to human health and wellbeing. One condition that can be associated with obesity is known as Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Various symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea will impair a commercial <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>operator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ability to safely maneuver a vehicle. Many commercial motor vehicle collisions have been caused by operator fatigue and have resulted in serious injury and death. Due to unhealthy lifestyles, commercial <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>operators</b> are at a high risk of being obese. Obesity {{will increase}} the risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. Both obesity and obstructive sleep apnea have an impact on commercial operator performance. Recognizing these relationships and understanding this information can be used to prevent the effects of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea on commercial <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>operator</b> performance. 	Literature, statistical analysis, surveys, and interviews confirm the prevalence of obesity in commercial <b>motor</b> vehicle <b>operators.</b> Literature, statistical analysis, surveys, and interviews verify a relationship between obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.

40|$|Safety is of {{paramount}} concern in todays high technology environment. Because of technological advances, {{there are numerous}} situations (high consequence operations) for which the implications of a safety failure are so severe that extreme attention to safety systems is essential. Some of those situations are: nuclear weapon detonation safety, nuclear reactor safety, dam safety, mass transit transportation safety, and hazardous materials transportation and handling safety. In each case, specific safety systems, human control, and administrative procedures {{have been designed to}} give a high level of assurance against disasters. In an overview sense, safety concepts can be divided into two broad approaches: active safety and passive safety. Active safety systems, in general, are based on the need for ``functioning`` elements (operating <b>motors,</b> <b>operator</b> action, etc.) and safety may be based in a large measure on ``reliability`` data (historical records of the operability success of components). Passive safety basically depends on non-functionality...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a waste {{framework}} for motor carrier operations by adapting the classical 7 waste framework, and furthermore, to validate it by collecting empirical data from several <b>motor</b> carrier <b>operators.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The chosen approach includes three steps, starting with analyzing qualitative data from a literature review and an interview study. The interviewees were experts from carrier operations, the lean field, carrier technology providers and carrier service buyers. The findings were validated with qualitative and quantitative studies at five <b>motor</b> carrier <b>operators.</b> Findings – The finding of this paper is a waste framework adapted to motor carrier operations that has been based on the classical 7 waste framework. This provides a structured framework of inefficiencies found in motor carrier operations. Originality/value – Previous literature is scarce on both holistic approaches to describing waste in carrier operations and in-depth studies of day-to-day transport operations. It is also a novel approach to use a waste framework for transport operations...|$|R
