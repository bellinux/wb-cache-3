25|$|The hotel had 29 {{rooms and}} suites built on palafittes {{that were on}} the edge of an estuary. The rooms were named after Mexican lotería card riddles; each room was {{different}} and was themed and decorated inside according to its card name. To reach their rooms, guests had to use rowboats on a waterway, and raised a flagpole for means of communication. <b>Morning</b> <b>coffee</b> was given to guests after they pulled a rope from their room that erected a red flag. The absence of mobile phones and telephones was intended to bring an isolation experience. In addition, Hotelito Desconocido did not use electricity and was excluded from human settlements nearby. During the night, the hosts burnt candles, torches, and luminaries to light the hotel and pathways. The illumination of the moonlight was also an intended part of the night experience. Throughout the afternoon, guests were encouraged to horseback riding along the beach, biking through the palm trails, kayaking, playing volleyball, or billiards. There were also bird-watching and baby turtle release activities since the area had over 150 bird species and 3 different turtle species.|$|E

500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his <b>morning</b> <b>coffee</b> with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E

In spite of this, Loeb had accumulated such a huge point lead before Turkey that Marcus Grönholm's failure to finish third or better in Australia handed Loeb the 2006 championship crown by one point. He received the news at home via an Internet video link to the rally HQ. Due to the time difference, he made do with early <b>morning</b> <b>coffee</b> instead of the customary champagne, calling the whole experience [...] "strange".|$|E

2500|$|Coffee bars were {{attractive}} to British youths because, {{in contrast to}} typical pubs, which closed at about 11pm, they were open until {{the early hours of}} the <b>morning.</b> <b>Coffee</b> bars had jukeboxes, which in some cases reserved space in the machines for the customers' own records. In the late 1950s, coffee bars were associated with jazz and blues, but in the early 1960s, they began playing more R music. Frith notes that although coffee bars were originally aimed at middle-class art school students, they began to facilitate an intermixing of youths from different backgrounds and classes. At these venues, which Frith calls the [...] "first sign of the youth movement", young people would meet collectors of R and blues records, who introduced them to new types of African-American music, which the teens were attracted to for its rawness and authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|Since Gordon Ramsay {{employed}} {{his former}} protégé Marcus Wareing {{in the less}} formal Savoy Grill, the restaurant earned its first Michelin star. The Grill was originally [...] "where people go to eat a modest luncheon or to dine {{on the way to}} the theatre without spending too much time or too much money." [...] Since 2010, the chef patron has been Stuart Gillies. From 2015 to 2017, Kim Woodward, a former contestant on the TV show , became the Grill's first female Head Chef. The Thames Foyer serves breakfast, <b>morning</b> <b>coffee,</b> light lunch and supper, as well as afternoon tea, accompanied by the hotel's resident pianist. Also part of the hotel buildings is Simpson's-in-the-Strand, featuring classic British style cuisine. Its specialties are aged Scottish beef on the bone, potted shrimps, roast saddle of lamb and steak and kidney pie.|$|E
2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual <b>morning</b> <b>coffee,</b> soon {{settling}} down to work on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door and peered in. Catherine was sprawled on the floor. Her face appeared purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Office of Security used LSD in interrogations but Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who {{directed}} MKUltra, had other ideas; {{he thought it}} could be used in covert operations. Since its effects were temporary, he believed it could be given to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in [...] "normal" [...] settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point was reached where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Adverse reactions often occurred, for example an operative who had received the drug in his <b>morning</b> <b>coffee</b> became psychotic and ran across Washington, seeing a monster in every car that passed him. [...] The experiments continued even after Dr. Frank Olson, an Army scientist who had not taken LSD before, went into deep depression after a surprise trip and later fell from a thirteenth story window.|$|E
2500|$|Falasca {{noted the}} 2009 {{testimony}} of Sister Margherita Marin (b. 1941), {{who was one}} of the two nuns that found the pope dead in his bedroom on the morning of 29 September. John Paul I had made it a practice to have a <b>morning</b> <b>coffee</b> in the sacristy and then go into the chapel to pray before tending to the day's matters. Sister Vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15am (after about ten minutes) and went looking for him but found him dead, and hastily summoned Marin who also went into the room. Marin testified that Luciani's hands were cold, and she was struck by the darkness of his nails. Sister Vincenza said: [...] "He hasn't come out yet? Why not? and knocked a few more times but heard silence, then opening the door and walking in. Marin remained in the hallway but heard the elder sister say: [...] "Your Holiness, you shouldn't pull these jokes on me" [...] because Sister Vincenza also had heart problems. Marin further testified that original information provided by the Vatican regarding who discovered the pope was wrong, since it had originally been claimed the pope's secretaries Lorenzi and Magee did. Marin testified that [...] "he was in bed with a slight smile" [...] on his face. The reading light over the headboard was still on, with his two pillows under his back propping him up, with his legs outstretched and his arms on top of the bedsheets. Luciani was still in his pajamas with a few typewritten sheets in his hands. His hear was slightly turned to the right and his eyes were partially closed; his glasses rested on his nose.|$|E
