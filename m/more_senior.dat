5|$|When White {{retired as}} Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely {{expected}} to succeed him, {{as he had}} {{as chief of staff}} of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> officers, particularly Major General Victor Sellheim, at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the new post of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Balmer was {{promoted}} to temporary group captain on 4May 1944. On 10/11May, his Lancasters {{took part in a}} raid on Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No.467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No.463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.|$|E

He {{was also the first}} engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> air vice marshal through the personal influence of the Defence Secretary, Sir Arthur Tange. The CAS was nevertheless required {{to be a member of}} the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} {{security}} imposed on the planning for the raid was so high that when Major Frost was first briefed by a liaison officer from the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division, he was informed that his company was {{to take part in}} an airborne warfare demonstration for the War Cabinet. He was also informed that C Company would be divided into four sections for the exercise, which was contrary to a plan Frost had devised for the exercise and confused him. It was only after Frost raised several objections with a <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> officer at headquarters that he was informed of the intended raid, after which the Major dropped his objections and turned his attention to training the company.|$|E

In 1747, he was named to the Fairfax County Court. Mason was elected as a vestryman for Truro Parish, serving 1749–1785. He took a position among the officers of the county militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> members of the court and he was not then successful, but he would win in 1758.|$|E

5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and misappropriation of public funds to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but also {{had to deal with}} USAF headquarters and the Strategic Air Command. He was also designated the point of contact for dealing with the British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold his own in dealings with <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> British officers, and with senior British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his Strategic Air Command colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by his order that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Barely a {{month later}} on 18 August 1851, Juan Manuel de Rosas, {{dictator}} of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil, beginning the Platine War. Marques de Sousa had been warned by Caxias as early as 27 July 1844 {{of the possibility of}} an armed conflict between Brazil and its Platine neighbor. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay and dissident Argentine provinces. Caxias, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of Brazilian land forces, placed Marques de Sousa {{at the head of the}} 2nd Brigade, part of the 2nd Division. The Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. On 17 November, while the army was camped in the village of Santa Lucía near the Uruguayan capital, Marques de Sousa was promoted to a higher command, the 1st division. The choice was controversial, as there were two <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> and experienced officers next in line who were bypassed owing to their foreign birth.|$|E

5|$|French {{casualties}} in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiantes destruction, but based on Acklom's report from the boarding party they {{were believed to be}} heavy. British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing much of the blame for the French defeat on the <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> Pevrieux. The restriction of French movement along their own coastline had serious effects {{for the development of the}} French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain.|$|E
5|$|He was demoted to {{the reserve}} side soon {{thereafter}} by manager Míchel, who had replaced Bielsa {{early in the}} season, and made only one <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> appearance for the campaign. Much of his absence {{in the second half}} of the season also came as a result of him suffering from glue ear, a condition which traps liquid behind the eardrum and affects hearing. Míchel confirmed that Sparagna had been suffering from the condition since the start of the season and had unsuccessfully undergone treatment in late 2015. In April he began a new cortisone treatment but was unable to return to the pitch for fear that he would fall short of doping regulations as a result of the medication. Míchel later revealed that his reluctance to play Sparagna, despite the risks involved had he done so, ultimately contributed towards him being sacked by Vincent Labrune and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who at the time were the president and owner of the club respectively. Sparagna ultimately made 15 appearances across all competitions as Marseille ended the season in 13th position in Ligue 1 and as runners-up in the Coupe de France.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler had barely looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E

5|$|In spring 593, Priscus was re-appointed {{in command}} as {{commander}} of the cavalry in Thrace, with Gentzon leading the infantry. Priscus, as the <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> of the two, also held overall command. Both generals marched to Dorostolon on the Danube, and campaigned with success against the Slavic tribes preparing to cross the river under their leaders Ardagastus and Musocius. Crossing the river, both Slavic hosts were annihilated in surprise night attacks. At the same time, however, Priscus reportedly quarrelled with his men over {{the distribution of the}} booty captured, and especially the considerable portion Priscus allocated to the imperial family. The soldiers were eventually placated, and the booty sent back to the capital with an escort. Maurice also sent orders for the army to winter north of the river, but this caused great resentment and unrest amongst the soldiers. Priscus chose to disobey the emperor's order and crossed again with his army to winter in the southern bank. In the autumn of 593, he was replaced by Maurice with his own brother Peter. Before the latter could assume command, however, Priscus arranged for a truce with the khagan, to whom he returned all Avar captives, some 5,000 in number, a fact for which he was criticized by Maurice.|$|E
5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by <b>more</b> <b>senior</b> players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.|$|E
