40|$|W serii gł. Nr 1158 Instrumental {{method of}} pilling {{assessment}} {{is based on}} computer processing {{and analysis of the}} images of textile fabric samples. The principle of method consists in taking an image of fabric sample under defined conditions of machine vision scene, performing an image processing operation using RGB channel’s mix algorithm, making an image segmentation and calculating the value of the degree of surface filling by pilling. The degree of surface filling by pilling is the ratio of surface area occupied by the pilling to the total surface area of the sample. This paper presents the construction of a <b>measuring</b> <b>stand</b> and the procedure for pilling measurement using instrumental method. Then the qualitative model of the method was defined and potential factors, which may influence the measurement results, were identified and examined. These factors include adjusting parameters of <b>measuring</b> <b>stand</b> and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the metrological characteristics analysis of instrumental method was conducted as regards discrimination threshold and sensitivity. The analysis of adequacy of both instrumental and standard, organoleptic method shows that the test results obtained with both methods are closely correlated.

For each treatment (burned 2 x+ and burned 2 x+ preWFU), 18 cores were randomly selected from a subset of 128 ponderosa pine trees > 50 cm in diameter. Radial increment growth of each tree was measured to the nearest 0.01 mm on a <b>measuring</b> <b>stand</b> using the Measure J 2 X software program (Robinson and Evans 2004).

40|$|In many recent studies, {{the value}} of forest {{inventory}} information in the harvest scheduling has been examined. Usually only the profitability of measuring simultaneously all the stands in the area is examined. Yet, {{it may be more}} profitable to concentrate the measurement efforts to some subset of them.

It turned out to be profitable to postpone the measurements until just before the potential harvests. Introducing a strict end-inventory constraint increased the number of stands that could be profitably measured. In this case, also the length of the planning horizon had a clear effect on what stands were profitable to measure. With a 15 -year planning horizon, <b>measuring</b> the oldest <b>stands</b> was profitable while with longer planning horizons it was not.
