40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in housing demand since 1994 {{represents}} a mammoth task for both {{the present and future}} housing policy in South Africa. The new Developmental Local Government in an effort to address this challenge has placed high premium to informal settlement formalization and <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>development.</b> The rationale behind these two approaches is to address urban poverty, segregation and redevelopment. The goal {{of this paper is to}} appraise <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> as it relates to sustainable land use with the objective towards integration along racial and social grounds. The problem associated with South African housing policy in creating separate residential development based on income group has reached a crisis point in addressing housing challenge facing the country. The poor remain located on the peripheries of the cities where the land is cheap and far from their places of work and have to travel long hours to and from work. The City of Johannesburg is characterized by fragmented <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> that lack harmonious integration and this impact on infrastructural provision and access to job opportunities.

50|$|<b>Mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> {{is one of}} {{two primary}} {{mechanisms}} to eliminate neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, combat residential segregation, and avoid the building of public housing that offers 100% of its housing units to those living in poverty. <b>Mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> is a project-based subsidy, that is the subsidy is tied to the housing unit, not the tenant, while tenant-based assistance, such as Section 8 (housing) {{comes in the form of}} vouchers, which provide a housing subsidy that individuals can use on the open market and move to neighborhoods where landlords will take the voucher subsidy as rent payment.

40|$|Posted by Prof Henry G.

Personally, I find such stories unpleasant, but not at all surprising. If you share that sentiment surpress, for a moment, your outrage and ask yourself the following question - if the uncomfortable truth is that wealthy people don't want to mix with their poor neighbours (and can't be forced to do so) then what, exactly does this policy achieve...|$|R
5000|$|Ellickson {{contends that}} <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> {{projects}} are economically inefficient: “Housing economists have consistently found that, all else equal, the <b>development</b> of <b>housing</b> units in subsidized projects, whether publicly or privately sponsored, costs {{significantly more than}} the development of unsubsidized units.” [...] Likewise, Schwartz suggests that {{further research is needed}} to understand if it is cheaper to build and subsidize <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> than other forms of subsidy. <b>Mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> can also cost more in terms of time and effort from developers and local governments. Because funding comes from diverse sources, developer-permitting applications are more complex. Further, new affordable <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> can raise concerns among existing residents, which at times can also slow progress. Ellen & Turner also echo concerns about scale in their review of “neighborhood effects” research, commenting that researchers “may not measure relevant neighborhood conditions accurately if they are unable to define the relevant neighborhood boundaries.” Thus, measuring the success of a singular mixed income project may not be the right scale, and understanding the impacts of the development on the neighborhood poses its own methodological challenges.|$|R
50|$|Further, many <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> {{projects}} {{that are part of}} public housing revitalization efforts do not offer a one-to-one replacement rate on the units, causing some public housing residents to be displaced. In this way, <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> serves not as poverty alleviation, but rather as way to move poverty around. Most often, those displaced include the hardest-to-house, that require the most intensive services due to substance abuse, mental health issues, criminal backgrounds, physical disability, or complicated family and childcare structures. In this way, <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> may just be moving problems around a metropolitan area and not actually lifting people out of poverty or offering them more opportunity. As Fraser & Nelson ask, “Are we satisfied with moving poverty around cities and metropolitan areas, or can we develop innovative and geographically informed community-based approaches for the integration of housing needs with other domain areas that affect our quality of life?” Further, many <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> have strict regulations and background checks for new residents, making some of the hardest-to-house without options to move back into the community.|$|R

A [...] "New Seoul Town Development" [...] project was announced when Goh Kun became {{the mayor of}} Seoul in July 1998. In August of the same year, the general planning for New Seoul Town project began to take form. Based on this, a master plan was established for the Millennium City (Sangam New Millennium Town). Along with drawing up a city plan to turn the Sangam region into a secondary center of Seoul, a subsequent plan was drafted to build a gateway town that embodies both information and ecology. The plan has since been carried out in concrete, and encompasses separate projects such as the World Cup Park, an environmentally friendly housing complex and the Digital Media City.|$|R

5000|$|The {{definition}} of <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> is broad and encompasses {{many types of}} dwellings and neighborhoods. Generally speaking, a <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> includes diverse types of housing units, such as apartments, town homes, and/or single-family homes for a people {{with a range of}} income levels. <b>Mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> may include housing that is priced based on the dominant housing market (market-rate units) with only a few units priced for lower-income residents, or it may not include any market-rate units and be built exclusively for low- and moderate-income residents.|$|R
5000|$|First, by {{measure of}} {{creating}} and/or maintaining an affordable housing {{stock in the}} United States, <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> {{can be considered a}} success. <b>Mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> are a more politically palatable option to housing lower income members of society, particularly in communities with deep resistance to building affordable housing or having public housing relocated through a scattered sites policy. Therefore, <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> as a policy strategy has taken hold in the United States not because it is expected to alleviate poverty, but rather because of many ancillary benefits that accrue to the neighborhood, city, and all residents.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} major {{commercial}} development, {{the value of}} the few remaining parcels along Spring Creek have begun to skyrocket. City officials admit that the city is now officially landlocked since it is also surrounded on all sides by other suburbs. This means that the remaining ecologically sensitive area located on private lands is in danger of developmental destruction. The only way for the remaining natural limestone outcroppings, dramatic elevations and large colonies of Trout Lilies to be preserved, is for a philanthropist to come forward and purchase land for preservation. While it was hoped by many citizens for many years that the county would purchase the land, or in the least that the city Planning and Zoning Commission would only approve environmentally related businesses, it is now apparent {{that this is not the}} case. The City Council has directed the commission to approve any and all development projects under the same regulations required for all commercial businesses in the neighboring hotel, restaurant, and <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{promotion}} of safe and adequate housing has persisted {{since the late}} 1800s in the United States, when early interventions focused on tenement reforms. These efforts were primarily the purview of local governments, however, {{and the federal government}} did not enter into housing questions until 1937 when Congress passed the Wagner-Steagall Housing Act, which launched the federal public housing program that still exists today. Historically, public housing authorities sought to achieve the goals that efforts of <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> seek today, including the mixing of diverse residents, improved neighborhood services, and creating a ladder out of public housing.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to questions about}} the empirical evidence for social benefits of lifting people out of poverty, some criticize <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments</b> as too costly and not the most economically efficient way to de-concentrate poverty. Some argue that tenant-based housing vouchers offer greater possibility for social integration and cost less than project-based <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> endeavors. According to Ellickson, “most housing economists…assert that, as a general matter, portable tenant-based subsidies are markedly more efficient and fairer than project-based subsidies.” Further, Ellickson argues that the goals of economic integration are better suited to a neighborhood, rather than project level scale, which would suggest that tenant-based subsidies would provide more opportunities for moving people out of neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and for building social contacts beyond their immediate circles.|$|R

40|$|South Africa is a water-scarce country (Otieno and Ochieng, 2004; Wassung, 2010). The current {{sanitation}} system mostly used in South African {{urban areas}} depends on {{extensive use of}} water in a form of flush toilets. The housing sector in major cities is continuously growing and this is putting a strain on water services. The government has explored a range of sanitation technologies including waterborne, the Ventilated Improved (VIP) toilet and ecological sanitation (widely known as ecosan) in a form of a urine diversion dry (UDD) toilet. The latter provides a reasonable solution to the current sanitation challenge. This study explores {{the perceptions of the}} users of the UDD toilets installed in the medium density <b>mixed</b> <b>housing</b> <b>development</b> of Hull Street in Kimberley. Understanding the users’ socio-cultural perceptions of the UDD toilet will contribute to future policy making, as the information can be used to improve the future roll-out of the technology {{in order to make it}} more acceptable. The study was qualitative in nature and used a phenomenological research design. The sample size comprised 16 participants, 13 of whom were residents of the Hull Street housing project and three were employees of the Sol Plaatje Housing Company (SPHC). The sample was selected by a purposive sampling method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data for the study. The data was analysed by means of content analysis, which enabled the researcher to identify important themes for the study. The findings of the study revealed dissatisfaction regarding the use of the UDD toilet, which emanates from poor design of the toilet facility. The research was successful in identifying, inter alia, odour, uncomfortable sitting position on the toilet mainly by female users and high cost of operating and maintaining the sanitation system. Recommendations emphasise the importance of involving users in future UDD sanitation projects and educating the public at large about sustainability aspects of this sanitation technology (UDD). One of the key lessons drawn from the study is that challenges experienced by the users should be used to improve future UDD toilets...|$|R

5000|$|In both {{planning}} and ongoing management, broad community empowerment and participation is key, across all income levels of residents. Fraser & Nelson recommend community empowerment to accompany <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing</b> <b>developments,</b> {{in large part}} to help foster neighborhood relations, identify key assets and needs of the community, and ultimately to maximize the “neighborhood effects” of the new development. Vale also suggests that empowering lower income residents to meaningfully engage in the management of their developments can help foster positive outcomes for individuals and the neighborhood as a whole through formal and informal social controls. Community engagement can be fostered or inhibited by certain design elements; creating central, shared community spaces with interesting programming may be one way to provide opportunities for mingling and socialization among diverse residents. Duke suggests that participation is about more than just developing positive outcomes for integrated communities; participation and the ability to effect change in a place is fundamental to The Right to the City that needs to be protected. Physical integration is not enough to ensure that lower income residents have as much control over management, maintenance, and subsequent transformation - other programmatic or governance structures may be needed as well: “If any true transformation and integration is to occur in <b>mixed</b> income <b>housing,</b> marginalized groups would have {{to be involved in the}} process of relocation and have infrastructure in place for participation." ...|$|R
