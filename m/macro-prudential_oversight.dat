50|$|The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) was {{established}} on 16 December 2010 {{in response to}} the ongoing financial crisis. It is tasked with the <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight</b> of the financial system within the European Union in order to contribute to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks to financial stability in the EU. It shall contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market and thereby ensure a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth.|$|E
5000|$|These impediments {{not only}} affect {{macro-financial}} stability but {{also reduce the}} growth dividends from deepening. At the same time, unsustainable expansion of financial systems can pose risks for stability. Weak and limited supervisory and regulatory frameworks and capacity, deficient early warning and resolution systems, and governance problems in LICs increase the risks of such fragility.The considerable heterogeneity among LICs, however, {{suggests that there is}} no [...] "one-size-fits-all" [...] solution. Different areas and approaches may be needed to promote financial deepening generally.Policies Matter Cross-country experiences in emerging market and low-income countries suggest that targeted and balanced initiatives to encourage competition, put in place information and market infrastructure, address collateral issues, limit excessively intrusive public sector interventions and dominance, maintain macroeconomic stability, and exercise appropriate <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight</b> to avoid creating new sources of instability can help overcome specific impediments to increasing the depth, breadth, and inclusion of financial systems.*** ...|$|E

In this context, the article discusses issues of micro- and <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight</b> and argues that more needs to be done to ensure accountability, independence, transparency and integrity of the various actors of the financial system safety net...|$|E
40|$|The main {{challenges}} currently {{faced by}} most central banks are {{generated by the}} effects of the economic and financial crisis. Thus, at the national, European and international level there is a trend of changing the economic governance structures and improving the regulatory and supervisory policies, focusing on <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight.</b> In the context of changes at the European Union level, the central banks of the Member States become also subject to changes in their carried out actions. The objectives of this research aim mainly at: highlighting the role of the National Bank of Romania in regulating and supervising the banking system in Romania and analyzing the measures implemented by the National Bank of Romania after the crisis so far; identifying the challenges of the National Bank of Romania on the basis of changes operated by European Union at the supervisory framework level...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-loose {{monetary}} policies, such as {{very low}} or even negative interest rates, large-scale asset purchases, long-maturity lending to banks and forward guidance in central bank communication, aim to increase inflation and output, {{to the benefit}} of financial stability. But at the same time, these measures pose various risks and might create challenges for financial institutions. • By assessing the theoretical literature and developments in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan, where very expansionary monetary policies were adopted during the past six years, and by examining the euro-area situation, we conclude that the risks to financial stability of ultra-loose monetary policy in the euro area could be low. However, vigilance is needed. • While monetary policy should focus on its primary mandate of area-wide price stability, other policies should be deployed whenever the financial cycle deviates from the economic cycle or when heterogeneous financial developments in the euro area require financial tightening in some but not all countries. These policies include micro-prudential supervision, <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight,</b> fiscal policy and regulation of sectors that pose risks to financial stability, such as construction...|$|E
40|$|The term “macroprudential” {{is usually}} used in {{different}} ways. Sometimes {{it refers to}} macroprudential analysis, others to <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight</b> and it also speaks of macroprudential regulation. In this paper, taking into account these concepts, an analysis of {{what is meant by}} macroprudential authority, how should it be implemented and should have powers to ensure the stability of the entire financial system is going to be done. Referring to the local economy, the Charter Reform of the Central Bank of Argentina has entered into force. In regard to financial regulation, within the reform, and unlike it was in force since 1992, it aims to not only to monitor, but to implement regulations on the local financial system to avoid the frequent abuses by various entities. To perform the analysis of the implementation of a macroprudential authority in Argentina, {{it is going to be}} considered the evolution of a particular sector of the real economy, namely tourism. Finally, a measure of this economic sector, that should to detect potential problems in the financial system, is proposed. ...|$|E

The committee's {{first meeting}} with the Commissioner comes {{in the wake of}} the {{publication}} of the Commission’s Stockholm Action Plan, which takes up many of the ideas which the committee has put forward in the areas of civil law and contract law. In addition, the Commission, in the person of its Secretary General, Catherine Day, will be taking part in a hearing on Monitoring the Application of Community Law- Evaluation of the Pilot Project, for which the rapporteur is Eva Lichtenberger. The committee will be hearing a representative of a Member State participating in the pilot project, Professor Krämer, the former Head of Union of Environmental Governance in the Commission's DG ENVI and Marta Ballesteros of ClientEarth. The committee will also be holding a workshop on one or more optional instruments for European contract law at which the Common Frame of Reference and a possible optional instrument for European insurance contract law will be discussed with invited experts. This ties in with the presentation by Diana Wallis of a working document on the Commission's proposal for a consumer rights directive. The working document is informed by two academic studies commissioned by the committee’s policy department. Owing to the fact that votes could not be held at the committee’s extraordinary meeting last week in Strasbourg, the voting will take place on 28 April. The items to be voted on include a number of opinions for the Economic Affairs Committee on alternative investment fund managers (rapporteur: Evelyn Regner), <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>oversight</b> of the financial system and establishment of a Europea...|$|E
