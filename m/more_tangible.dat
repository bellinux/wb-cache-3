5|$|The {{sheer size}} and {{complexity}} of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> closed systems. For example, he likens human existence on Earth— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} some dispute as to the best {{definition}} of feedback. According to Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of circularity of action, which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> connection.|$|E
25|$|Harlem Duet is {{considered}} to be a precursor to Shakespeare's Othello. The location is set on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X Boulevards. Sears choose this location because she wanted the audience to grasp the concept of race in the country, and the familiar streets were <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> to the North American Audience. The story follows main characters Othello and Billie and there withering marriage as Othello begins to lean towards a white identity mostly because of his affair with a character named Mona, who is a white woman. The story paints a picture of the white dominated North America.|$|E
40|$|The {{second call}} for {{proposals}} for Mizzou Advantage grant funding requests two types of proposals: network grants and seed (formerly "fellow") grants. Network grants foster communication between scholars in diverse areas, helping focus thinking on key topics and helping identify areas in which networks exist but are lacking one or more key elements for success, while seed grants provide initial funding for projects which will result in <b>more</b> specific, <b>tangible</b> outcomes, such as larger project proposals to granting agencies, major conferences which will reposition Mizzou {{in the eyes of}} policymakers, funders and leading scholars, or shape larger state, national or international research priorities. The two may overlap conceptually, but network proposals generally improve communication and dialogue among scholars and stakeholders, while seed proposals provide initial funding to realize a <b>more</b> specific and <b>tangible</b> goal...|$|R

25|$|After World War I, {{the prestigious}} rank of field marshal was {{banned in the}} Weimar Republic, {{alongside}} other restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. After Hitler and the Nazi Party came to national power in January 1933, they began {{an expansion of the}} military; it was part of Hitler's desire to restore the army's power and prestige. In 1936, he revived the rank of field marshal. It was the highest and most prestigious military rank in Germany, originally only {{for the use of the}} Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief of the Army. The traditional attribute distinguishing a German field marshal was an ornately decorated baton. <b>More</b> <b>tangible</b> benefits included a yearly salary of 36,000 Reichsmarks and all earnings being exempt from income tax.|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} the Civil War, African Americans {{primarily}} {{favored the}} Republican Party due to its overwhelming political and <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> efforts in achieving the abolition of slavery, particularly through President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The south had long been a Democratic stronghold, favoring a state's right to legal slavery. In addition, the ranks of the fledgling Ku Klux Klan were composed almost entirely of white Democrats who were angry over the poor treatment they had received at the hands of northerners and who were also bent on reversing the policies of Reconstruction. However, African Americans began drifting to the Democratic Party when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president. Support for the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s by Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson helped give the Democrats even larger support among the African-American community, which consistently vote between 85-95% Democratic.|$|E
500|$|Nieuwendyk was {{regarded}} as a leader throughout his career. [...] He was the captain of the Flames for four seasons, and his teammates in Dallas praised him as a player who would help guide the younger players as they began their careers. His presence was considered an important factor in New Jersey's 2003 Stanley Cup championship. Devils' general manager Lou Lamoriello praised his impact {{both on and off the}} ice: [...] "Certainly (the tangibles were) the quality player he was even at that time, how good he was defensively as well as always finding a way to get big goals. It was also about how good he was on faceoffs. And the intangibles, which are really <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> than anything, are what he brought in the locker room from leadership and unselfishness. It was obvious that when he didn't play he was still so active in his support. He's genuine in every sense of the word. He was a true team player." [...] Nieuwendyk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011, and his uniform number 25 was honoured by the Calgary Flames on March 7, 2014, as he was named to the organization's [...] "Forever a Flame" [...] program.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} adult mortality on the pattern of investment and economic development. In the presence of high mortality risks and imperfect an-nuities market, altruistic parents invest <b>more</b> in <b>tangible</b> assets (physical capital, land) that are readily transferable to future generations compared to intangible human cap-ital. This differential effect of mortality can translate into divergent growth paths for economies, differing willingness to adopt modern skill-intensive technologies {{as well as a}} late transition from physical to human capital accumulation. Parental altruism can substitute for the absence of annuities reasonably well: investment in tangible assets is typically higher under missing annuities...|$|R

Using data from two regional planning studies, perceived landscape values from inside and outside wilderness areas were compared to determine if proportionate value differences exist between wilderness and nonwilderness areas. Multiple regression analysis was used to confirm the results and determine the relative strength of general landscape values as predictors of wilderness value. Results indicate that wilderness areas reflect values associated with indirect, intangible, or deferred human uses of the landscape—life-sustaining, intrinsic, and future values—whereas landscape values outside wilderness areas reflect <b>more</b> direct, <b>tangible,</b> and immediate uses of the landscape—economic, recreation, and subsistence values...|$|R

The results indicate that the work style of modern executives in Madrid does not fall clearly into the category of a polychronic (P-time) culture (Hall, 1959, 1976, 1981 & 1990) on all the three dimensions, if it ever did so.

50|$|Sankei-en (Sankei Garden) is a {{traditional}} Japanese-style garden in Naka Ward, Yokohama, Japan, which opened in 1906. Sankei-en was designed and built by Tomitaro Hara (原富太郎) (1868-1939), known by the pseudonym Sankei Hara, who was a silk trader. Almost all of its buildings are historically significant structures bought by Hara himself in locations all over the country, among them Tokyo, Kyoto, Kamakura, Gifu Prefecture, and Wakayama prefecture.

2500|$|The {{original}} financing plan, {{of using}} the revenues from radio receiver sales to pay station costs, proved to be insufficient {{for a number of}} reasons. Additional expenses included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something <b>more</b> <b>tangible</b> than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling vacuum-tube receivers that it expected it had gotten through the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold [...] "amateur and experimental" [...] rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.|$|E
