5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{shows that}} a <b>moral</b> sense <b>or</b> <b>moral</b> sentiments alone cannot {{identify}} appropriate morals. To this end, the essay analyzes three defenses of Francis Hutcheson’s, David Hume’s, and Adam Smith’s moral sense theories against the relativism charge that a <b>moral</b> sense <b>or</b> <b>moral</b> sentiments vary across people, societies, cultures, or times. The first defense is the claim {{that there is a}} universal <b>moral</b> sense <b>or</b> universal <b>moral</b> sentiments. However, even if they exist, a <b>moral</b> sense <b>or</b> <b>moral</b> sentiments alone cannot identify appropriate morals. The second defense is to adopt a general viewpoint theory, which identifies moral principles by taking a general viewpoint. But it needs to employ reason, and even if not, it does not guarantee that we identify appropriate morals. The third defense is to adopt an ideal observer theory, which draws moral principles from sentimental reactions of an ideal observer. Yet it still does not show that a <b>moral</b> sense <b>or</b> <b>moral</b> sentiments alone can identify appropriate morals...|$|R
5|$|The second part, Debt and Sin, {{explores the}} {{theological}} side, including <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> ethical characteristics attributed to debtors and creditors by society and religion. Debt, like certain vices, such as cigarette-smoking, have experienced {{times when it}} was considered sinful, and other times fashionable. Biblical references, like the Book of Deuteronomy, the Lord's Prayer, and sin-eating, are examined. The growth of debt {{is linked to the}} growth of the written media with the relationship symbolized by the Faustian contract with the devil.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E

25|$|In 1874–1876 he {{contributed to}} the Salon in Paris and to the {{exhibitions}} of the Itinerants' Society in Saint Petersburg.

25|$|Many noblemen found {{themselves}} conflicted {{with the idea}} of entering the business realm of the American society, as Enlightenment ideals discouraged business as a <b>moral</b> <b>or</b> noble activity. Nonetheless, the émigrés took up pursuits in Real Estate, finance, and smaller family owned businesses. These were all to be temporary endeavors, however, as the French nobility still aimed to leave the Americas at the most opportune moment.|$|E
25|$|Adultery (anglicised from Latin adulterium) is extramarital {{sex that}} is {{considered}} objectionable on social, religious, <b>moral,</b> <b>or</b> legal grounds. Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, {{as well as the}} social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.|$|E

Expressivists deny constructivist accounts of moral facts - e.g. Kantianism - as well as realist accounts - e.g. ethical intuitionism.|$|R

Aggressive behaviors are associated with adjustment problems and several psychopathological symptoms such as Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder.|$|E
