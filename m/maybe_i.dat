500|$|Nevermind was {{mastered}} on {{the afternoon}} of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E
500|$|Ike's {{accounts}} {{of his relationship}} with Tina, including the incidents of abuse, differed. In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, Ike admitted, [...] "Yeah, I hit her, but I didn't hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.... If she says I abused her, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> did." [...] He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs, Taking Back My Name (1999), writing: [...] "Sure, I've slapped Tina.... There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I have never beat her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> did a little cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|E

500|$|Vulović {{told reporters}} {{that she did not}} think of her fall every day, but {{admitted}} to struggling with survivor's guilt. [...] "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry... Then I think <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should not have survived at all." [...] Vulović declined therapy to help her cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. [...] "If you can survive what I survived," [...] she said, [...] "you can survive anything." ...|$|E

After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took the subway back to her Brooklyn home. When she got off the train and checked her phone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. [...] "I couldn't open Twitter because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, <b>maybe.</b> <b>I</b> didn't know what was going on." [...] Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors, which would reach 673,000 at its peak.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. The club won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th {{official}} trophy. During {{the last week}} of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key in the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision from the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, [...] "If I was in charge, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> would have done things differently," [...] while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, [...] "We must start again from zero." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{transgender}} {{community was}} largely {{disappointed by the}} image of forced gender reassignment surgery and a boycott was created in response. The director Walter Hill responded by stating : [...] "I wouldnt make a movie that hurt transgender people. Some of them have {{had a tough time}} of it, and the last thing I want to do is make anyones road harder. But look, I understand the concern. Is it lurid? Yes. Is it lowbrow? Well, <b>maybe.</b> <b>Is</b> it offensive? No. Im just trying to honor the B movies that we grew up with." ...|$|R

500|$|James Montgomery from MTV News {{reviewed}} the video for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] positively. Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like {{pretty much everything}} 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm to both the song and the video. Perhaps it's the power-tool chorus, or the [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] vocal harmonies. Maybe it's Kesha's sexy ass. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> just like watching {{a whole bunch of}} people lock lips. The whole thing is a lot of fun. It gets in your head. And hey, it's the summer — school's out, and gleefully stupid is in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as [...] "friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d {{want to play}} {{video games}} with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t {{know what to say}} to the media if I’m not talking about a film that I am doing, so yeah, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am perceived as a snob." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z {{responded to}} Braxton's claims: [...] "I wouldn't {{want to take}} it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could get on that record.' The most obvious [...] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an {{original}} idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" [...] He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.|$|E

500|$|Scott Porter, {{playing the}} role of quarterback Jason Street, knew that his {{character}} would be paralyzed from the first episode on, and said that this {{was a big part of}} the reason why he took the role. Porter played high school football as a wide receiver. He also played on a highly successful team in high school, and described himself as huge fan of the Friday Night Lights movie. Meanwhile, Taylor Kitsch, the show's Tim Riggins, said in an interview that he was able to relate to his character based on his own personal experiences: [...] "my father is out of my life, more or less", he revealed in an interview, [...] "So I discover stuff that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even dealing with as a person." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{recognized}} {{primarily as}} a playmaker leading up to his NHL career, Kariya was forced into shooting more as the Mighty Ducks lacked scorers {{in his first two}} seasons with the team. During his third NHL season, he commented that, [...] "If Teemu [...] had been here right off the bat, then <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have focused so much on shooting." [...] Kariya was able to put many shots on goal due to his quick release. In 1998–99, he led the League with 429 shots on goal, which at the time was the second-highest recorded total in NHL history. Nonetheless maintaining his passing ability, Kariya was particularly adept at making plays from deep in the offensive zone and beside the opposing team's net.|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered {{negotiations}} {{to play a}} pair of villains. A few days later, Rockwell confirmed {{he would take the}} role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer. Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Marvel entered into early talks with Emily Blunt to play the Black Widow, though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels. Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson claimed that [...] "There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> won't be Nick Fury." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{confided in}} Branca {{that he wanted}} to be the biggest star in show {{business}} and [...] "the wealthiest". Jackson was upset about what he perceived to be the under-performance of Off the Wall, stating, [...] "It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again." [...] He also felt undervalued by the music industry; in 1980 when Jackson asked the publicist of Rolling Stone if they would be interested in doing a cover story on him, the publicist declined, to which Jackson responded, [...] "I've been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn't sell copies ... Just wait. Someday those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I'll give them one, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> won't." ...|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{perception}} is remarkably different; Satō and Kabosu are rather {{known as a}} pet and owner rather than a meme, and her blog is the fourth-most popular pet-related blog in the country as of December 2013. Reacting to the meme, she explained, [...] "To be honest, some pictures are strange for me, but it's still funny! I’m very impressed with their skills and taste. Around me, nobody knows about the doge meme. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> don't understand memes very well, because I'm living a such an analog life." [...] Satō has also expressed that she had learned that [...] "the risk of the internet is that {{anyone in the world}} can see my life on my blog". Fleming stated that in his experience, the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognised due to the meme.|$|E

Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult than I expected because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ". Devon Bostick was offered to reprise his role as Brent from Saw VI, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E

[...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if I start to play again on hard courts, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> will injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he never thought he would win his first two titles on clay courts.|$|E

Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make.

But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E
