In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E

The Supreme Court of New South Wales agreed with Cowin and determined that Burger King had violated the terms of the contract and awarded Hungry Jack's A$46.9million (US$41.6million in 2001). In its decision, the Court said that Burger King sought to engineer a default of the franchise agreement so that the company could limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, which was a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement. The case introduced the American legal concept of good faith negotiations into the Australian legal system, which until the time of the verdict had been rarely used in the Australian court systems.|$|E

40|$|Die vorliegende Masterarbeit hat die Auswirkungen der Prinzipal-Agent-Theorie, sowie der Transaktionskostentheorie auf die Wahl der Organisationsstruktur von internationalen Franchise-Unternehmen untersucht. Die empirische Untersuchung basiert auf den Daten von internationalen Franchise-Unternehmen, die ihren Hauptsitz in acht Ländern, i. e. in den USA und in Europa, haben. Die binäre logistische Regression wurde als Auswertungsinstrument gewählt. Es wurden die Effekte der Theorien auf die Wahl von direktem im Vergleich zu indirektem Franchising untersucht. Indirektes Franchising (i. e. <b>Master</b> <b>Franchising)</b> impliziert niedrige Kontrolle wobei direktes Franchising (i. e. Tochterunternehmen, Joint-Venture-Franchising, Einheits-Franchising und Mehreinheit-Franchising) hohe Kontrolle impliziert. Die empirischen Ergebnisse belegen nur die Hypothese in Bezug auf die Prinzipal-Agent-Theorie und liefern konträre Schlüsse für die Transaktionskostentheorie. Hohe Überwachungskosten auf Grund von Verhaltensunsicherheit erhöhen die Anwendung von indirektem Franchising. Die Hypothesen in Bezug auf die Transaktionskostentheorie konnten nicht belegt werden, weil die Ergebnisse konträr und zum Teil nicht signifikant waren. In this thesis, it was {{examined}} how Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Theory determine {{the choice of}} governance structure of international franchising firms. The empirical investigation was {{based on data from}} international franchising companies whose respective headquarters are located in eight countries, i. e. in the USA and in Europe. Binary logistic regression was used to obtain the empirical results. The different governance structure modes were summarized under direct franchising as opposed to indirect franchising. Indirect franchising (i. e. <b>master</b> <b>franchising)</b> is characterized by low control levels, whereas direct franchising (i. e. wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint-venture franchising, single-unit and multi-unit franchising) is characterized by higher control levels. The empirical results support only the hypothesis for Agency Theory and bring about contradictory findings for Transaction Cost Theory. In conclusion, high monitoring costs owing to behavioral uncertainty increase the use of indirect franchising. The hypotheses with regard to Transaction Cost Theory could not be supported as the results are contradictory and in part not significant. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{growth in}} {{business format franchising}} as an international business model is widely reported. This paper reviews the status of international franchising by Australian franchisors. A comprehensive study {{of the population of}} Australian franchisors was conducted to examine the motivational incentives and barriers to offshore expansion. In particular, data was gathered on preferred international locations, international franchising strategies and modes of entry, pre-internationalisation activities and factors impeding the overseas expansion. Consistent with previous research, results show that larger and more experienced franchisors seek to grow their organisations through expanding to host countries. <b>Master</b> <b>franchising</b> and joint ventures are preferred modes of entry, and many franchisors locally adapted systems and processes in transferring their business concepts to different cultural and regulatory environments. In opposition to recent research, Australian franchisors placed lesser emphasis on macroeconomic influences upon the decision to internationalise.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} how {{a number of}} market conditions may constrain entry mode choice into Middle East nations. Specifically, this paper focuses on <b>master</b> <b>franchising</b> and analyzes the determining factors in this entry mode decision.

They are Bahrain, Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Findings show the importance of a number of host country’s features (economic development, corruption, and efficiency of contract enforcement). The scant theoretical or empirical attention given to the topic of foreign entry mode choice via franchising has usually been examined from a U. S. base and focused on developed markets.
