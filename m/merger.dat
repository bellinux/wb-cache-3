It is assumed that pharmaceutical companies with no experience in <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions achieve better results in relatively small and domestic <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions while pharmaceutical companies with greater experience in <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions are successful even in bigger and international <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions. Bigger <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions and international <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions are more risky for the companies so lack of experience in <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions additionally increases risks during the process of <b>mergers</b> and acquisitions.

However, some <b>mergers</b> can {{have a negative effect}} on consumer welfare by, for example, leading to an increase in price or a reduction in output. That is, they substantially lessen competition and consumers (including businesses) suffer. <b>Mergers</b> over a certain financial threshold must be notified to the Competition Authority for review. The Competition Authority aims at all times to make sure that <b>mergers</b> are reviewed in a timely manner so that good <b>mergers</b> are not held up. At the same time, the Competition Authority actively protects the interests of consumers and has the power to block <b>mergers</b> where it finds that it will lead to a “substantial lessening of competition”. <b>Mergers</b> and acquisitions bring a number of changes within the organization.
