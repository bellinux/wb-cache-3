40|$|Abstract This study aims {{to examine}} psychosocial factors {{associated}} with <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> well-being difficulties {{in a group of}} Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults. A self-reported survey was administered to 155 par-ticipants aged 18 – 80 from five Indigenous communities, who were recruited through local Aboriginal Community Con-trolled Health Services. Stress, resilience, <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> well-being were measured. Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the association of stress <b>and</b> resilience with <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> well-being difficul-ties. Seventy-eight participants had no mental health or emotional well-being difficulties but 77 participants were at risk. Low levels of resilience emerged as a key psychosocial factor associated with <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> well-being dif-ficulties while high levels of resilience were associated with a reduced risk. High levels of stress was related to an increased risk of experiencing <b>mental</b> health <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> well-being difficulties. Improving our understanding of psychological characteristics associated with resilience in the face of stress can inform prevention and treatment interventions for stress-exposed individuals...|$|R

The simulator performs the reasoning in the framework of belief-desire-intention model.

25|$|There {{exists a}} number of {{meditation}} techniques such as pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, savīrya-dhyāna, etc. In padāstha dhyāna one focuses on Mantra. A Mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of Mantra in Jainism. All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether Digambara or Svetambara, practice mantra. Mantra chanting {{is an important part}} of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. Mantra chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. Yogasana and Pranayama has been an important practice undertaken since ages. Pranayama– breathing exercises– are performed to strengthen the five Pranas or vital energy.

25|$|Butler's protagonists are disenfranchised {{individuals}} who endure, compromise, and embrace {{radical change in}} order to survive. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, her stories focus on minority characters whose historical background makes them already intimate with brutal violation and exploitation, and therefore the need to compromise to survive. Even when endowed with extra abilities, these characters are forced to experience unprecedented physical, <b>mental,</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> distress and exclusion to ensure a minimal degree of agency and to prevent humanity from achieving self-destruction. In many stories, their acts of courage become acts of understanding, and in some cases, love, as they reach a crucial compromise with those in power. Ultimately, Butler's focus on disenfranchised characters serves to illustrate both the historical exploitation of minorities and how the resolve of one such exploited individual may bring on critical change.|$|E
25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{treatment}} involves periodic {{visits to}} a psychiatrist for consultation {{in his or her}} office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. Initial appointments, at which the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. Follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms (e.g., exercise, cognitive therapy techniques, sleep hygiene—to name just a few). The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.|$|E

40|$|Adolescence is a {{critical}} period for <b>mental,</b> social, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> wellbeing <b>and</b> development. During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant developmental changes, establishing neural pathways and behavior patterns that will last into adulthood. Because their brains are still developing, adolescents are particularly receptive to the positive influences of youth development strategies, social <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> learning, <b>and</b> behavioral modeling. But adolescents' developing brains, coupled with hormonal changes, make them more prone to depression {{and more likely to}} engage in risky and thrill-seeking behaviors than either younger children or adults. These and other factors underline the importance of meeting the <b>mental,</b> social, <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> health needs of this age group. <b>Mental</b> health <b>and</b> social <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> wellbeing – combined with sexual and reproductive health, violence and unintentional injury, substance use, and nutrition and obesity – form part of a complex web of potential challenges to adolescents' healthy <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> physical development...|$|R

25|$|As a baby, Harry was in {{the room}} when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul had been {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> states, allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E
25|$|Music therapy {{finds its}} roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which {{described}} the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal {{of the study was to}} understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.|$|E
