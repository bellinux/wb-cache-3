A collection K of nonempty subsets of X is said to <b>move</b> <b>off</b> C if for each C ∈ C there exists K ∈ K such that C ∩ K = ∅. Let X be a Tychonoff space. As usual, we use Cp(X) [resp. Ck(X) ] to denote the space of continuous real-valued functions on X with the product topology (a. k. a. the topology of pointwise convergence) [resp. with the compact-open topology]. • Cp(X) is countably tight iff every collection of closed subsets of X which <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the finite sets has a countable subcollection which also <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the finite sets [AP]. • Cp(X) is Fréchet-Urysohn iff every collection of closed subsets of X which <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the finite sets has an infinite point-finite subcollection [GN]. • Cp(X) is Baire iff every countably infinite collection of finite sets which <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the finite sets has an infinite subcollection that expands to a discrete collection of open sets [GN].

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward {{through the}} Atlantic Ocean {{for the next}} week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come together two days later due to the influence of anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Charley {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> {{the west coast of}} Africa in early August 2004. Tracking westward, the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August9 while located roughly 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Barbados. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Charley after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. Quickly tracking northwest, the small storm intensified.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{the fourth}} named storm of the 1992 Pacific {{hurricane}} season. The origins of Darby were from a tropical wave which <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa on June 19. It traversed the Atlantic, and moved across Mexico, where it re-emerged in the Pacific on June 29 and became a tropical depression on July 2, a tropical storm on July 5, and a hurricane on July 6. The storm remained well offshore, although it killed three people.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an {{area of low pressure}} two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

5|$|On August 11, 2007, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> {{the west coast}} of Africa, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. It encountered conditions favorable for gradual development, and on August12 it gained organization and became a low. Strong upper-level easterly winds slowed development, but on August13 the tropical wave gained enough organization that the National Hurricane Center designated it Tropical Depression Four. At this time it was centered about 520mi (835km) west-southwest of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical wave that <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa on July 9.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, a {{tropical}} wave <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast of}} Africa and tracked westward. The wave entered the Caribbean on July 29 and gained in organization and convection, and organized into Tropical Storm Barry on August 3. After fluctuations in intensity, the system attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) in the Gulf of Mexico, and headed northward before moving ashore along the Gulf Coast.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the latest}} Cape Verde-type hurricanes to form in any season, Joan formed from an area of {{convection}} in the intertropical convergence zone that <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa early in October.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Dorothy {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa on August13. It tracked generally westward, developing into a tropical depression on August17 about 1375mi (2210km) east of Tobago in the Lesser Antilles. Two days later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy, while located about 500mi (800km) east of the Lesser Antilles, with its intensity confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the system was a cold front that <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> the U.S. East Coast on September 11.

Over the next two days, the cloud cover slowly detached itself from the front and form into a tropical low in its own right. On the afternoon of September 17, the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four.|$|E
