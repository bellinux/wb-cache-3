5|$|At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers {{agreed to}} create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations. Many League bodies, such as the International Labour Organisation, {{continued}} to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN. The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> League.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block may be <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which {{is more effective than}} a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with Counter battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing. A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E
30|$|As {{a result}} shown in Tables  4 and 5, {{in the case}} of the small (no) view angle difference, the {{accuracy}} of LB and MT is higher than that of Siamese since leveraging the inter-subject difference is <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> mitigating <b>the</b> intra-subject difference due to view angle differences in such a case. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} a larger view angle difference, Siamese is better than LB and MT, since mitigating the intra-subject difference due to view angle difference is <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> leveraging <b>the</b> inter-subject difference.|$|R

25|$|Hypnodelic therapy, as {{the name}} suggests, was {{developed}} with the goal to maximize the power of hypnotic suggestion by combining it with the psychedelic experience. After training the patient to respond to hypnosis, LSD would be administered, and during the onset phase of the drug the patient would be placed {{into a state of}} trance. Levine and Ludwig found the combination of these techniques to be <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> use of either of these two components separately.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{requirements}} set for {{the system}} were to achieve twice the performance in terms of range, altitude and combat effectiveness of the ZSU-23-4, additionally the system should have a reaction time no greater than 10 seconds. Due to the similarities in the fire control of artillery and missiles, {{it was decided that}} the Tunguska would be a combined gun and missile system. A combined system is <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ZSU-23-4, engaging targets at long-range with missiles, and shorter range targets with guns.|$|E
25|$|For alert, {{cooperative}} patients, air breaks {{provided by}} mask are <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> changing <b>the</b> chamber gas {{because they provide}} a quicker gas change and a more reliable gas composition both during the break and treatment periods.|$|R

25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British ones, which often failed to {{penetrate}} heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly {{the case at}} long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.|$|E
25|$|The other {{approach}} is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish {{to ensure that the}} EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so {{that they will not be}} put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.|$|E
25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that haloperidol may be <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and that the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, memantine {{has been shown to}} significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of memantine in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|Aid {{programs}} {{to prevent and}} treat infectious diseases in developing countries depend largely on indigenous health workers for their success and cannot be fielded effectively in their absence.

25|$|However, {{it seems}} that the results of the raid were a lot <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> press had led people to believe. All of the bombs were dropped into the correct target box, except for one string of bombs which had missed the area {{completely}} because of a radar failure. After about a week, US Army teams began to enter the area and reported almost total destruction of all life in the area. Additional missions were cancelled and did not resume until July. There was initially some skepticism about the usefulness of a high-altitude radar bomb drop against guerrilla forces. Nevertheless, within a few months there was universal acceptance {{of the power of the}} B-52 raids as a new type of artillery. By November 1965, the B-52s were able to support the 1st Air Cavalry Division in mopping up operations near Pleiku.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that helps students to participate in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
