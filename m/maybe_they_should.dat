500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of our fans were probably like, 'Fuck, <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Book Job" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology named it one the season's strongest episodes so far, praising it for featuring [...] "a brilliant appearance by author [...] Neil Gaiman and a slick Ocean's Eleven aesthetic". AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, it pays to shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode." [...] He noted that while [...] "the rest of the gags have some thrust to them, [...] cross the line into cute pandering to the audience. Fortunately, they are over in about ten seconds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opponents {{of the law}} {{maintain}} that a uniform, unambiguous set of laws that apply to all road users is easier for children to understand and allowing cyclists to behave by a separate set of rules than drivers makes them less predictable and thus, less safe. Jack Gillette, {{former president of the}} Boise Bicycle Commuters Association, argued that bicyclists should not have greater freedoms than drivers. “Bicyclists want the same rights as drivers, and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have the same duties,” he said. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee argued that the law [...] "directly endangers pedestrians and cyclists" [...] in his veto of a similar law in his city.|$|E

Now I {{think there may}} be a new generation of players who don't realise how lucky they are to be able to leave a club and join another, even if they are the fifth or sixth foreigner there. I am proud of the ruling because people will still be talking about it in years to come, maybe even after I am gone in 20 or 30 years or whatever. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> will think <b>they</b> <b>should</b> at least thank me, nothing more."

2500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} game a 2/5 saying [...] "Despite {{the fact that}} Absolution is a hugely disappointing entry into the canon, Hitman is still a fabulous series." [...] IBITimes gave the game a 5/10 saying [...] "An unremarkable, {{derivative}} clone of a game that's barely a shadow of what Hitman used to be." [...] Videogamer.com gave it 5/10 saying [...] "The problem with Absolution is that its new custodians from the Kane and Lynch team seem to have fundamentally misunderstood what made Hitman great." [...] Blogcritics.org gave the game a 3/5 saying [...] "There are definitely good things about it, but all too often the game's failures shine through more clearly than its successes." [...] PC Gamer gave it 66% saying [...] "A passable stealth game, but one that betrays almost everything that, until now, has made Hitman great." [...] GameTrailers gave it 6.9/10 saying [...] "It’s clear that {{a good deal of}} effort was put into crafting Hitman: Absolution’s world. This makes its flaws all the more unfortunate." [...] New Statesman gave no rating but said [...] "If developers want to win back fans when they revisit established franchises <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> look to what made those games popular {{in the first place and}} by doing so maybe they’d avoid stepping on a rake or two." [...] GamerSyndrome gave no rating but said [...] "Hitman Absolution tries to be a jack of all trades but ends up being a master of none." [...] The Irish Times gave no score but said [...] "The move away from the completely open world may leave some hardcore fans of Hitman disappointed." [...] Gaming Age rated the game a 'C' and said [...] "It feels like I’m playing a low rent, knockoff Metal Gear title as opposed to traditional Hitman." [...] The Daily Record gave the game 3/5 saying [...] "While it’s more accessible than previous Hitman games, Absolution loses a lot of the freedom that fans of the franchise love, and perhaps doesn’t necessarily fit the Hitman name any longer." [...] TheEscapist gave no score but said [...] "Hitman Absolution is not the best nor the worst Hitman". Whatculture gave the game a 3/5 saying [...] "Not Quite the expected hit". The Guardian gave it 3/5 saying [...] "The game may look better and play better than any Hitman game before it, but one can only marvel at how IO managed to lose sight of their IP's most appealing aspects so often." ...|$|E
60|$|Only {{there were}} certain murmurs by the rugged Scots and fierce Gascons among the guests. George {{observed}} to David Drummond that {{he felt as if}} this was a nest of eider-ducks, all down and fluff. Davie responded that it was like a pasteboard town in a mystery play, and that he longed to strike at it with his good broadsword. The English squire who stood by, in his turn compared it to a castle of flummery and blanc-manger. A French captain of a full company declared that he wished he had the plundering of it; and a fierce-looking mountaineer of the Vosges of Alsace growled that if the harping old King of Nowhere flouted his master, Duke Sigismund, <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have a taste of plunder.|$|E
