40|$|International audiencePrevious {{studies of}} the commercially {{harvested}} sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus revealed genetic differentiation between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and between the Adriatic and other <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins,</b> and reported an absence of genetic structure within basins. These studies used mitochondrial markers. We augmented these data with new mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (calpain exon-primed intron crossing) sequences and renalyzed them. We found within-basin and within-region differentiation with each genetic marker, providing, for this species, the first report of a significant and consistent genetic structure within regions in which no stable or identified oceanographic barriers had ever been reported. This was unexpected given the long planktonic larval phase. With the mitochondrial marker, the easternmost population from Lebanon appeared strongly differentiated from other populations, with Phi(ST) values of the same order as those between Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins,</b> and a differentiation of the same magnitude was found for the northernmost population (Galway, Ireland). Among basins, gene flow appeared unidirectional, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea, and we found an admixture area between Adriatic and other Mediterranean populations. The divergence between Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins</b> was estimated to have started between 270 000 and 370 000 yr ago. Chaotic genetic patchiness appears unlikely to be the single factor responsible for such a differentiation, and some environmental or hydrological factors that are relatively stable over years, are probably involved. Methodological aspects such as sample sizes and the choice of statistics (F-ST versus Phi(ST)) contributed to the increased detection power of our study...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} features of Justinian's reign was the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basin</b> that had slipped out of Imperial control in the 5th century. As a Christian Roman emperor, Justinian considered it his divine duty to restore the Roman Empire to its ancient boundaries. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.|$|E

40|$|Based on new cyclostratigraphic {{data and}} considerations, the Messinian Terminal Carbonate Complex (TCC), {{consisting}} of oolite and microbial-dominated carbonate platforms mainly {{preserved in the}} western <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins,</b> developed between 5. 97 and 5. 42 Ma. In Sorbas basin (southern Spain), the TCC offers an almost continuous record of MSC stages 1 (5. 97 - 5. 6 Ma), 2 (5. 6 - 5. 55 Ma) and of {{the lower part of}} stage 3 (5. 55 - 5. 42 Ma). As a consequence the TCC carbonate platforms can be considered as a shallow-water equivalent of both Lower Gypsum and Upper Gypsum units, developed respectively during MSC stage 1 and 3. The MSC peak during stage 2 caused a significant change in reef-builder communities allowing subdivision of the TCC into two units. TCC 1 dominated by oolites, Porites reefs and stromatolites and TCC 2, dominated by thrombolites. The surface separating the two units corresponds to the Messinian erosional surface; facies and stratigraphic relationships suggest that only a modest relative sea-level fall (tens of meters) can be associated to this unconformity, thus questioning the high-amplitude sea-level drop (800 - 1500 m) usually envisaged for this event which led to the accumulation of giant salt bodies in deep <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R

5|$|Whales {{were once}} {{uncommon}} in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, but {{have increased their}} presence in both waters as global populations have recovered.

5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basin</b> began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{are known}} with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are {{essentially}} the well-known ectomycorrhizal {{trees and shrubs}} in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with Bistorta vivipara (Polygonaceae), Kobresia (Cyperaceae), and Dryas octopetala (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (Coccoloba), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus and Leptospermum), and Rhamnaceae (Pomaderris).

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} an {{estimation of the}} anthropogenic CO 2 (CANT) concentrations and acidification (ΔpH=pH 2013 –pHpre-industrial) in the Mediterranean Sea, based upon hydrographic and carbonate chemistry data collected during the May 2013 MedSeA cruise. The concentrations of CANT were calculated using the composite tracer TrOCA. The CANT distribution shows that the most invaded waters (> 60 µmol kg− 1) {{are those of the}} intermediate and deep layers in the Alboran, Liguro- and Algero-Provencal Sub-basins in the Western basin, and in the Adriatic Sub-basin in the Eastern basin. Whereas the areas containing the lowest CANT concentrations are the deep layers of the Eastern basin, especially those of the Ionian Sub-basin, and those of the northern Tyrrhenian Sub-basin in the Western basin. The acidification level in the Mediterranean Sea reflects the excessive increase of atmospheric CO 2 and therefore the invasion of the sea by CANT. This acidification varies between − 0. 055 and − 0. 156 pH unit and it indicates that all Mediterranean Sea waters are already acidified, especially those of the Western basin where ΔpH is rarely less than − 0. 1 pH unit. Both CANT concentrations and acidification levels are closely linked to the presence and history of the different water masses in the intermediate and deep layers of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins.</b> Despite the high acidification levels, both <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>basins</b> are still highly supersaturated in calcium carbonate minerals...|$|R
