50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>linings</b> {{were invented}} by Bertha Benz (the wife of Karl Benz {{who invented the}} first {{patented}} automobile) during her historic first long-distance car trip {{in the world in}} August 1888. The first asbestos <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> were developed in 1908 by Herbert Frood.Although Frood was the first to implement the use of asbestos <b>brake</b> <b>linings,</b> the heat dissipation properties of the fibres were tested by various scientists, including well known materials chemist Dr Gwilym Price, who did most of his research and testing from Cambridge, United Kingdom and various Cambridge-funded institutes.|$|R

As a result, by contrast with the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> that have been done at the same material and producing technology, it was preliminary demonstrated that the apparent porosity of the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> that have been made by the granulating technology could be enhanced greatly, so on the hot-pressing process, products exhausting has been easy, the die cavity volume could be decreased, the hot-pressing time could been shorten, the production efficiency could be enhanced, the natural frequency of the braking lining could be reduced, the possibility of the braking noise could be decreased...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{friction}} coefficient-temperature and time experiments {{are carried out}} for the produced non-asbestos <b>brake</b> <b>linings.</b> For the evaluation of <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> with different ingredients the mean value {{the friction}} coefficient and the standard deviation which gives the variation of the friction coefficients are calculated experimental. Recently, the ANN is successfully implemented for the prediction of experimental results in many areas. This {{is due to the}} capability of ANN in modeling of non-linear relation. The prediction of experimental results is advantageous for time and cost. In this study the ANNs are used for the prediction of mean value of friction coefficient and standard deviation for produced <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> with different amount of organic dust and barite.

25|$|Natural {{amorphous}} {{and fine}} flake graphite {{are used in}} <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> or <b>brake</b> shoes for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important {{with the need to}} substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.|$|R

50|$|Due to its efficacy, {{chrysotile}} asbestos {{was often a}} component in <b>brake</b> <b>linings.</b> However, studies such as a 1989 National Institutes of Health item showed an uncommonly high proportion of brake mechanics were afflicted with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, {{both of which are}} linked to chrysotile and asbestos exposure. Public health authorities generally recommend against inhaling brake dust, chrysotile has been banned in many developed countries, such as Australia in late 2003, and chrysotile has been progressively replaced in most <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> and pads by other fibers such as the synthetic aramids.|$|R
40|$|Background In Booth v Amaca Pty Ltd and Amaba Pty Ltd, 1 the New South Wales Dust Diseases Tribunal {{awarded a}} retired motor {{mechanic}} 326 640 in damages for his malignant pleural mesothelioma allegedly caused {{by exposure to}} asbestos through working with the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> manufactured by the defendants. The evidence before the Tribunal was that the plaintiff {{had been exposed to}} asbestos prior to working as a mechanic from home renovations {{when he was a child}} and loading a truck as a youth. However, as a mechanic he had been exposed to asbestos in <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> on which he worked from 1953 to 1983. Curtis DCJ held at [172] that the asbestos from the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> ‘materially contributed to [the plaintiff’s] contraction of mesothelioma’. This decision was based upon acceptance that the effect of exposure to asbestos on the development of mesothelioma was cumulative and rejection of theory that a single fibre of asbestos can cause the disease [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Insights {{into the}} {{speciation}} of Sb in samples of <b>brake</b> <b>linings,</b> <b>brake</b> pad wear residues, road dust, and {{atmospheric particulate matter}} PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were obtained combining several well established and advanced characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy e energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS). The advantage of SR-XAS is that samples do not undergo any chemical treatment prior to measurements, thus excluding possible alterations. These analyses revealed that the samples of wheel rims dust, road dust, and atmospheric particulate matter are composed by an admixture of Sb(III) and Sb(V) in different relative abundances. <b>Brake</b> <b>linings</b> {{turned out to be}} composed by Sb(III) oxide (Sb 2 O 3) and stibnite (Sb 2 S 3). Stibnite was also detected in some of the particulate matter samples. The obtained data suggest that Sb 2 S 3 during the brake abrasion process is easily decomposed forming more stable compounds such as antimony mixed oxidic forms. Sb redox speciation, in particular and well studied circumstances, may enhance the potential and selectivity of this element as a tracer of motor vehicle emissions in apportioning studies...|$|R
