5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rest}} of the office is told of Phyllis' injury, they take this as {{confirmation}} that the Cafe Disco is a bad idea and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis. Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe Disco. Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo. This catches the eye of two <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe Disco is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{cultural}} investments {{were carried out}} in 1958: the newspaper Det nye Kingsbay was published, a public library was established and the school {{moved to a new}} building. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks. That year only 8,000 tonnes were exported. A new shaft was opened the following year, allowing mining to start in Vestre Senterfelt. Production in 1960 hit a record 79,000 tonnes of raw coal, which after being processed through the new coal preparation plant resulted in 51,000 tonnes. Start of a coke plant in Mo i Rana helped stimulate the domestic coal demand. Washed coal production hit 54,000 tonnes in 1961. By then NOK21 million had been invested in the past years, although the coal prices had continued to fall, and especially in Norway the demand had diminished. Norway was retiring its last steam locomotives, but unlike in most of Europe it was not replicating the coal demand through construction of coal-fueled thermal power plants. By 1962 Ny-Ålesund had 25 family apartments and barracks for 210 <b>male</b> <b>employees.</b> Production hit 75,000 tonnes of washed coal in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{legislation}} passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both the Equal Opportunity Law, which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave {{to tend to}} children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies who ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as <b>male</b> <b>employees,</b> of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any career woman not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part {{of the labor force}} are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the household budget. In fact, the government discourages housewives from making too much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance. This limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay and chances at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.|$|E
25|$|A {{key issue}} {{that remains is}} the lack of female {{representation}} in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002. Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is {{due to the lack of}} commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, family, and children. While the government had imposed the Equal Opportunity Law, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement. However, uptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labour market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system. Gendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose not to be in management jobs due to lack of training, experience, and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an existing environment of a male-dominated workplace.|$|E

At the bachelorette party, with the current and former female employees plus Angela's sister Rachael (Rachael Harris), the group is shocked to see that the stripper hired for entertainment is Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) son Jake (Spencer Daniels). Angela is then kidnapped by Dwight's cousin Mose (Michael Schur). After hearing about Angela's kidnapping, Dwight and the <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> visit the bar that Kevin owns, where Dwight, at Jim's insistence to bury the hatchet, is forced to apologize to Kevin and confirm that his firing was not personal but based solely on his job performance, which cheers him up. The two decide to make amends. Mose then leads Dwight and Jim out to his car where Angela is stuck in the trunk and finally let out.|$|E
500|$|The {{length of}} pre-Code films was usually {{comparatively}} short, but that running time often required tighter material {{and did not}} affect the impact of message films. Employees' Entrance (1933) received the following review from Jonathan Rosenbaum: [...] "As an attack on ruthless capitalism, it goes a lot further than more recent efforts such as Wall Street, and it's amazing how much plot and character are gracefully shoehorned into 75 minutes." [...] The film featured pre-Code megastar Warren William (later dubbed [...] "the king of Pre-Code"), [...] "at his magnetic worst", playing a particularly vile and heartless department store manager who, for example, terminates the jobs of two long-standing <b>male</b> <b>employees,</b> one of whom commits suicide as a result. He also threatens to fire Loretta Young's character, who pretends to be single to stay employed, unless she sleeps with him, then attempts to ruin her husband after learning she is married.|$|E
500|$|The visitors' {{need for}} {{overnight}} lodging led to creation {{of public and}} private campsites and rustic cabins along highways near Cave Junction and the monument. In 1923, the USFS signed a contract with the Oregon Caves Company, based in Grants Pass, to run the cave tours and improve the park accommodations. Public-private partnerships between the USFS or NPS and concessionaires continued in various forms at Oregon Caves into the 21st century. The Chalet, a building with a kitchen, dining room, gift shop, ticket sales area, and a dormitory for women on the Oregon Caves Company staff, was completed later that year. Three years later, the company added seven two-bedroom cabins for tourists and a dormitory for <b>male</b> <b>employees.</b> In 1928, an Oregon Caves bill written by the USFS and introduced by Senator Charles McNary of Oregon won Congressional approval. It provided funds for electric lights, a power plant, a system of pipes and hoses to wash mud from the cave, and an artificial exit tunnel to eliminate the crowding that occurred when two groups on round-trip tours had to pass one another. The [...] tunnel was completed in 1931.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by male and female {{employer}} to the <b>male</b> and female <b>employees</b> and also <b>male</b> and female <b>employees</b> to <b>male</b> and female employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by {{the male and female}} employer to the <b>male</b> and female <b>employees</b> and <b>male</b> and female <b>employees</b> to <b>male</b> and female employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find the most frequently used types of request used by both male and female employers and both <b>male</b> and female <b>employees,</b> the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both male and female employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both <b>male</b> and female <b>employees.</b> However, the writer found various types of request used by both <b>male</b> and female <b>employees</b> to both <b>male</b> and female employers. The result of this research showed that both male and female employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their <b>male</b> and female <b>employees.</b> However, both <b>male</b> and female <b>employees</b> used various types of request, both to male and female employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both male and female employers and both <b>male</b> and female <b>employees...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Sexual abuse. [...] Sexual {{abuse was}} endemic in boys’ institutions. The schools {{investigated}} revealed a substantial level {{of sexual abuse}} of boys in care that extended over a range from improper touching and fondling to rape with violence. Perpetrators of abuse were able to operate undetected for long periods {{at the core of}} institutions. When confronted with evidence of sexual abuse, the response of the religious authorities was to transfer the offender to another location where, in many instances, he was free to abuse again. The safety of children in general was not a consideration. The situation in girls’ institutions was different. Although girls were subjected to predatory sexual abuse by <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> or visitors or in outside placements, sexual abuse was not systemic in girls’ schools.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expression}} of anger {{is believed to}} be related to status, as anger is considered a status emotion. [...] Positive impressions of those who display anger are reserved for people who are stereotypically conferred a higher status. [...] A 2007 study found that <b>male</b> <b>employees</b> who were in a subordinate position in the workplace displayed anger toward higher status employees, while female employees in a subordinate position displayed anger toward higher status employees much less frequently. [...] This suggests that the stereotypical norm of men displaying anger carries over into the workplace, while the norm of women restraining displays of anger also carries over. [...] It also suggests that, although men in low level positions in the workplace possess a low status in this context, they may carry over the higher status that comes with their gender into the workplace. [...] Women do not possess this high status; therefore the low status that low level women possess in the workplace is the sole status that matters.|$|E
