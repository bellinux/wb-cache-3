5|$|Because Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Running back David Wilson returned the opening kickoff to the Tech 21-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began the first drive of the second half. The first play of the quarter was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to Coale, beginning a seven-play, 67-yard drive resulting in a touchdown. The culminating play of the drive was a 45-yard pass from Taylor to Coale for the touchdown, which extended Tech's lead to 11 points, 28–17, at the 11:24 <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quarter.|$|E

He again played a rabbi in a 1956 episode of ITV Television Playhouse entitled Skipper Next to God, and made two further appearances in the series later in the decade. In 1959, Miller had an uncredited role as Kakky in Expresso Bongo directed by Val Guest. He played a doctor in the television film Henry IV and appeared as Dr. Schrott in Anthony Asquith's film Libel, starring alongside Olivia de Havilland and Dirk Bogarde.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Panthers is uncertain. One {{of the most widely}} known {{theories}} is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Millson appears {{throughout}} the first series as Maria's recently separated father, Alan, with Chrissie Jackson, Maria's mother, played by Juliet Cowan.

5|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} second half, Robinson threw a 70-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Junior Hemingway. Demarlo Willis tied the game at 28–28 with his second touchdown on a 4-yard run at the 6:55 <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third quarter. Michigan once again took the lead {{less than a minute}} later with a 56-yard touchdown run by Vincent Smith. The score remained 35–28 until the closing minutes as the defensive units held the offenses without a score for more than 20 minutes. Late in the fourth quarter, Chappell led Indiana on a six-minute, 80-yard drive. On fourth down with 1:20 remaining in the game, Chappell completed a 19-yard touchdown to Darius Willis to tie the game at 35–35. The Wolverines got the ball back at their own 27-yard line with 1:15 remaining in the game. Robinson carried the ball three times to take the ball to the Indiana 46-yard line and then completed a 42-yard pass to Hemingway who was tackled at the Indiana 4-yard line. Robinson ran the ball into the endzone for the winning touchdown with 17 seconds left in the game. It was Michigan's 17th consecutive win against Indiana, dating back to 1987. The victory also gave Michigan its first 5–0 start since the 2006 season.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates construction-level {{effects of}} animacy for Agents {{in a set}} of Australian languages. It is shown that <b>the</b> {{presence}} <b>of</b> an inanimate Agent can not only affect <b>the</b> <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Agent, but also <b>the</b> <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Undergoer. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> these effects in specific languages, it is shown that they are not always directly related to animacy, but can also be related to factors that are typically but not exclusively associated with animacy, like unusual instigation and unusual affectedness. It is also shown that there is a correlation between <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction that is affected, and <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> motivation.

The ruling meant the Gulf Racing's No. 86 car moved from sixth to fourth in LMGTE Am. The No. 51 AF Corse entry, and Ford Chip Ganassi Team's No. 66 car, failed their post-qualifying checks when it was discovered that the vehicles were able to start their engines with and without their fuel couplings engaged; they were allowed to start the race. Michael Christensen, one of two drivers of the No. 77 Dempsey Proton Porsche, failed to reach the 107% <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fastest qualifying time in LMGTE Pro and was prohibited from starting the event but allowed to participate {{in the rest of the}} race.

5|$|Temple Owls' {{first loss}} in conference play was 78–66 against Duquesne Dukes, despite {{the return of}} Juan Fernandez. The Owls began the game by {{trailing}} 22–2, missing their first 14 shots. Temple Owls scored their first field goal at the 8:18 <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half, and shot 17 {{percent in the first}} half. Duquesne shot 67 percent in the first half en route to a 40–23 halftime lead. In the second half, the Owls scored the first six points, but the Dukes went on an 8–2 run from which Temple Owls could not recover. Ramone Moore contributed 18 points to lead the Owls. Temple Owls recovered with a 75–56 out-of-conference win against Philadelphia Big Five team Penn. Khalif Wyatt scored a career-best 27 points, Ramone Moore added 12 points and Lavoy Allen scored 10 points and six blocks.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albulena was {{significant}} for the southern resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Franz Babinger, a historian of the Ottoman Empire, describes the battle as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory. The battle of Albulena strengthened the morale of Skanderbeg's men who afterwards rarely, if at all, deserted his army as Hamza had. Hamza himself was sent as a prisoner to Naples in Alfonso's realm after being captured. An Ottoman envoy was sent to ransom the standard bearers and forty of the distinguished prisoners. The envoy also tried {{to settle for a}} truce between Mehmed and Skanderbeg, but the latter responded that he would only accept if Svetigrad and Berat, which had been lost in 1448 and 1450 respectively, were restored to his state. Seeing that Mehmed would not accept such terms, Skanderbeg strengthened his garrisons in the area around Svetigrad. The victory still bought Albania and Italy time; in 1460, Mehmed and Skanderbeg signed an armistice that lasted three years. This gave Skanderbeg the opportunity to land in Italy and help out Alfonso's son, Ferdinand I of Naples, who had been crowned after his father had died. The battle thus opened a new phase in the Ottoman-Albanian war which saw the high-water <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albanian resistance and the fiercest Ottoman invasions of Albania in the war. The war would last until the fall of Krujë in 1478.|$|E

5|$|The West Cornwall covered {{bridge is}} very {{significant}} and important {{as one of}} only three surviving covered bridges in the state of Connecticut. The bridge's modification from the original Town lattice represents a unique design that is not repeated in either the Comstock's Bridge or Bull's Bridge. The covered bridge is perhaps best known for being featured on postcards of New England villages. Terry Miller and Ronald Knapp assert that Charles Ives passed by the bridge {{on the way to the}} Berkshires which inspired the third movement in the Three Places in New England. The bridge appeared in the opening scenes of the movie, Valley of the Dolls a 1967 American drama film based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Jacqueline Susann. This brief scene occurs near the 2 minute <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, during the opening credits. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The branch was {{included}} in the Beeching report of 1963 which concluded that, since 30% of the railway network carried less than 1% of the total passenger traffic, much of it should be closed. The residents of Newport Pagnell resisted the closure, demanding an enquiry which took place on 7 June 1964. Despite many objections, it was determined that the line would close. The last passenger service was the 5:34 pm train from Newport Pagnell on 5 September 1964, just under a century after the line opened to passengers. The mourning of the line was so great that a bucket of water was poured over a double dressed as Richard Beeching, the man commonly associated with the closure of over 4,000 miles of the British railway network. The crowd cheered as this happened, a <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public's feelings about the closure.|$|E
5|$|What {{would become}} the Strand on the {{southern}} boundary of the future Covent Garden was used during the Roman period {{as part of a}} route to Silchester, known as Iter VII on the Antonine Itinerary. Excavations in 2006 at St Martin-in-the-Fields revealed a late Roman grave, suggesting the locale had been a sacred site. The area {{to the north of the}} Strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century, but theories by Alan Vince and Martin Biddle that there had been an Anglo-Saxon settlement to the west of the old Roman town of Londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005. These revealed Covent Garden as the centre of a trading town called Lundenwic, developed around 600 AD, which stretched from Trafalgar Square to Aldwych. Alfred the Great gradually shifted the settlement into the old Roman town of Londinium from around 886 AD onwards, leaving no <b>mark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old town, and the site returned to fields.|$|E
