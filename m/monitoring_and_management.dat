5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E

These processes {{are the most}} basic and essential components of ecosystems. An understanding of the full complexity and intricacies of these cycles is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. A functional ecosystem, that is completely self-perpetuating (no management required), is {{the ultimate goal of}} restorative efforts. Since, these ecosystem functions are emergent properties of the system as a whole, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> are crucial for the long-term stability of an ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|The fast-fashion brands are not {{the only}} one who involve with sweat factories. The German {{sportswear}} giant, Adidas, was blamed for Indonesian sweatshops in 2000 (Osborn, 2000). Adidas was subjected to the issues of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, Nike, is recently facing a heavy wave of anti-sweatshops protests in the US. They are organised by the United Student Against Sweatshops (USAS) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike’s contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with ‘temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees’(Bain, 2017). Since the 1990s, Nike was reported of employing sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike’s image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of labour rights (Nisen, 2013). To improve its brand image of being immoral, Nike has been publishing annual sustainable business reports since 2001(Project Just, 2016) and annual corporate social responsibility report continuously since 2005, mentioning its commitments, standards and audit (Nisen, 2013).Yet, the issue of sweatshops continues to bother Nike. Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2010, India {{has more}} {{reported}} cases of TB than any other country. This is {{in part due to}} severe mismanagement of diagnosis and treatment of TB within the private health care sector of India that serves about 50% of the population. [...] There are therefore calls for the private sector to engage in the public Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program that has proved effective in reducing TB amongst the patients receiving health care through the government. Additionally, a study by Maurya et al. conducted in 2013 shows evidence that there is a burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in India and change is needed for testing, surveillance, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E
