Materials and methods: A total of 160 milk producers in Babile district were selected using multistage stratified sampling technique. Moreover, a total of 54 milk collectors and transporters (5, 40, 9 from Jigjiga, Harar and Dire Dawa town, respectively), 152 vendors (40 from Bable, Harar and Dire Dawa town and 32 from Jigjiga town) and 160 consumers (40 from each town) were selected using snowball sampling technique. Data from the selected actors were collected using focus group discussion, questionnaire survey and observations. Results: The study revealed that the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> milk handling operations in the study area is carried out by females. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> milk producers (87. 5 - 92. 5 %), collectors and transporters (88. 9 - 100 %), vendors (77. 5 - 90. 7 %) and some consumers (37. 5 - 47. 5 %) performing milk handling operations were illiterate. Most of the observed actors in the study area perform malpractices (such as failure to stop milk handling while showing disease symptoms, improper hand washing and handling of risk factors) while working with milk. <b>Majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondent</b> milk producers (87. 5 - 97. 5 %), all traders and some consumers (12. 5 - 32. 5 %) use plastic containers for milk handling.
