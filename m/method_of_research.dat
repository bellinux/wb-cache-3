5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
25|$|Janzen's work {{exemplifies the}} {{dialectic}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> {{applied to the}} biology of the natural world. For him {{it has not been}} the passive analysis of documents and data about ecological processes in order to formulate theories, but rather the active creation of life size scenarios of ecological change and their careful and meticulous documentation from which he then formulates theories which inspire new grand experiments in an ever expanding spiral of knowledge based on the keen observation of nature. The following sections are an attempt to synthesise the main themes of his lifelong quest and work.|$|E
500|$|Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet {{received}} a generally favorable reception in media coverage and book reviewers. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, [...] "The authors convey the awe and wonderment of seeing Earth from {{space and the}} intricate delicacy of the Earth's ecology". The Dallas Morning News said, [...] "The astronaut's descriptions are vivid". A review in Booklist was more critical; it said, [...] "The authors try to cover too much in so few pages, and the narrative, with several focal points, becomes simplified at times". School Library Journal wrote, [...] "It provides a unique look at a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this exciting field of endeavor". The book was selected for inclusion in books Best Books for Children, and Adventuring With Books, or educating youths about history by using children's literature works.|$|E

500|$|A {{review of}} the book by Ilana Steinhorn in Booklist was more critical. Steinhorn said, [...] "The authors try to cover too much in so few pages, and the narrative, with several focal points, becomes {{simplified}} at times...Still, the account is interesting, and the many high-quality, often breathtaking color photographs and radar images complement the text nicely". Elaine Fort Weischedel reviewed the book for School Library Journal, and recommended it for teaching specific subject matter. She wrote, [...] "Pollution patterns, shifting ocean currents, destruction of rain forests, and other environmental changes were the heart of Jones's project, and this book might be used more successfully to supplement the curriculum in those areas than in units on space flight per se". Weischedel said the book [...] "provides a unique look at a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this exciting field of endeavor". Horn Book Review called the book [...] "a uniquely personal account", and said it [...] "features a crowded design, but the many color photographs throughout the text are fascinating".|$|E
2500|$|An {{associate}} {{professor of sociology at}} Stanford University and a social demographer who studies race, ethnicity, and family structure, the family's effect on children, and the history of the family. Dr. Rosenfeld has examined the study by defense witness Regnerus. Some of the work by defense witness Allen is based on Rosenfeld's work which was based off the United States Census. Rosenfeld testified on February 26, 2014 that [...] "there is no basis" [...] for believing that kids develop better in a household led by a man and a woman. Broadly summarizing research in the field, he said [...] "it’s clear that being raised by same-sex parents is no disadvantage to children." [...] While cross-examining Rosenfeld, Assistant Attorney General Kristin Heyse suggested it was rational for voters to approve the same-sex marriage ban nearly 10 years ago because same-sex marriage in the U.S. was just emerging. Rosenfeld’s <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> was questioned by Heyse regarding the sample size used.|$|E

60|$|The whitened {{tables of}} the Pontifices {{preserved}} carefully {{the records of}} the eclipses and other atmospherical phenomena, and what we call the art of verifying dates was known to them at an early time; but there was no spontaneous rise of physical science to suggest by its analogies of law and order a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> nor any natural springing up of the questioning spirit of philosophy with its unification of all phenomena and all knowledge. At the very time when the whole tide of Eastern superstition was sweeping {{into the heart of the}} Capital the Senate banished the Greek philosophers from Rome. And of the three systems which did at length take some root in the city, those of Zeno and Epicurus were used merely as the rule for the ordering of life, while the dogmatic scepticism of Carneades, by its very principles, annihilated the possibility of argument and encouraged a perfect indifference to research.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time, {{and as an}} {{essential}} aid to the direct perception of the truth, {{it is necessary to}} acquire fertility in imagining abstract hypotheses. This is, I think, what has most of all been lacking hitherto in philosophy. So meagre was the logical apparatus that all the hypotheses philosophers could imagine were found to be inconsistent with the facts. Too often this state of things led to the adoption of heroic measures, such as a wholesale denial of the facts, when an imagination better stocked with logical tools would have found a key to unlock the mystery. It is in this way that the study of logic becomes the central study in philosophy: it gives the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> in philosophy, just as mathematics gives the method in physics. And as physics, which, from Plato to the Renaissance, was as unprogressive, dim, and superstitious as philosophy, became a science through Galileo's fresh observation of facts and subsequent mathematical manipulation, so philosophy, in our own day, is becoming scientific through the simultaneous acquisition of new facts and logical methods.|$|E
6000|$|Anticipating in {{some measure}} the {{comparative}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> he argues from {{the fact of the}} more barbarous Greek tribes, such as the AEtolians and Acarnanians, still carrying arms in his own day, that this custom was the case originally over the whole country. 'The fact,' he says, 'that the people in these parts of Hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life was equally common to all.' Similarly, in another passage, he shows how a corroboration of his theory of the respectable character of piracy in ancient days is afforded by 'the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder,' {{as well as by the}} fact that the question, 'Are you a pirate?' is a common feature of primitive society as shown in the poets; and finally, after observing how the old Greek custom of wearing belts in gymnastic contests still survived among the more uncivilised Asiatic tribes, he observes that there are many other points in which a likeness may be shown between the life of the primitive Hellenes and that of the barbarians to-day.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{course of}} the study of the spirit of {{historical}} criticism has not been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now antiquated and of no account. The only spirit which is entirely removed from us is the mediaeval; the Greek spirit is essentially modern. The introduction of the comparative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> which has forced history to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us. Ours, too, is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival. Nor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of crucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance in modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the statical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all physical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single instance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new science of prehistoric archaeology and to bring us back to a time when man was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros. But, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of historical criticism. Across the drear waste of a thousand years the Greek and the modern spirit join hands.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{greatest}} force of {{all on the}} side of vivisection is the mighty and indeed divine force of curiosity. Here we have no decaying tribal instinct which men strive to root out of themselves as they strive to root out the tiger's lust for blood. On the contrary, the curiosity of the ape, or of the child who pulls out the legs and wings of a fly to see what it will do without them, or who, on being told that a cat dropped out of the window will always fall on its legs, immediately tries the experiment on the nearest cat from the highest window in the house (I protest I did it myself from the first floor only), is as nothing compared to the thirst for knowledge of the philosopher, the poet, the biologist, and the naturalist. I have always despised Adam because he had to be tempted by the woman, as she was by the serpent, before he could be induced to pluck the apple from the tree of knowledge. I should have swallowed every apple on the tree the moment the owner's back was turned. When Gray said [...] "Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise," [...] he forgot that it is godlike to be wise; and since nobody wants bliss particularly, or could stand more than a very brief taste of it if it were attainable, and since everybody, by the deepest law of the Life Force, desires to be godlike, it is stupid, and indeed blasphemous and despairing, to hope that the thirst for knowledge will either diminish or consent to be subordinated to any other end whatsoever. We shall see later on that the claim that has arisen in this way for the unconditioned pursuit of knowledge is as idle as all dreams of unconditioned activity; but none the less the right to knowledge must be regarded as a fundamental human right. The fact that men of science have had to fight so hard to secure its recognition, and are still so vigorously persecuted when they discover anything that is not quite palatable to vulgar people, makes them sorely jealous for that right; and when they hear a popular outcry for the suppression of a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> which has an air of being scientific, their first instinct is to rally to the defence of that method without further consideration, with the result that they sometimes, {{as in the case of}} vivisection, presently find themselves fighting on a false issue.|$|E
