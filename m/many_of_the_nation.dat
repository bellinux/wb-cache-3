40|$|Part One of this Essay {{defends the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s [Grutter] analysis. The thesis {{here is a}} simple one: Universities should have a zone of freedom in which to conduct their {{academic}} affairs because they are better at making choices about educational matters than are generalist courts. This is the position I took, both in the Sixth Circuit and in the Supreme Court, as the chief counsel to the amicus deans of <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s leading private law schools in Grutter. Academic freedom {{has become something of}} a pariah concept; indeed, our amicus brief contained the only substantial discussion, let alone defense, of educational autonomy among the various briefs filed in the case. Grutter 2 ̆ 7 s celebration of such autonomy was by necessity modest, for what was left unmentioned were the many abuses of power in the name of academic freedom. To construct a viable system of deference to university decisionmaking, one must isolate not only the advantages of autonomy, but also its dangers. Part Two, to that end, sets forth some structural preconditions before academic autonomy claims should be recognized by courts. The Part explains why universities that seek to use educational autonomy to defend their admissions practices must release admissions data to a broader set of people than university administrators. As such, I issue a cautionary note to universities that are tempted to use their autonomy wantonly to carry out policies that cross the constitutional line...|$|E

It collects the best reporting on the subject, drawn {{from the pages of}} High Country News, the newspaper that sets the standard for coverage of environmental issues in the West. Beginning with an exhilarating account of the 1983 Colorado River floods that almost destroyed Glen Canyon Dam and proceeding through recent articles tracking the water quests of Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, Phoenix, and Tucson, this book provides compelling perspectives on the issues and controversies that have roiled water politics in the West over the past two decades. The tensions between the need for water and society 2 ̆ 7 s demands that rivers and their wildlife be restored to health are explored in chapters on the Northwest salmon crisis, Glen Canyon Dam, federal and urban water projects, Native American water rights, watershed restoration, and water management. Readers will find smart, incisive writings that probe the West 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to balance competing needs. The contributors to the book — among them activists, scholars, scientists, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s finest environmental journalists — offer captivating portrayals of local efforts to solve water conflicts. Together, these stories bring a refreshing focus and clarity to the West 2 ̆ 7 s most complex and contentious environmental issue. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers {{approximately}} 245 {{million acres}} of our public lands and yet, {{for most of our}} nation 2 ̆ 7 s history, these lands seemed largely destined to end up in private hands. Even when the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 ushered in an important era of better managing public grazing districts and 2 ̆ 2 promoting the highest use of the public lands, 2 ̆ 2 such use of our public lands still was plainly considered temporary, 2 ̆ 2 pending its final disposal. 2 ̆ 2 It was not until 1976 {{with the passage of the}} Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) that congress adopted a policy that the 2 ̆ 2 public lands be retained in Federal ownership. 2 ̆ 2 In the 40 years since Congress enacted FLPMA, the BLM has experienced a remarkable transformation from an agency once focusing almost entirely on livestock grazing and mineral development to one that has fully embraced a multiple use mandate [...] including managing large tracts of public lands for conservation and even wilderness protection purposes. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s prominent environmental or natural resources laws, within the last few years, have celebrated their 40 th anniversaries, often provoking critical dialogues about their past and future.

40|$|Generations of {{scholarship}} {{on the political}} economy of land use have tried to explain a world in which tony suburbs use zoning to keep out development but big cities allow untrammeled growth because of the political influence of developers. But as demand to live in them has increased, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s biggest cities have substantially limited development. Although developers remain important players in city politics, we have not seen enough growth in the housing supply in many cities to keep prices from skyrocketing. This Article seeks to explain this change with a story about big-city land use that places the legal regime governing land-use decisions at its center. In the absence of strong local political parties, land-use laws that set the voting procedure in local legislatures determine policy results between cycling preferences. Specifically, the Standard Zoning Enabling Act (SZEA) creates a peculiar procedure that privileges the intense preferences of local residents opposed to new building. Amendments to zoning maps are considered one-by-one, making deals across projects and neighborhoods difficult. Legislators may prefer to allow some building rather to stopping it everywhere, but are most concerned that their districts not bear the brunt of the negative externalities associated with new development. Absent deals that link zoning changes in different neighborhoods, all legislators will work to stop the zoning amendments that effect their districts. Without a strong party leadership to whip votes into line, the preferences of legislators about projects in their districts dominate and building is restricted everywhere. Further, the seriatim nature of local land-use procedure results in frequent downzonings, as big developers do not have an incentive to fight reductions in the ability of landowners to build incremental additions to the housing stock as of right. The cost of moving amendments through the land-use process means that small developers cannot overcome the burdens imposed by downzonings. The Article concludes by considering several forms of legislative process reform that mimic procedural changes Congress adopted in order to pass international trade treaties...|$|E

40|$|Hamdan v. Rumsfeld {{is a rare}} Supreme Court rebuke to the President during armed conflict. The time is not yet {{right to}} tell all of the backstory of the case, but it is {{possible}} to offer some preliminary reflections on how the case was litigated, the decision, and its implications for the oft-noticed divide between legal theory and practice. In a widely cited article, Judge Harry Edwards lamented 2 ̆ 2 the growing disjunction between legal education and the legal profession, 2 ̆ 2 claiming that 2 ̆ 2 many law schools. [...] have abandoned their proper place, by emphasizing abstract theory at the expense of practical scholarship and pedagogy. 2 ̆ 2 This observation is truer today than when Judge Edwards penned those words in 1992. Perhaps fueled by an intense desire to move up in published law school rankings, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s leading law schools have ramped up course offerings and the number of faculty members devoted to legal theory while disparaging practitioners. Like any excluded group, practitioners have begun disparaging the theoreticians in return. We are witnessing {{one of the most significant}} developments in the history of American law: the majority of professors on many law faculties are now specializing in areas that are of no obvious relevance to their students 2 ̆ 7 activities upon graduation. This Comment uses Hamdan to illustrate why the disparagement of theory is partially wrong. By examining the litigation of the case, it demonstrates some of the benefits of theory to practice. At least three different theoretical tools were involved in Hamdan: (1) psychological research on framing effects and bias toward compromise; (2) theoretical inquiry into the timing of Supreme Court litigation and the 2 ̆ 2 passive virtues 2 ̆ 2; and (3) economic analysis of penalty default rules and political science research on the veto.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s largest law firms have {{converted}} from single-tier to two-tier (or multi-tier) partnerships. A two-tier firm contains separate tracks for equity and nonequity partner. The equity tier typically controls {{the firm and}} enjoys a larger per capita share of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profits. At present, two-tier partnerships make up 80 percent of Am Law 200. The conventional explanation {{for the growth of}} the two-tier system (or, conversely, the abandonment of the single-tier) is that it produces higher profits per equity partner (PPP), thus solidifying the prestige of the firm and improving its ability to attract the best legal talent. Drawing upon a comprehensive dataset of Am Law 200 firms, this study documents that average PPP is significantly higher in single-tier firms, even after controlling for geographic market segment and firm leverage. The higher profitability of single-tier firms appears to be a function of higher levels of reputational capital, which enable single-tier firms to (a) attract and retain a more lucrative client base, and (b) run a more rigorous promotion-to-partnership tournament. Based upon a ten-year longitudinal sample, this study also found negligible statistical evidence that the two-tier structure, after controlling for relative starting position and geographic market, is associated with larger gains in PPP. In light of its uncertain financial benefits, the author theorizes that the two-tier structure is primarily a bonding mechanism used by less prestigious firms to institutionalize a marginal product method of partnership compensation and consolidate managerial control {{for the benefit of the}} firm 2 ̆ 7 s most powerful partners. Failure to switch to the two-tier structure leaves the firm vulnerable to defections and possible collapse. As a result, the primary economic benefit of the two-tier format may be firm stability rather than higher average PPP. Finally, this study provides some evidence that the appeal of permanent nonequity partnership status, which typically entails fewer professional demands, may set in a motion an adverse selection problem at the associate recruitment level, thus undermining some of the perceived benefits of a two-tier (or multi-tier) format...|$|E
40|$|The Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden {{is pleased}} to present The Visual Culture of PRAIRIE SCHOONER, an {{exhibition}} of forty images {{from the pages of}} one of the more distinguished literary magazines in the country. Celebrating its seventy-fifth year of publication, the Prairie Schooner almost from the outset became a much sought after venue for the publication of poems, short fiction, criticism, and personal essays for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s important and soon-to-be important writers. This exhibition explores the role that visual imagery has played in this important and influential magazine. If, as Henry Rago asserts, 2 ̆ 2 a literary magazine is a form of conversation, 2 ̆ 2 visual imagery has participated in and facilitated this conversation. Of the many important functions they serve, 2 ̆ 2 little magazines 2 ̆ 2 articulate and sustain creative communities. And visual imagery has played a subtle but nonetheless important role in building and maintaining a loyal and committed community of readers. No doubt these readers will be surprised that visual imagery has played any role whatsoever in Prairie Schooner, much less that it might actually possess something even remotely resembling a 2 ̆ 2 visual culture. 2 ̆ 2 But it does. The intimate and complex relationship between the word and image is an important, but often unrecognized, part of the history of modern art. 2 Throughout the 20 th century, the manifesto and the artist 2 ̆ 7 s statement developed almost simultaneously with the emergence of a visual art that transcended language. Everywhere modern visual art is, language is close by. And, as this exhibition will show, everywhere language is, there will be visual imagery lurking somewhere. It might not be prominent, but it is there and thus worth taking seriously. From the perspective of visual and material culture, Prairie Schooner is much {{more than the sum of}} its literary contents.

40|$|Books on the U. S. {{military}} in the trans-Mississippi West abound. Yet surprisingly, no comprehensive study of the familiar but exotic Indian scouts has been published. Thomas W. Dunlay 2 ̆ 7 s work sets out to fill this void {{and is on the}} whole very successful. Dunlay approaches his subject in an analytic, thematic manner. He has a set of questions that frame the central chapters of his book. In general, he wants to understand why the U. S. military chose to include Indians in its western service and how these Indians were used. In addition, he seeks to understand the Indian point-of-view, the dynamics behind choosing to serve and, on occasion, choosing to fight against fellow tribesmen. Dunlay uncovers diverse explanations, but he does not hesitate to draw some important conclusions. Assessing military attitudes toward the scouts, he believes, 2 ̆ 2 The more closely an officer 2 ̆ 7 s mental world was confined to the army and the more obvious military values, the less likely he was to appreciate Indian allies 2 ̆ 2 (p. 68). Effective white leaders for the scouts had to respect the Indian 2 ̆ 2 way of doing things 2 ̆ 2 (p. 107). As for the Indians, intratribal rivalries as well as intertribal animosities explain a willingness to serve on the white side. In some cases, this service represented a vital military alliance against a powerful native adversary. Beyond these intercultural military matters, Dunlay 2 ̆ 7 s book raises questions that are not answered. Dunlay sees the scouts 2 ̆ 7 often informal service as partial assimilation on Indian terms. If such is the case, then this reader would like {{to know more about the}} role of the scouts in their own tribes. Did scouts become the Indian police on the reservation? Did they become another type of vital intermediary like linguistic interpreters and Christian converts? In other words, what importance do these Indian scouts have within their own Indian societies during and after the thirty-year period of warfare examined in the book? In addition, a broader analysis of the perception and appreciation of the military within post-Civil War American society would be helpful. Dunlay rightly recognizes the humanitarian interest of many military officers toward the Indians. These military figures often felt they could do better in 2 ̆ 2 civilizing 2 ̆ 2 the Indians than could civilian government officials. Indeed, service as scouts was pointed out as one way toward Indian advancement. Yet, late nineteenth-century America did not view its own present-or the Indians 2 ̆ 7 future- 2 ̆ 2 civilization 2 ̆ 2 as a process of 2 ̆ 2 militarization. 2 ̆ 2 Why this rejection of the military way when <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> 2 ̆ 7 s heroes were military figures, some of whom fought in the West with Indian scouts at their side? Dunlay 2 ̆ 7 s thorough research and thoughtful analysis in this book show that he is the scholar who can attempt answers to these other questions as well...|$|E
