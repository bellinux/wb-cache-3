2500|$|The City of California was {{established}} in 1834. The seat of justice of <b>Moniteau</b> <b>County</b> was originally known as Boonesborough. When <b>Moniteau</b> <b>County</b> was organized in 1845, {{it was decided that}} Boonsborough would become the county seat. Because the county court was unwilling to pay for land in Boonsborough, a site was selected one-mile (1.6km) west and this would become the new county seat. In 1846, the Post Office required a new name [...] to be selected for Boonsborough since there was already a Boonsborough in Missouri. The city was renamed California on January 25, 1847 for the territory on the West Coast that was just then drawing attention due to progress of the overland railroad. That same year, a courthouse was erected on the square.|$|E
