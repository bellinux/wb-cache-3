40|$|Processing {{optimization}} is {{an important}} means to inhibit manufacturing defects efficiently. However, processing optimization used by experiments or macroscopic theories in high-speed automated fiber placement (AFP) suffers from some restrictions, because multiscale effect of laying tows and their manufacturing defects could not be considered. In this paper, processing parameters, including compaction force, laying speed, and preheating temperature, are optimized by multiscale collaborative optimization in AFP process. Firstly, rational model between cracks and strain energy is revealed in order that the formative possibility of cracks could be assessed by using strain energy or its density. Following that, an antisequential hierarchical multiscale collaborative optimization method is presented to resolve multiscale effect of structure and <b>mechanical</b> properties for <b>laying</b> tows or cracks in high-speed automated fiber placement process. According to the above method and taking carbon fiber/epoxy tow as an example, multiscale <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>laying</b> tow under different processing parameters are investigated through simulation, which includes recoverable strain energy (ALLSE) of macroscale, strain energy density (SED) of mesoscale, and interface absorbability and matrix fluidity of microscale.

40|$|Supramolecular polymer {{networks}} {{consist of}} macromolecules that are cross linked by transient physical interactions such as hydrogen bonding or transition metal complexation. The utility of these networks {{is based on}} their <b>mechanical</b> properties, which <b>lay</b> between those of permanent networks and that of mechanically entangled, viscoelastic polymer solutions, depending {{on the strength of}} transient chain cross linking. To benefit from this interplay, it is necessary to understand it. To promote this understanding, we use a modular toolkit to form supramolecular polymer networks that exhibit greatly varying strength of transient chain cross linking but that are all derived from the very same precursor polymer. This strategy allows the impact of the strength of transient chain cross linking on the network dynamics and mechanics to be studied with high consistency. We follow this approach to evaluate the diffusive mobility of labeled tracer chains within these transient networks. Our results reveal that the concentration dependence of the tracer chain diffusivity is in agreement with theoretical predictions derived from the sticky reptation model by Rubinstein and Semenov, provided the chain association is stronger than a certain threshol...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we address}} a {{particular}} {{flavor of the}} motion planning problem, that is, the gait generation problem for underactuated variable inertia mechanical systems. Additionally, we analyze a rather general type of mechanical systems which we refer to as mixed systems. What is unique about this type of mechanical system is that both non-holonomic velocity constraints as well as instantaneous conservation of the generalized momentum variables defined along the allowable motion direction completely specify the systems velocity. By analyzing this general type of <b>mechanical</b> systems, we <b>lay</b> the grounds for a general and intuitive analysis of the gait generation problem. Through our approach, we provide a novel framework not only for classifying different types of mechanical systems, but also for identifying a partition on the space of allowable gaits. By applying our techniques to mixed systems which according to our classification are the most general type of mechanical systems, we verify the generality and applicability of our approach. Moreover, mixed systems yield the richest family of allowable gaits, hence, superseding the gait generation problem for other simpler types of mechanical systems. Finally, we apply our analysis to a novel mechanical system, the variable inertia snakeboard, which is a generalization of the original snakeboard that was previously studied in the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamical}} integrity, a {{new concept}} proposed by J. M. T. Thompson, and developed by the authors, is used to interpret experimental results. After reviewing the main issues involved in this analysis, including the proposal of a new integrity measure able to capture in an easy way the safe part of basins, attention is dedicated to two experiments, a rotating pendulum and a micro-electro-mechanical system, where the theoretical predictions are not fulfilled. These mechanical systems, the former at the macro-scale and the latter at the micro-scale, permit a comparative analysis of different mechanical and dynamical behaviours. The fact that {{in both cases the}} dynamical integrity permits one to justify the difference between experimental and theoretical results, which is the main achievement of this paper, shows the effectiveness of this new approach and suggests its use in practical situations. The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes the middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy (science); for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and <b>mechanical</b> experiments and <b>lay</b> up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and digested. Therefore, from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never been made), much may be hoped. (Francis Bacon 1561 - 1626) But are we sure of our observational facts? Scientific men are rather fond of saying pontifically that one ought to be quite sure of one's observational facts before embarking on theory. Fortunately those who give this advice do not practice what they preach. Observation and theory get on best when they are mixed together, both helping one another in the pursuit of truth. It is a good rule not to put overmuch confidence in a theory until it has been confirmed by observation. I hope I shall not shock the experimental physicists too much if I add that it is also a good rule not to put overmuch confidence in the observational results that are put forward until they have been confirmed by theory.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of chemical reactions under mechanical stress {{has been known}} since {{the earliest days of}} polymer science. Once limited to the simple scission of polymer chains, mechanical force can now be used to produce a wide array of productive chemistry. The development of so-called "covalent mechanochemistry," has allowed chemists to challenge and support classically held models of chemical reactivity, impacting both synthetic chemistry and material science. This work aims to develop molecular tools that respond to stress and explore the mechanisms behind that response. While a wide-range of fields may be impacted, the overall inspiration for the work herein is the development of materials with rich and robust molecular responses to otherwise destructive forces. To this end we focus on: (a) developing new mechanochemically reactive organic molecules (mechanophores) that undergo constructive covalent transformations in linear polymers under stress; (b) probing the nature of force transduction across length scales, from bulk (macroscopic) to microscopic stress, in networks thus informing material design; (c) constructing systems that reversibly amplify mechanochemical signals via catalysis. 	Force induced transformations of polymer bound mechanophores have the potential to produce a rich array of stress responsive behavior. One area of interest is the activation of non-scissile mechanophores in which latent reactivity can be unveiled. Under the appropriate conditions, this new reactivity could lead to constructive bond formation, and potentially a pathway to mechanochemical stress strengthening. In chapter 2, the mechanical activation of a bicyclo[3. 2. 0]heptane (BCH) mechanophore is demonstrated via selective labeling of bis-enone products. BCH ring-opening, via a formal [2 + 2] cycloreversion, produces large local elongation (> 4 Å) and products that are reactive to Michael-type additions under mild conditions. Subsequent photocyclization regenerates the initial BCH functionality, providing switchable structure and reactivity along the polymer backbone in response to stress and visible light. 	In chapter 3, the [2 + 2] cycloreversion of cyclobutane mechanophores is further explored through the development of bicyclo[4. 2. 0]octane (BCO) mechanophores. Using carbodiimide polyesterification, BCO units were incorporated into high molecular weight polymers containing up to 700 mechanophores per polymer chain. Under exposure to the otherwise destructive elongational forces of pulsed ultrasound, these mechanophores unravel by ~ 7 Å per monomer unit to form unsaturated esters that react constructively via nucleophilic thiol-ene conjugate addition to form sulfide functionalized copolymers and cross-linked polymer networks. The wide variety of possible product stereochemistry provided an opportunity to probe the dynamics of the mechanochemical ring opening. A series of bicyclo[4. 2. 0]octane derivatives that varied in stereochemistry, substitution, and symmetry were synthesized and activated. Product stereochemistry was analyzed by conventional NMR and chromatographic means, which enabled inquiry into the mechanism of the mechanochemical [2 + 2] cycloreversion. These results support that the ring opening is not concerted, but proceeds via a 1, 4 diradical intermediate. Additionally, insight is provided into the 1, 4 -diradical dynamics prior to product formation. 	We next turn our attention to the molecular level responses of polymer materials under macroscopic stress. Hydrogels and organogels made from polymer networks are widely used in biomedical applications and soft, active devices for which the ability to sustain large deformations is required. The strain at which polymer networks fracture is typically improved through the addition of elements that dissipate energy, often strong, yet reversible interactions. The result is often tougher materials, resulting from both greater nominal strains and elastic moduli. These materials require extra work to achieve a desired level of deformation, however, {{there is little evidence that}} large amounts of energy dissipation is required to achieve greater nominal strains. In chapter 4, we show that the addition of mechanically "invisible" supramolecular crosslinks causes substantial increases in the ultimate gel properties without incurring the added energetic costs of dissipation. We then incorporated a chemiluminescent stress-sensor, the bis(adamantyl) dioxetane covalent cross-linker, first developed in the Sijbesma group, which emits light in the event of covalent bond scission. In these experiments we demonstrate that the occurrence of macroscopic failure (from stress-strain curves) coincides with the molecular level failure of the underlying covalent network. 	Finally, in chapter 5, we turn our attention to the development of mechanocatalytic systems. By activating or otherwise altering the activity of a catalyst using force, a single mechanochemical event may be amplified (i. e. by catalyst turnover). Such systems have been previously reported in the form of force-activated polymer bound transition metal complexes. Beyond these on/off systems, we imagine that force may be used to tune catalyst selectivity, via the perturbation of ligand geometry. Here, we report a catalyst that couples a photoswitch to the biaryl backbone of a chiral bis(phosphine) ligand, thus allowing photochemical manipulation of ligand geometry without significantly altering the electronic structure. The changes in catalyst activity and selectivity upon switching can be attributed to intramolecular <b>mechanical</b> forces, <b>laying</b> the foundation for a new class of catalysts whose selectivity can be varied smoothly and in situ over a useful range by controlling molecular stress experienced by the catalyst during turnover. Forces on the order of 100 pN are generated, leading to measureable changes in the enantioselectivities of asymmetric Heck arylations and Trost allylic alkylations. Dissertatio...|$|R
