40|$|International audienceNew {{chemical}} kinetic reaction {{mechanisms are}} developed {{for two of}} the five major components of biodiesel fuel, <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and methyl oleate. The mechanisms are produced using existing reaction classes and rules for reaction rates, with additional reaction classes to describe other reactions unique to methyl ester species. Mechanism capabilities were examined by computing fuel/air autoignition delay times and comparing the results with more conventional hydrocarbon fuels for which experimental results are available. Additional comparisons were carried out with measured results taken from jet-stirred reactor experiments for rapeseed oil methyl ester fuels. In both sets of computational tests, methyl oleate was found to be slightly less reactive than <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate,</b> and an explanation of this observation is made showing that the double bond in methyl oleate inhibits certain low temperature chain branching reaction pathways important in <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate.</b> The resulting detailed chemical kinetic reaction mechanism includes more approximately 3500 chemical species and more than 17, 000 chemical reactions...|$|E

The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the structure modification of palm oil to cocoa butter equivalent using Carica papaya lipase –catalyzed interesterification. The study showed that the compositions of cocoa butter equivalent were affected by acyl donor sources, substrate ratio, initial water of enzyme, reaction time, reaction temperature and the amount of enzyme. Among three acyl donors tested (<b>methyl</b> <b>stearate,</b> ethyl stearate and stearic acid), <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> appeared to be the best acyl donor for incorporation to palm oil structure. The best reaction conditions for cocoa butter equivalent production were: substrate ratio (palm oil: <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate,</b> mol/mol) at 1 : 4, water activity of enzyme at 0. 11, reaction time at 4 h, reaction temperature at 45 � C and 18 % by weight of the enzyme. The chemical and physical properties of cocoa butter equivalent were 9. 75 ± 0. 41 % free fatty acid, 44. 89 ± 0. 84 iodine number, 193. 19 ± 0. 78 sponification value and melting point at 37 - 39 � C.

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is to find, solve and characterise polymorphs of <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and methyl palmitate, which are the two major {{compounds}} that have prevented {{the widespread use of}} biodiesel. Biodiesel is traditionally derived from biomass containing high percentages of triglycerides, which are converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). High melting point saturated FAMEs produce the same poor low temperature flow properties experienced with petroleum diesel. For many years additives have been designed for petroleum diesel to reduce the cold flow problems; however these are not structurally selective for FAMEs. The most common compounds in biodiesel which cause cold flow problems are <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and methyl palmitate; therefore accurate crystal structures for all polymorphs that may crystallise in the fuel should be found, to design additives which are structurally selective for these compounds. Throughout this thesis powder x-ray and neutron diffraction were used in conjunction with Gaussian dipole calculations, to characterise the polymorphs of <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and methyl palmitate and their interactions with 5 straight chain n-alkanes.

40|$|The {{interest}} in plant sterols enriched foods has recently enhanced {{due to their}} healthy properties. The influence of the unsaturation degree of different fatty acids <b>methyl</b> esters (FAME: <b>stearate,</b> oleate, linoletate and linolenate) on a mixture of three plant sterols (PS: campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol) was evaluated at 180 °C for up to 180 min. Sterols degraded slower {{in the presence of}} unsaturated FAME. Both PS and FAME degradation fit a first order kinetic model (R 2 > 0. 9). Maximum oxysterols concentrations were achieved at 20 min in neat PS and 120 min in lipid mixtures and this maximum amount decreased with increasing their unsaturation degree. In conclusion, the presence of FAME delayed PS degradation and postponed oxysterols formation. This protective effect was further promoted by increasing the unsaturation degree of FAME. This evidence could help industries to optimize the formulation of sterol-enriched products, so that they could maintain their healthy properties during cooking or processing...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} solution behaviour and crystallisation kinetics of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is presented. The systems studied are: methyl palmitate, <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and their binary mixtures in dodecane and methyl oleate solvents. Fractionation behaviour in palm methyl ester, soybean methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester fuel is also studied. Two principal techniques are employed in this work, i. e. turbidometric analysis of solutions during polythermal cycles and the gas chromatography analysis of solution supernatants {{as a function of}} temperature. The foundations of these two studied have been laid via the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the solid-state forms of methyl palmitate and <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> crystallised from solution. No evidence is found to suggest that the <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and methyl palmitate binary mixtures crystallise from methyl oleate solvent as a solid solution and no shift in the XRD patterns generated, i. e. no transition in solid state form crystallised is observed for the conditions under which solutions are crystallised. It is found that solution behaviour for methyl palmitate, <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and their binary mixtures in both solvents is in negative deviation to ideality, with the pure solutes being the more deviated in comparison to the binary mixtures. Eutectic points are discovered at a composition of 75 mol% C 16 : 0 in the C 16 : 0 I C 18 : 0 binary mixture crystallisation from both solvents. Metastable zone widths (MSZW) are larger for both solutes in the methyl oleate solvent (6 - 9. 50 C) as compared to dodecane (3 - 6. 5 oC) and MSZWs are significantly smaller at the 100 mI scale, being about half those at the 1 ml scale. Nucleation rates for both solutes and their binary mixtures are about 2 - 13 k gilimin over a 100 - 250 g/l concentration range in both solvents. From the palm methyl ester and its blends with soy methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester only C 16 : 0 is found to crystallise at the cloud points. A thermodynamic model for methyl palmitate and <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> solubilities in methyl oleate solvent predicts the fractionation behaviour in the blended fuels satisfactorily but less well in the pure palm methyl ester.

40|$|Wax {{formation}} in diesel and biodiesel fuels at low temperatures {{is one of}} the major problems faced by the fuels industry as crystallisation of the saturated compounds present in these solutions can plug up filters and obstruct pipelines. Preventing wax {{formation in}} these multicomponent mixtures requires a good understanding of the crystallisation behaviour of both n-alkanes and Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs). This work studies solutions of methyl palmitate and stearate in representative mixtures of diesel fuels and unsaturated esters solvents, providing an overall assessment of their solubility and nucleation kinetics. An in-depth analysis of the growth kinetics and crystal morphology for <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> crystallising from n-dodecane, kerosene and toluene solvents is also presented. To perform this study methodologies are developed for the assessment of nucleation kinetics and morphological indexation of crystal specific faces. Models for the analysis of crystal growth kinetics are also derived. These describe the effect in series of the diffusion of growth units within the bulk of the solution and a rate of incorporation of these units which is associated to the molecular structure of the crystal faces´ surface. It was found that the solubility and crystallisation kinetics of methyl palmitate and stearate is very dependent on the solution environment in particular solvent type. Solubilities are higher in solvents whose molecules have more compact structures, such as in the case of toluene and methyl-cyclohexane and are lower in unsaturated methyl ester type solvents. The nucleation process in these systems is found to be much more thermodynamically controlled in the case of diesel type solvents and show a greater kinetic influence in the case of unsaturated methyl esters solvents. The growth kinetics of <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> crystals is found to be strongly associated to the level of solvation of these solutes molecules as well as to the chemical structure of the crystal-solution interface. Accordingly, the rate limiting step is suggested to be the integration of growth units to the surface of the crystal in the case of <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> growing from n-dodecane solvent, and more diffusional controlled in the case of <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> growing from kerosene and toluene solvents. The morphology of <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> crystals however is not found to be strongly influenced by solvent type, only showing changes as a function of supersaturation in the case of kerosene solvent. ...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that covalent binding of reactive metabolites to liver membrane constituents {{may be responsible for}} the hepatoxicity of carbon tetrachloride. This study demonstrates that trichloromethyl free radical is the major reductive metabolite of carbon tetrachloride by cytochrome P- 450 and that this free radical is capable of binding to double bonds of fatty acyl chains of the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding cytochrome P- 450. The structural identification of the reactive free radical metabolite and the product of its addition to phospholipids was accomplished by use of a reconstituted system of human cytochromes P- 450, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase, and cytochrome b 5 in phospholipid vesicles. The reconstituted vesicles contained a mixture of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and egg phosphatidylethanolamine that served as both structural components and targets for trichloromethyl free radical binding. After incubation of these vesicles under a N 2 atmosphere in the presence of NADPH with 14 CCl 4, the phospholipids were extracted and then separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine fraction was transesterified and the resulting single 14 C-labeled fatty acid methyl ester was purified by reverse-phase chromatography.

Although the content of phospholipids was not changed by treatment, free cholesterol (130 %) and cholesterol esters (400 %) were increased in liver surface membrane fractions. These observations correlate with changes in membrane viscosity, as shown by electron spin resonance probes. Both rotational correlation time, using the isotropic probe <b>methyl</b> (12 -nitroxyl) <b>stearate,</b> and the order parameter, determined by the anisotropic probe 5 -nitroxylstearic acid, were significantly increased in liver surface membrane fractions from rats treated with ethinyl estradiol. Administration of Triton WR- 1339, a nonionic detergent that corrects hepatic and serum lipid changes caused by ethinyl estradiol treatment, restored toward normal elevated membrane lipids and viscosity as well as Na+,K+-ATPase activity and bile flow. Although restoration of normal liver surface membrane structure and function {{may be due to}} reversal of abnormal lipid composition, detergents also may directly alter membrane enzyme activity. Addition of Triton WR- 1339 in vitro increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity and reduced membrane viscosity of surface membranes from rats treated with ethinyl estradiol.

Molecular cluster modelling work has been explored to study the effect of additives on crystallization temperature, meta-stable zone width and solubility. A new method has been developed for the prediction of crystallisability through the comparison of structural variability of molecular clusters of pure naphthalene, pure biphenyl, and naphthalene in the presence of biphenyl and vice versa.

40|$|International audienceA {{detailed}} chemical kinetic {{reaction mechanism}} is {{developed for the}} five major components of soy biodiesel and rapeseed biodiesel fuels. These components, <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate,</b> methyl oleate, methyl linoleate, methyl linolenate, and methyl palmitate, are large methyl ester molecules, some with carbon-carbon double bonds, and kinetic mechanisms for them as a family of fuels have not previously been available. Of particular importance in these mechanisms are models for alkylperoxy radical isomerization reactions in which a C=C double bond {{is embedded in the}} transition state ring. The resulting kinetic model is validated through comparisons between predicted results and a relatively small experimental literature. The model is also used in simulations of biodiesel oxidation in jet-stirred reactor and intermediate shock tube ignition and oxidation conditions to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of these mechanisms. Differences in combustion properties between the two biodiesel fuels, derived from soy and rapeseed oils, are traced to the differences in the relative amounts of the same five methyl ester components...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study in vitro antibacterial activity of 4 strains of Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola (Bga) against G+ve Bacillus megaterium and G−ve Escherichia coli, haemolytic activity against the cell membrane of erythrocytes, the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and finally, the pathogenicity against Agaricus bisporus flesh blocks. Chemical structure of bioactive substances of the most bioactive strain (ICMP 11096) was established using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). All the studied Bga strains inhibited {{the growth of the}} two tested bacteria although some growing substrates negatively influenced the antimicrobial substance production. The same Bga strains showed highly haemolytic activity and were able to produce 3 hydrolytic enzymes, i. e. chitinase, glucanase and protease. In pathogenicity assays, the considered Bga strains resulted virulent for A. bisporus. The GC–MS for compounds from Bga ICMP 11096 were compatible with the structure of two bioactive fatty acids identified as <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate</b> and ethanol 2 -butoxy phosphate with mass spectrum m/e 298 and 398, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This work {{investigated}} {{the suitability of}} biodiesel (predominantly Methyl Linolenate, Methyl Palmitate, Methyl Oleate and <b>Methyl</b> <b>Stearate)</b> as an absorbent for the recovery of VOCs from waste gas process streams through absorption. The objective was to predict the vapour liquid equilibria (VLE) data {{in the form of}} infinite dilution activity coefficients for five VOC families, in fatty acid methyl ester solvents at varying temperature. The Original Universal Functional Group Activity Coefficient (UNIFAC) model (Fredenslund et al., 1975) [1], Modified UNIFAC (Larsen et al., 1981) [2] and Modified UNIFAC (Bastos et al., 1988) [3] was used to predict the required phase equilibrium. Alkanes, alcohols and acids/ester interactions showed an increase in activity coefficients with increase in temperature. The influence of temperature on the activity coefficients for alkene and amine families was negligible. The solubility of VOCs in biodiesel decreases with increase in ester hydrocarbon unsaturation. The solubility of VOCs increased with increase in ester molecular weight...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{investigation}} of the methanolic extract of the ascidian Didemnum psammatodes {{has led to the}} identification of fourteen known compounds: three methyl esters (methyl myristate, methyl palmitate and <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate),</b> four steroids (cholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol), two fatty acids (palmitic acid and stearic acid), three glyceryl ethers {(1, 2 -propanediol, 3 -(heptadecyloxy), batyl alcohol and 1, 2 -propanediol, 3 -[(methyloctadecyl) oxy]) and two nucleosides (thymidine and 2 `-deoxyguanosine). Their structures were proposed by NMR and comparison with literature data and GC analysis in comparison with authentic sample. The cytotoxic activity of these compounds was evaluated against human leukemia cell line panel using the MTT assay. The mixture of the three methyl esters was the most active group of compounds, showing antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. Further studies on their mode of action suggest that these activities are connected with inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of both necrosis and apoptosis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Biofuels are an {{important}} alternative to environmental sustainability, and biodiesel has a detached contribution to this scenario. The increasing use of biodiesel requires the knowledge of several thermophysical properties of this biofuel. This work addresses the measurements {{of the speed of}} sound and density at atmospheric pressure of five fatty acid methyl esters (methyl caprylate, methyl caprate, methyl palmitate, <b>methyl</b> <b>stearate,</b> and methyl linoleate). These data are used to test Wada's group contribution method recently proposed by us and its ability to predict the speed of sound of biodiesel fuels and to expand the application of this model to the prediction of the speed of sound of biodiesel fuels. The overall average relative deviations (OARD) obtained were 0. 12 % for the methyl esters and 0. 29 % for biodiesels. An extension of this model to high pressures is also proposed and tested with success, presenting an OARD of 1. 0 % for six biodiesel fuels...|$|E
