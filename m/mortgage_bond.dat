25|$|The US <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bond</b> Building is a nine-story office {{building}} faced with gray limestone and brick. The building {{was constructed in}} 1924-25 for the United States <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bond</b> Company, organized ten years earlier in 1915. The design mixes Italian palazzo, Neoclassical, and Renaissance Revival influences. The lower three stories of the building are finished in broad courses of limestone; the upper floors, finished in smoother limestone, are separated from the lower by a cornice. There are five window bays on the Shelby facade and six on the Congress facade. At {{some point in the}} middle 20th century, a pedestrian bridge was built connecting the building to the State Savings Bank across the street.|$|E
25|$|The bank offered {{loans to}} income-producing manor owners (about 70–80% of total loans) or {{property}} owners in cities. Long-term loans were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers {{had to pay}} the interest to <b>mortgage</b> <b>bond</b> holders plus 1% administrative fee to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the long-term loans varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The loan terms for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912–1914) opted for the longest possible loans. Short-term loans, for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value.|$|E

It had a series of recessions and terraces beginning at the sixteenth story which culminate in a tower. Its steel skeleton was interior, lacking the corner columns that were present in other buildings of the time. It had a brick exterior that was deep purple in its lower stories gradually growing lighter in color until at the top a faint lavender blended into pure white. Harvey Wiley Corbett said the coloration gave the skyscraper a [...] "feeling of growth." [...] He said, [...] "this colored brick exterior, which rises from a low, dark ground to a gleaming, white pinnacle, gives the building a dynamic quality. The play of sunlight on the many hues will make the building a beautiful spectacle of changing colors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{plans of}} {{reorganization}} were put forth {{before the end}} of 1880. The first came from the McCalmont faction; the second from a former vice president of the Reading; and the third from Franklin Gowen. The McCalmont plan would have given preferred protection to senior <b>mortgage</b> <b>bond</b> holders and also would have put a levy upon stockholders, US$15 per share, towards substantially paying down floating debt. The second plan did away with the levy—heavily objected to by American shareholders—but was contingent for success upon the Reading's preferred stock being worth roughly four times its current trading value. The third plan was put forth by Franklin Gowen in the context of known contemplation by the English bondholders of exercising their right of foreclosure against the Reading. Gowen's plan called for receivership to last for five years, for which time he projected increasingly improved business performance, reduction of fixed expenses to a manageable level, and liquidation of floating debt by the selling off of assets and/or conversion into preferred stock. This plan, as put forth to the McCalmonts, was accompanied by Gowen's offer to step aside as receiver. The English faction agreed to a plan very close to Gowen's, but with the stipulation that Gowen should indeed be replaced as receiver by someone not involved in the corporation's management prior to the bankruptcy. Gowen backpedaled vigorously.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{mortgage}} credit growth experienced {{in recent years}} in mature and emerging countries has raised some stability concerns. Many European credit institutions in mature markets have reacted by increasing securitization, particularly via <b>mortgage</b> covered <b>bonds.</b> From the issuer''s perspective, these instruments have become an attractive funding source and a tool for assetliability management; from the investor''s perspective, covered bonds enjoy a favorable risk-return profile and a very liquid market. In this paper, we examine the two largest "jumbo" covered bond markets, Germany and Spain. We show how movements in covered bond prices can be used to analyze the credit developments of the underlying issuer and the quality of its mortgage portfolio. Our analysis also suggests that <b>mortgage</b> covered <b>bonds</b> could be of interest to other mature and emerging markets facing similar risks related to {{mortgage credit}}.
