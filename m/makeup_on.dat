25|$|Biba's layout was {{innovative}} and {{was set to}} enhance the clothes rather than just to hold them. The clothes were also displayed in an unusual manner, from the beginning hanging on coat stands. Since coat stands can not hold a lot of clothes many were needed. Fitz shopped for them all year round, {{so that he could}} secure as many as they needed in the store, while ordering hundreds more. Biba was also the first store that let customers try makeup before buying it. This started an unusual routine; women came to Biba before work with no <b>makeup</b> <b>on,</b> put it on in the store and then rushed to work.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil {{would not be able to}} be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E

500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue what I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} have the film open with the statement [...] "Hell is a teenage girl" [...] to reflect the [...] "horrors" [...] of puberty and that [...] "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women". Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> her face. I always thought {{that was such a}} sad image. She's so vulnerable.

500|$|After Jones' {{death and}} their move in 1971 {{to the south}} of France as tax exiles, Jagger, {{along with the rest of}} the band, changed his look and style as the 1970s progressed. He also learned to play guitar and contributed guitar parts for certain songs on Sticky Fingers (1971) and all {{subsequent}} albums except Dirty Work in 1986. For the Rolling Stones' highly publicised 1972 American tour, Jagger wore glam-rock clothing and glittery <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> stage. Later in the decade they ventured into genres like disco and punk with the album Some Girls (1978). However, their interest in the blues had been made manifest in the 1972 album Exile on Main St.. Music critic Russell Hall has described Jagger's emotional singing on the gospel-influenced [...] "Let It Loose", one of the album's tracks, as Jagger's finest-ever vocal achievement.|$|E

A {{battered}} prostitute appears at Logan’s door and takes Wendy away, citing problems with their pimp, leaving Max heartbroken. Veronica finds a stain of purple <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> a towel, and she immediately deduces that Wendy conned Max out of $1,000. Veronica blackmails a judge {{in order to secure}} the $1,000 back. Veronica and Logan ask each other personal questions in an attempt to become more intimate, but it fails. At the bus locker at which Veronica instructed the judge to leave the money, she instead finds a note that tells Veronica and Max to get in a limo. In the limo, they find Wendy’s pimp, who is actually a woman. She tells them that she actually did fall in love with Max, but that she needed money for other reasons.|$|E

Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and <b>makeup</b> <b>on.</b> That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes."

500|$|The Beauty Process also {{contains}} heavier songs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous albums. The song [...] "Drama" [...] features a guitar solo played with a Micro Jammers' toy guitar. Sparks explained that she was getting frustrated with it, commenting [...] "Fuck it, I can't play these riffs, let the Micro Jammers do it for $1.99." [...] The song was described by Spin as [...] " [...] off like Helmet sans pretentious time signatures". The track [...] "Bad Things" [...] was described as [...] "a full-throttle blast of urban paranoia", while [...] "The Masses Are Asses" [...] deals with social outrage and rude humor. The album's title refers to two different things: the first part, [...] "The Beauty Process", is what Sparks would call [...] "putting my fright <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> before a show", while the second part, [...] "Triple Platinum", is a joke about L7's career as the band had yet to reach gold status.|$|E
500|$|Natural killer cells, or NK cells, are {{lymphocytes}} and {{a component}} of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes. [...] Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as [...] "missing self." [...] This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex) – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells. They were named [...] "natural killer" [...] because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are [...] "missing self." [...] For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of [...] "missing self". [...] Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.|$|E
500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E

500|$|According to Moss from MTV News, {{the video}} {{represents}} a [...] "literal take on somewhat abstract lyrics". It opens with shots of Lee playing the song on a piano at a snowy forest. At {{the start of}} the first verse, the band joins in, performing the song separately. Lee is seen lip-syncing the lyrics to the camera throughout; she dons a white dress, with light pale <b>makeup</b> <b>on</b> her face and a bright red lipstick. Later on, she is also shown laying down, as snow falls around her and the camera focuses on her face and expressions. As the song progresses to its final chorus, the singer is seen slowly walking towards a lake, as black petals start falling around her. During the song's last verse, she eventually submerges herself completely. Scenes of Lee in a black dress and singing the song while floating underwater are also interspersed throughout the entire clip. The music video was available online on November 27. Wind-up also released the video on the band's official website on the same day. The clip managed to peak at number four on TRL countdown list of the best music videos in January 2007. A behind-the-scenes clip from the filming set of the music video was posted on January 12, 2007 on the band's official YouTube channel.|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least she could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really had to do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the <b>makeup</b> <b>on.</b> During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E
