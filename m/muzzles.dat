5|$|Old skulls in the {{collection}} of the Natural History Museum in Bern demonstrate a diversity in head shapes. The collection proves at least two distinct variations during the same time period. The larger skulls have a greater pronounced stop with a shorter muzzle while the smaller skulls show a great deal less stop whilst having longer <b>muzzles.</b>|$|E
5|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is {{an emerging}} disease in North American bats which by 2012 {{was associated with}} at least 5-7 million bat deaths. The condition is named for a distinctive fungal growth around the <b>muzzles</b> and {{on the wings of}} hibernating bats and was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in Schoharie County, New York.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} skull length, the {{smallest}} subspecies {{of the blue}} wildebeest is the western white-bearded wildebeest. It is also the darkest subspecies, the eastern white-bearded wildebeest being the lightest race. Both these subspecies possess a creamy white beard, whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland wildebeest and the common wildebeest. The longest <b>muzzles</b> {{are found in the}} Nyassaland wildebeest, and the shortest in female western white-bearded wildebeest.|$|E

50|$|A <b>muzzle</b> shroud is {{a sleeve}} (either {{circular}} or otherwise) that extends beyond a weapon's <b>muzzle.</b> It {{is similar to}} a barrel shroud with the difference that it only surrounds {{the far end of the}} barrel known as a <b>muzzle.</b> It can be a <b>muzzle</b> extension or <b>muzzle</b> device.|$|R
50|$|The {{interchangeable}} terms <b>muzzle</b> rise, <b>muzzle</b> flip, or <b>muzzle</b> climb {{refer to}} the tendency of a handheld firearm's front end (the <b>muzzle</b> end of the barrel) to rise after firing.

5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the <b>muzzles</b> of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.|$|E
5|$|Their skulls {{are fairly}} narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their canine teeth are {{relatively}} long. Sexual dimorphism {{of the skull}} is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower <b>muzzles,</b> less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fruit bats, {{the vampire}} bats have short, conical <b>muzzles.</b> It also lacks a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with U-shaped grooves at the tip. The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, also has {{specialized}} thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating {{areas where the}} blood flows close to the skin of its prey. A nucleus {{has been found in}} the brain of vampire bats that has a similar position and similar histology to the infrared receptor of infrared-sensing snakes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Muzzle</b> (Frank Welker): A Rottweiler. <b>Muzzle</b> {{was once}} [...] "Scout", Professor Sheperd's dog that was kidnapped. He was never {{transformed}} into a Cano-sapien,but instead becoming aggressive due to Parvo's failed experiment on him. Due to this aggression, he is often restrained on a cart while wearing a straitjacket and mask. He serves as a “final attack” for the team. Whenever the Rovers feel they are outnumbers, Hunter takes off <b>Muzzle’s</b> straitjacket and mask, letting <b>Muzzle</b> jump in to attack on Hunter's command of “Let’s <b>Muzzle</b> ‘em!”. <b>Muzzle</b> and Hunter first meet when Parvo drops <b>Muzzle</b> off at an animal shelter, after having failed to turn <b>Muzzle</b> into a Cano-sapien.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{approximate}} {{model of}} the <b>muzzle</b> brake performance was set up and evaluated to simplify the analysis process. LHS(Latin Hypercube Sampling) and numerical simulation of inviscid <b>muzzle</b> flow field were applied to obtain some samples of the <b>muzzle</b> brake performance. The performance was weighted with the impact force on the <b>muzzle</b> brake. Then RSM(Response Surface Method) was adopted to get the approximate {{model of the}} <b>muzzle</b> brake performance to establish a mapping of <b>muzzle</b> brake shape parameters and the impact force. In the end GA(Genetic Algorithm) was applied to perform the optimization of the <b>muzzle</b> brake shape parameters with the approximate model...|$|R
5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer <b>muzzles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower <b>muzzles</b> and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more robust and less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader <b>muzzles</b> of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muzzle</b> flash is {{the visible}} {{light of a}} <b>muzzle</b> blast, which expels high temperature, high {{pressure}} gases from the <b>muzzle</b> of a firearm. The blast and flash are caused by the combustion products of the gunpowder, and any remaining unburned powder, mixing with the ambient air. The {{size and shape of}} the <b>muzzle</b> flash is dependent on the type of ammunition being used and the individual characteristics of firearm and any devices attached to the <b>muzzle</b> (such as a <b>muzzle</b> brake or flash suppressor).|$|R

50|$|A <b>muzzle</b> booster or recoil booster is {{a device}} {{affixed to the}} <b>muzzle</b> of a firearm, {{intended}} to harness {{the energy of the}} escaping propellant to augment the force of recoil on portions of the firearm. <b>Muzzle</b> boosters are usually used to improve the reliability and/or rate of fire of a recoil operated firearm. The <b>muzzle</b> booster is the antithesis of the <b>muzzle</b> brake, which is designed to use the propellant gases to reduce the recoil of the firearm. However, unlike a <b>muzzle</b> brake, a <b>muzzle</b> booster uses the pressure of the expanding gases, rather than the reaction force, and it does not alter the felt recoil of the weapon, it merely adds more energy to the operating components.|$|R
5|$|Giant otter <b>muzzles</b> {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs {{are active}} {{primarily}} {{during the day}} (diurnal), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and nectar, often adopting suspensory postures while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their digestive tract and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their feces, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are also significant pollinators of the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis). Without destroying the inflorescence, they lick the nectar from deep inside the flower using their long <b>muzzles</b> and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship {{is thought to be}} a result of co-evolution.|$|E
5|$|The red {{and white}} variety of toy spaniel was first seen in {{paintings}} by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog {{is used as a}} symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the <b>muzzles</b> were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.|$|E
5000|$|The high-powered {{firearms}} use the <b>muzzle</b> brake {{mainly for}} recoil reduction, which reduces the battering of the shooter by the severe recoil. The action-shooting handguns redirect {{all the energy}} up to counteract {{the rotation of the}} recoil, and make following shots faster by leaving the gun on target. The disadvantage of the <b>muzzle</b> brake is a longer, heavier barrel, and a large increase in sound levels and flash behind the <b>muzzle</b> of the rifle. Shooting firearms without <b>muzzle</b> brakes and without hearing protection can eventually damage the operator's hearing; however, shooting rifles with <b>muzzle</b> brakes - with or without hearing protection - causes permanent ear damage.

5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long <b>muzzles,</b> upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of <b>muzzles</b> and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E
5|$|At around 6:50 am on 5 April, the Viet Cong 5th Division {{moved across}} the Cambodian border to stage the main attack on Lộc Ninh. The Viet Cong assault opened with a heavy barrage of artillery, rocket and mortar fire {{targeting}} {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment and the Lộc Ninh district compound. The Viet Cong simultaneously mounted other attacks throughout the ARVN 5th Infantry Division's areas of operations in Lai Khê and Quần Lợi. There was also indirect fire on South Vietnamese positions in Phước Long Province, mainly targeting Phước Vinh, Sông Bé, and Bo Duc. Following the artillery barrage, Viet Cong infantry, supported by about 25 tanks, attacked Lộc Ninh from the west. In the initial assault, they tried to overrun the South Vietnamese regimental compound located {{at the south end of}} the airstrip. Despite the ferocity of the onslaught, South Vietnamese soldiers held their ground and fought desperately to hold the enemy at bay; South Vietnamese artillerymen lowered the <b>muzzles</b> of their 105mm howitzers and fired directly at enemy infantry formations moving through the rubber trees.|$|E

5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long <b>muzzles</b> and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E
5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous. Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other Early Cretaceous dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide <b>muzzles</b> of grazers.|$|E
5|$|White nose {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} associated with the deaths of millions of bats in the Eastern United States and Canada. The disease is named after a white fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, found growing on the <b>muzzles,</b> ears, and wings of afflicted bats. This fungus, which is mostly spread from bat to bat, is the sole cause of the disease. The fungus was first discovered in central New York State in 2006 and spread quickly to the entire Eastern US north of Florida; mortality rates of 90–100% have been observed in most caves. New England and the mid-Atlantic states have, since 2006, witnessed entire species completely extirpated and others with numbers that have gone from the hundreds of thousands, even millions, to a few hundred or less. The provinces of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick have witnessed identical die offs, with the Canadian government making preparations to protect all remaining bat populations in its territory. Scientific evidence suggests that longer winters where the fungus has {{a longer period of}} time to infect bats results in greater chances of mortality. In 2014, infection crossed the Mississippi River, but species native to northern Mexico and the West had not yet been affected.|$|E
