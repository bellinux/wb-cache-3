5|$|The keto oxygen renders {{mephedrone}} more hydrophilic {{than the}} corresponding methylamphetamines, which <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the higher doses {{required to achieve}} a similar effect, because mephedrone is less able to cross the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
30|$|From {{the set of}} {{variables}}, some variables <b>may</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> {{large amount}} of variability in the data set.

5|$|Industrial {{apiculture}} {{has adopted}} simple breeding programs for uniform desired traits, and seasonal transportation of colonies over vast distances causes increased infectious exposures from mixing of these domestic and residual displaced wild populations. Brood incubation conditions may be stressful {{with respect to}} deficient nutrition, temperature and other basics. This combination of ecological factors, especially the host factor of loss of genetic variation and hybrid vigor, <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the apparent multifactorial environmental 'causes' of CCD including concurrent infections.|$|E
5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to {{the dead}} insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes. A similar reason <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed to vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E

5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|Burges's two finest gothic {{churches were}} also {{undertaken}} in the 1870s, the Church of Christ the Consoler, Skelton-on-Ure, and St Mary's, Studley Royal. His patron, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, although not as rich as Bute, was his equal in romantic medievalism and had been a friend of Bute's at Oxford, which <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the choice of Burges as architect. Both churches were built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned the Church of Christ the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, Skelton was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at around {{three or four}} years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not {{successfully}} breed until a few years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium {{died at the age of}} 28 years. Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E
30|$|Variable {{dimension}} {{reduction is}} a tool to avoid complexity due to having large number of variables by considering the possible small number of variables those can reflect the needed information: which arise due to some variables are highly correlated to each other or to latent variable, or from the set of variables some variables <b>may</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> large amount of variability in the data set. For this type of problem variable reduction methods like principal factor analysis and factor score analysis are suggested [1, 2].|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of equilibrium in six specimens of garnet-biotite-sillimanite-plagioclase-potash feldspar-quartz [...] . gneiss from a metamorphic terrain in south-western Quebec. A nearly uniform Ti content of biotite <b>may</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by an equilibrium (a) involving biotite, sillimanite, quartz, garnet, potash feldspar, and H 2 O. The {{nature of the}} distribution of Fe and Mg between garnet and biotite <b>may</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by another equilibrium (b) involving the same mineral suite, or by a simple exchange equilibrium (c) involving only garnet and biotite. The distribution of Mn between garnet and biotite is <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by an exchange equilibrium (d). A nearly uniform value of the ratio Ca content of plagioclase/Ca content of garnet <b>may</b> be <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by an equilibrium (e) involving plagioclase, garnet, sillimanite, and quartz. A proposed equilibrium (f) involving biotite, quartz, ilmenite, potash feldspar, sillimanite, and H 2 O conflicts with equilibrium (a) and was evidently not established in the gneisses. The factors governing the Ca content of biotite remain largely unknown. Some of these equilibria form potential indicators of relative geologic temperature, pressure, and chemical potential of H 2 O...|$|R

5|$|In Hawaii, the planarian Endeavouria septemlineata {{has been}} used to control the {{imported}} giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails, and Platydemus manokwari, another planarian, {{has been used}} for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although A. fulica has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much E. septemlineata contributed to this. However, P. manokwari is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, A. fulica – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> their ability to decimate A. fulica. However, these abilities have raised concerns that planarians may themselves become a serious threat to native snails.|$|E
5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create {{a gap between the}} teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E

5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{variations}} in mitochondrial DNA indicate {{low levels of}} genetic divergence among bog turtle colonies. This is unusual in species such as the bog turtle, which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in bog turtle colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that the bog turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a population bottleneck – as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as the bog turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{produces}} an apocrine secretion on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow loris licks its brachial glands and applies the secretion to its heads. The oily secretion contains a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an allergenic protein found in cat dander. The similarity between the brachial gland secretions and domestic cat allergens <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.|$|E

5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity <b>may</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
