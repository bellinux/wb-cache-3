5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the <b>model</b> <b>may</b> be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. What are the {{limitations}} of model-based discovery? This pa-per identies two limitations: limits of scale (<b>models</b> <b>may</b> have to be pro-hibitively large or numerous) and limits of sampling (individual <b>models</b> <b>may</b> mislead and generalization from them be dicult). Examples are used to illustrate both limits...|$|R
40|$|In {{large-scale}} model-based development, developers periodically need {{to combine}} collections of interrelated <b>models.</b> These <b>models</b> <b>may</b> capture different {{features of a}} system, describe alternative perspectives on a single feature, or express ways in which different features alter one another’s structure or behaviour. We refer {{to the process of}} combining a set of interrelated models as model fusion. A number of factors make model fusion complicated. <b>Models</b> <b>may</b> overlap, in that they refer to the same concepts, but these concepts may be presented differently in each model, and the <b>models</b> <b>may</b> contradict one another. <b>Models</b> <b>may</b> describe independent system components, but the components may interact, potentially causing undesirable side effects. Finally, <b>models</b> <b>may</b> cross-cut, modifying one another in ways that violate their syntactic or semantic properties. In this thesis, we study three instances of the fusion problem for behavioural models, motivated by real-world applications. The first problem is combining partial models of a single feature with the goal of creating a more complete description of that feature. The second problem is maintenance of variant specifications of individual features. The goa...|$|R

25|$|A similar {{problem to}} the one {{considered}} appears in the physics of normal-metal superconductor interfaces. Quasiparticles are scattered at the pair potential which in the simplest <b>model</b> <b>may</b> be assumed to have a step-like shape. The solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation resembles that of the discussed Heaviside-step potential. In the superconductor normal-metal case this gives rise to Andreev reflection.|$|E

25|$|Aquifer {{tests are}} {{typically}} interpreted {{by using an}} analytical model of aquifer flow (the most fundamental being the Theis solution) to match the data observed in the real world, then assuming that the parameters from the idealized model apply to the real-world aquifer.

25|$|Two {{independent}} studies {{published in}} the journal Nature in 2010 November confirmed the ability of tumors to make their own blood vessels. When one group found that tumor stem cells could make their own blood vessels and avastin could not inhibit their early differentiation, the other group showed that selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by tumor-derived stem cells in mouse xenografts resulted in tumour reduction. These studies done in glioblastoma <b>model</b> <b>may</b> have implications in other tumors.|$|E
25|$|The source {{models can}} be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined <b>model</b> <b>may</b> consist of a few {{point-like}} sources ("equivalent dipoles"), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models {{may be used in}} cases where many different distributed areas are activated ("distributed source solutions"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} notable {{examples}} of this mimicry or acquisition of the same carbohydrate sequences implicated in this protective system by pathogens and aggressive tumor cells. The major carbohydrate sequence linked to glycodelin-A also profusely coats the surface of schistosomes. The profile of the major oligosaccharides linked to CA125 and the major surface glycoprotein of HIV-1 (gp120) almost perfectly overlap. More persistent pathogens linked to the eu-FEDS <b>model</b> <b>may</b> be identified as mass spectrometry methods for sequencing oligosaccharides become more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of marketing, {{behavioural}} experiments which have dealt with managerial decision- making, and risk perception, in consumer decisions have utilised the Bayesian model, or similar models, but found {{that it may not}} be relevant quantitatively in predicting human information processing behaviour. Instead the model has been proven as useful as a qualitative means of describing how individuals combine new evidence with their predetermined judgements. Therefore, “the <b>model</b> <b>may</b> have some value as a first approximation to the development of descriptive choice theory” in consumer and managerial instances.|$|E
25|$|The valleys {{typically}} {{have many features}} that on Earth are commonly (though not exclusively) associated with groundwater sapping - for instance, amphitheater-like headwalls, constant valley width downstream, flat or U-shaped floors and steep walls. However, without some recharge mechanism for the putative aquifers producing this seepage, i.e., a hydrologic cycle of some kind, it is extremely unlikely that enough water could seep to cut all of the valleys formed in the Noachian. In spite of this, this basic <b>model</b> <b>may</b> remain useful in understanding the more limited valleys formed later in the Hesperian and Amazonian.|$|E
