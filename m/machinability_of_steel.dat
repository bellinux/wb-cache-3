40|$|Performance of {{indexable}} insert {{cutting tools}} {{is not only}} about the performance of cutting inserts. It is also about the cutting tool body, which has to provide a secure and accurate insert positioning as well as its quick and easy handling under severe working conditions. The common damage mechanisms of cutting tool bodies are fatigue and plastic deformation. Cutting tools undergo high dynamic stresses going in and out cutting engagement; as a result, an adequate level of fatigue strength is the essential steel property. Working temperatures of tool bodies in the insert pocket can reach up to 600 °C, why the tool steel requires high softening resistance to avoid plastic deformation. Machinability is also essential, as machining <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> represents a large fraction of the production cost of a cutting tool. The overall aim of the study is to improve the tool body performance by use <b>of</b> an advanced <b>steel</b> grade with an optimized combination of all the demanding properties. Due to the high-temperature conditions, the thesis concerns mostly hot-work tool steels increasing also the general knowledge of their microstructure, mechanical properties and machinability. Knowing the positive effect <b>of</b> sulphur on <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> <b>steels,</b> the first step was to indentify a certain limit of the sulphur addition, which would not reduce the fatigue strength of the tool body below an acceptable level. In tool bodies, where the demand on surface roughness was low and a geometrical stress concentrator was present, the addition of sulphur could be up to 0. 09 wt%. Fatigue performance of the cutting tools to a large extent depended on the steel resistance to stress relaxation under high dynamic loading and elevated temperatures. The stress relaxation behaviour, material substructure and dislocation characteristics in low-alloyed and hot-work tool steels were studied using X-ray diffraction under thermal and mechanical loading.  Different tool steels exhibited different stress relaxation resistance depending on their microstructure, temper resistance and working temperature. Hot-work tool steels showed to be more preferable to low-alloyed tool <b>steels</b> because <b>of</b> their ability to inhibit the rearrangement and annihilation of induced dislocations. High-temperature softening resistance of the hot-work tool steels was investigated during high-temperature hold-times and isothermal fatigue and discussed with respect to their microstructure. Carbide morphology and precipitation were determined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. <b>Machinability</b> <b>of</b> a prehardened hot-work tool <b>steel</b> <b>of</b> varying nickel content from 1 to 5 wt% was investigated in end milling and drilling operations.

40|$|Abstract: AAR Grade E {{steel is}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} rail industry for the manufacture of rail related components. Due to {{the environment in which}} these components operate, it is required that they exhibit good mechanical properties. The casting process is amongst the most economic methods of manufacturing. In the rail industry, rail components are predominantly manufactured by means of sand casting. Sand casting accounts for a significant majority of the total tonnage cast. Sand casting consists of pouring molten metal into a sand mould, allowing the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mould to remove the casting. After the component is cast, it is usually followed by a heat treatment process. For some components a machining operation follows after the heat treatment process. Depending on the application of the component, the heat treatment required may {{have a significant effect on}} the mechanical properties and the <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> the alloy. It is therefore important to schedule the machine appropriately and to use the most efficient and cost effective machining strategy. This may reduce costs as well as energy usage. It is also important to optimize the heat treatment process for the required mechanical properties along with an appropriate machining strategy for the alloy and family of parts concerned. A literature review has indicated that limited information exists to optimize the heat treatment of AAR Grade E steel as related to heat treatment and machining strategy. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties and <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> AAR Grade E steel. A detailed literature review of the various topics that are covered in this research was conducted. These include the characterization of AAR Grade E <b>steel,</b> fundamentals <b>of</b> heat treatment, the applications of heat treatment on medium carbon steel alloys, the fundamentals of metal cutting and <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> <b>steels.</b> An experimental program was developed to address the objectives that were established. This was executed by producing sample castings of a given diameter and thereafter subjecting them to various heat treatment cycles. These samples were then subjected to various heat treatment processes. Thereafter, various tests were conducted in order to determine its mechanical properties as well as machinability by using an instrumented lathe. The results obtained with regards to heat treatment showed that AAR Grade E steel responds positively to normalising, quenching and tempering when executed at the prescribed temperatures and soaking times. In addition to this, through a positive response to the various heat treatment processes, the respective samples exhibits mechanical properties that is typical to other steel grades having a similar chemical composition and that have undergone the same heat treatment process. In terms of the effect of heat treatment on the <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> AAR grade E steel, it was found that depending on the <b>machinability</b> performance measure <b>of</b> interest, each material condition performs in a manner that is consistent with the fundamentals of machining as has been investigated in the literature review.

This combination of parameters resulted in the minimum power consumption of 14. 94 % and decreased surface roughness and tool wear by 4. 71 % and 13. 98 %, respectively. Therefore, this method also effectively reduces the effects and costs of the machining process...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{behaviour}} of 22 {{industrial test}} charges of AISI  8620 carburizing steel with two different calcium treatment levels was studied. The research work consisted mainly of rotating bending fatigue tests, residual stress and surface roughness measurements, electron microscopy, different steel cleanliness level and statistical inclusion size estimation methods. There {{were no significant}} differences between the σw/Rm ratios of the casts with the large amount of calcium injection and the casts with the small amount of calcium injection. In the casts with the large amount of calcium injection, the fatigue cracks initiated mostly from the surface and interior inclusions. In the casts with the small amount of calcium injection, the fatigue cracks initiated mostly from the surface discontinuities. The inclusions responsible for fatigue crack initiation were in the most cases calcium aluminates encapsulated in calcium sulfide containing small amounts of magnesia and/or silica. The fatigue crack initiation from cracked and non-cracked inclusions resulted in similar fatigue life on the same ΔK level. The fatigue strength scatter was larger in the casts with the large amount of calcium injection. In rotating bending fatigue the σw/Rm ratio was almost independent of inclusion size in the average fatigue crack initiating inclusion size region smaller than ∼  70 - 90  µm. The results of DIN  50   602 and SFS-ENV  10247 inclusion rating methods and ultrasonic tests in immersion did not correlate with the inclusions that were responsible for fatigue failure in these steels. The results may, however, suggest guidelines for the fatigue properties and the <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>steels</b> when the contents of certain alloying elements are taken into account. Ultrasonic tests in immersion provide more relevant information about the fatigue properties and <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>steels</b> than the conventional inclusion rating methods do, but its resolution capability still needs improvement. In most casts the maximum inclusion sizes predicted by the statistics of extreme value method were much smaller than the size of the inclusions found at the fatigue crack initiation sites of the fatigue specimens. The studied steels seemed to have two different inclusion size distributions, i. e., the inclusions detected at the polished microsections and the inclusions at the fatigue crack initiation sites. Both distributions had similar morphology and chemical composition, which was contrary to the earlier findings of the bilinear nature of inclusion distribution in some steels. The successful application of the Murakami-Endo model with these steels requires quite a large inspection area, approximately 8400  mm 2 at least, to enable the detection of the population of the largest inclusions, which are responsible for fatigue failure. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|High {{economical}} efficiency {{obtained by}} utilizing prehardened mould steels in plastic mould making {{has increased the}} usage of these types <b>of</b> <b>steels</b> to a great extent. Generally, prehardened mould steels are applied for large moulds and moulds for moderate production runs, {{and one of the}} advantages of using this type <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> is that no heat treatment is necessary for putting the mould in use. Today, around 80 percent <b>of</b> the mould <b>steels</b> are produced in prehardened condition which is typically ~ 40 HRC. This hardness limit is required for providing both high hardness and <b>machinability</b> which are <b>of</b> the most important demands upon mould steels. In addition to these properties, a superior polishability, nitriding stability, weldability toughness, corrosion resistance and thermal conductivity are wanted by either moulders or mould makers. Among these properties, machinability is extremely important because of its direct influence on cost of the mould and consequently the plastic part. The machining expenses accounts for more than 60 percent of the total cost of a mould. Hence, improving the machinability in prehardened mould steels has been the concern <b>of</b> tool <b>steel</b> suppliers. In this thesis work, the focus is laid on metallurgical aspects <b>of</b> <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> prehardened mould <b>steels.</b> Therefore, the <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> different types <b>of</b> prehardened mould <b>steels</b> is investigated with respect to milling and drilling operations which are the most frequently used machining operations in mould production. In order to understand the metallurgical reason for machinability differences, detailed studies are performed on two steel grades, Uddeholm Nimax and Impax HH. Thorough microstructure characterization is complemented by examining the <b>machinability</b> <b>of</b> the materials in terms of cutting temperature, cutting force and tool life. The materials have shown very different properties in different machining operations and their machinability varies greatly depending on the cutting condition and machining operation type. Comparing the two deeply studied steel grades, Uddeholm Nimax with bainitic structure is benefitted with higher machinability and possesses superior impact toughness and ductility which are important properties for plastic mould steels. Uddeholm Nimax has also the advantage of not needing costly quenching and tempering processes for its production...|$|R
