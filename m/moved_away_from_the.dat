5|$|When the Whiskers first {{formed in}} 1998, their main rivals were Young Ones, Lazuli, Elveera and Vivian. These were their main rivals for three years, then Gattaca formed {{north of the}} Whiskers {{territory}} and became their rivals. Over the next few years, Vivian <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Whiskers and Commandos became the Whiskers new rivals. Soon Elveera and Lazuli <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Whiskers and Aztecs form their territory next to the Whiskers. In 2007 Whiskers main rivals were Young Ones, Aztecs and Commandos. Then Young Ones died out, and Kung Fu formed next to Whiskers, Commandos moved away and the Sequoia formed. Today Whiskers main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and Sequoia.|$|E
5|$|As Esther {{began to}} {{parallel}} the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21. All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings {{later that day}} as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast. After Esther completed its anticyclonic loop over the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine. Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards.|$|E
5000|$|One {{idea that}} many [...] "branches" [...] of Neo-Marxism share is <b>the</b> desire to <b>move</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> idea of open, bloody {{revolution}} {{to one of}} a more peaceful nature. <b>Moving</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> violence of the Red revolutions of the past while keeping the revolutionary message. Neo-Marxist concepts can also follow an economic theory that attempts to <b>move</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional accusations of class warfare and create new economic theory models, such as Hans-Jürgen Krahl did.|$|R

5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{monetary}} {{theory of}} Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, {{due to a}} strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E
5|$|In Robson's first {{match in}} charge, Shearer scored five goals in an 8–0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday. With Robson in charge, the team <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> relegation zone, {{finishing}} in mid-table {{and reached the}} FA Cup semi-finals, but a third consecutive final was beyond them as they were beaten by Chelsea. Shearer missed only one league game and notched up 23goals.|$|E

5|$|Shadows Fall {{has been}} mainly {{described}} as metalcore and thrash metal. Originally, Shadows Fall was a melodic death metal band. With {{the release of}} the band's 2002 album The Art of Balance, Shadows Fall <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> melodic death metal genre. Shadows Fall has been compared by Steve Huey of AllMusic to Gothernburg death metal, including Gothernburg death metal band In Flames.|$|E
5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be boring. As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video {{game of the year}} in Japan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As Rammasun <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Philippines, it {{enhanced}} the monsoon and produced rainfall and flooding. Several landslides were reported, {{and more than}} 3,000people had to evacuate. Subsequent storms also {{enhanced the}} monsoon, and combined with the effects from Typhoon Chataan, Severe Tropical Storm Nakri, and Typhoon Halong, there were 85deaths, with 45people injured in the Philippines. The combined damage in the country totaled $10.3million (₱522million 2002PHP).|$|E

5|$|Birks was {{promoted}} {{as a temporary}} wagon orderly corporal on 5 August 1916, and the rank was made substantive five days later. After his unit <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front line, Birks {{had an opportunity to}} return to Buckley. There, he visited his old school and gave them a Turkish flag that he has attained while in Gallipoli. Following his return to France, Birks was hospitalised for five days with pyrexia. He rejoined his unit on 14 February 1917.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Havelock <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> socialist organisations he {{had been}} {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E

In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable {{for the growth of}} pure diamond.|$|E

5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number {{but not enough to}} offset the losses due to migration.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen {{experiences}} {{a very high}} turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> town. The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, {{about a quarter of}} the population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{hurricane}} had <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coast, airports quickly re-opened. Simultaneously, fishermen in Playa Azul protested that their livelihood was endangered due to fishing bans {{caused by the}} chemical spill; consequently, in Lázaro Cárdenas, 28people were arrested while warrants for 526 others' arrest were issued for disturbing peace and blocking highways. This sparked protests from two environmental group as a well a group of Mexican artists. Also, the fisherman demanded a $1million compensation. Within {{a week after the}} storm, additional rains had moved into the area, leading to further damage and eight fatalities.|$|E

5|$|The Second Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented {{than those of}} his predecessor. Additionally, after The Highlanders, stories <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> purely {{historical}} ones that featured during William Hartnell's tenure; instead, any historical tales also included a science fiction element. Patrick Troughton retained the role until the last episode of The War Games {{when members of the}} Doctor's race, the Time Lords, put him on trial for breaking the laws of time and forced him to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The crowd <b>moved</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate}} {{area of the}} custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets.

Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
