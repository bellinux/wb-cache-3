Relative humidity, <b>clamping</b> <b>pressure</b> and back pressure were studied at two levels for Gore MEAs and GDLs. Two replicated experiments were performed. An ON/OFF test cycle was used to accelerate degradation. Total duration of the tests, after a break in procedure suggested by Gore, was ten days. In addition to sampling of voltage and current response and ohmic resistance, effluents were manually sampled from both electrodes every 24 hours and analyzed. Experiments with low humidification levels showed inferior durability. The combination of high relative humidity (100 %), high <b>clamping</b> <b>pressure</b> (10 barg) and high back pressure (1. 5 barg) result in the best performance and the lowest degradation rate. Results indicate that relative humidity is important both for performance and durability. Generally, fluoride emission rates (FER) showed an increasing trend with time. Higher rates were observed at the cathode. For the experiment with low relative humidity (25 %), low <b>clamping</b> <b>pressure</b> (5 barg) and high back pressure (1. 5 barg) FER was significantly higher {{compared to the other}} experiments.

To this aim, always more sensitive sensors to monitor plant water status have been developed in recent years. Among them, the leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probes are very promising for water management of olive but until now have been tested only in few environmental and management conditions. In this work these sensors have been tested for two consecutive years on two completely different management systems: a traditional rainfed orchard and a super high density (SHD) drip irrigated orchard. Within the SHD orchard the probes have been installed on two different genotypes characterize by different vigor and productive potential. Stem water potential and gases exchange have been measured at regular intervals and used as reference to detect water status of the trees. The high correlation observed between the leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probes and Ψswp, independently from the year and the treatment, confirmed the high potential of the continuous system.

40|$|A high-precision {{pressure}} probe {{is described}} which allows non-invasive online-monitoring {{of the water}} relations of intact leaves. Real-time recording of the leaf water status occurred by data transfer to an Internet server. The leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probe measures the attenuated pressure, Pp, of a leaf patch {{in response to a}} constant <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure,</b> Pclamp. Pp is sensed by a miniaturized silicone pressure sensor integrated into the device. The magnitude of Pp is dictated by the transfer function of the leaf, Tf, which is a function of leaf patch volume and ultimately of cell turgor pressure, Pc, as shown theoretically. The power function Tf=f(Pc) theoretically derived was experimentally confirmed by concomitant Pp and Pc measurements on intact leaflets of the liana Tetrastigma voinierianum under greenhouse conditions. Simultaneous Pp recordings on leaflets up to 10 m height above ground demonstrated that changes in Tf induced by Pc changes due to changes of microclimate and/or of the irrigation regime were sensitively reflected in corresponding changes of Pp. Analysis of the data show that transpirational water loss during the morning hours was associated with a transient rise in turgor pressure gradients within the leaflets. Subsequent recovery of turgescence during the afternoon was much faster than the preceding transpiration-induced water loss if the plants were well irrigated.

40|$|Abstract. Assembly {{pressure}} {{plays an}} important role in the factors affecting the performance of a PEM fuel cell. An insufficient <b>clamping</b> <b>pressure</b> may cause large contact resistance and thus lower the cell performance. On the other hand, over-clamping may reduce the porosity and permeability of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and also result in poor cell performance. Therefore, it is very important to determine the proper assembly pressure for obtaining optimal performance. In this study, we design a special test fixture to evaluate the effect of assembly pressure on the performance of a PEM fuel cell. Without disassembling the fuel cell, the <b>clamping</b> <b>pressure</b> can be adjusted in situ to measure the cell performance directly and precisely. The unique single cell design eliminates the influence of gasket around the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and makes it possible to estimate the compression effect of GDL independently.

The variations of water contact angle, gas permeability, and in-plane electrical resistivity with the assembly pressure are also measured to explore the effects of assembly pressure on these physical properties.
