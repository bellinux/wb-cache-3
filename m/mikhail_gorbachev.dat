5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} the Soviet Union was assumed by <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev.</b> The {{worsening}} economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev {{to carry out a}} number of reforms, not only in the field of economics (uskoreniye) but in the political and social realms (glasnost and perestroika).

Polish academics tried to include Katyn in {{the agenda of the}} 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed that Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> admitted that the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of External Relations {{negotiated}} diplomatic treaties, handled Soviet {{foreign affairs}} {{along with the}} International Department of the Central Committee and aided in the guidance of international communism and anti-imperialism, both strong themes of Soviet policy. Before <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> became General Secretary, the organisational structure of the MER mostly stayed the same. As many other Soviet agencies, the MER had an inner-policy group known as the Collegium, {{made up of the}} minister, the two first deputy ministers and nine deputy ministers, among others. Each deputy minister usually headed his own department.|$|E

5|$|These policy failures, and the {{stalemate}} that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become {{highly critical of}} Karmal's leadership. Under <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to Moscow. He was {{allowed to return to}} Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from liver cancer.|$|E
