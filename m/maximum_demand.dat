5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} in the state {{as well in the}} Federal Territory of Labuan are operated and managed by the Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB). Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined cycle power plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of 396.5 MW. While the East Coast Grid supplies electricity to the major towns of Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau with a capacity of 333.02 MW and <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of 203.3 MW.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of <b>maximum</b> <b>demand,</b> as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E

25|$|Both free-flow {{and demand}} {{regulators}} use mechanical feedback of the downstream pressure {{to control the}} opening of a valve which controls gas flow from the upstream, high-pressure side, to the downstream, low-pressure side of each stage.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the probable <b>maximum</b> simultaneous <b>demands</b> of water supply facilities at {{an acceptable level}} of reliability for some high-rise residential buildings in crowded cities. In particular, the probable <b>maximum</b> simultaneous water <b>demands</b> of domestic washrooms are derived for some usage patterns that the appliances in the same washroom would not operate simultaneously. The model parameters including usage patterns and operating flow rates of some domestic appliances were surveyed from 597 domestic washrooms of 14 typical high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. The results revealed that, with the surveyed data and original design data as references, the probable <b>maximum</b> simultaneous <b>demands</b> were only about 50 % of those estimated for assuming all appliances in simultaneous operation. The results would be useful in updating the calculation of water supply plants and piping systems for high-rise residential buildings at a balance of cost and system reliability.

This paper surveyed the water usage patterns through face-to-face interviews and simple on site measurements from some typical high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong and investigated the probable <b>maximum</b> <b>demands</b> of domestic appliances in terms of fixture units determined at an allowable failure rate of 1 % of the peak hourly demands.
