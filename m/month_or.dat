5|$|While many {{versions}} of the tale exist, Ila is usually described as a daughter or son of Vaivasvata Manu and thus the sibling of Ikshvaku, {{the founder of the}} Solar Dynasty.

After mistakenly entering a sacred grove as an adult, Ila is either cursed to change his/her gender every <b>month</b> <b>or</b> cursed to become a woman. As a woman, Ilā married Budha, the god of the planet Mercury and the son of the lunar deity Chandra (Soma), and bore him a son called Pururavas, the father of the Lunar dynasty.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{document}} prevalence, identify leading indicators, and develop and assess prediction models for nursing home resident outcomes (death, discharge home). New residents (N = 647) in eight nursing homes were evaluated on admission and 3 and 6 months later. Predictor variables tested included 14 health status variables, 5 demographic variables, and 6 other resident and nursing home variables. A cancer diagnosis was the most important risk factor for death at 3 <b>months</b> (<b>OR</b> = 8. 0) and 6 <b>months</b> (<b>OR</b> = 10. 8). A first nursing home admission was the most important risk factor for discharge to home at 3 <b>months</b> (<b>OR</b> = 9. 5) and 6 <b>months</b> (<b>OR</b> = 13. 9). Not having a dementia diagnosis was the second most important risk factor for discharge to home at 3 <b>months</b> (<b>OR</b> = 5. 8) and 6 <b>months</b> (<b>OR</b> = 4. 2). All prediction models demonstrated useful potential for clinical application. NURSING home staff are challenged to care for residentswith disparate needs. Residents are more disabled with greater acuity than in the past, yet approximately half stay less than 3 months (Spence and Weiner, 1990). Nursing home staff must design and implement care for residents with different care needs: short-stay residents with unstable health who may die, short-stay residents who may be discharged home, and permanently placed long-stay residents.

5|$|Adams {{received}} {{an invitation to}} {{become a member of the}} Knickerbockers a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so after the team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers. Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine runs for his team as they defeated a side picked by William R. Wheaton, 51–42. The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19. Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23–1. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' lineup, he made one out and did not score a run.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} reception accorded to L'Arianna at its premiere, the duke did not request a second showing, {{as he had}} with L'Orfeo the previous year". The next hint of a performance of L'Arianna is in 1614, when the Medici court in Florence requested {{a copy of the}} score, presumably with the intention of staging it. There is, however, no record of any such performance there. Early in 1620 Striggio asked Monteverdi to send him the music for a projected performance in Mantua as part of the celebration for the Duchess Caterina's birthday. Monteverdi went to the trouble and expense of preparing a new manuscript with revisions; had he had more time, he informed Striggio, he would have revised the work more thoroughly. Hearing nothing further from the Mantuan court, Monteverdi wrote to Striggio on 18 April 1620, offering to help with the staging. A <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so later, however, he learned that the duchess's celebrations had been scaled back, and that there had been no performance of L'Arianna.|$|E

She was {{reclassified}} as a cruiser {{of the first}} rank on 13 February 1892 and remained in the Mediterranean for another <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so. The ship reached Vladivostok on 29 June, stopping at Aden, Singapore, and Hong Kong en route. Dmitrii Donskoi served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Tirtov {{several times during the}} year. She spent the winter in Yokosuka and Nagasaki before she sailed in early 1893 to America for a goodwill visit to mark the 400 anniversary of America's discovery. In Algiers in March, the ship picked up Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and became flagship of Rear Admiral Kaznakov who commanded all the Russian ships at the exhibition. Dmitrii Donskoi reached New York City on 25 April and participated in the Presidential Review two days later. She made port visits to Philadelphia, Boston and Newport, Rhode Island before she arrived back at Kronstadt in early September.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation {{by means of an}} adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E

5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny {{species such as}} ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{became aware}} {{that there was a}} spy {{operating}} within the Turkish Embassy, they investigated Bazna, installed a new alarm system, and initiated an unsuccessful sting to catch him selling intelligence. He stopped selling information to the Germans by the end of February 1944 and left the embassy within a <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so. After the war, Bazna was questioned for war crimes, but he was never charged with espionage. He attempted to buy and operate a hotel in Ankara with the proceeds of his spying career, but it was discovered that much of the money was counterfeit. He served a brief prison sentence for circulating forged notes. Bazna lived in Ankara with his family for many years and obtained work doing odd jobs. He moved to Munich in 1960 and worked as a night watchman before dying in 1970 of kidney disease. Bazna published a memoir of the Cicero affair in 1962.|$|E
