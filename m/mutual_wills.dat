25|$|Another {{issue as}} regards <b>mutual</b> <b>wills</b> is the {{question}} of revocability. In Re Hobley Charles Aldous QC held that there could be either unilateral or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, the problem with this approach is that unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the unconscionability rationale that unjust enrichment could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.|$|E

50|$|If the {{survivor}} accepts the benefits under the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> {{he or she}} becomes bound by its terms. The survivor is consequently under an obligation (of a contractual or quasi-contractual nature) to allow the jointly disposed of property to devolve {{in terms of the}} joint will. In other words, the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> now comes fully into operation and {{the survivor}} cannot revoke his or her share of it. The <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> operates in effect as the will of the first-dying party and the survivor is a beneficiary under that will.|$|R
50|$|If the {{survivor}} elects {{to take no}} benefit under the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> and thereby repudiates the will {{he or she is}} not bound by its terms. It follows that {{the survivor}} reverts to the legal position which he enjoyed before the death of the testator. The survivor accordingly may revoke his or her share of the <b>mutual</b> <b>will,</b> retain personal property and be free of the will’s terms. The consequence is that the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> remains in force only in so far as it is the will of the first-dying and it operates only upon the latter’s share of the property.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>wills</b> are rare, {{and often}} {{another form of}} {{constructive}} trust is imposed (See Healey v Browne [...] 2 WTLR 849).

2500|$|Other {{types of}} {{constructive}} trust not relating to unconscionable dealings are constructive trusts over property, <b>mutual</b> <b>wills,</b> and arguably secret trusts.

Secret trusts {{are the subject of}} much debate over their classification, but one theory holds them to be constructive in nature. Related to constructive trusts are constructive trustees, or trustees de son tort; these are where [...] "one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to intermeddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee".

25|$|A {{joint will}} differs substantively from a <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> {{in that the}} former is not {{intended}} to be irrevocable or to express a mutual intention; it is merely an administrative convenience. A will may be both joint (on one document) and mutual (see below).|$|R
50|$|Whether the {{survivor}} has elected {{to abide by}} the terms of the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> or to repudiate them is a question of fact. The election is generally effected by {{the survivor}} in his or her capacity as executor (for the survivor is usually appointed executor testamentary) in framing the liquidation and distribution account. If the survivor takes the interest in the share of the first-dying in terms of the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> the survivor is deemed to have accepted the benefits and to have adiated. Vice versa, the survivor is held to repudiate the terms of the will if he or she does not take the interest in the share of the first-dying but assigns the estate of the deceased to the other beneficiaries.|$|R
2500|$|A {{joint will}} {{is a single}} {{document}} executed {{by more than one}} person (typically between spouses), making which has effect in relation to each signatory's property on his or her death (unless he or she revokes (cancels) the will during his or her lifetime). [...] Although a single document, the joint will is a separate distribution of property by each executor (signatory) and will be treated as such on admission to probate. [...] <b>Mutual</b> <b>wills</b> are any two (or more) wills which are mutually binding, such that following the first death the survivor is constrained in his or her ability to dispose of his or her property by the agreement he or she made with the deceased. [...] Historically such wills had an important role in ensuring property passed to children of a marriage rather than a widow or widower's spouse on a remarriage.|$|E
2500|$|In Olins v Walters [...] 2 WLR 1 C.A. the Court of Appeal {{has held}} that {{although}} it is {{a necessary condition for}} <b>mutual</b> <b>wills</b> that there is clear and satisfactory evidence of a contract between the testators, it is a legally sufficient condition that the contract provide that, in return for one testator agreeing to make a will in a particular form and not to revoke it without notice to the other testator, the latter would also make a will in a particular form and agree not to revoke it without notice to the first testator. [...] Once a contract of that kind is established, equity will impose on the surviving testator a constructive trust not to dispose of the property in any other way. [...] There {{did not have to be}} more detailed terms of the contract because the remedy was not founded on specific performance of contractual obligations but upon implementation of the trust, and the intentions of the parties had only to be expressed sufficiently to lay the foundations for that equitable obligation. [...] The case also held that, where established, the equitable obligation under the trust became immediately binding upon the surviving testator upon the death of the first and was not postponed to take effect only after the death of the second or last testator when the property, or what was left of it, came into the hands of his personal representatives.|$|E

50|$|It will be {{seen that}} the effect of massing, if carried out, is to give the {{survivor}} one benefit and to deprive him or her of another. The survivor acquires a beneficial interest in the property of the first-dying which otherwise (in the absence of any will) the survivor would not have obtained, but the survivor no longer has the full ownership {{of his or her own}} share of the property which otherwise he or she would have retained. The survivor, however, is not bound to allow the <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> to be carried into effect. If the survivor accepts the benefit, he or she must also accept the loss of an interest in his or her own property; the survivor cannot accept the benefit without its accompanying liability.

25|$|Constructive trusts also arise with <b>mutual</b> wills; <b>wills</b> {{created by}} two or more people at the same time, with the {{intention}} that the wills are completely binding. Normal wills can be altered or revoked; when one signatory to a <b>mutual</b> <b>will</b> dies, the will irrevocably binds the other signatories. This is dependent on several things. Firstly, there must be evidence of a contract between the signatories demonstrating that each would make a will in a certain form, and neither would revoke it, as in Walters v Olins. Secondly, the will must {{make it clear that}} it is to apply to the other party after death. Until a death occurs, the arrangement is simply a contract and has no effect in equity.|$|R

50|$|The {{rights of}} the {{ultimate}} beneficiaries in the massed estate have undergone considerable change. Under the common law their rights in the first-dying testator’s share of the massed property were real rights, being conferred by will, while their right in the survivor’s share were personal rights only since they were of a semi-contractual nature and since the will of one person cannot confer a real right in the property of another person. It followed that the survivor retained the dominium {{in his or her}} share of the property even after adiation, and could thus validly alienate or mortgage such share. If the survivor went insolvent after adiation and before transfer of the property to’ the beneficiaries the latter would rank merely as concurrent creditors in the insolvent estate. To remedy this state of affairs a vitally important change was made in 1913 by the Administration of Estates Act in respect of <b>mutual</b> <b>wills</b> of spouses married in community of property. Where such a will effected a massing and the survivor adiated, the Act in effect placed the two halves of the joint estate upon exactly the same footing by giving the beneficiaries the same rights in respect of the survivor’s half as they possessed in the half of the first-dying spouse. Given the state of the common law at the time this meant that the beneficiaries acquired real rights in the entire estate. Under the modern system of administering deceased estates, however, the beneficiaries under a will acquire only personal rights against the executor before transfer to them of the bequeathed property.|$|E
