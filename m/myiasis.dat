5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular <b>myiasis</b> of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
5|$|Dipterans are an {{important}} group of insects and have a considerable impact on the environment. Some leaf-miner flies (Agromyzidae), fruit flies (Tephritidae and Drosophilidae) and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) are pests of agricultural crops; others such as tsetse flies, screwworm and botflies (Oestridae) attack livestock, causing wounds, spreading disease, and creating significant economic harm. See article: Parasitic flies of domestic animals. A few can even cause <b>myiasis</b> in humans. Still others such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), blackflies (Simuliidae) and drain flies (Psychodidae) impact human health, acting as vectors of major tropical diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} causes of <b>myiasis</b> in {{humans and animals}} are the three {{dipteran}} families Oestridea, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae. <b>Myiasis</b> in humans is clinically categorized in six ways: dermal and subdermal, facial cavity, wound or traumatic, gastrointestinal, vaginal, and generalized. If found in humans, the dipteran larvae are usually in their first instar. The only treatment necessary is just to remove the maggots, and the patient heals naturally. Whilst not strictly a <b>myiasis</b> species, the Congo floor maggot feeds on mammal blood, occasionally human.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myiasis</b> is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or necrotic tissue {{in a living}} host by fly larvae. Some flies may just lay their eggs in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of <b>myiasis</b> but is not a fly that is regularly found. <b>Myiasis</b> is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. <b>Myiasis</b> is different from maggot therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on necrotic tissue in order to clean up a wound and aid healing. Maggot therapy can clean up a wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E
25|$|The main medical {{concern with}} this species {{is that it}} causes {{accidental}} enteric, urinary, auricular, and urogenital <b>myiasis.</b> <b>Myiasis</b> is the infestation of animals or humans, where dipterous fly larvae feed on the host's necrotic or living tissue. This is prevalent in small children and bedridden adults living in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis, {{also known}} as the red-tailed flesh fly, is a fly in the Sarcophagidae family. This fly often breeds in carrion and feces, making it a {{possible}} vector for disease. The larvae of this species can cause <b>myiasis,</b> as well as accidental <b>myiasis.</b> It is potentially useful in forensic entomology.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of S. haemorrhoidalis {{may produce}} <b>myiasis</b> on {{necrotic}} or dead flesh.|$|E
25|$|In one {{documented}} case of gastrointestinal <b>myiasis,</b> {{a patient}} was admitted into a neurology clinic, and after several days, maggots {{were found in}} his stool. They were identified as S. haemorrhoidalis through taxonomical means. The accidental <b>myiasis</b> did not contribute to or cause the patient's illness. Because S. haemorrhoidalis rarely invades living tissue, cases such as this are not seen often.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} of {{auricular}} <b>myiasis</b> (on the outer ear) {{on a human}} was reported in Iran in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Mulesing is {{the removal}} of strips of wool-bearing skin from around the breech (buttocks) of a sheep to prevent flystrike (<b>myiasis).</b>|$|E
25|$|C. hominivorax {{is known}} as the primary {{screwworm}} because its larvae produce <b>myiasis</b> and feed on living tissue. This feeding causes deep, pocket-like lesions in the skin, which can be very damaging to the animal host. C. macellaria {{is known as}} the secondary screwworm because its larvae produce <b>myiasis,</b> but feed only on necrotic tissue. This species is forensically important because it is often associated with dead bodies and carcasses. Both C. hominivorax and C. macellaria thrive in warm, tropical areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{veterinary}} {{concern is}} the same as the medical. The flies cause the same kind of <b>myiasis</b> in animals as it does in humans. It mainly only affects domesticated companion animals who are paralyzed or helpless.|$|E
25|$|C. megacephala causes <b>myiasis</b> {{in humans}} and animals. This causes losses in cattle and fish {{industries}} {{all over the}} world. Studies are being done on C. megacephala to determine {{its role as a}} vector for diarrhea-causing bacteria such as E. coli.|$|E
25|$|Accidental <b>myiasis</b> {{can also}} be caused by S. haemorrhoidalis larvae. When meat {{contaminated}} with live larvae is eaten, the maggots can {{make their way into}} the gastrointestinal tract and infest the intestines. The larvae are usually excreted with the feces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myiasis</b> is {{the leading}} entomological {{evidence}} used to prove abuse, and neglect in animals. Leading causes of <b>myiasis</b> in animals occur {{when there is an}} injury or the presence of excretory material, making the living animal alluring to insects. The following characteristics have to be present for <b>myiasis</b> to happen in a pet animal. There has to be abuse or neglect that causes an injury with blood, decaying tissue, feces or urine that attracts flies and the animals must be fairly helpless or incapable of cleaning itself. In long-coated animals, matts and burrs can cause irritation which leads to hot spots, scratching, open lacerations, and infestation. Animals with long mats and coats are especially prone to the building of excrement around the genital area. This circumstance worsens when the animal is elderly or hindered and can no longer clean itself. Risk factors are further intensified if the animals spends most of its life outdoors and is vulnerable to the external environments. Regular grooming and check-ups can significantly reduce these risks. In addition, eliminating other fly attractants, such as uneaten food and fecal matter, can also reduce risks. The summer season is when the highest risk occurs because insects are more common during this time.|$|E
25|$|Blow flies {{have caught}} the {{interest}} of researchers {{in a variety of}} fields, although the large body of literature on calliphorids has been concentrated on solving the problem of <b>myiasis</b> in livestock. The sheep blow fly Lucilia cuprina causes the Australian sheep industry an estimated $170 million a year in losses.|$|E
25|$|Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) is an {{important}} fly with regard to human and animal health. The fly has interesting attributes particular to its family like being able to fly in the rain. This role in sometimes first colonizing corpses at crime scenes along with its capability of <b>myiasis</b> makes this a forensically relevant species.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the <b>myiasis</b> type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece). All these flies have an obligate <b>myiasis</b> life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) <b>myiasis</b> in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.|$|E
25|$|Chrysomya megacephala, more {{commonly}} known as the oriental latrine fly, {{is a member of the}} family Calliphoridae (blowflies). It is a warm-weather fly with a greenish-blue metallic box-like body. The fly infests corpses soon after death, making it important to forensic science. This fly is implicated in some public health issues; it can cause accidental <b>myiasis,</b> and also infects fish and livestock.|$|E
25|$|An {{article from}} Canada had two case studies on people being {{affected}} by F. scalaris {{who were not}} from an underdeveloped country, like the proceeding study in Malaysia. The patients showed similar symptoms, such as <b>myiasis,</b> and had been passing organisms. This illustrates that F. scalaris causes problems for humans globally, not just in underdeveloped regions, {{although it may be}} more prevalent in under developed areas.|$|E
25|$|When larvae of Lucilia feed parasitically {{they cause}} the disease facultative <b>myiasis</b> (facultative = {{opportunistic}} or optional). When this occurs on sheep {{it is often}} known as blow-fly strike. This causes severe distress to the host and may be fatal due to toxemia from ammonia excreted by masses of infesting larvae. Females of Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia and similar genera always seek out their host such as cattle, sheep, dogs, to lay their eggs at vulnerable sites such as a small wound. The larvae hatch and rapidly invade the superficial layers of skin to continue feeding there until ready to pupate. This form of parasitism is essential for these types of fly, and causes obligate <b>myiasis</b> (obligate = necessary or essential). This infestation develops into severe disease and can be fatal if the infestation is at a vulnerable site such as ear or navel of the host. Adult blow-flies {{such as those in}} the Calliphora genus can be significant as transmitters of various bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by Moraxella bovis bacteria and may be transmitted by blow-flies.|$|E
25|$|As the {{secondary}} screwworm {{does not have}} the biological characteristic of single lifetime breeding as does C. hominivorax, no widespread control methods are currently in place beyond the usual pesticide spraying done for general fly control. However, due to its being associated with facultative <b>myiasis,</b> its impact on livestock in the United States is not nearly as severe. It can also be associated with human infestation in poorly run medical facilities and areas stricken by poverty, so vigilance is essential.|$|E
25|$|Secondary screwworms appear {{only around}} an {{existing}} wound (wound {{in this case}} being defined as including the opened cord area of newborn livestock), so practice facultative <b>myiasis.</b> They are attracted most strongly to infected wounds due to the strong odor of the wound’s discharge, but even a small blister or abrasion can serve as an infestation site. Flies can also be induced to lay their eggs in hair or wool that is matted thickly and stained with any bodily fluid.|$|E
25|$|The primary screwworm, C. hominivorax, is a {{parasitic}} species, whose larvae are {{renowned for}} eating and infesting {{the flesh of}} living organisms, primarily warm-blooded animals such as cattle and other livestock. Their larvae cause <b>myiasis,</b> or an infestation of maggots, in lesions or other wounds and injuries that the host animal may have. Fly strikes may occur due to such farming processes as branding, castrating, dehorning, and tailing of the host animals. These processes, along with barbed-wire cuts and flea bites, lead to <b>myiasis</b> in the host animal. Navels of newborns also can be the sites of infestation. C. hominivorax tends to reproduce only on the flesh of a living host. Unlike most other maggots, these maggots attack and consume healthy living tissue along with decaying tissue (hominivorax literally translates to “man-eating”). The larvae are responsible for their common name, the screwworm, because they possess small spines on each body segment that resemble a screw’s threads. After the larvae hatch, they dive into the wound and burrow deeper, perpendicular to the skin surface, eating into live flesh, again resembling a screw being driven into an object. The larvae then continue to feed on the wound fluids and the animal’s tissue.|$|E
25|$|Interaction {{between humans}} and C. macellaria outside of {{accidental}} secondary <b>myiasis</b> has been largely unremarkable, with the notable exception of their early use in surgical maggot therapy. However, given the medical stigma surrounding the screwworm fly, and the slight potential for even C. macellaria to secondarily infest tissue beyond the desired extent of medical use, it has currently fallen out of favor with the medical community, which prefers the predictable Lucilia sericata. Nonetheless, C. macellaria has been and remains a concern for farmers, veterinarians, and public health officials.|$|E
25|$|L. sericata {{has been}} of medical {{importance}} since 1826, when Meigen removed larvae from the eyes and facial cavities of a human patient. L. sericata has shown promise in three separate clinical approaches. First, larvae {{have been shown to}} debride wounds with extremely low probability of <b>myiasis</b> upon clinical application. Larval secretions have been shown to help in tissue regeneration. L. sericata has also been shown to lower bacteremia levels in patients infected with MRSA. Basically, L. sericata larvae can be used as biosurgery agents in cases where antibiotics and surgery are impractical.|$|E
25|$|Maggot {{debridement}} therapy (MDT) is {{the medical}} use of selected, laboratory-raised fly larvae for cleaning nonhealing wounds. Medicinal maggots perform debridement by selectively eating only dead tissue. Lucilia sericata (Phaenicia sericata), or the common green bottlefly, {{is the preferred}} species used in maggot therapy. <b>Myiasis</b> (maggot infestation) by non-medicinal maggots is not always therapeutic - {{in addition to the}} possibility of introducing microbes, some species of maggots eat healthy tissue as well, such as screwworms. MDT can be used to treat pressure ulcers, diabetic foot wounds, venous stasis ulcers, and postsurgical wounds.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{was used to}} eradicate Cochliomyia hominivorax screw-worm fly from the USA where the flies were endemic, and from Libya where {{there had been an}} accidental importation from South America. Although this species of blowfly under natural conditions has larvae of the obligate <b>myiasis</b> type, it is possible to colonize the entire life-cycle in large factory conditions. Massive numbers pupae are sterilized by irradiation. When released these flies mate with the wild flies and the matings produce no offspring. The reproductive rate of the wild flies can be reduced to the level of eradication. Eradication schemes are being extended in the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Adults may be vectors of {{pathogens}} {{of diseases}} such as dysentery. Flies, most commonly Calliphoridae, have frequently been associated with disease transmission in humans and animals, as well as <b>myiasis.</b> Studies and research have linked Calliphora and Lucilia to vectors of causal agents of bacterial infections. These larvae, commonly seen on decaying bodies, feed on carrion while the adults can be necrophagous or vegetative. During the process of decay, microorganisms (e.g. Mycobacterium) may be released through the body. Flies arrive at the scene and lay their eggs. The larvae begin eating and breaking down the corpse, simultaneously ingesting these organisms {{which is the first}} step of one transmission route.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the process}} of {{clinical}} diagnosis begins and <b>myiasis</b> is recognised, the larvae are fairly easy to identify. Their overall body structure resembles the spiraled screw shape on which their common name is based, a shape fairly unusual within parasitic larvae. The cranial end of the larvae has two sharply curved hooks, generally dark in color, and distinctive spiracle patterns are observed at the caudal end. The most identifying features, and {{the easiest way to}} differentiate between C. hominivorax and C. macellaria, are the prominent darkened tracheal tubes which are visible in the final third of the larval body of the former, and are often visible both with a microscope and to the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|C. rufifacies {{has been}} used {{successfully}} in maggot therapy to treat patients with osteomyelitis, a microbial infection of the bone. C. rufifacies can be a vector for enteric pathogens {{in countries such as}} India and Australia, specifically, if it enters homes due to its attraction to feces, fruits, meats, and refuse. Multiple pathogens such as Bacillus bacteria, roundworms, and pinworms have been recovered from the alimentary canal and feces of C. rufifacies. The late instars of the species are beneficial medically by acting as predators of maggots of pathogen-transmitting and myiasis-producing flies; thus, the larvae can be used as beneficial and effective biological control agents. However, certain strains from Australia, India, and Hawaii have been documented to have instars that are harmful when involved in secondary <b>myiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chrysomya rufifacies is {{a species}} {{belonging}} to the blow fly family, Calliphoridae, and is most significant {{in the field of}} forensic entomology due to its use in establishing or altering post mortem intervals. The common name for the species is the hairy maggot blow fly, and it belongs to the genus Chrysomya, which is commonly referred to as the Old World screwworms. This genus includes other species such as Chrysomya putoria and Chrysomya bezziana, which are agents of <b>myiasis.</b> C. rufifacies prefers very warm weather and has a relatively short lifecycle. It is widely distributed geographically and prefers to colonize large carcasses over small ones. The species commonly has a greenish metallic appearance and is important medically, economically, and forensically.|$|E
25|$|Lucilia cuprina {{is one of}} {{many species}} of the family Calliphoridae. Though many of its species have similar characteristics, L. cuprina’s closest {{relative}} is its sister species, Lucilia sericata. These flies are very similar in appearance and morphological characteristics, which can sometimes cause errors when trying to differentiate between them. They each exhibit specific genetic variations which can be distinguished by using random amplified polymorphic DNA and/or mitochondrial DNA sequences, and are known to cause <b>myiasis</b> (flystrike) in sheep. They are both one of the first blow flies to arrive at a corpse and each have smooth larva. Unlike L. cuprina, L. sericata does not usually infest live sheep. L. cuprina is a worldwide sheep pest though it is usually found in dry climates. L. sericata has a coastal distribution.|$|E
25|$|C. rufifacies is {{of primary}} {{forensic}} {{importance in the}} field of medicocriminal entomology and aids in establishing post mortem intervals. The species will become more significant ecologically, medically, and forensically as it displaces other native species and becomes a dominant blow fly. Future research is directed toward examining the potential effects of the widespread distribution of this species. C. rufifacies competes with the native Cochliomyia macellaria species and may cause the latter to become extinct. The fly has been successful in competing with other species in many regions of the world. This newly achieved success will require close monitoring of the species to examine its ecological effects and determine any serious involvement in <b>myiasis.</b> Further research in the developmental and successional behavior of the species will allow for more accurate post mortem interval calculations {{in the field of}} medicocriminal entomology.|$|E
25|$|Fannia scalaris, {{also known}} as the latrine fly, is a fly species in the Fanniidae family. This species is smaller and more slender than the house fly, Musca domestica, and is similar in {{appearance}} to the lesser house fly, Fannia canicularis. The life cycle of this species can be as long as one month. These flies are globally distributed in urban areas as they are drawn to unsanitary environments. F. scalaris is a major cause of <b>myiasis,</b> the infestation of a body cavity by fly maggots. The adults infest bodies that have decomposed, making the species an important part of forensic entomology. The larvae of this fly have adapted protuberances, or feathered appendages, that allow them to survive in such a moist environment. Entomologists continue to research the effects that F. scalaris may have medically, forensically, and on the environment around them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myiasis</b> often {{occurs in}} wild, and {{domestic}} animals. In particular, rabbits, pigs, dogs and sheep can be victims of “blowfly strike” {{because of the}} urine or fecal matter stuck to their fur, fleece, or hind quarters through neglect, poor captivity and living conditions, or ill-health. “Blowfly strike” is a well-recognized and economically damaging problem primarily seen in sheep. “Blowfly strike” is estimated to cost the Australian sheep industry at least $161 million annually. 9 of the 10 cases submitted by the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association stated that the insects colonizing most animals were the metallic Blue-Green Blow Fly (Lucilia illustris, Meigen) or the Green Bottle Fly (Phaenicia sericata, Meigen). In the one case, the larvae of botfly (Cuterebra jellison, Curran) colonized a pet rabbit. Lucilia illustris and Phaenicia sericata are common and ubiquitous blow fly species that are frequently reported in forensic cases involving human homicide and wildlife crime.|$|E
