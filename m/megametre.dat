The symbol (Mm) can also be confused with millimetres (mm). <b>Megametres</b> are also occasionally found in science fiction.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>megametre</b> (International {{spelling}} as {{used by the}} International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: Mm) or megameter (American spelling) is a unit {{of length}} in the metric system, equal to one million metres, the SI base unit of length, hence to [...] or approximately 621.37 miles.|$|E
50|$|The kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, {{and smaller}} are common. (However, the {{decimetre}} is rarely used.) The micrometre {{is often referred}} to by the non-SI term micron. In some fields, such as chemistry, the ångström (equal to 0.1 nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The femtometre, used mainly in particle physics, is usually called a fermi. For large scales, <b>megametre,</b> gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as astronomical units, light years, and parsecs; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.|$|E
50|$|Assured of {{the backing}} of the {{powerful}} Calles and a presidential victory, Cárdenas took the opportunity to actively campaign in many parts of Mexico rather than remaining in Mexico City. His 25 <b>megametre</b> campaign accomplished several things, including making direct contact with regions and constituents who had never seen a presidential candidate before and thus building Cárdenas a personal power base. The campaign also allowed him to refine and articulate for popular consumption what he considered the important elements of the Six Year Plan. On the campaign trail, he acted more like someone already in office than a candidate, settling disputes between groups. He reached out to Mexican workers, as well as peasants, to whom he promised land reform. Cárdenas promised Amerindians schools and educational opportunities, and urged them to join with workers against exploitative practices.|$|E

Eight shot signals from five different sites near Cape Town were received at three widely spaced hydrophones at Ascension over a number of 4. 4 <b>Megametre</b> lines. These signals show the effects of (1) sources at different depths relative to the axis of the sound channel, (2) blocking and partial blocking of direct rays by seamounts and narrow undersea ridges and (3) a sound speed profile displaced downwards by a filament of warm surface water. Comparisons with ray trace and normal mode models show that some of the received signals consist of a combination of slower, refracted rays and faster rays reﬂected off Walvis ridge. The reflected energy starts earlier and has a greater amplitude than would be expected from ray trace modelling. This energy will act as noise and make ATOC (Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate) determinations more difficult...|$|E
