40|$|<b>Window</b> <b>regulator</b> {{system is}} {{becoming}} a complicated mechatronic system. To obtain and improve understandings of system behaviors, this work developed models and simulations. To realize the target, system simulation with uniformed modeling language, VHDL-AMS, is chosen as tool. At first, dynamic behavior of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> system is studied with method of averaging by a highly abstracted model. As next, main components, e. g. electrical drive, lifting mechanism, door frame and electronic system, are studied and modelled. Parametrization achieves with information from suppliers, existing data bank and measurements. Component models are verified and validated against their measurements. Afterwards, system simulation is built up by assembling component models. As verification and validation, system simulations are compared to measurements. As applications, simulations are used to investigate anti-pinch processes, influence of drum diameter and so on. Depending on the purpose of usage, they can be further improved. As summary, simulation provides support in development of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> systems.

40|$|The {{development}} of windows based user interface {{has introduced a}} new dimension to the field of human computer interaction. Now a user is able to perform multiple tasks at a time, often switching from one task to another. However windows environment also imposes the burden of <b>manual</b> <b>windows</b> management on the user. Several studies have suggested that <b>manual</b> <b>window</b> management is an unproductive chore often resulting in clutter and confusion on the display screen. Therefore we need a automatic windows layout generator to free the user to perform other useful tasks. This thesis introduces SPORDAC {Shadow Propagation for Overlap Removal and Display Area Compaction) algorithm. This algorithm aims to remove overlap from the display layout and encapsulate the layout in the finite display area. The SPORDAC prototype integrates the SPORDAC algorithm with simulated annealing to optimise the display area usage. The usefulness and applicability of the SPORDAC approach are illustrated with the implementation of a prototype, samples of generated layouts and analysis of the collected dat...|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} for washing the building windows are stored {{on the roof}} of the building. There are two types: one is automatic and the other is <b>manual.</b> The automatic <b>window</b> washing machines run on rails on the sides of the building. This machine can clean a window in 2.6 seconds. It consumes 426,000 gallons of water per run to clean the entire tower. The other machine is a <b>manual</b> <b>window</b> washing cradle. Both of these {{machines for}} cleaning the windows are supported by rails that run around the outside of the pyramid roof and that are bolted down into the maintenance floor itself.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{was mostly}} based on {{existing}} F-Series architecture. The cab {{was derived from}} the Japanese Mazda Titan introduced in 2000. Standard features included <b>manual</b> <b>windows</b> and steel wheels and a painted grille; for an extra cost, power windows could be added alongside a chrome grille, bumper, and wheels. Styled similar to the Super Duty trucks, the grille of the LCF differed from its International counterpart, which featured vertical bars.|$|R

It {{included}} the following features: sixteen-inch styled steel wheels, sixteen-inch tires, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, <b>manual</b> <b>windows</b> and door locks, an A/M-F/M stereo with a single-disc CD player (later, single-disc CD/MP3 player) and auxiliary audio input jack (on most models), a four-speaker sound system, air conditioning, and the 3.7L [...] "Power-Tech" [...] V6 engine, which was the only available engine on the ST model.|$|R
50|$|Base: The Base was the least-expensive {{trim level}} of the Plymouth Breeze from 1994-1999, and the only {{available}} trim level for the Breeze's final year of production in 2000. The Base included the following standard equipment: a 2.0L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, a five-speed manual transmission, fifteen-inch black steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, an A/M-F/M stereo with four speakers, full instrumentation, air conditioning, cloth seats, and <b>manual</b> <b>windows</b> and door locks.|$|R
2500|$|The Graduate was {{intended}} as a less expensive [...] "entry-level" [...] Alfa. While it had the same engine and transmission as the Quadrifoglio and Veloce, it lacked the alloy wheels and luxury features of the other two models. The Graduate model had <b>manual</b> <b>windows,</b> basic vinyl seats, a vinyl top, and steel wheels as standard. Air conditioning and a dealer-installed radio were the only options. It first appeared in 1985 in North America and continued until 1990.|$|R
30|$|Passive cooling {{strategies}} of evaporative cooling, natural ventilation, ground cooling and radiant cooling were discussed by Santamouris (2007). Three passive cooling strategies were tested for shading and non-shading system {{to determine their}} applicability in warm climates (La Roche and Milne 2004). Thermal performance of a passive cooling system of earth pipe cooling was investigated experimentally and numerically for a subtropical climate in Queensland, Australia (Ahmed et al. 2013, 2014 a, b). To reduce energy consumption, an air-cooled chiller system in an office building was analysed using passive cooling (Chowdhury et al. 2009). The use of advanced passive cooling was explored {{in the context of}} complex non-domestic buildings (Rajapaksha and Hyde 2012). This study evaluated the present barriers and opportunities associated with the challenges of passive cooling through monitoring of an innovative case study of a building in southeast Queensland in Australia. The feasibility of passive cooling in newly built office buildings in the temperate climate of Belgium was assessed using standardised adaptive comfort criteria (Parys et al. 2012). In this research, two passive cooling schemes were studied: diurnal <b>manual</b> <b>window</b> operation and the combination of diurnal <b>manual</b> <b>window</b> operation and passive night ventilation.|$|R
50|$|After having {{sold more}} than 40,000 devices, {{production}} was stopped and sold to India in 1958, allowing Max Brose to focus on products for the automotive industry. The <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> {{became one of the}} company's main pillars. In 1963, the company began series production of this product fitted {{for the first time with}} an electrical drive. In 1968, Brose ventured into a new key segment - the seat systems business - with the production of seat recliners for adjusting backrests.|$|R
