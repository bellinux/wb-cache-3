Using mind control, Strahd will try to force a PC to attack Ireena and gain her love by [...] "saving" [...] her from the situation he created.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Kérékou's move to Marxism-Leninism was motivated mainly by pragmatic considerations, and that Kérékou himself was not actually a leftist radical; the new ideology offered a means of legitimization, a way of distinguishing the new regime from those that had preceded it, and was based on broader unifying principles than the politics of ethnicity. Kérékou's regime initially included officers from both the north and south of the country, but as the years passed the northerners (like Kérékou himself) became clearly dominant, undermining the idea that the regime was not based in ethnicity. By officially adopting Marxism-Leninism, Kérékou <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> to win the support of the country's leftists.|$|R

5000|$|Gauguin's {{attendance}} at the execution was {{as a result of}} the deep shock left by Van Gogh's self-mutilation. Writer Jerome Winer suggests that Gauguin may have felt guilty over his treatment of Van Gogh to identify with Prado. According to Bradley Collins, [...] "There is no question that Gauguin would have strongly associated Vincent with the execution". [...] Collins continues, [...] "If Gauguin had been terrified by the sight of the near-dead Vincent curled up in his bloody sheets, he may have had the counterphobic desire to reassure himself of his courage by taking an unflinching look at Prado's execution. He <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> to glory in his own innocence and another's guilt." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Description Logic (DL) {{knowledge}} bases (KBs) {{allow to}} express knowledge about concepts and individuals {{in a formal}} way. This knowledge is typically crisp, i. e., an individual either is an in-stance of a given concept or it is not. However, in practice this is often too restrictive: when querying for instances, one <b>may</b> often <b>also</b> <b>want</b> to find suitable alternatives, i. e., individuals that are not instances of query concept, but could still be considered ‘good enough’. Relaxed instance queries have been introduced to gradually relax this infer-ence in a controlled way via the use of concept similarity measures (CSMs). So far, those algorithms only work for the DL EL, which has limited expressive power. In this paper, we introduce a suitable CSM for EL++-concepts. EL++ adds nominals, role inclusion axioms, and concrete domains to EL. We extend the algorithm to compute relaxed instance queries w. r. t. this new CSM, and thus to work for general EL++ KBs. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{transfer}} of copyright from author to publisher, {{used by some}} journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere {{without the need for}} permission.

5000|$|Tensions mounted {{again after}} 1805, erupting into the War of 1812, when the Americans {{declared}} war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships {{on the high seas}} and seizure ("Impressment") of 6,000 sailors from American ships, severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American [...] "honor" [...] was an implicit issue. The Americans were outgunned by more than 10 to 1 by the Royal Navy, but could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible, and most advantegous means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of Native American resistance to the westward expansion of the United States, typified by Tecumseh's coalition of tribes. Americans <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> to annex Canada.|$|R

He also sought to counter any adventure by King John of England, who had marriage and fealty ties also with the Toulouse comtal house.

50|$|In 1851 Greenhill {{resigned}} his Radcliffe Infirmary {{post and}} briefly attempted practice as an Oxford physician. However, he moved {{later that year}} to Hastings on grounds of health, though he <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>wanted</b> to escape Oxford's febrile religious controversies. For many years he was physician to the St. Leonards and East Sussex Infirmary. His investigations of mortality rates in Hastings showed the insanitary conditions of artisan housing, despite the town's new popularity as a health resort. In 1857 he founded the Hastings Cottage Improvement Society, and was its secretary from 1857 to 1891: this company bought up and improved insanitary accommodation, as well as building new housing of a better standard. The venture's success prompted Greenhill to promote the idea at the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science, and establish a similar organisation in London, the London Labourers' Dwellings Society, {{of which he was}} secretary from 1862 to 1876. On Gladstone's recommendation, Greenhill was granted a civil list pension of £60 in 1881. At {{the time of his death}} at The Croft, Hastings, aged 81, Greenhill had outlived his wife and his eldest daughter and son, who had each died young; one son and one daughter survived him.|$|R
