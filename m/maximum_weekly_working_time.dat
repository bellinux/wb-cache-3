50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} all {{time he was}} {{required}} {{to be at the}} hospital, even when sleeping, was to be regarded as working time. The Directive, after the SIMAP case could not be taken to treat inactive on call time as a rest period. Dr Jaeger, by being required to stay at work was subject to greater constraints than a doctor at home, because he was kept apart from his family and social environment. The 1994 Act breached the Directive by letter Dr Jaeger’s collective agreement proide for offsetting of only active on call time. Under Art 17, a derogation to allow for a reduction of the daily minimum rest of 8 hours could only be granted if a period of rest followed immediately, and a reduction could not allow the <b>maximum</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> to be exceeded.|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-5/15, Matja Kumba, the {{national}} court asked, firstly, whether an average weekly working time of 84 hours (7-7 rotation) in a cohabitant care arrangement constitutes {{a breach of}} Article 6 of the Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC); secondly, whether a national provision, under which an employee’s consent to working more than 60 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement cannot be revoked, {{is compatible with the}} rights that employees have under the Directive; and thirdly, whether a dismissal following a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment” within the meaning of the Directive. With regard to the first question, the Court noted that it is for {{the national}} court to assess the amount of working time in the case at hand, taking into account the factors clarified by the Court. Working time amounting to an average of 84 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement is compatible with Article 6 of the Directive, in circumstances governed by Article 22(1)(a), provided that the worker has explicitly, freely and individually agreed to perform such work, and the general principles of the protection of the safety and health of the worker are observed. With regard to the second question, the Court noted that the Directive does not contain a provision concerning revocation of consent. It is for national law to determine whether such revocation of consent is possible. However, a complete inability to revoke consent, even in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, may prove incompatible with the Directive, since the possibility for a worker to consent to exceeding the <b>maximum</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is expressly conditional on the EEA State respecting the general principles of the protection of {{the health and safety of}} workers, cf. Article 22(1)(a) of the Directive. With regard to the third question, the Court noted that, typically, a dismissal due to a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment”. However, a notice of dismissal and offer of re-engagement on new terms, following a refusal by a worker to agree to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period, is not to be considered a “detriment” if the termination of the employment is based upon reasons that are fully independent of the worker’s refusal to agree to perform such additional work.|$|E

However, with The Swedish Model {{it is possible to}} diverge from the law-regulations by collective agreement by the parts of the Swedish labor market. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the national and international law regulations and further on study a few selected Swedish central collective agreements to discover in which extension deviation from the law occur. The sections of the Working Hours Act’s that has been investigated is ordinary working time, daily rest, weekly rest periods, breaks and <b>maximum</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> To do this, a jurisprudential method has been used. The examination shows that agreements made by the parts of the labor market highly differentiate from Swedish law. This is due to adjustments to local conditions and flexible purposes. This effects the workers as the terms of their working hours can be found in different documents, international or Swedish law as well as in central or local collective agreements. Another effect of the deviation from the law is that the workers-organizations receive a great amount of power and influence of the workers working-conditions. They are responsible for negotiating for all the workers, whether they are members in the workers-organization or not. The Working Hours Act and the Work Environment Act have strong connections and the Swedish Working Environment Authority {{is currently working on a}} provision regarding the organizational and social working conditions. If it will be approved later this year it may influence the upcoming collective agreements. However, as of today, there is no assurance that the provision will be accepted.

30|$|Both {{employers}} and employees can benefit from WTA (Seifert 2004): employers {{are interested in the}} ability to adjust employees’ daily or <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> if the demand for and availability of personnel vary over time.

Employees are able to reconcile their work-life balance. The positive and negative effects of flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> on employees also affect firm’s profits. If employers are able to improve the working conditions of their employees, they can fill vacant positions more quickly and at a lower cost. Establishments have possibilities to weaken negative and strengthen positive effects. Better capacity utilization can be achieved by WTA insofar as capital costs can be saved and storage costs can be reduced. A more efficient utilization of labor is a central objective of WTA (Zapf 2012). Employers are better able to meet demand fluctuations and can better avoid the wage costs associated with workforce under-utilization.|$|R

Furthermore, this section {{deals with the}} use of flexible forms of work in the Czech and Slovak Republics. It was found that in both countries, in comparison with other European countries, flexible forms of work, including the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts, are not as popular. In the Czech Republic, it is only used by 38 % of companies, mainly by the ones with over 50 employees. It is used most often in a situation where the employer wishes to retain qualified personnel, but doesn´t have work for them temporarily. The second part analyzes the use of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> accounts in terms of company XY. It was found that the employees are not particularly satisfied with the length of the balancing period and don´t like working in the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> account. This work confirmed that the main disadvantage of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> account is associated with increased administration of working hours and wages records. An advantage for the employer is the ability to adapt working hours to the need of work. For employees, it is job security and constant wage...|$|R
40|$|Food {{farming in}} Oyo North, Nigeria is characterised by an {{increasing}} use of Intermediary Mode of Transportation (IMT) to ease inputs and outputs mobility and farm access. To assess the influence on food farmer’s productivity, {{a random sample of}} 230 respondents was selected and data collected on their socio-economic and farm specific characteristics. Descriptive statistics, Herfindhal Index and Technical Efficiency Approach were used to analyse the data. The results indicate that majority of food farmers were in their middle age with mean age of 50 years and most of them used one plot at a location between 5 and 10 km to their village of residence. They acquired land by inheritance and practiced intensive crop diversification as risk management strategy. The transportation modes used in addition to walking include bicycle, motorcycle, and car with increasing trend in the use of motorcycle. The mean Technical Efficiency (TE) of food farmers was 0. 82 with significant inefficiency effects. The inefficiency analysis indicates positive effect of distance, crop diversification and un-tarred type of road on farmer’s productivity, while poor level of education among farmers, use of bicycle; trekking and <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> negatively affect farmer’s efficiency. The negative effect of trekking and use of bicycle and the excess <b>working</b> <b>time</b> suggest the adoption of more IMT of motorized type to optimize farming time and increase farmer’s productivity...|$|R
40|$|We use {{longitudinal}} individual wage, hours, {{and employment}} data {{to investigate the}} effect of the February 1, 1982 mandatory reduction of <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> hours in France. Just after François Mitterrand's election in May 1981, the government decided to increase the minimum wage by 5 %. Then, as promised in its electoral program, the socialist government reduced the workweek from 40 to 39 hours. At the same time, it mandated stable monthly earnings for minimum wage workers and recommended the stabilization of monthly earnings for other workers (recommendations followed by 90 % of the firms). We show that workers directly affected by these changes - those working 40 hours in March 1981 - were more likely to lose their jobs between 1981 and 1982 than workers not affected by the changes - those working 36 to 39 hours in March 1981. Moreover, because the decree enforcing the new standard was issued faster than earlier promises, some firms had no time to complete negotiations and their workers were still working 40 hours after February 1, 1982. We show that these workers have also been strongly affected by the reduction in standard hours. Our estimates of the impact of this one-hour reduction of the workweek on employment losses vary between 2 % and 4 %, depending on the methodology or the data used. Furthermore, we show that minimum wage workers have been most affected by the changes. This result, consistent with our model, is due to the impossibility of adjusting their monthly wage which results in excess job destruction and creation. These results should help us understand the possible effects of the upcoming mandatory reduction of hours in France, where the <b>maximum</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>working</b> hours will gradually decline from 39 to 35 hours beginning in the year 2000. Similar projects are envisaged in other European countries, which hope that reductions in hours will be an efficient policy for reducing unemployment. Hours Reduction; Unemployment; Wages...|$|R
