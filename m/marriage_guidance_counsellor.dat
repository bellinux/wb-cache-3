40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} in which Masters' and Johnson's rapid-treatment (14 -day) programme for sexual difficulties was modified to once-a-week out-patient attendance; in which couples attending for treatment were allocated to treatment by two therapists of opposite sex, (cotherapy), or one therapist of either sex (single therapy); {{and in which}} observations were made upon the therapeutic efficacy of <b>marriage</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in treating sexual problems, following appropriate training, {{in comparison with the}} outcome results of an experienced clinician. By way of introduction, a survey of the literature prior to the publication of Masters' and Johnson's "Human Sexual Inadequacy" in 1970 identifies four main strands of therapeutic practice and development which potentiated the uptake of Masters' and Johnson's ideas. These four strands - the psychoanalytic, the sociological, the cultural and the behavioural - are related to the period of questioning about professional knowledge of sexual function that Masters' and Johnson's "Human Sexual Response" of 1967 provoked. The-marriage <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellor</b> training group is described in detail by reference to personality characteristics, as defined by the 16 PF test, and sexual knowledge, as assessed by the Sexual Knowledge Inventory (SKI). Results are compared with a population of <b>marriage</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors.</b> The effects of training are demonstrated by changes in the acquisition of sexual knowledge in the training group and by improvement in diagnostic skills over the period of training. Under the two conditions of cotherapy and single therapy, it is demonstrated that there are significant differences in favour of cotherapy, on the basis of an analysis of variance of questionnaires completed independently by therapists, by client couples, and by an external assessor. Therapists recorded their judgements before and after treatment, whilst client couples and an external assessor made judgements at the conclusion of treatment only. Analysis of the questionnaire results suggested however that treatment produced greater effects upon the general and sexual relationships of presenting couples than upon their sexual function, though all treatment procedures produced some change in all three aspects. It was concluded that further work might isolate in more specific detail the differential effects of treatment upon sexual function as distinct from appreciation of the sexual relationship and the general relationship. In modifying the time structure of treatment from a daily to a weekly procedure, it was observed that treatment typically took 12 sessions over 17 weeks but that there wide variations both between and within specific disorders. <b>Marriage</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> were shown to establish treatment results that were of the same order of success as an experienced clinician. Final observations made proposals for modifying the diagnostic schema proposed by Masters and Johnson, and reflected upon the nature of cotherapy...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} investigated the role secondary school <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> believed they played in the course selection process, especially regarding the continuation of French {{as a second language}} (FSL). As new initiatives have been recently introduced to increase retention in all FSL programs throughout Ontario (OME, 2013 a), this study also sought to identify the factors <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> believed contributed to students continuing (or not continuing) the study of FSL past the mandatory Grade 9 credit. The following research questions guided this study: (1) How do <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> describe the process of course selection, with regards to FSL in particular?; (2) How do <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> view their role in the course selection process?; and (3) What do <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> identify as factors that contribute to students continuing (or not continuing) the study of FSL past Grade 9 ? Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> from 12 schools across one school board in Ontario. Analysis of the insights shared by <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> highlight the complexities of the course selection process, as well as the strategies and tools they each used to prepare students to make the most informed decisions regarding their course selection. When counselling students about continuing optional FSL courses after Grade 9, participants expressed that they would encourage the pursuit of FSL courses, if the topic was student initiated. Emerging evidence showed that core French and French immersion students were counselled differently, with the latter receiving more attention if they expressed a desire to leave the program. Finally, <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> identified a wide variety of reasons they believed affected retention and attrition rates at their schools, with the most common being for future employment purposes and not seeing the value in learning French...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Suicide is {{the primary}} cause of death of {{adolescents}} in Ireland. While much attention has been given this phenomenon, no research has specifically examined the role of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in secondary schools in Ireland in addressing this phenomenon. The purpose of this research was to examine the self-efficacy of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in Ireland for identifying and assessing students at risk for suicide, including four hypothesized predictors for such self-efficacy. These predictors were gender, institution of training, membership of the Irish Institute of Guidance and Counselling, and exposure to a suicidal student. The participants were 405 members of the Irish Institute of Guidance Counselling, a professional organization whose membership was inclusive of all <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in secondary schools in Ireland. The instrument utilized was entitled Adolescent Suicide, and included fourteen questions measuring the three components of self-efficacy (i. e., efficacy expectations, outcome expectations and outcome values). The results were analyzed using measures of central tendency and logistic regression. Analyses using measures of central tendency indicated that Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> as a whole had high global self-efficacy when it comes to intervening with suicide. Logistic regression analyses supported two of the four hypothesized predictors. In terms of the gender predictor variable, males were almost three times more likely than females to have high suicide intervention self-efficacy. In terms of the exposure to suicidal ideation variable, Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> who were exposed to suicide in their work were more than {{three times more likely to}} have high suicide intervention self-efficacy than those <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> who had no such exposure. While the global suicide intervention self-efficacy score was high for the majority of Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors,</b> individual item level analyses of the Adolescent Suicide instrument revealed areas of low suicide intervention self-efficacy in the efficacy expectation and outcome expectation components. In particular, Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> questioned their ability to recognize a student at risk for suicide. The limitations of the present study were presented. Also, the research and professional practice implications of the findings of this study were discussed...|$|R

40|$|Guidance and {{counselling}} {{services have}} been an important feature of the New Zealand secondary education system for two decades now. However, {{there have been few}} official policy statements and little research on the subject, hence an adequate definition and prescription for the role of the <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellor</b> has not been produced. What type of work <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> do and how they perform their jobs has never been suitably examined in this country and it is something little known even to those who are actually involved in the service. What is known has been restricted to propositions provided by literature, which generally states what and how guidance counselling ought to be carried out, but rarely what is actually taking place. The actual role performance of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> has been sought mostly by means of questionnaire survey studies. The present study made a day-to-day recording of the activities and the time allocated to the various activities of three practising <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in three New Zealand secondary schools. The recording was carried out from June to August, 1979. Each counsellor was requested to make a detailed daily recording of all the activities undertaken and {{the amount of time spent}} on them. These records were then collected from the counsellors at the end of each week; the materials were collated and arranged into various categories and the amount of time for each was calculated. Comparisons were made among the three <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in the activities undertaken and some comparison was also made with a comprehensive New Zealand questionnaire study. The overall results showed that the three <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> were involved in similar work patterns and about a third of their activities were in educational, vocational, and personal-social guidance areas which involved direct contacts with pupils whilst the remaining activities involved administrative duties, staff liaison, liaison with various supporting services, and a series of other minor responsibilities.
