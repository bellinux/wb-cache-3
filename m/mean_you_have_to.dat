[...] Now {{reviewer}} Evan Davies wrote that although the group's fans and label had expectations, it [...] "doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put out the exact same fucking album twice in a row." [...] According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: [...] "energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group [...] "amped up their sound," [...] with Valentine [...] "delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses." [...] Hoard called most of the album's songs [...] "skull-rattling slasher with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle." [...] For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album [...] "tables the discussion" [...] of whether Taking Back Sunday [...] "embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed." [...] Cohen concluded, [...] "As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell." ...|$|E

Beaver tells off his female classmates, telling Violet Rutherford she drinks gutter water, calling Linda Dennison a [...] "smelly old ape" [...] and threatening to punch Judy Hensler if she [...] "gets mushy" [...] on him. Though loathing girls his own age, Beaver develops crushes on schoolteachers Miss Canfield and Miss Landers, and in one episode says he's going to marry a [...] "mother" [...] when the time comes. Beaver disparages marriage saying, [...] "just because you're married doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> like girls." [...] In the later seasons, Beaver has adjusted his outlook somewhat and dates a few girls.|$|E
2500|$|In Silvestri's {{first meeting}} with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, [...] "To {{have some kind of}} musical {{signature}} either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." [...] For this central theme, a fanfare for Captain America, Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to [...] "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of Aaron Copland's [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man". He noted that Captain America is a [...] "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing [...] "a really bad guy" [...] in the Red Skull in a similar way to Luke Skywalker's development in the presence of Darth Vader. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and [...] "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character when he talks about his tortured past. He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.|$|E
