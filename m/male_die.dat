50|$|Tools {{and punches}} can be interchanged for {{different}} part requirements.One advantage of hydroforming is the savings on tools. For sheet metal only a draw ring and punch (metalworking) or <b>male</b> <b>die</b> is required. Depending {{on the part}} being formed, the punch {{can be made from}} epoxy, rather than metal. The bladder of the hydroform itself acts as the female die eliminating the need to fabricate it. This allows for changes in material thickness to be made with usually no necessary changes to the tool. However, dies must be highly polished and in tube hydroforming a two-piece die is required to allow opening and closing.|$|E
50|$|Rubber pad forming can be {{accomplished}} in many different ways, and as technology has advanced, so have the applications for this simple process. In general, an elastic upper die, usually made of rubber, is connected to a hydraulic press. A rigid lower die, often called a form block, provides the mold for the sheeted metal to be formed to. Because the upper (<b>male)</b> <b>die</b> {{can be used with}} separate lower (female) dies, the process is relatively cheap and flexible. The worked metal is not worn as quickly as in more conventional processes such as deep drawing, however, rubber pads exert less pressure in the same circumstances as non-elastic parts, which may lead to less definition in forming, and rubber pads wear more quickly than steel parts.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of hydroforming is that complex shapes {{can be made}} in one step. In sheet hydroforming (SHF) with the bladder acting as the <b>male</b> <b>die</b> almost limitless geometries can be produced. However, the process is limited by the very high closing force required in order to seal the dies, especially for large panels and thick hard materials. Small concave corner radii are difficult to be completely calibrated, i.e. filled, because too large a pressure would be required. in fact, the die closing force can be very high, both in tube and sheet hydroforming and may easily overcome the maximum tonnage of the forming press. In order to keep the die closing force under prescribed limits, the maximum internal fluid pressure must be limited. This reduces the calibration abilities of the process, i.e. it reduces the possibility of forming parts with small concave radii.Limits of the SHF process are due to risks of excessive thinning, fracture, wrinkling and are strictly related to the material formability and to a proper selection of process parameters (e.g. hydraulic pressure vs. time curve). Tube hydroforming (THF) can produce many geometric options as well, reducing the need for tube welding operations. Similar limitations and risks can be listed as in SHF; however, the maximum closing force is seldom a limiting factor in THF.|$|E

40|$|Complete {{mortality}} of males after mating {{is known in}} several small dasyurid and didelphid species (up to 300 g) and has previously been suggested to be a consequence of their small size and their inability to sequester sufficient fat reserves for an intense rut in the winter. Males of these species use increased corticosteroid levels to allow protein catabolism, enabling them to support their mating effort with other body reserves. However, increased corticosteroid levels have negative consequences such as anaemia, gastrointestinal ulceration, immune suppression and disease. The Australian dasyurid Dasyurus hallucatus shows complete <b>male</b> <b>die</b> off after mating in tropical savannah, yet males of this species may weigh as much as 1120 g and continue to eat during the rut. Die off in D. hallucatus shows many similarities {{to that in the}} smaller species including weight loss, fur loss, parasite infestation, increased testosterone levels and anaemia. However, in contrast to smaller species, {{there is no evidence of}} elevated corticosteroid levels or gastrointestinal ulceration. Consequently, the phenomenon of <b>male</b> <b>die</b> off after mating lacks a universal explanation...|$|E
40|$|Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) is a {{promising}} sheet-metal-forming technology which is drawing {{more and more}} researchers 2 ̆ 7 attention due to its flexibility of manufacturing three-dimensional products at a relatively low cost for rapid prototyping and small-batch production. This paper {{is focused on the}} thickness distribution and the forming strategy analysis for two point incremental forming with a <b>male</b> <b>die.</b> The analyzed benchmark is half a torus which is generated by revolving a semi-circle. Such a part is hardly able to be formed by single point incremental forming because its slope varies from 0 degree to 90 degrees. In terms of the varying slope, the variant of sine 2 ̆ 7 s law is derived to give an approximate prediction of the thickness distribution from an analytical perspective. In addition, a multi-stage forming strategy is proposed in order to form the part successfully. In particular, a keying operation is implemented carefully in order to avoid twist phenomenon and achieve good dimensional accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Superplastic forming (SPF) of some alloys is a {{manufacturing}} process used {{particularly in the}} aerospace industry. In earlier work, the authors presented a paper on a microcomputer-controlled superplastic bulging machine, the work reported herein extending those developments, a machine for superplastic forming providing workpieces of more uniform wall thickness {{with the aid of}} a microcomputer control system being introduced. This machine can achieve multi-channel data collection, and control over the temperature, the gas pressure (including the bulging pressure and the back pressure) and the position of the <b>male</b> <b>die</b> during the superplastic forming (SPF). A distributed control system is used, the software being programmed according to the modular-design method with C Language, which can enable convenient man-machine interaction during the SPF. Experiments for uniformization of wall thickness, for both can workpieces and basin-shaped shell workpieces (AI-Li alloy), have been undertaken, by means of which it has been demonstrated that workpieces with more uniform wall thickness can be obtained by the use of this machine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were performed by use of stepwise pressurization profiles for gas blow forming of an Mg alloy with a <b>male</b> <b>die.</b> Decreasing the forming time for gas blow forming of a commercially available fine-grained Mg alloy AZ 31 B thin sheet with a thickness of 0. 6 mm has been studied in the present work. The results indicated that it was feasible to form a shallow rectangular pan with a height of 10 mm in less than 320 sec. The distribution of thickness along the transverse {{cross section of the}} formed pan was confirmed by the results as being sensitive to the pressurization profiles. Grain growth was not a serious problem for forming at a temperature of 370 °C. Grain size increased from about 5. 1 μm to a maximum size of about 7. 1 μm. The maximum cavity volume fraction in the formed pan was about 1. 1 % for two different pressurization profiles. Index Terms—AZ 31 B Mg alloy, Gas blow forming, Pressurization profil...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} state of men's health, which is in silent crisis. The male {{mortality}} rate is 60 % higher then the female mortality rate in Canada. Furthermore it is higher for all 10 leading causes of death. The difference in life expectancy is over 5 years between men and women. Contributing to their early demise are so-called preventable deaths, homicide, suicide, vehicle accidents and work accidents which are much more prevalent among males than females. In the U. S. from infancy, males die and suffer serious illnesses at greater rates than females. In fact between the age of 15 and 24, <b>male</b> <b>die</b> at a rate {{more than three times}} that of females. This constitutes a silent health crisis [...] -silent because it is not acknowledged, it is in fact, ignored. In Canada there are five Centres of Excellence devoted to women's health [...] -yet there are none for men's health, which is far worse. In the U. S., the morbidity and mortality rates are proportionally similar. There are eleven Specialized Centers of Research for Women's Health, and none for men. We will explore in this thesis both the reasons for men's ill health relative to women's, and the paradox of the silence. Three major theoretical perspectives: the bio-medical, the environmental, and lifestyle, are examined extensively, as are gender specific theories concerning the role that masculinity plays in contributing to male health. Lastly, I present recommendations for improving men's health. Not only is there an appalling loss of men's lives {{and to a lesser extent}} women's for many reasons, but also it is extremely expensive. The economic costs of male potential years of life lost in 2001 (U. S. data), amounted to $ 329, 836, million dollars per annum. This money would be better invested in preventive care and Centers of Excellence devoted to men's health...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of egg {{presence}} on female mate choice in a fish with paternal care. Females who were allowed a free choice between two males mated within a shorter time than females who {{were randomly assigned to}} a particular male. When a second female was allowed to choose among die males, she preferred the same male as die previous female. This result shows diat females are concordant in their mate choice. When the initial female was randomly assigned to mate with one of two males (forced choice), the second female mated randomly widi respect to the first one. Thus females do not prefer males with eggs. If the initial female was given a free choice, but the eggs were removed from die chosen <b>male,</b> <b>die</b> test female mated randomly. When bodi die males initially had mated but one randomly determined male's eggs were removed, the test female preferred die male who was still guarding eggs. These experiments show that females avoid spawning in unsuccessful nests. When die females in die free choice/egg removal experiment mated widi die unsuccessful male diere was a considerably bigger size difference in favor of diis male dian when the females mated widi die odier male. We conclude diat female sand gobies show clear mate preferences, but that diey do not prefer males with eggs over males widiout eggs. They do, however, avoid mating widi males guarding unsuccessful nests. We dierefore suggest diat egg loss could be an important factor selecting for egg preference.
