A 74 {{year old}} man with a past medical history of esophageal strictures status post dilatation, coronary artery disease status post CABG, and atrial fibrillation presented to hospital with complaints of severe chest pain that began after the consumption of tortilla chips one hour prior to presentation. Electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes were not consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Chest X-ray was consistent with a <b>widened</b> <b>mediastinal</b> silhouette. Contrast esophogram was negative for extra luminal extravasation. CT scan of the chest with oral contrast demonstrated thickening of the mid-thoracic esophagus with an extra-luminal focus of gas in the mediastinum along with fluid along the inferior aspect of the esophagus (Figures 1 and 2). These findings were concerning for esophageal perforation. The patient was taken to the operating room for endoscopy which showed micro perforation in mid-esophagus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Extrapulmonary {{involvement}} by Pneumocystis carinii (PC) in {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) patients is uncommon. Our purpose is to describe three AIDS patients with low cluster differentiation cell (CD 4) counts, who were receiving aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis, and who had large noncalcified hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest radiography, CT, and clinical and laboratory records of three AIDS patients who had radiographic evidence of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Symptoms were quite similar in all patients: weight loss, fever, cough, and mild dyspnea. <b>Mediastinal</b> and hilar <b>widening</b> was noticed on chest radiography. Contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed multiple noncalcified lymphadenopathy with supracarinal predominance in all cases. Mediastinoscopy with mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes sampling was performed in all patients. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimens demonstrated a necrotic foamy tissue without any calcification, and silver stain coloration showed abundant PC organisms in each case. CONCLUSION: In AIDS patients, PC infection {{should be considered as}} a possible cause of noncalcified hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy along with such possibilities as atypical infections and neoplasms, especially in severely immunocompromised hosts (low CD 4) with aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{traumatic}} aortic injury (ATAI) is {{a serious}} clinical condition in patients with multiorgan trauma. It results from motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian-automobile collisions and, less frequently, falls from height. Young men comprise the majority of patients with ATAI. In this publication we present examples of posttraumatic aortic changes identified in CT polytrauma (trauma CT) followed by CT angiography examinations performed between 2010 and 2012 in the CT and MRI Laboratory of Clinical Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging Department in Provincial Hospital No. 2 in Rzeszow. The {{aim of this study}} is to present morphological variants of posttraumatic aortic injuries and potential CT imaging pitfalls. <b>Widened</b> <b>mediastinal</b> silhouette in CT scoutview (topogram) may suggest the presence of posttraumatic lesions of thoracic aorta. In trauma CT scan, a hemorrhage may be suggested by blurring of the border between the aorta and periaortic adipose tissue, and/or increase of mediastinal adipose tissue density. Sudden change in aortic wall outlines, extravasation of blood/contrast medium outside the vessel, and/or delamination (tear) of tunica intima are likely changes visible in CT imaging after administration of contrast medium. When assessing CT examination one should keep in mind possible changes, which may mimic thoracic aortic injury, including thymic residual tissue, "ductus bump" or mediastinal hemorrhage of a different etiology. ATAI is associated with high mortality, which is directly dependent on the time from injury to implementation of treatment. A seemingly good condition of the patient should not influence the extent or rapidity of diagnostic imaging...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mediastinal</b> <b>widening</b> is a {{frequent}} radiological finding in the emergency department patient. The causes of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening</b> {{can be divided into}} traumatic and nontraumatic <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening.</b> An important association of moderate to high velocity trauma is the mediastinal haematoma. It {{may be the result of}} traumatic transsection of the aorta, or it may be due to bleeding from other mediastinal vessels. Before the era of multidetector spiral CT, angiography was the gold standard for the evaluation of patients with a widened mediastinum. Meanwhile, angiography as a risk-carrying invasive examination has widely been replaced by MDCT. However, conventional radiography remains an important diagnostic tool; so does angiography, especially in the context of interventional radiology. Multidetector spiral CT plays an important role (Alkadhi et al., Radiographics 2004; 24 : 1239 - 1255), but usually as a second line procedure.

40|$|Background: Limiting {{the effects}} of a {{large-scale}} bioterrorist anthrax attack will require rapid and accurate detection of the earliest victims. We undertook this study to improve physicians’ ability to rapidly detect inhalational anthrax victims. Methods: We conducted a case-control study to compare chest radiograph findings from 47 patients from historical inhalational anthrax cases and 188 community-acquired pneumonia control subjects. We then used classification tree analyses to derive an algorithm of chest radiograph findings and clinical characteristics that accurately and explicitly discriminated between inhalational anthrax and community-acquired pneumonia. Results: Twenty-two of the 47 patients from historical inhalational anthrax cases (46. 8 %) had reported chest radiograph findings. All 22 case patients (100 %) had <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening,</b> pleural effusion, or both. However, 16 case patients (72. 7 %) also had infiltrates. In comparison, all 188 community-acquired control subjects had reported chest radiographs.

Isolated aneurysms involving the brachiocephalic/innominate vein are extremely rare. We describe detection of a saccular aneurysm of the innominate vein, as the underlying cause of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening</b> seen on a chest radiograph in a 42 -year-old asymptomatic woman.

40|$|Marfan {{syndrome}} is {{a spectrum of}} disorder caused by a heritable genetic defect of connective tissue that has an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The defect itself has been isolated to FBN 1 gene on chromosome 15, which codes for connective tissue protein FIBRIN. A mutation result {{in an increase in}} protein called transforming growth factor ß. Abnormalities in this protein cause a myriad of distinct clinical problems, of which the musculoskeletal, cardiac and ocular system problems predominate. A case report on Marfan syndrome with <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening</b> and sinus tachycardia was reported. This report underscores the significance of thorough family history and physical examination in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Additionally, the effectiveness of therapy can be improved by having a proper insight about the pathology and clinical presentation of Marfan syndrome. Regular ECG, blood pressure monitoring and early initiation of beta blockers therapy as well as elective prophylactic surgical repair contribute to increasing the survival rate of Marfan patients.

40|$|Objective: In this {{retrospective}} study, we {{aimed to}} manifest some clinical, radiologic and demographical features of patients which were admitted to our emergency department and diagnosed with aortic dissection. Materials and Methods: Records of patients diagnosed with aortic dissection in our Emergency Department during March 2009 -March 2011 were scanned retrospectively. Patients’ gender, age, complaints (chest pain, backache, abdominal pain, syncope, dizziness and other), presence of <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening</b> on tele cardiograph and presence of fleb on echocardiograph were recorded. Results: Total 12 patients (8 males, 4 females) were included into the study. Mean age was 63. 5 ± 19. 0 (minimum 28, maximum 85). Complaints were chest pain (50 %), backache (25 %), abdominal pain (25 %), syncope (25 %) and dizziness (16. 7 %), respectively. There was a pulse {{difference between the}} two arms in 25 % of patients. However, <b>mediastinal</b> <b>widening</b> was present in 50 % of patients. Eight patients (67 %) have a fleb on echocardiograph. Eight patients had Standford Type A and five of patients had De Bakey Type 1 aortic dissection. There were no statistical differences between dissection types and gender (p> 0. 5). Eleven patients were referred to another hospital, and one of patients died.
