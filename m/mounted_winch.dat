50|$|G.91 target tug: A target tug variant was {{developed}} with an under-wing pylon <b>mounted</b> <b>winch</b> and target drogue. The drogue being attached to {{an extension of}} the winch around the trailing edge, above the wing. Other modifications included a large blade aerial above the centre fuselage and an anti-collision light at the forward end of the dorsal fin.|$|E
50|$|Most {{variants}} were {{fitted with}} a chassis <b>mounted</b> <b>winch</b> that was driven through the gearbox. This winch, which was intended for maneuvering of the towed field gun and for self-recovery of the vehicle; it proved extremely strong and reliable. The Militant gained the nickname 'Knocker' from its military crews {{which may have been}} due to the rhythmic sound of the slow-revving engines.|$|E
50|$|These boats have a {{relatively}} small mainsail compared to other yachts of their size. They use a large headsail to increase sail area. The boom is relatively high {{from the bottom of}} the cockpit, and the end is more forward. Mainsail controls are achieved through a cabin-top <b>mounted</b> <b>winch,</b> leading to a traveler car system running across the deck in front of the main cabin's sliding hatch.|$|E
50|$|An M35A2 {{cargo truck}} with a 10000 lb PTO-driven Garwood front winch is 112 in tall, 96 in wide and 277 in long, and 13030 lb empty (13530 lb empty when {{equipped}} with the front <b>mount</b> <b>winch,</b> according to dashboard dataplates). The standard wheelbase cargo bed is 8 feet wide by 12 feet long (2.4 x 3.6 m), with only 7.25 feet of this width being flat floorspace between the stake-pockets, the tailgate rising 16 inches above {{the floor and the}} side-walls/stake-pockets rising 12 inches above the floor. The M35A2 was available with a canvas soft top or a metal hard top. Metal hard-top configurations are most often found on vehicles that have been equipped with cold-weather gear, including additional insulation in the cab, as well as engine coolant or multifuel-fired cab personnel heaters.|$|R
50|$|The chassis of the M1120 {{is formed}} of 257 × 89 × 9.5 mm {{heat-treated}} carbon manganese steel with a yield strength of 758 MPa. With {{the exception of}} the wrecker variant, this chassis is common on all HEMTT variants Bolted construction with Grade 8 bolts is used throughout. A centrally <b>mounted</b> self-recovery <b>winch</b> is an option and this is fitted to around 20% of production.|$|R

40|$|In North-eastern Italian Alps wood {{extraction}} in steep terrain (up to 25 - 30 %) {{is generally}} performed {{by means of}} 4 WD agricultural tractors equipped with winches. One problem {{associated with the use}} of agricultural tractor in forestry, especially in off-road moving in steep terrain, is the stability and hence operator’s safety. In order to overcome such a problem an adaptation of a 4 WD agricultural tractor for wood extraction in steep terrain has been developed. It considers different features especially designed to be installed on an agricultural tractor. The first feature consists in a self-levelling device, made by two arms, articulated on the tractor’s final drive box and moved by two hydraulic rams. On the end of each arm a free-turning bogie is mounted. Another feature is the elongation of the fork in which the front axle is articulated, in order to increase its tilting angle. Two side plates, bolted on the rear body of the tractor, represent the last feature. The plates allow moving the p. t. o. shaft and the three-point linkage to the back permitting the use of the <b>mounted</b> <b>winch.</b> The control of the levelling device is both automatic and manual. When manually operated the levelling device is controlled by means of a single lever on the right side arm of the operator’s seat. The adapted tractor has demonstrated to operate in efficient and safe way on sloping and rough terrain...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop a innovative Gravity Base Foundation (GBF) concepts, including fabrication yards, launching systems and installation equipment, for a 500 MW utility scale project in the Great Lakes (Lake Erie). The goal was to lower the LCOE by 25 %. The project was the first to investigate an offshore wind project in the Great Lakes and it has furthered the body of knowledge for foundations and installation methods within Lake Erie. The project collected historical geotechnical information for Lake Erie and also used recently obtained data from the LEEDCo Icebreaker Project (FOA DE-EE 0005989) geotechnical program to develop the conceptual designs. Using these data-sets, the project developed design wind and wave conditions from actual buoy data in order to develop a concept that would de-risk a project using a GBF. These wind and wave conditions were then utilized to create reference designs for various foundations specific to installation in Lake Erie. A project partner on the project (Weeks Marine) provided input for construction and costing the GBF fabrication and installation. By having a marine contractor with experience with large marine projects as part of the team provides credibility to the LCOE developed by NREL. NREL then utilized the design and construction costing information as part of the LCOE model. The report summarizes the findings of the project. • Developed a cost model and “baseline” LCOE • Documented Site Conditions within Lake Erie • Developed Fabrication, Installation and Foundations Innovative Concept Designs • Evaluated LCOE Impact of Innovations • Developed Assembly line “Rail System” for GBF Construction and Staging • Developed Transit-Inspired Foundation Designs which incorporated: Semi-Floating Transit with Supplemental Pontoons Barge <b>mounted</b> <b>Winch</b> System • Developed GBF with “Penetration Skirt” • Developed Integrated GBF with Turbine Tower • Developed Turbine, Plant Layout and O&M Strategies The report details lowering LCOE by 22. 3 % and identified additional strategies that could further lower LCOE when building an utility scale wind farm in the Great Lakes...|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the M984 wrecker variant (254 × 89 × 9.5 mm, front; 356 × 89 × 9.5 mm, rear), on all HEMTT variants the chassis is formed of 257 × 89 × 9.5 mm heat-treated carbon manganese steel with a yield strength of 758 MPa. Bolted construction with Grade 8 bolts is used throughout. A centrally <b>mounted</b> self-recovery <b>winch</b> is an option and this is fitted to around 20% of production.|$|R
50|$|The main {{differences}} between various chassis was {{the location of}} the 45,000 lb winches and fifth-wheels. Different M123 models had either one or two <b>winches</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the cab, all M125s had a single winch at the front.|$|R
25|$|Scottish seiners are {{basically}} configured {{the same as}} anchor seiners. The only difference is that, whereas the anchor seiner has the coiler and <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> transversally amidships, the Scottish seiner has them mounted transversally in the forward part of the vessel.|$|R
25|$|Anchor seiners {{have the}} {{wheelhouse}} and accommodation aft {{and the working}} deck amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and shot from the stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> transversally amidships.|$|R
50|$|A donkey {{consists}} of a steam boiler and steam engine, connected to a <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> on a sled called a donkey sled. The donkeys were moved by simply dragging themselves with the winch line. They were used to move logs, by attaching lines to the logs and hauling them.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Pallot opened Central Motor Works at Sion, Trinity, an {{agricultural}} works. He was a gifted engineer, and invented several agricultural implements which were employed on Jersey farms, {{and are now}} displayed in the museum, including the Pallot elevator digger, the last furrow reversible plough, the single furrow reversible plough, the tractor <b>mounted</b> Côtil <b>winch,</b> and the tractor mounted 2 point linkage transport box. His ability to improvise proved invaluable during the difficult years of the Occupation of Jersey by Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|R
50|$|A short ballast {{body was}} <b>mounted</b> behind the <b>winch.</b> There were closed tool {{compartments}} along both sides, two open containers in the front, and a bottom-hinged tailgate. The spare tire was {{mounted in the}} front. The box could hold 18,000 lb of ballast to increase traction on the rear tandem axles.|$|R
50|$|The Warner T 93 5 speed {{transmission}} {{had a very}} low first, a direct fourth and an overdrive fifth gear. A power take-off could be fitted to operate a <b>winch</b> (<b>mounted</b> just below {{in front of the}} radiator) and/or the hydraulic hoist on dump trucks (the U10/U11 and U12/U13 dump truck models).|$|R
50|$|With rolling recoil {{the entire}} gun, mount and {{everything}} rolls backward, typically between 30 to 50 ft, restrained {{only by the}} brakes. The <b>mount</b> was <b>winched</b> back into firing position by cables fastened to the track. This system was usually combined with cradle recoil because the springs of the trucks cannot withstand the vertical component of the recoil force alone. This type of mount was usually fitted with car-traverse. It was unsuitable for smaller guns {{due to the lack}} of traverse. The great advantage of this method is that it requires minimal preparation and can fire from any suitable section of curved track.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the lander}} stopped rolling, the airbags {{deflated}} and retracted toward the lander using four <b>winches</b> <b>mounted</b> on the lander [...] "petals". Designed to right itself from any initial orientation, the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal. 74 minutes after landing, the petals were deployed with Sojourner rover and the solar panels attached on the inside.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} power operated, low recoil force gun turret of the Stingray light tank {{is used on}} the LAV-600. This incorporates a BAE Systems RO Defence 105 mm M-68 gun as the primary weapon of the LAV-600. A computerized fire control system is used for this weapon, with the power operated <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the front of}} the hull. The gunner's sight has a laser rangefinder system. The turret has a traverse arc of 360 degrees.|$|R
25|$|The barrage has two sluice gates, each is 7 metres {{wide and}} 5 metres high. They are raised and lowered by ropes from <b>winches</b> <b>mounted</b> in a machine {{room in the}} centre of the barrage. To travel the 5 metres from the fully closed to the open {{position}} of the gates takes 10 minutes. There is a PLC system to control the opening and closing of the gates which incorporates river level sensors, gate position sensors and a motor control centre.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ship had}} double steam <b>winches</b> <b>mounted</b> both fore and aft, cargo ports, {{and the latest}} freight {{handling}} machinery. [...] Three life boats of a type then considered modern and improved were carried, {{as well as a}} life raft. [...] The ship carried patent anchors, had an auxiliary schooner sailing rig, and was fitted with towing bits. [...] Cruising speed downriver on the Columbia was said to have been easily maintained at 10 knots. [...] The average speed however was stated in 1917 to be 9 knots.|$|R
50|$|Some 101FCs were {{produced}} with a PTO powered Nokken capstan <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the chassis at {{the centre of}} the vehicle, allowing winching from either the front or rear. Another variation on a small number of pre-production vehicles was the addition of a trailer with an axle driven from the PTO, creating a 6x6 vehicle, this adaptation was abandoned before full production when it was discovered that the trailer had a propensity to push the vehicle onto its side when driven over rough terrain.|$|R

50|$|Maintenance of a {{railroad}} embankment may require material (soil, rock, etc.) {{to be moved}} from where it is deposited by erosion near the track {{to a place where}} the embankment has been eroded away, or {{a railroad}} may need to simply widen the cut and fill sections. One method to do this was to <b>mount</b> a <b>winch</b> on one flat car (colloquially known as the Lidgerwood Car and in some cases labeled as such) with a line connected to a plow that was configured to slide along the decks of many flat cars. Soil material was shoveled (manually or by power equipment) onto the flat cars then the train of flat cars was moved to where the material was to be unloaded and the plow was pulled over the decks, forcing the material laterally off the flat cars where it fell to the embankment.|$|R
40|$|Topology {{optimization}} is at {{the phase}} of structural concept design {{and the result of}} it is foundation for succeeding design, therefore, structural topology optimization is more important to engineering design. in this thesis, in order to seek the optimal structure shape of the <b>winch’s</b> <b>mounting</b> bracket of ROV simulator, topology optimization design of it by finite element analysis software ANSYS was carried out. the results show that the topology optimization method is an effective optimization method and indicate that the method is correct and effective, it has a certain engineering application prospect...|$|R
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> on a heavy vehicle. This method {{is widely used}} at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|R

50|$|The EQ2080/2081 is the 2,500 kg class chassis for {{workshop}} shelters {{in service}} with the Air Force and Navy, intended for operations in mountainous areas and over rough roads and tracks. The {{layout of the}} vehicle is entirely conventional, with the engine forward, the steel cab seating the driver and two passengers, and the load area to the rear. The standard cargo body has a steel and wood floor, steel side racks and a tailgate. Body options are stated to include dump, tanker and crane. Optional equipment includes a power take-off and a 4,500 kg <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the front bumper.|$|R
50|$|The western {{gate was}} usually kept shut {{and was only}} opened for very large vessels that were damaged or under tow, which {{required}} {{the use of the}} deeper and straighter Western Channel. The western gate was opened by a tug boat. All other ships used the eastern gate, which was controlled by the boom gate vessel. The gate was opened by dragging it back to the hauling-back dolphin using winches housed on Green Point. The small craft gate was lowered to a depth of 5 metres (16 ft) with a <b>winch</b> <b>mounted</b> on board HMAS Kuramia.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{very small}} wheels were mounted under the deck {{which had to}} be wider than the track of the {{vehicles}} to be carried. It had two ramps, stowed above the back axle and below the body. These were withdrawn from the lorry and one end of each attached {{to the back of the}} deck while the other ends rested on the ground. A <b>winch,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the headboard was then used to draw the load up the ramps and onto the deck. The winch cable, low fixed sideboards and a low hinged tailboard plus lashings retained it there.|$|R
