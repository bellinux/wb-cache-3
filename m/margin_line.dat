25|$|There {{was also}} a series of {{linguistic}} sound changes {{towards the end of}} this period, including the Great Vowel Shift, which resulted in the i in mine, for example, changing from a pure vowel to a diphthong. These changes for the most part did not detract from the rule-governed nature of the spelling system; but in some cases they introduced confusing inconsistencies, like the well-known example of the many pronunciations of ough (rough, through, though, trough, plough, etc.). Most of these changes happened before the arrival of printing in England. However, the arrival of the printing press froze the current system, rather than providing the impetus for a realignment of spelling with pronunciation. Furthermore, it introduced further inconsistencies, partly because of the use of typesetters trained abroad, particularly in the Low Countries. For example, the h in ghost was influenced by Dutch.

Sensitivity factors of apparent power flow at the receiving end bus are adopted to predict power flow direction of each transmission line corresponding to a specified scenario of generation and demand in-creased. The proposed performance indices provide information regarding severe trans-mission paths that need for expansion or upgrading. A six-bus system is used to test with satisfactory re-sults...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of propeller，the propeller efficiency optimization method under the off-designed conditions were studied. Taking the open water efficiency around the designed velocity of parent propeller as the objective function, taking the radial distribution of pitch ratio as the optimization variables and taking the thrust and the cavitation performance of the propeller as the constraints and the optimization mathematical model was established. The panel method was used to solve the hydrodynamic performance of propeller and the cavitation performance was described by the BaiLiEr merchant <b>margin</b> <b>line.</b> Based on the simple genetic algorithm, the optimized radial distribution of the pitch ratio was solved. The optimized results show that due to the changes of ship speed the method which takes the efficiency of design velocity as the objective function fails to achieve the expected energy-saving.

40|$|Analysis of {{handwritten}} document {{images is}} one of the key areas of research in image processing domain. The objective of the analysis is to recognize the text components in an image and extract the intended information. However, inscription of handwriting usually would be on documents with rule lines, since they act as guide lines to the writer to ensure the writing remains straight and is of uniform size. These lines make the task of recognition difficult and hence removing them automatically becomes a major issue in text image processing. To accomplish this objective, an attempt is being made in this paper to remove the horizontal rule lines and vertical <b>margin</b> <b>line</b> for efficient recognition and analysis of the foreground text. Using mathematical morphology, predominant horizontal and vertical lines are removed leaving out stray lines which hinder the further processing of text. The stray lines are identified and removed using entropy with sliding window based on dynamic thresholding...|$|E

40|$|Background/PurposeThis study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the transverse and sagittal angulations of proximal segment after sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) and intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO), and examining their {{influences on the}} stability of distal segment. MethodsPatients who received SSRO (n =  21) or IVRO (n =  11) for mandibular setback were included. Lateral and posteroanterior cephalograms taken within 1 month before surgery (T 1), within 1 week after surgery (T 2), and at least 6 months after surgery (T 3) were analyzed. The angulation of each proximal segment relative to the upper orbital <b>margin</b> <b>line</b> was measured on posteroanterior cephalogram and the sum of both angles (total ramus angle, TRA) was obtained. On lateral radiograph, ramus inclination angle (RIA) relative to a horizontal reference line 7 ° to the sella–nasion was assessed and B-point position was measured. ResultsFrom T 1 to T 2, more increases in TRA and RIA were noted after IVRO than after SSRO. From T 2 to T 3, TRA and RIA significantly decreased in IVRO group but remained relatively stable in SSRO group. ΔTRAT 1 –T 2 positively related to upward rotation of distal segment for SSRO and downward rotation for IVRO from T 2 to T 3. For SSRO only, ΔRIAT 1 –T 2 significantly related to forward movement of distal segment during remodeling. ConclusionTRA and RIA increase significantly after IVRO and then regress, whereas they increase mildly after SSRO and remain stable. Increase in TRA significantly relates to distal segment rotation during remodeling for both surgeries, but increase in RIA relates to forward relapse of the distal segment only for SSRO. The reasons underlying the correlations are not certain and deserve future investigations...|$|E
