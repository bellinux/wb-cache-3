25|$|Although Maslow's {{theory is}} widely known, in the {{workplace}} it {{has proven to be}} a poor predictor of employee behavior. Maslow theorized that people will not seek to satisfy a higher level need until their lower level needs are met. There has been little empirical support for the idea that employees {{in the workplace}} strive to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> only in the hierarchical order prescribed by Maslow.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} innovation, only now {{becoming}} widely recognized, is end-user innovation. This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation {{for their own}} (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> MIT economist Eric von Hippel has identified end-user innovation as, by far, {{the most important and}} critical in his classic book on the subject, The Sources of Innovation.|$|E

Students enrolled in cloud units study the same units as campus students except instead of attending classes, they receive course and study materials online. Many courses have a residential component, which provides opportunities for face-to-face networking with other students and staff.|$|E
25|$|Bad boundaries: Narcissists do not {{recognize}} that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> or may as well not exist at all. Those who provide narcissistic supply to the narcissist are treated {{as if they are}} part of the narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist, there is no boundary between self and other.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} support {{across the world}} for {{building}} new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency GlobeScan, commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed {{than they were in}} 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend.

25|$|At Earhart's urging, Putnam {{purchased}} {{a small house}} in June 1935 adjacent to the clubhouse of the Lakeside Golf Club in Toluca Lake, a San Fernando Valley celebrity enclave community nestled between the Warner Brothers and Universal Pictures studio complexes where they had earlier rented a temporary residence. Earhart and Putnam would not move in immediately, however; they decided to do considerable remodeling and enlarge the existing small structure to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> This delayed the occupation of their new home for several months.|$|E
25|$|Expansion of Norden bombsight {{production}} {{to a final}} total of six factories took several years. The Army Air Forces demanded additional {{production to}} <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs,</b> and eventually arranged for the Victor Adding Machine company to gain a manufacturing license, and then Remington Rand. Ironically, during this period the Navy abandoned the Norden in favour of dive bombing, reducing the demand. By {{the end of the}} war, Norden and its subcontractors had produced 72,000 M-9 bombsights for the Army Air Force alone, costing $8,800 each.|$|E
25|$|Writers in a {{specialized}} field {{or with a}} narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market {{in the form of}} small presses and self-publishing. More recently, these options include print on demand and ebook format. These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> or who {{are in a position to}} make more money from direct sales than they could from bookstore sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{concept is}} natural building, {{which is usually}} {{on a smaller scale}} and tends to focus on the use of natural {{materials}} that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.|$|E
25|$|Working with non-disabled {{children}} in the Casa dei Bambini in 1907, Montessori began to develop her own pedagogy. The essential elements of her educational theory emerged from this work, described in The Montessori Method in 1912 and in The Discovery of the Child in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> Montessori {{came to the conclusion}} that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the appropriate role of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, {{the report}} of Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, {{was sent to the}} North Carolina legislature. He {{primarily}} reported on the Cherokee in the state. He noted that the Indians of Robeson County had developed an extensive system of schools and a political organization. He thought that, as state-recognized Indians, they were eligible to attend federal Indian schools. But, as they were highly assimilated, spoke English, and already worked in the common state culture, he doubted that the federal Indian schools could <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> Congress did not provide any additional funding to support education for Indians in North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|The term learner-generated context {{originated}} in the suggestion that an educational context {{might be described as}} a learner-centric ecology of resources and that a learner generated context is one in which a group of users collaboratively marshall available resources to create an ecology that <b>meets</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the Brundtland Commission's report, one of {{the first}} {{initiatives}} to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by Swedish cancer scientist Karl-Henrik Robèrt. Robèrt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability. At the core of the process lies a consensus on what Robèrt came to call the natural step framework. The framework is based on a definition of sustainability, described as the system conditions of sustainability (as derived from System theory). In the natural step framework, a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth's crust, or substances produced by society; that does not degrade the environment and in which people have the capacity to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots {{backed the}} 2004 Annan Plan for Cyprus {{aimed at the}} reunification of the island, but the plan was {{subsequently}} rejected by Greek Cypriots {{on the grounds that}} it did not <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> According to Greek Cypriots, the latest proposal included maintained residence rights for the many Anatolian Turks who moved to Cyprus after the invasion (and their descendants who were born on the island after 1974), while the Greek Cypriots who lost their property after the Turkish invasion would be granted only a restricted right of return to the north following the island's proposed reunification. Although the outcome received much criticism in the EU as well, the Republic of Cyprus was admitted into the EU a week after the referendum.|$|E
25|$|The Festival {{provides}} {{a broad range}} of educational programs {{for a wide range of}} ages and interests. The initial focus was on college students and the Institute for Renaissance Studies was formed to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> The Festival offered short courses, lectures, readings, concerts, and exhibits focused on the plays of the season. Participation was open to all Festival company members and audiences, either for college credit from several universities, or for audit. Coursework was supported by a collection of Renaissance and late-medieval books, manuscripts, and prints now housed in the Southern Oregon University’s Hannon Library. Each year, FAIR (Fellowships, Assistantships, Internships and Residencies) offers college and university students from across the United States aspiring to a career in theater experience on the administrative, artistic, education, and production staffs.|$|E

25|$|The {{income of}} women with status living off-reserve was on average $13,870 a year, {{according}} to a 1996 Canadian census. This is about $5500 less than non-Indigenous women, such as Inuit and Métis women,which recorded slightly higher average annual incomes; regardless of the small discrepancy, {{all of which are}} substantially less than Statistics Canada’s estimated amount of which an individual living in a large Canadian city would require to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> It is not unlikely for Aboriginal women living in poverty to not only tend to their own needs, but often tend to the needs of their elderly parents, care for loved ones in ill-health, as well as raising children; all of which is often supported only on a single income. It is believed that homelessness and inadequate shelter are widespread problems facing Aboriginal families, in all settings.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, Google {{announced}} {{that to make}} it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst) but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using Google Pack. Google also created group policy objects to fine tune the behavior of Chrome in the business environment, for example by setting automatic updates interval, disabling auto-updates, and configuring a home page. Until version 24 the software is known not to be ready for enterprise deployments with roaming profiles or Terminal Server/Citrix environments.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 the United Nation's World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), in {{its report}} Our Common Future {{suggested}} that development was acceptable, {{but it must be}} sustainable development that would {{meet the needs of the}} poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to <b>meet</b> <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.|$|E
