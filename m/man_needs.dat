5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the <b>man</b> <b>needs</b> to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E

500|$|A {{real estate}} boom {{occurred}} in the U.S. {{after the end of}} the First World War, with a particular surge in the construction of new skyscrapers between 1925 and 1931. In New York, a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931, with [...] of new office space added between 1925 and 1929 alone. In Chicago, limited wartime construction created supply shortages, and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924. This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city. The boom inflated prices in the real estate market, leading to speculative financing and building projects, including the introduction of 100 percent mortgages for new builds. An early edition of the Fortune magazine commented wryly that [...] "all a <b>man</b> <b>needs</b> to own a skyscraper is the money and the land. And he may be able to get along without the money." ...|$|E

500|$|Magistrate Li writes out a {{marriage}} certificate and dispatches a messenger {{to deliver the}} document to Yue Fei in Unicorn Village. Zhou and Yue set out at dawn and travel back to Tangyin to thank the Magistrate for his generosity and kindness. There, Li prepares a great feast for them, but when food is brought out for any servants that might have accompanied them, Zhou comments that they had come on foot without help. Li decides to let Yue pick from any one of his thousands of horses because every able military <b>man</b> <b>needs</b> a strong steed. After finishing their feast, Zhou and Yue thank Li once again and leave Tangyin to return home. During their journey, Zhou recommends that Yue run the horse to test its speed. Yue spurs the horse on leaving Zhou in pursuit. When they reach the village gate, the two dismount and Zhou returns to his study where he feels hot from the race and removes his outer garments to fan himself. But he soon falls ill and stays bedridden for seven days. Then the book describes his death and burial: ...|$|E
500|$|Proposals {{that one}} type of animal, even humans, could descend from other types of animals, are known {{to go back to}} the first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers. Anaximander of Miletus (c. 610 – 546 BC) {{proposed}} that the first animals lived in water, during a wet phase of the Earth's past, and that the first land-dwelling ancestors of mankind must have been born in water, and only spent part of their life on land. He also argued that the first human of the form known today must have been the child of a different type of animal, because <b>man</b> <b>needs</b> prolonged nursing to live. Empedocles (c. 490 – 430 BC), argued that what we call birth and death in animals are just the mingling and separations of elements which cause the countless [...] "tribes of mortal things." [...] Specifically, the first animals and plants were like disjointed parts of the ones we see today, some of which survived by joining in different combinations, and then intermixing during the development of the embryo, and where [...] "everything turned out as it would have if it were on purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way." [...] Other philosophers who became more influential in the Middle Ages, including Plato (c. 428/427 – 348/347 BC), Aristotle (384 – 322 BC), and members of the Stoic school of philosophy, believed that the types of all things, not only living things, were fixed by divine design.|$|E

2500|$|The {{operation}} {{and effects of}} grace are understood differently by different traditions. Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the necessity of the free will to cooperate with grace. This does not mean man can come to God {{on his own and}} then cooperate with grace, as Semipelagianism, an early church heresy, postulates. Human nature is not evil, since God creates no evil thing, but man continues in or is inclined to sin (concupiscence) because of Original Sin. <b>Man</b> <b>needs</b> grace from God to be able to [...] "repent and believe in the gospel." [...] Reformed theology, by contrast, teaches that people are completely incapable of self-redemption to the point that human nature itself is evil, but the grace of God overcomes even the unwilling heart. Arminianism takes a synergistic approach while Lutheran doctrine teaches justification by grace alone through faith alone.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Cardinal Nicolás de Jesús López Rodríguez {{referred}} to President Obama's nominee for Dominican Republic's ambassador (Wally Brewster) by the anti-gay slur maricón. In 2011 a Catholic bishop in Peru, Luis Bambarén, {{was forced to}} apologize for using the same word in commenting, when answering journalists' questions on plans to legalise same-sex marriage, on the use in Spanish of the English word [...] "gay": [...] "I {{do not know why}} we talk about Gays. Let's speak in Creole or Castilian: They're faggots. That's how you say it, right?" [...] He later apologized, saying: [...] "It is an offensive word, and [...] deserve respect." [...] However, in December 2015 Rodríguez again insulted Brewster who he said was abusing his role by speaking out against corruption: [...] "That <b>man</b> <b>needs</b> {{to go back to his}} embassy. Let him focus on housework, since he's the wife to a man." [...] The remark received criticism from the US State Department, and Senator, Dick Durbin asked Pope Francis to intervene and reprimand Rodriguez.|$|E
