40|$|Groundwater {{sustainability}} {{has become}} a critical issue for Zhanjiang (China) because of serious groundwater level drawdown induced by overexploitation of its coastal <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifer</b> system. It is necessary to understand the origins, material sources, hydrochemical processes, and dynamics of the coastal groundwater in Zhanjiang to support its sustainable management. To this end, an integrated analysis of hydrochemical and isotopic data of 95 groundwater samples was conducted. Hydrochemical analysis shows that coastal groundwater is fresh; however, relatively high levels of Cl−, Mg 2 +, and total dissolved solid (TDS) imply slight seawater mixing with coastal unconfined groundwater. Stable isotopes (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) values reveal the recharge sources of groundwater in the <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifer</b> system. The unconfined groundwater originates from local modern precipitation; the confined groundwater in mainland originates from modern precipitation in northwestern mountain area, and the confined groundwater in Donghai and Leizhou is sourced from rainfall recharge during an older period with a colder climate. Ionic relations demonstrate that silicate weathering, carbonate dissolutions, and cation exchange are the primary processes controlling the groundwater chemical composition. Declining trends of groundwater level and increasing trends of TDS of the confined groundwater in islands reveal the landward extending tendency of the freshwater-seawater mixing zone...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} to characterization of <b>multilayer</b> <b>aquifer</b> systems using open well borehole dilution is described. The approach involves measuring observation well flow velocities while a nearby extraction well is pumped by introducing a saline tracer into observation wells and collecting dilution vs. depth profiles. Inspection of tracer profile evolution allows discrete permeable layers within the aquifer to be identified. Dilution profiles for well sections between permeable layers are then converted into vertical borehole flow velocities and their evolution, using an analytic {{solution to the}} advection-dispersion equation applied to borehole flow. The dilution approach is potentially able to measure much smaller flow velocities that would be detectable using flowmeters. Vertical flow velocity data from the observation wells are then matched to those generated using a hydraulic model of the aquifer system, ‘‘shorted’ ’ by the observation wells, to yield the hydraulic properties of the constituent layers. Observation well flow monitoring of pumping tests represents a cost-effective alternative or preliminary {{approach to}} pump testing each layer of a <b>multilayer</b> <b>aquifer</b> system separately using straddle packers or screened wells and requires no prior knowledge of permeable layer depths and thicknesses. The modification described here, of using tracer dilution rather than flowmeter logging to obtain well flow velocities, allows the approach to be extended to greater well separations, thus characterizing a larger volume of the aquifer. An example of the application of this approach to a multilayer Chalk Aquifer in Yorkshire, Northeast England, is presented...|$|E

The latter flows account for over 50 % of the aquifer discharge from the test area, {{the eastern shore of}} the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Normally utilized response matrix (RM) and embedding (EM) simulation/optimization modelling procedures did not converge to optimal solutions for this area; they diverged or oscillated. However, the newly presented linear RM and EM approaches satisfactorily addressed the nonlinearities posed by over 2000 piecewise-linear constraints for evapotranspiration, discharge from flowing wells, drain discharge, and vertical interlayer flow reduction due to desaturation of a confined aquifer. Both presented modelling approaches converged to the same optimal solution. Superposition was applied to the nonlinear problem by: making a cycle within the RM analogous to an iteration in a simulation model (such as MODFLOW); and using a modified MODFLOW to develop influence coefficients.

40|$|Flow {{problems}} in an anisotropic domain {{can be transformed}} into ones in an equivalent isotropic domain by coordinate transformations. Once analytical solutions are obtained for the equivalent isotropic domain, they can be back transformed to the original anisotropic domain. The existing solutions presented by Cihan et al. (2011) for isotropic <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifer</b> systems with alternating aquitards and multiple injection/pumping wells and leaky wells were modified to account for horizontal anisotropy in aquifers. The modified solutions for pressure buildup distribution and leakage rates through leaky wells can be used when the anisotropy direction and ratio (Kx=Ky) {{are assumed to be}} identical for all aquifers alternating with aquitards. However, for <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifers</b> alternating with aquicludes, both the principal direction of the anisotropic horizontal conductivity and the anisotropy ratio can be different in each aquifer. With coordinate transformation, a circular well with finite radius becomes an ellipse, and thus in the transformed domain the head contours in the immediate vicinity of the well have elliptical shapes. Through a radial flow approximation around the finite radius wells, the elliptical well boundaries in the transformed domain are approximated by an effective well radius expression. The analytical solutions with the effective radius approximations were compared with exact solutions as well as a numerical solution for elliptic flow. The effective well radius approximation is sufficiently accurate to predict the head buildup at the well bore of the injection/pumping wells for moderately anisotropic systems (Kx=Ky ≤ 25). The effective radius approximation gives satisfactory results for predicting head buildup at observation points and leakage through leaky wells away from the injection/pumping wells even for highly anisotropic aquifer systems (Kx=Ky ≤ 1000) ...|$|R

It constitutes an important strategic water resource considering the great quality of this water and its natural protection against anthropic pollutions. Nevertheless, some of these aquifers are overexploited. In order to manage these resources, a regional planning of groundwater was approved in 2003.

Thus, a new well field is planned in the Medoc region at 35 km west of Bordeaux. It will be composed of 14 wells and will produce 10 million cubic meters by year extract from Oligocene aquifer (150 m below ground surface). In this region, most of the surface is occupied by the Landes forest, which corresponds to a monoculture of maritime pines (Pinus pinaster). Soils are mainly composed of sand in which a phreatic aquifer (Plio-Quaternary) is in development.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical solution of groundwater response to tidal fluctuation in a coastal <b>multilayer</b> <b>aquifer</b> system {{consisting of a}} leaky confined aquifer, a semipermeable layer, and an unconfined aquifer. The semipermeable layer, or {{the roof of the}} leaky confined aquifer, extends under the sea. Comparisons are made with solutions derived previously, which considered only a single aquifer, zero extension of the roof, or infinite roof length, and demonstrate that the previous solutions are special cases of the solution presented here. A hypothetical example is used to discuss the impact of the dimensionless roof length, dimensionless leakage, and tidal efficiency on the groundwater level fluctuations in the inland part of the confined aquifer. The fluctuation decreases significantly with the roof length when the roof length is small but is insensitive to the change of roof length when the roof length is greater than a threshold. The impacts of leakage from the offshore and inland portions of the confining unit are different. Leakage from the offshore portion tends to increase the fluctuation of the groundwater level, while leakage from the inland portion tends to decrease the fluctuation. The fluctuation increases as the tidal efficiency increases. This fact is significant only when the roof length is great and leakage is small. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Application of the models to field tracer test data indicates that the observed recoveries, which are not proportional to the abstraction rate in each layer, are consistent with the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer when natural vertical head gradients are taken into account. Investigation with the models illustrates that the vertical distribution of tracer recovery depends strongly upon the background heads and that tracer tests conducted in the same aquifer, but at different times, may interrogate different aquifer layers. It is also shown generally that for a given abstraction rate the vertical distribution of tracer recovery in small-scale tracer tests is controlled largely by the transmissivity distribution but that as the spatial scale of the test increases, the distribution of recovery becomes proportional to the discharges from the injection borehole because of vertical flows within it, which may be natural or induced by pumping in the monitoring borehole.

Pleistocene marine transgression, and cationic exchange are clearly evidenced in the most salinized parts of the Cabo and Beberibe aquifers. All 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are above the past and present-day seawater signatures, meaning that the Sr isotopic signature is altered due to additional Sr inputs from dilution with different freshwaters, and water-rock interactions. Only the Cabo aquifer presents a well-delimitated area of Na-HCO 3 water typical of a freshening process. The two deep aquifers also display a broad range of B concentrations and B isotope ratios with values among the highest known to date (63 - 68. 5 ‰). This suggests multiple sources and processes affecting B behaviour, among which mixing with saline water, B sorption on clays and mixing with wastewater. The highly fractionated B isotopic values were explained by infiltration of relatively salty water with B interacting with clays, pointing out the major role played by (palaeo) -channels for the deep Beberibe aquifer recharge. Based on an increase of salinity at end of the dry season, a present-day seawater intrusion is identified in the surficial Boa Viagem aquifer.

Chloride concentrations are low (below 100  mg/l) and not correlated to the 36 Cl/Cl values, indicating negligible dissolution of evaporites in most samples. Reliable 36 Cl ages can be calculated along the different flow paths investigated, suggesting residence times {{of the deep}} groundwaters larger than 300 000 years. These {{results are consistent with}} new AMS- 14 C data below the detection limit but are in contradiction with previous 14 C data obtained in the area...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Recife Metropolitan Region (PE, Brazil) is {{a typical}} "hot spot" {{illustrating}} the problems of southern countries on water issues inducing high pressures on water resources both on quantity and quality {{in the context of}} global social and environmental changes. By focusing on the groundwater geochemistry in a costal <b>multilayer</b> <b>aquifer,</b> this work aims at investigating the sources and processes of salinization. Two different Precambrian blocks separated by a large lineament area constitute the site basement. The sedimentary fillings of the two basins present different origins that were distinguished by the Sr isotope composition. The northern deep Beberibe aquifer displays very high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr with a large range of values (0. 7102 - 0. 7233) illustrating the main continental origin of sediments whereas the southern deep Cabo aquifer showed lower values (0. 7097 - 0. 7141) indicating the contribution of the marine sedimentation. Although sulfate isotopes, Electrical Conductivity and Cl contents indicate a mixing with seawater for some samples of the deep Cabo and Beberibe aquifers, all 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are above the present-day seawater composition. This can be related to the complex local history of transgression/regression phases that induced alternatively salinisation and freshening with gains and losses of cations and Sr, together with water-rock interactions. δ 18 O-δ 2 H clearly evidence the local present day recharge in the surficial aquifer, some samples being affected by in situ evaporation processes and/or recharge with evaporated water from dams used for water supply. The deep aquifers display a high range of B (20 - 600 µg/L) and δ 11 B (6. 7 - 68. 5 ‰) with some of the highest values known to date. Multiple sources and processes affect the B behavior, among which mixing with saline water, B sorption on clays/organic matter and mixing with wastewater. The surficial aquifers are locally salinized possibly due to present seawater intrusion, and highly contaminated with wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Contaminant {{sources have}} been {{attributed}} to shoe manufacturers in an alluvial aquifer located along 26 km 2 in the Chienti River Valley, Central Italy. During the 1980 s and 1990 s, the main chlorinated compound used in the study area was 1, 1, 1 -Trichloroethane (1, 1, 1 -TCA), which was substituted by Perchloroethene (PCE) in the last 15 years. A hydrogeological conceptual model has been developed for the alluvial aquifer taking into account the presence of low permeability lenses, forming a multilayer semi-confined aquifer. Hydrodynamic tests (pumping and flowmeter heat-pulse tests) coupled with standard and multilevel hydrochemical and isotopic samplings were performed. Flowmeter tests showed the existence of vertical flow between aquifer levels having different permeability. Physical-chemical parameter logs agreed with the existence of a <b>multilayer</b> <b>aquifer.</b> Concentration data collected in 21 wells located downgradient of the different sources revealed VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) levels lower than 100 μg/L in {{the upper part of the}} valley and levels reaching about 200 μg/L in the near shore areas. PCE is the main compound present in the aquifer. No evidence of the presence of TCA was found in the upper areas of the Chienti Valley, but in the areas near the shore, TCA and its degradation products are predominant. Data collected at multilevels located at two sites (upper and near shore areas) to refine the results obtained in the regional survey show a stratification of the VOC concentrations; values of each compound are higher than those measured in the conventional wells during the standard sampling (e. g. PCE: 150 μg/L instead of 2 μg/L). In addition, the vertical distribution of the contaminant reflects the vertical flow pattern inferred from hydrogeological data. The hydrogeological, VOC and isotope data showed that dilution is the main process controlling VOCs concentration in the aquifer. Degradation also played a role in the attenuation of the parent compounds in some localized areas of the aquifer. The role of the low permeability layers on VOC degradation was documented by the presence of cis- 1, 2 -DCE, a main daughter product of PCE, in some zones of the upper area, and 1, 1 -Dichloroethene (1, 1 -DCE) and 1, 1 -Dichloroethane (1, 1 -DCA), byproducts of 1, 1, 1 -TCA degradation, in the near shore areas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{embedding}} optimization modelling {{approach is}} adapted to aid long-term groundwater quality and quantity management of complex nonlinear <b>multilayer</b> <b>aquifers.</b> Implicit block-centered finite-difference approximations of the quasi-three-dimensional unsteady flow equation, and Galerkin finite-element approximations of the twodimensional advection-dispersion transport equation are embedded as constraints in the model. Other hydrological processes are also included as constraints. Cyclical linear differencing permits representation of nonlinear transport, even when contaminant is extracted by unsteady pumping (a decision variable). Also used are nonlinear (discontinuous derivative) constraints describing drainage, stream-aquifer interflow and evapotranspiration. The use of both linear and nonlinear formulations of the entire flow and transport model in a cyclical manner reduces execution time and improves confidence in solution optimality. The resulting model incorporates the dynamic changes in parameters characterizing nonlinear groundwater systems. The methodology is most suitable for reconnaissance planning in nonlinear systems typified by: (1) relatively large cell size, (2) {{large proportion of the}} cells having head-dependent external fluxes and pumping decision variables, and (3) the need for dispersed contaminant management. It uses a multiobjective weighting approach and goal programming to maximize sustainable groundwater extraction while achieving target groundwater concentrations in control nodes. In a second paper, the methodology is applied to the Salt Lake Valley...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} 20 years, {{numerical}} modelling of Groundwater flow and transport {{has become the}} best tool for water resources management and decision making. Numerous codes deal with flow, transport, density, unsaturated zone, surface water- groundwater interaction, etc [...] . {{but only a few}} codes integrate these aspect simultaneously. The MARTHE code presented here tackles all of them in a dynamic way. This presentation intends to illustrate through case studies, how this modelling software can be used to treat various problems. The scale of applications of this computer program ranges from detailed investigations, such as water movement in soils (soil volumes of a few cm 3 with cells of a few mm), to simulation of large <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifer</b> systems (150, 000 km 2, 1, 500 m thickness). The temporal scale of applications ranges from a few seconds to 15, 000 years for long-term geochemical predictions. MARTHE has been applied to over 300 aquifer systems since its first release in the late 1980 's. Fields of application have included i) the management of groundwater resources (e. g. water balance assessments, evaluation of the potential impacts of abstractions); ii) civil engineering and mining works (e. g. impact of underground activities); and, iii) environmental assessments, both point and diffuse pollutions...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} {{has become}} a worrisome phenomenon, mainly for aquifers underlying industrialized areas. In order to evaluate the risk of pollution, {{a model of the}} aquifer is needed. Herewith, we describe a quasi-tridimensional model, which we applied to a <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifer</b> where a phreatic aquifer was coupled to a confined one by means of an aquitard. This hydrogeological scheme is often met in practice and, therefore, models a number of situations. Moreover, aquitards {{play an important role in}} the management of natural resources of this kind. The model we adopted contains some approximations: the flow within the aquifers is assumed to be horizontal, whereas leakage is assumed vertical. The effect of some wells drilled in these aquifers is also taken into account. In order to evaluate the leakage fluxes that correspond to different exploitation conditions, we numerically solve a system of quasilinear and time-dependent partial differential equations. This model has been calibrated by the hydrogeological data from a water supply station of the Milan Water Works, where water is polluted by some halocarbons. Our simulations account for several experimental facts, both from the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical viewpoints. Maxima of computed downward leakage rates are found to correspond with measured pollutant concentration maxima. Other results show how the aquitard can help in minimizing the contamination of drinkable water...|$|R
40|$|Sinis area {{is located}} in the north western sector of Campidano plain, to the North of the Gulf of Oristano. In that sector of Sardinia {{underground}} waters constitute the most important water resource for agriculture. In Sinis area two deep aquifers have been placed. The first, placed in the western part, is constituted by sands and gravels and it is overhung by a very thick clayey marl’s layer. The water yeld of the confined aquifer has been determined by pumping tests from which it results that the pumping rate varies between 6 and 13. 5 l/sec. The average Transmissivity is 1. 7 x 10 - 3 m 2 /s. The other aquifer system, already known and studied for a long time, belongs to the alluvial <b>multilayered</b> <b>aquifer</b> of Campidano. It is constituted by very permeable layers of sands and gravels alternated to impervious or semi confining silty clay layers. The Transmissivity of this aquifer results superior to 10 - 3 m 2 /sec. Pumping rates are at least 6 - 7 l/sec. Chemical analysis showed that some samples of water taken {{in the southern part of}} Sinis present some anomalous values and they show thermal waters typical characters. This fact is confirmed by the average temperatures around 23 °C. It could be a ground water recharge by deep thermal waters, with which waters coming from Montiferru would be mixed...|$|R
