40|$|We {{carried out}} DFT {{calculations}} for <b>monohydrated</b> sulfuric and phosphoric acids. We {{are interested in}} clusters which differ in orientation of hydrogen atoms only. Such molecular complexes are close in energy, since they lie {{in the vicinity of}} the global minimum energy structure on the flat potential energy surface. For <b>monohydrated</b> sulfuric acid we identified four different isomers. The <b>monohydrated</b> phosphoric acid forms five different conformers. These systems are difficult to study from the theoretical point of view, since binding energy differences in several cases are very small. For each structure, we calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies to be sure that if the optimized structures are at the local or global minima on the potential energy surface. The analysis of calculated –OH vibrational frequencies is useful in interpretation of infrared photodissociation spectroscopy experiments. We employed four different DFT functionals in our calculations. For each structure, we calculated binding energies, thermodynamic properties, and harmonic vibrational frequencies. Our analysis clearly shows that DFT approach is suitable for studying <b>monohydrated</b> inorganic acids with different hydrogen atom orientations. We carried out MP 2 calculations with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set for both <b>monohydrated</b> acids. MP 2 results serve as a benchmark for DFT calculations.

40|$|Binding of {{a single}} water {{molecule}} has a dramatic effect on the excited state lifetime of adenine. Here we report a joint nonadiabatic dynamics and reaction paths study aimed at understanding the sub- 100 fs lifetime of adenine in the <b>monohydrates.</b> Our nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, performed using the ADC(2) electronic structure method, show a shortening of the excited state lifetime in the <b>monohydrates</b> with respect to bare adenine. However, the computed lifetimes {{were found to be}} significantly longer that the observed one. By comparing the reaction pathways of several excited state deactivation processes in adenine and adenine <b>monohydrates,</b> we show that electron-driven proton transfer from water to nitrogen atom N 3 of the adenine ring may be the process responsible for the observed ultrafast decay.

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrochemical}} {{response of}} the fluorogenic label naphthalene- 2, 3 -dicarboxyaldehyde (NDA) in a binary mixture of water/methanol was characterized with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) electrochemical techniques. Naphthalene- 2, 3 -dicarboxyaldehyde does exist in three isomeric forms in aqueous solution: the unhydrated dialdehyde (DA), the acyclic <b>monohydrated</b> (MA) and the cyclic hemiacetal (HAC). The study underlines {{that the proportion of}} each of them varies according to the working pH. At low and high pH, the dialdehyde form is in larger proportion than the acyclic <b>monohydrated</b> form. Conversely at intermediate pH, the concentration of the acyclic form is in greater proportion than the dialdehyde form. These results allowed us to determine the optimal pH of 9 for which the labeling of biomolecules could be more efficient due to the base catalyzed regeneration of the unhydrated form. At this pH, the data processing from the analysis of measured currents and estimation of diffusion coefficients of each form according to the semi-empirical models of Wilke-Chang, Scheibel, Reddy-Doraiswamy and Lusis-Ratcliff allowed us to obtain the concentration of dialdehyde (0. 28 mM), acyclic <b>monohydrated</b> (0. 57 mM) and cyclic hemiacetal <b>monohydrated</b> (0. 15 mM) forms starting from 1 mM naphthalene- 2, 3 -dicarboxyaldehyde...|$|R

Conformational distributions of the <b>monohydrates</b> have been revealed by IR/UV double-resonance spectroscopy and their structures assigned by comparison with DFT-D calculations. A careful analysis of the final hydrate distribution together with a detailed theoretical investigation of the potential energy surface of the <b>monohydrates</b> demonstrates that solvation occurs from the conformational distribution of the isolated peptide monomers. The distribution of the <b>monohydrates</b> appears to be strongly dependent on both the initial monomer conformation (extended or folded backbone) and the solvation site initially occupied by the water molecule. The solvation processes taking place during the cooling can be categorized as follows: (a) solvation without significant structural changes of the peptide, (b) solvation inducing significant distortions of the backbone but retaining the secondary structure, and (c) solvation triggering backbone isomerizations, leading to a modification of the peptide secondary structure. It is observed that solvation by a single water molecule can fold a beta-strand into a gamma-turn structure (type c) or induce a significant opening of a gamma-turn characterized by an elongated C(7) hydrogen bond (type b).
