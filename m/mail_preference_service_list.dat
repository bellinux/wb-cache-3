5000|$|A Robinson <b>list</b> or <b>Mail</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>Service</b> (MPS) <b>list</b> is an {{opt-out list}} of people who do not wish to receive {{marketing}} transmissions. The marketing can be via e-mail, postal mail, telephone, or fax. In each case, contact details will be placed on a blacklist. Although the purpose of such a list is to reduce unwanted marketing, the principle that [...] "data is only private until someone decides it isn't" [...] indicates it can also generate unwanted marketing.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Door to door" [...] service {{does not}} use the UK <b>Mailing</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>Service</b> - instead, Royal Mail {{operates}} its own opt-out database. Warnings about missing government communications given by Royal Mail to customers opting out of their service have been criticized by customers and consumer groups. Clarification given by the company in June 2015 explained that election communications and unaddressed government mail would be delivered to customers {{even if they had}} opted out.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{organizations}} offer opt-out {{services to}} people who wish to reduce or eliminate the amount of addressed advertising mail they receive. In the UK, the <b>Mailing</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>Service</b> allows people to register with them for removal from posted as opposed to hand-delivered mail. As of 2017 in the United States two organizations offering these services include Catalog Choice and DMAChoice. A similar organization {{by the name of}} 41pounds.org received customer complaints and then became defunct. Another one by the name of Tonic Mailstopper (formerly GreenDimes) no longer appears to be in business either.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, the <b>Mailing</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>Service</b> composes a Robinson list {{funded by}} the direct mail {{industry}} which collects names and addresses {{of people who do}} not want to receive direct marketing. This list is circulated to marketing companies which are then responsible for not contacting people on the list. Although use of this list is governed by the Advertising Standards Authority and the Code of Practice of the Direct Marketing Association, there is nonetheless the potential for names on the list to be used for the opposite of their intended purpose, either accidentally or intentionally.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA) <b>Mail</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>Service</b> {{provides}} an opt-out service. [...] The consumer's name {{is added to}} a [...] "delete" [...] file which is made available to direct-mail marketers. This process does not cover opting out of Bulk Mail also known as Standard mail or Current Resident Mail, which will require opting out on a company by company basis. There is no charge to register online {{but there is a}} $1 charge to register by regular mail. There is another service to stop mail to deceased people. Registration will not stop mailings from organizations that are not registered with the DMA. DirectMail.com offers a similar service.|$|R

Those in the [...] "gen-eki" [...] sub-category would serve {{for two years in}} the army or three in the navy. After this period, they would be placed on the primary reserve <b>service</b> <b>list</b> (yobi-eki) for five years and four months in the army or four years in the navy, and would be subsequently placed on the secondary reserve <b>service</b> <b>list</b> after 10 years in the army (five in the navy) before being placed on the national <b>service</b> <b>list</b> (kokumin hei-eki) after 17 years and four months of army service (or 12 years of naval service). A similar but less stringent path was set out for those enlisted into the primary or secondary reserve categories; they would also end their service on the national <b>service</b> <b>list.</b> The least rigorous path was for those enlisted into the hoju hei-eki (replenishment territorial army and naval volunteer reserve), who would end their service on the national <b>service</b> <b>list.</b>|$|R
