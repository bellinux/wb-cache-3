25|$|Performance of cross {{interleaver}} : As {{shown in}} the above interleaver figure, the output is nothing but the diagonal symbols generated {{at the end of}} each delay line. In this case, when the input <b>multiplexer</b> switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half message at receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also reduced by half which is good improvement over the block interleaver. Thus, the total interleaver memory is split between transmitter and receiver.|$|E
500|$|A {{typical power}} divider {{is shown in}} figure 13. [...] Ideally, input power would be divided equally between the output ports. [...] Dividers are made up of {{multiple}} couplers and, like couplers, may be reversed and used as multiplexers. [...] The drawback is that for a four channel <b>multiplexer,</b> the output consists of only 1/4 the power from each, and is relatively inefficient. [...] The {{reason for this is that}} at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load. [...] If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1. [...] However, <b>multiplexer</b> inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent. [...] Lossless multiplexing can only be done with filter networks.Naval Air Warfare Center, pp.6.4.4, 6.4.5 ...|$|E
