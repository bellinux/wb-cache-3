50|$|About 1960, however, {{a change}} {{occurred}} as Hubley became {{known for its}} detailed <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> kits, which were unique in a market of dominantly plastic offerings. Hubley even set up its Scale Model Division for these products. These metal kits, issued in various scales, were more expensive than plastic models, and, when finished, were naturally quite heavy. Complexity in detail was often seen - with opening hoods, doors, moving phaeton panels, and detailed engines and chassis.|$|E
5000|$|When metals became readily {{available}} in the United States in 1947, Cox {{turned his attention to}} new products, beginning with a diecast <b>metal</b> <b>car.</b> This product was developed into a [...] "whip car", a tethered vehicle which could be manually swung in a circle at high speed. Nitro- and gasoline-powered tether cars with [...]60 cubic inch miniature engines capable of speeds of 100 mph (160 km/h) were quickly becoming popular. Cox's first contribution to that growing hobby was a cast aluminum midget racer powered by a [...]15 engine by Cameron Brothers.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 Barris {{was asked}} to design a theme car for the Batman {{television}} series. Originally the auto stylist Dean Jeffries was contracted to build the car for the show in late 1965, but when the studio wanted the car faster than he could deliver, the project was given to Barris. With the short notice, Barris thought the Futura might work well, and using Jeffriess initial car, decided that its unusual winged shape would be an ideal {{starting point for the}} Batmobile. Barris hired Bill Cushenberry to modify the cars metalwork.Barris went on to build three fiberglass replicas using the frames and running gear from 1966 Ford Galaxie cars for the show circuit, three of which were covered with a felt-like flocking finish in the 1970s. Barris later acquired a fourth replica, a <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> built on a 1958 Thunderbird.|$|E

50|$|There {{seems to}} have been some overlap of reponsbilities {{regarding}} the Amilcar Compound’s development between Jean-Albert Grégoire and Clément Vinciguerra. In any event, after 1940 Grégoire was increasingly preoccupied by other projects, notably one with Simca for the production of a light <b>metal</b> <b>car.</b> It was the company man Clément Vinciguerra at Hotchkiss who took the project forward. Anticipating that peace would at some stage break out, by 1941 Clément Vinciguerra had designed {{a new version of the}} Compound to take the B67 engine and transmission package. The design was similar to that of the existing car, but featured innovative touches such as an Americanized slatted front grill. Under the skin more dramatic changes were foreseen. Mindful of the materials shortages and technological restrictions that might accompany its production, the design for this car, known as “Project 704” had a greatly reduced dependency on exotic materials, and featured a traditional separate chassis. The design drawings progressed to the construction of a prototype which would be used as a private car and survived well after the war. This car clocked up more than 200,000 km before being scrapped. Unfortunately no one photographed it, however.|$|E
50|$|New floors {{require less}} work {{resulting}} in lower costs, {{but there are}} a few things to be aware of before a new concrete floor can be polished. Firstly the mix design of the concrete should be 3,500 psi or higher. The concrete should always be poured full depth to take advantage of the concretes full structural strength and to also help in preventing cracks. The concrete should always be professionally finished with power trowels and properly cured with water for 7 days. Polishing should not begin to the concrete is full cured (generally 28 days). The concrete slab can contain decorative aggregates to create many different aesthetically beautiful appearances. The concrete aggregate is typically the normal aggregates used in the region, but almost anything can be used. The finished surface of the concrete will need to be finished to a high standard to facilitate the polishing process. According to the Global Concrete Polishing Institute, a FF (floor flatness level) of 50 or greater is desired. During the finishing phase any decorative aggregates such as seashells, glass chips or even <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> parts can be dropped into the surface of the concrete. Builder needs to be aware as early as possible if the concrete is to be polished so that the final finish is of the best quality.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{motorcycle}} helmet standards use impacts {{at speeds}} between 4 - 7 m/s (9 - 16 mph). While motorcyclists frequently ride at speeds higher than 20 m/s (45 mph), the perpendicular impact {{speed of the}} helmet is usually {{not the same as}} the road speed of the motorcycle, and the severity of the impact is determined not only by the speed of the head but also by the surface it hits and the angle of impact. Since the surface of the road is almost parallel to the direction a motorcyclist moves while driving, only a small component of their velocity is directed perpendicularly (though other surfaces may be perpendicular to the motorcyclist's velocity, such as trees, walls, and the sides of other vehicles). The severity of an impact is also influenced by the nature of the surface struck. The sheet metal wall of a car door may bend inwards to a depth of 7.5 [...] - [...] 10 cm during a helmeted-head impact, allowing more stopping distance for the rider's head than the helmet itself. A perpendicular impact against a flat steel anvil at 5 m/s (11 mph) may be of approximate severity to an oblique impact against a concrete surface at 30 m/s (67 mph) or a perpendicular impact against a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> door or windscreen at 30 m/s. Since there is a wide range of severity in the impacts that could happen in a motorcycle accident, some will be more severe than the impacts used in the standard tests and some will be less.|$|E
50|$|The first 15 locos were swapped {{between the}} narrow and {{standard}} gauge networks {{by changing the}} bogies and couplers. However, by the mid 1960s problems were experienced in working wide standard gauge rolling stock such as the Treadwell hot <b>metal</b> <b>cars.</b> To overcome this {{it was decided to}} dedicate 37 to 41 to the narrow gauge network, with 42 to 53 were progressively fitted with 9 ft wide cabs and platforms to overcome the visibility problems.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{the first}} Dapper Day Car show {{was held in}} the parking lot of the Disneyland Hotel. Those who wished to {{register}} a vehicle for the show were encouraged to [...] "arrive in style" [...] by bringing cars defined by classic style and refined design from all time periods. Bare <b>metal</b> <b>cars,</b> rat rods, unfinished cars, [...] "work in progress" [...] cars, project cars, and motorcycles were not invited to participate in the event. Public viewing access was free, while food and refreshments were available from designated Disney vendors.|$|R

50|$|Seatbelts {{restrain}} the passengers so they don't {{fly through the}} windshield, and are in the correct position for the airbag and also spread the loading of impact on the body. Seat belts also absorb passenger inertial energy by being designed to stretch during an impact, again to reduce the speed differential between the passenger's body and their vehicle interior. In short: a passenger whose body is decelerated more slowly due to the crumple zone (and other devices) over a longer time survives much more often than a passenger whose body indirectly impacts a hard, undamaged <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> body which {{has come to a}} halt nearly instantaneously. It is like the difference between slamming someone into a wall headfirst (fracturing their skull) and shoulder-first (bruising their flesh slightly) is that the arm, being softer, has tens of times longer to slow its speed, yielding a little at a time, than the hard skull, which isn't in contact with the wall until it has to deal with extremely high pressures. The stretching of seatbelts while restraining occupants during an impact, means {{that it is necessary to}} replace them if a vehicle is repaired and put back on the road after a collision. They should also be replaced if their condition has deteriorated e.g. through fraying or mechanical or belt mounting faults. In New Zealand it is officially mandatory to replace worn inertia reel type seatbelts only with 'webbing grabber' type belts that have less play and are more effective on older cars. Newer cars have electronically fired pre-tension seatbelts that are timed to work with the airbag firing. Buying used seatbelts is not a good idea even in countries where it is legal to do so, because they may have already been stretched in an impact event and may not protect their new users as they should.|$|E
5000|$|During Summer, 1942 Gilbert (as {{were many}} {{manufacturing}} companies) was compelled by Federal wartime restrictions to cease manufacturing (and even servicing!) its electric train and other metal consumer products. It did not again publish American Flyer catalogs until 1946. The manufacturing hiatus offered the company {{the opportunity to}} further differentiate the products {{from those of the}} market leaders (by sales volume) Marx and Lionel. By Summer, 1945 it was able to resume limited manufacturing of the 3/16s scale O gauge trains. While it did so, the same sized products were re-engineered to run on much more realistic two rail (with a [...] "T" [...] profile rail) track. The fine detail of the diecast engines, tenders and cars that had debuted in the '39 catalog reappeared. The engines and tenders continued to be made of diecast metal, but the cars' bodies were made out of plastic. Two pages of the spectacular 1946 catalog emphasize the running advantages of the lighter cars. Ironically, they soon realized that they had to add weight. <b>Metal</b> <b>car</b> bottoms & chassis were necessary to prevent the too-light cars from tipping over. The 'link & pin' automatic couplers that had been introduced on the 3/16s O products were reduced in size, with plastic replacing the sintered metal of the originals. They too, later had metal weights added because they would fail to descend to the locking position needed for cars to couple. The chugging mechanisms of the premium O gauge tenders were redesigned to also generate smoke, which was conveyed to the engines' smokestacks via a black rubber tube that protruded out of the rear of the cab so that it could connect {{to the front of the}} tender.|$|E
40|$|Possibly {{the most}} common {{application}} of spot welding is in the automobile manufac-turing industry, where it is almost universally used to weld the sheet <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> components. However, due to manufacturing inaccuracies and fatigue failures an important number of spot welds may be missing in an operational vehicle. It seems {{that in order to}} properly analyze reliability of such structures, in particular crashworthiness reliability, the spot weld failures must be considered. Representing properties of each spot weld in a stochastic model by corresponding random variables is extremely inefficient. Therefore, in the cur-rent paper an approach is proposed for handling spot weld defects in the reliability analysis by accounting for their averaged influence on a failure criterion. The approach consists in appropriate treatment of a random noise component of the limit state function. The noise results from strategy of deleting a certain number of randomly selected spot weld elements from the finite element model each time the limit state function value is computed. Dealing with noisy limit state functions in structural reliability analysis is a challenging task. The only method that seems to be insensitive to this phenomenon is Monte Carlo sampling, which for most of the applications of practical interest is prohibitively expen-sive. Having this in mind, in the paper a method based on the algorithm proposed by Zou et al. in [23] is investigated. The method combines the best features of the first order reliabil-ity method, the response surface technique and the importance sampling method to achieve both accuracy and efficiency. A detailed study on the reliability of thin-walled s-rail sub-jected to crash is performed. Some suggestions concerning modification of the original algorithm are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Energy Balance Bowen Ratio System [...] Estimates {{of surface}} energy fluxes are a primary {{product of the}} data {{collection}} systems at the ARM SGP CART site. Surface fluxes tell researchers {{a great deal about}} the effects of interactions between the sun's energy and Earth. Surface fluxes of latent and sensible heat can be estimated by measuring temperature and relative humidity gradients across a vertical distance. Sensible heat is what we feel coming from a warm sidewalk or a <b>metal</b> <b>car</b> door; it can be measured with a thermometer. Latent heat, on the other hand, is released or absorbed during transformations such as the freezing of water into ice or the evaporation of morning dew from a lawn. Such a transformation is referred to as a ''phase change,'' the conversion of a substance among its solid, liquid, and vapor phases. Phase change is an important aspect of our climate. Earth's water cycle abounds with phase changes: rain falls and evaporates, changing from liquid to vapor; the water vapor in the air condenses to form clouds, changing from a gas into a liquid cloud droplet, and eventually falls to Earth's surface as rain or snow; snow falls and melts to liquid or sublimes directly to water vapor. This cyclic process has no end. Surface vegetation and land use play extremely important roles in surface energy fluxes. Plants absorb and reflect solar radiation and also take up water and expel water vapor. The type of plant material, its stage of growth, and its color determine whether and to what extent the surface and air can couple and exchange energy...|$|E
40|$|The {{steel mills}} in Bethlehem are quiet now, but Mildred T. Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s boldly colored {{needlepoint}} tapestries vividly {{remind us of}} their awesome power in the 1940 s and 1950 s. Far from being realistic, literal renderings, these abstract and highly textural interpretations use steel making {{as a metaphor for}} modern life. The machinery is larger than life, crackling and spewing out the molten steel used to construct oilrigs and skyscrapers. The people in the mill are very small—the anonymous steelworkers in masks, the artist as a bewildered Alice in a Wonderland of Steel. Mildred Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s needlepoints are personal and spiritual. Her Buddha rising above the blast furnace signals that no matter how deafening the machinery, spiritual beliefs can prevail, bestowing a semblance of calm in a fast-paced, dehumanized world. Mildred Johnstone received her artistic training from a variety of sources. In the early 1940 s, she studied painting at the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia. Although she liked painting, she soon realized that her busy lifestyle did not lend itself to oil painting. Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s second husband, William H. Johnstone, was {{vice president in charge of}} financial and legal matters at Bethlehem Steel. Consequently, the Johnstones spent a great deal of time traveling within the United States and abroad on Bethlehem Steel business. In the 1930 s and early 1940 s, Milly (as she was known) created small decorative embroideries—monogrammed towels, ecclesiastical embroideries, and a wall hanging based on a Pennsylvania-German design. These needlework projects, a hesitant first step in finding her artistic medium, kept her fingers busy during her travels, but they did not satisfy her aesthetic curiosity. The turning point in Johnstone 2 ̆ 7 s artistic career came in 1948 when, on the invitation of her husband, she became the first woman to tour the Bethlehem Steel works. Awed by the power and grandeur of the place, she envisioned herself as Alice in Wonderland, growing smaller and smaller. When asked which elements of steel making she most responded to she stated: 2 ̆ 2 That is difficult to say. What you call the elements are something to be felt, not itemized. Perhaps one will be a giant hook silhouetted against the sky; another a hot <b>metal</b> <b>car.</b> Or I may stop and photograph the web like tracery of a catwalk atop a blast furnace. 2 ̆ 21 These visits provided Johnstone with the inspiration and material she needed for her needlepoint series on the theme of steel making...|$|E
