We demonstrate performance on 9 different <b>videos.</b> <b>Motion</b> magnification performance is equivalent to existing manual methods...|$|R

5|$|Starting with Final FantasyVIII, {{the series}} adopted a more photo-realistic look.

Final FantasyIX returned to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series, although it still maintained, {{and in many cases}} slightly upgraded, most of the graphical techniques used in the previous two games. Final FantasyX was released on the PlayStation 2, and used the more powerful hardware to render graphics in real-time instead of using pre-rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look; the game features full 3D environments, rather than have 3D character models move about pre-rendered backgrounds. It is also the first Final Fantasy game to introduce voice acting, occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to the character's reactions, emotions, and development.|$|E
