40|$|This major {{research}} paper (MRP) provides {{a strong case}} for dismissing the overblown rhetoric of nuclear alarmism by demonstrating that a multitude of constructive actions are being taken in order to mitigate what is a substantially small threat. By effectively evaluating the arguments for alarmism and responding to them in turn, this MRP asserts that the assumptions from which stem the contemporary overblown rhetoric on nuclear terrorism are not grounded. Fears about terrorists operating independently to acquire nuclear materials, fears about the safety of nuclear installations and radiological sources as well as fears about state-sponsored nuclear terrorism are assuaged through a reasoned deconstruction of arguments. Furthermore, this MRP argues that <b>multilateral</b> nuclear security <b>initiatives</b> are an essential component of global counter-nuclear terrorism efforts, given that there are numerous unilateral, bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>initiatives</b> that exist explicitly for the prevention of nuclear weapon proliferation within the arsenals of terrorists...|$|R

40|$|Background: The US National Library of Medicine {{supports}} the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Malaria (MIM) through the design, implementation, {{and operation of}} the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Malaria Communications Network (MIMCom.) MIMCom makes possible enhanced access to the Internet and to medical literature. Objectives: The main objectives {{of the present study}} were to examine the use of MIMCom supported information technology (IT) by scientists, students, and administrative personnel to facilitate communication, retrieve information, obtain documents, write proposals, and prepare papers for publication; and to determine the contribution of this intervention to their professional performance. Methods: The authors analyzed the contribution of enhanced Internet connectivity and access to electronic information resources to the performance of malaria research staff and their institutes through a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 181 respondents at 14 health research centers in Africa. Separate reviews of bandwidth usage, requests for document delivery, and publications in peer reviewed journals support the data of the survey. Results: The MIMCom network makes a positive contribution to the performance of malaria researchers and support staff at the sites reviewed by improving e-mail exchange, access to published literature, and research proposal development and submission. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E

Further development of human resources and insti-tutional capacity in Africa is essential to enhance the ability of African countries to address their own health problems. The MIM aims to publicize existing training opportunities and develop research capacity further by facilitating effec-tive scientific partnerships across Africa, and between Af-rican researchers and colleagues internationally...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. “When spider webs unite, {{they can}} tie up a lion ” (Ethiopian folk adage). The <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Malaria Communications Network (MIMCom) {{facilitates}} {{a new way}} of doing research in Africa and African scientists’ participation in the international scientific community. The MIMCom supports full access to the Internet and the resources of the WorldWide Web at 19 research sites in 11 African countries. Furthermore, the MIMCom project comprises two websites: one includes links to resources, databases, and publications as well as a document delivery service for full text journal articles, and the other is a research agenda specific website with a server for a research network desiring to share raw data. Other important components of MIMCom are training and evaluation components. The MIMCom was conceived in 1997 by African researchers and has been designed, implemented, and overseen by the U. S. National Library of Medicine in collaboration with partners in Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This project demonstrates clearly that it can make a positive difference in the functioning of remote research sites in Africa, in terms of site growth and productivity and in the professional lives of individual researchers. This report reviews the project’s background, methods of operation with an emphasis on local needs and priorities, cost effectiveness, and local responsibility; results focusing on a technical network; documentation of the system and two-way exchange of information; the MIMCom website; a network approach to research; and financial sustainability. The report concludes with summaries of evaluations by an independent panel, the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Malaria Secretariat, and the U. S. National Library of Medicine...|$|E

40|$|Among ENP countries, Azerbaijan is {{outstanding}} {{because it}} leans on its resource base {{and sees the}} EU at {{the receiving end of}} bilateral relations. At the other extreme, Ukraine depends on EU cooperation, especially with respect to trade. We develop a comprehensive theoretical concept for analyzing both types of asymmetries. We do this by considering both rational cost-benefit as well as constructivist norm oriented national strategies. Furthermore, we contrast the both national strategies to bilateral, regional, and multilateral EU strategies for democracy promotion, economic cooperation, justice and home affairs cooperation, and conflict resolution in European neighbourhood. It turns out that EU strategies of Neighbourhood Europeanization have to be increasingly based on non-tangible tools, on packages of regional and <b>multilateral</b> <b>initiatives</b> which balance out asymmetries, and on other tha...|$|R
