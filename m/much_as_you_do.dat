25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do)</b> while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions {{with respect to the}} quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Lansbury's {{performance}} were overwhelmingly positive. In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth {{and a very}} taking [...]" [...] The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys it as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> And it lasts {{as long as you}} are on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door." ...|$|E

60|$|I am {{thinking}} (this is {{said in a}} whisper, and in confidence--of two kinds), I {{am thinking}} that you don't admire him quite <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> three weeks ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you're stubborn, eh?" [...] Del Mar sneered at him. [...] "The {{matter with}} you is you're thoroughbred. Well, my boy, it just happens I know your kind and I reckon I can make you get busy and work for me just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> for that other guy. Now get busy." ...|$|R
2500|$|House Committee on Un-American Activities {{chairman}} Martin Dies {{called him}} a Communist, and Stout is reputed to have said to him, [...] "I hate Communists as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Martin, but there's one difference between us. I know what a Communist is and you don't." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the days}} before the war, the players were paid off in the dark. Some of the Canadian players took money and others didn't, though nearly all of them {{accepted}} gifts. Imports from the United States were paid in cash [...] - [...] somewhere between $1,000 and $1,200 for a season. Today you have to pay them all, homebreds or imports, and you have to pay them about four times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> before the war.|$|R
6000|$|As ill-luck {{would have}} it, however--I write as I then felt--about three days after, Mrs. Venn said to me, [...] "I've invited Mr. Cameron, {{one of our}} sub-lieutenants, to dine this evening, and I've had to invite his guest, young Carvalho, as well. By the way, Edie, if I were you, I wouldn't talk quite so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the other evening to Mr. Carvalho. You know, dear, though he doesn't look it, he's a brown man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Missis Dashwood," [...] {{said the}} Bloater, {{with a look}} of serio-comic dignity, [...] "I scorns bribery <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>does.</b> `No bribery, no c'rupt'ons, no Popery,' them's my mottoes--besides a few more that there's no {{occasion}} to mention. W'ether or not I gives 'im up depends on circumstances. Now, I s'pose you want's 'im took an' bagged, 'cause 'e ain't fit for your friend Martha Reading--we'll drop the `Miss' if you please.

6000|$|... "Can she now? I {{understand}} what you mean, but I don't believe a word of it. The bishop manages his own affairs himself, quite as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> or Mr. Harold Smith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's strange." [...] Mrs. Chudleigh's {{tone was}} sympathetically grave. [...] "I feel <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> After all, {{it may have}} been one of the affairs about which the truth never quite comes out." ...|$|E
6000|$|BRODIE. Not half so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> But I {{see what}} you're driving at; and if I can {{illuminate}} {{the course of}} justice, you may command me. (He sits, and motions HUNT to do likewise.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> {{to get to}} the station,' said Neigh, {{turning the}} face of his watch to the light. 'Here, come into my cab--I am driving that way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{all right}} now. <b>You</b> have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> {{to take care}} of yourself, and it is not fair to half carry me <b>as</b> <b>you</b> and Poyor have been doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't doin' half so <b>much</b> threatenin' <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> an' besides, I'm payin' for the {{privilege}} when I give you pretty nigh all the money I've got, an' you with a pocket full." ...|$|R
6000|$|The master-sentences of Edward's letter were these: 'You speak truly. That {{we never}} meet again is the wisest and only proper course. That I regret {{the past as}} <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> yourself, it is hardly {{necessary}} for me to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no thought}} of your leaving him," [...] Malinche said, kindly. [...] "Roger is to {{accompany}} you. He needs rest and peace almost as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Besides, {{he has been}} seriously wounded, though he makes light of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You amusing old Tory! Shall I {{throw you}} {{into a state of}} trance? No! I'll give you a shock of another kind--a shock of surprise. I know as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> about Mr. Gracedieu's daughters. What do you think of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gave him}} life just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] Susan was wont to say. [...] "He is just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> my baby <b>as</b> he is yours." [...] And, indeed, {{it was always}} to Susan that Shirley ran, to be kissed for bumps, and rocked to sleep, and {{protected}} from well-deserved spankings. Susan had conscientiously spanked all the other Blythe children when she thought they needed it for their souls' good, {{but she would not}} spank Shirley nor allow his mother to do it. Once, Dr. Blythe had spanked him and Susan had been stormily indignant.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would find}} it very hard work tugging the wire across, Bullen. The stream would catch it and, as it is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> to swim the current without any drawback, it would {{certainly}} carry you down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary dear," [...] said Fan, bending {{back her}} head {{so as to}} look into her friend's face, [...] "you were very angry with me yesterday, but to-day--now <b>you</b> love me <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>did.</b> Is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They shall know as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> {{and more}} too, {{if you go}} on with that. There's a measure in all things. I won't have it done, so I tell you." [...] And the father turned his face round to the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because, you know, Harry {{does not}} want it so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I am sure I wish you success with all my heart. Perhaps it's wicked to wish for either of you over the other; but you can't both get it at once, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Ruby, {{you would}} never care to live upon a miserable pittance of three hundred a year! I hate the name as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but I think I should try to bear it {{for the sake of}} twelve hundred a year and perfect comfort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will it make {{it easier}} if I say that, quite apart from his daughter's wishes, I am bound in honor to protect the {{interests}} of Julius Savine so far as I can?" [...] interposed Geoffrey. [...] "Your father found me <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> a struggling adventurer, and with unusual kindness helped me {{on the way to}} prosperity. All I have I owe to him, and perhaps, the more so because we have cunning enemies, my own mind is bent on the completion of the scheme. I believe that we shall triumph, Miss Savine, and I use the word advisedly, still expecting much from your father's skill." ...|$|R

2500|$|The school motto Quantum Potes Tantum Aude ("Dare All You Can, for God and Man") was {{introduced}} by the rector-headmaster, Fr Thomas Gartlan SJ, in 1906. Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is now formally translated from Latin <b>as</b> [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do,</b> so <b>much</b> dare to do", seen to best reflect the Latin, replacing the former [...] "Dare to do your Best". The motto is taken from a song of Saint Thomas Aquinas (12271274) entitled Lauda Sion Salvatorem ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is Quia Maior Omni Laude, which, together, translates to [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do,</b> so <b>much</b> dare to do, because He is above all praise".|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you, Cacama. My {{position}} here {{has become a}} very painful one.

6000|$|... "It's very silly {{of you to}} be so {{sensitive}} about your club-foot," [...] she said. She saw him bush darkly, but went on.

6000|$|... 'Redgauntlet,' said Sir Richard Glendale, calmly, 'your reproaches {{shall not}} goad me into {{anything}} of which my reason disapproves. That I respect my engagement as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> is evident, since I am here, ready {{to support it}} with the best blood in my veins. But has the king really come hither entirely unattended?' ...|$|E
