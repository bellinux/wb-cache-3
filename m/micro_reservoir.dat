40|$|With {{the advent}} of modern era of {{pharmaceutical}} dosage forms, transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) established itself {{as an integral part}} of novel drug delivery systems. Transdermal patches are polymeric formulations which when applied to skin deliver the drug at a predetermined rate across dermis to achieve systemic effects. Transdermal dosage forms, though a costly alternative to conventional formulations, are becoming popular because of their unique advantages. Controlled absorption, more uniform plasma levels, improved bioavailability, reduced side effects, painless and simple application and flexibility of terminating drug administration by simply removing the patch from the skin are some of the potential advantages of transdermal drug delivery. Development of controlled release transdermal dosage form is a complex process involving extensive efforts. This review article describes the methods of preparation of different types of transdermal patches viz., matrix patches, reservoir type, membrane matrix hybrid patches, drug-in-adhesive patches and <b>micro</b> <b>reservoir</b> patches. In addition, the various methods of evaluation of transdermal dosage form have also been reviewed...|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 D) {{printing technology}} is rapidly evolving such that printing speed {{is now a}} crucial factor in technological developments and future applications. For printing heads based on the inkjet concept, the number of nozzles on the print head is a limiting factor of printing speed. This paper offers a method to practically {{increase the number of}} nozzles unlimitedly, and thus to dramatically ramp up printing speed. Fluid reservoirs are used in inkjet print heads to supply fluid through a manifold to the jetting chambers. The pressure in the reservoir’s outlet is important and influences device performance. Many efforts have been made to regulate pressure inside the fluid reservoirs so as to obtain a constant pressure in the chambers. When the number of nozzles is increased too much, the regulation of uniform pressure among all the nozzles becomes too complicated. In this paper, a different approach is taken. The reservoir is divided into an array of many micro-reservoirs. Each micro-reservoir supports one or a few chambers, and has a unique structure with auto-pressure regulation, where the outlet pressure is independent of the fluid level. The regulation is based on auto-compensation of the gravity force and a capillary force having the same dependence on the fluid level; this feature is obtained by adding a wedge in the reservoir with a unique shape. When the fluid level drops, the gravitational force and the capillary force decrease with it, but at similar rates. Terms for the force balance are derived and, consequently, a constant pressure in the fluid micro-reservoir segment is obtained automatically, with each segment being autonomous. This <b>micro</b> <b>reservoir</b> array is suggested for the enlargement of an inkjet print head and the achievement of high-speed 3 D printing...|$|E

Their unique properties show promise for high-value technological applications in the medical, biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, liquid marbles were prepared from six mixtures of water and glycerol by releasing droplets from different heights onto a loosely packed powder bed using a 1 mL syringe. Pictures of the liquid marbles were taken with a stereo microscope (SMZ series) with a 3 MP Motic camera. The powders used were Aerosil R 202, hydrophobic glass ballotini and PTFE spheres.

40|$|Traditional {{medicine}} injection is done {{by medical}} professionals. Patients need to see doctors or nurses for medicine injection. This brings inconvenience for the patients and increases the cost of medical care. Many senior patients with chronical diseases may need to inject multiple medicines everyday.

Some medicine (such as insulin for diabetic patients) need to be delivered with precise dosage control according to the patient’s real-time need. Manual injection by rough estimation may lead to under-dose or overdose. All these made the medicine delivery a complicated and challenging task. In this research, a smart drug delivery system which can automatically inject the medicines according to preprogrammed sequence is proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring {{body fluids}} such as sweat {{composition}} can provide useful {{information about the}} physiological status. Physiological monitoring of body fluids such as sweat with a textile-based system {{has the advantage of}} being non-invasive and easily accessible and such monitoring is beneficial to indicate information about body’s physiological status. In the present study, it is aimed to design a textile-based system with non-invasive methods which can be used to monitor a sportsman’s performance. A novel, disposable and wearable biochemical analytical device was designed and fabricated by patterning <b>micro</b> channels and <b>reservoirs</b> using SU- 8 photoresist through photolithography technique on an absorbant bicomponent Evolon ® nonwoven substrate. It was obtained that hydrophilic reservoirs were well defined and demarcated by hydrophobic barriers. Therefore, no liquid leakage was observed around the reservoirs which was crucial for achieving a proper enzyme immobilization and the successful detection of the color change after the simulated sweat was deposited on the hydrophilic reservoir areas. Analyte optimization studies revealed that color change became more evident with the increasing analyte concentration until 20 mM and started to decrease with further increase due to analyte inhibition.

40|$|Foam flooding, as an {{enhanced}} oil recovery (EOR) process, has become {{of great interest}} to the oil industry. However, the mechanism of oil displacement by foam has not been fully understood. This thesis describes the visualization of foam on a pore-scale level using microfluidic devices. A micro model patterned with a heterogeneous porous media was designed to mimic reservoir with permeability contrast. The micro model is made with Norland Optical Adhesive 81 (NOA 81), an optical transparent material with high organic resistance available for crude oil tests. Foam was injected into the <b>reservoir</b> <b>micro</b> model to displace trapped crude oil. The smart rheology of foam can help mitigate reservoir heterogeneity by separating into dry- and wet-phases such that the flow resistance in high-perm region is much higher than that in low-perm region. Bubbles could block the high-perm region and divert more fluids to displace the oil in low-perm part. One hypothesis is that the phase separation of foam is due to the difference in capillary entry pressure. Thusly foam shows a better sweep efficiency compared to gas and water flooding. This thesis also compared different injection foam quality for different surfactant solutions. Results showed that higher foam quality has better sweep efficiency, especially in low-perm region. This is because high foam quality can create denser lamellae that increase flow resistance, which will thusly divert more liquid phase into low-perm region, improving oil displacement. Foam made with mixture of Lauryl Betaine (LB) and C 14 - 16 Alpha Olefin Sulfonate (AOS) showed a better sweep compared to foam consisting of only AOS. The reason is that AOS foam tended to collapse more easily, changing to very coarse foam...|$|R
40|$|Land {{degradation}} due {{to water}} erosion and the highly variable (often insufficient) rainfall present major threats to food security and sustainable livelihood in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Since the 1980 s, {{soil and water}} conservation (SWC) structures such as stone bunds and conservation trenches have been widely installed to counteract water erosion. In addition, the regional government of Tigray initiated water harvesting and irrigation development programs using <b>micro</b> dam <b>reservoirs.</b> However, the success of these reservoirs is limited due to reduced water inflow as a result from the extensive installation of SWC structures in the catchments intended to reduce siltation of these reservoirs. In order to contribute to a better planning of SWC measures and micro dams, the overall objective of this PhD thesis is to provide {{a better understanding of the}} effects of typical land use types, slope gradients and SWC structures on rainfall-runoff response and soil loss at runoff plot scale. Mayleba catchment (18 km 2) located ca. 40 km to the west from Mekelle was selected for this study. The catchment consists of two dominant land use types: cropland and rangeland. For each land use type, three representative sites were selected for runoff plots installation at gentle (5 %), medium (12 %) and steep (16 %) slopes. At each site in cropland, three runoff plots were installed: a control plot (without SWC structures), a plot with stone bunds and a plot with both stone bunds and trenches. At each site in rangeland, four runoff plots were installed: a control plot, a plot with stone bunds, a plot with both stone bunds and trenches and a plot with conservation trenches. SWC structures were randomly allotted to the plots at each site and installed based on recommended horizontal spacing. Replicate runoff plot sites were installed only for a medium slope site. Rainfall, runoff, soil loss, vegetation cover and soil moisture contents measurements were conducted for 28 runoff plots (520 - 1000 m 2) during three consecutive rainy seasons (2010 to 2012). For the cropland plots, also the crop productivity was monitored. To understand the effects of land use type, slope gradient and SWC structures on runoff production and soil loss, the data collected in 2010 were analyzed. Results show that seasonal runoff coefficients (RCs) were much higher for rangeland (0. 38 < RCs < 0. 50) than for cropland (0. 11 < RCS < 0. 15). Also seasonal soil loss (SLs) values were five to six times larger on rangeland (28. 6 < SLs < 50. 0 ton ha- 1) compared to cropland (4. 6 < SLs < 11. 4 ton ha- 1). These higher RCs and SLs values on rangelands are attributed to the fact that rangeland plots are heavily grazed, resulting in a low vegetation cover and soil compaction due to trampling. Cropland plots, on the other hand, are tilled (promoting infiltration) and have on average a higher vegetation cover. SWC structures strongly reduced both runoff and soil loss. The average RCs for control plots in rangeland was 0. 43 while the corresponding RCs for stone bunds, conservation trenches and stone bunds with trenches were 0. 32, 0. 14 and 0. 07 respectively. In cropland, the average RCs for control plots was 0. 13, while the corresponding values for plots with stone bunds and stone bunds with trenches were 0. 09 and 0. 07 respectively. In both land use types, SWC structures were more effective in reducing soil loss than in reducing runoff. In rangeland, SLs was reduced from an average of 38. 7 ton ha- 1 on the control plots to 14. 3 ton ha- 1 for plots with stone bunds, 4 ton ha- 1 for plots with conservation trenches and 1. 3 ton ha- 1 for plots with stone bunds and trenches. In cropland average SLs was reduced from 7. 2 under control conditions to 4. 3 ton ha- 1 (stone bunds) and 1. 1 ton ha- 1 (stone bunds with trenches). These reductions in SLs and RCs were observed during the first rainy season (2010) after installation. However, the effectiveness of these SWC structures declined over the three consecutive rainy seasons (2010 - 2012), due to the infilling with sediment. This is particularly the case for the conservation trenches and stone bunds with trenches installed in rangeland. Their effectiveness declined at both the event and at seasonal scale. For rangeland plots with stone bunds and trenches, average daily runoff depth was 17 % of the runoff on the corresponding control plot in 2010 but in 2012 this value increased to 34 %. For rangeland plots with conservation trenches, average daily runoff depth increased from 32 % of the runoff on the corresponding control plot in 2010 to 81 % in 2012. Likewise, average SLs increased from 4 ton ha- 1 to 20. 7 ton ha- 1 for conservation trenches and from 1. 3 ton ha- 1 to 4. 4 ton ha- 1 for stone bunds with trenches. Stone bunds are overall less effective in reducing runoff and soil loss but their effectiveness remain fairly constant over time. These losses in effectiveness are mainly attributed to the progressive reduction of the storage capacity of the SWC structures due to sediment infilling. The effectiveness of SWC structures installed in cropland plots did not show a clear evolution over time. Average soil moisture content (SMC) of the topsoil of the plots in cropland was larger compared to those in rangelands. The effect of slope gradient on SMC of the topsoil is significant for both land use type while the effect of SWC structures is insignificant. Average grain yield and above-ground biomass is larger for plots on gentle and medium slopes, compared to plots on steep slopes. Grain yield for most plots with SWC structures were larger (- 12  52. 7 %) than those for the control plots, even when accounting for the space occupied by the SWC structures. Within plots with SWC structures, grain yields and above-ground biomass are respectively 30  44 % and 8  48 % larger for the accumulation zones compared to the middle zones of the plots. Based on the collected rainfall-runoff data, CN values were calculated for the different SWC structures. CN values ranged from 34 to 91 for plots with and without SWC structures. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the CN method is reliable for most of the plots. Nevertheless, they remain subjectto important uncertainties. Comparison of our fitted CN values to the CN values that would be obtained from standardized tables, that only take into account land use, hydrological soil group and antecedent moisture conditions, showed that the latter overestimate the CN values by ca. 21 %. Based on the measured plot soil losses, rainfall and the soil and surface properties of the plots, also cover-management (C) and support practice (P) factors for the RUSLE erosion model were calculated. On average, C factor values range from 0. 15 to 0. 25 for cropland and from 0. 45 to 0. 71 for rangeland. Average P factors for stone bunds range from 0. 36 to 0. 47 in cropland and between 0. 36 and 0. 39 for rangeland. Average P factor for stone bunds with trenches ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 12 in cropland and from 0. 03 to 0. 11 in rangeland. Conservation trenches installed in rangeland had average P factor values ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 46. For plots where a decreased effectiveness of the SWC measures was observed over time, corresponding time-specific P-factors were also calculated. These results will help to address soil and water management challenges in Tigray through an optimization of soil erosion control measures, catchment management and the design of reservoirs. status: publishe...|$|R
