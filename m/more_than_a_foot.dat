500|$|In central Greenland {{a typical}} year might produce {{two or three}} feet of winter snow, plus {{a few inches of}} summer snow. [...] When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> of ice. [...] The layers {{corresponding}} to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. [...] As the depth increases {{to the point where the}} ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. [...] Dust layers may now become visible. [...] Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. [...] These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> and a half square?" ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{event was}} the second of four nor'easters during the 2009-2010 winter that brought heavy snow to enough of the Northeast's {{population}} to be numerically recognized by NOAA's NESIS intensity rating. [...] The first and third of these systems, the December 2009 Nor'Easter and the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard, respectively, combined with this event to bring the snowiest winter on record {{to much of the}} Mid-Atlantic. [...] Additionally, this event {{was the second}} of three major Mid-Atlantic snowstorms that occurred over a 12-day period; each subsequent storm focused its heaviest snow slightly farther north: the January 30, 2010 storm (not recognized by NESIS) dropped <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> of snow across Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay region, while the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard bulls-eyed the Maryland-Pennsylvania border with as much as 38.3 inches.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese beachheads {{from which}} the Kokoda {{campaign}} was launched were located about three key positions along a [...] stretch of the north coast of New Guinea: Gona to the west, Buna {{to the east and}} Sanananda–Giruwa in the centre. Roughly [...] northeast of Port Moresby, it approximates to the most direct line from there to the north coast. The settlements are located on a thin coastal strip that separates the sea from a tidal forest swamp of mangroves, nipa and sago. Rivers flowing across the broad, flat, coastal plain from the Owen Stanley Range disappear into the swamps and discharge to the sea through many coastal creeks. The coastal strip is rarely more than a few hundred yards at its widest, to little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> pad separating the swamp from the sea. The few paths through the swamp were seldom more than [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|The Minnesota Vikings' U.S. Bank Stadium faced {{a similar}} controversy; because the Minneapolis offices of Wells Fargo, a rival {{to the new}} stadium's naming rights sponsor U.S. Bank, are located within the {{vicinity}} of the stadium, Wells Fargo agreed to only install [...] "non-mounted," [...] non-illuminated signage on its building, such as letters painted directly onto the roof. After the original agreement was reached, Wells Fargo had asked the team to allow the installation of [...] "raised, illuminated lettering. mounted on beams <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> above the roof rather than painted on the roof as agreed upon". Such signage would be visible in overhead views of U.S. Bank Stadium (such as camera shots during event telecasts), Wells Fargo threatened to light the entire rooftops of its offices if the Vikings chose to deny the requested change. In December 2015, the Vikings sued Wells Fargo for violating the agreement, after they began to construct an illuminated sign on their rooftop. On June 23, 2016, Judge Donovan W. Frank ruled in favor of the Vikings, and ordered Wells Fargo to remove the raised, illuminated signage.|$|E

Behind only the two species of bison, the moose is the second largest land animal in both North America and Europe.|$|E
