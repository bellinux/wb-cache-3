[...] In <b>this</b> field <b>varactor</b> diodes are used as a voltage variable capacitor in frequency multipliers, parametric amplifiers and variable filters. [...] These diodes store a charge in their junction when reverse biased which {{is the source of}} the capacitor effect. [...] The slope of the voltage-stored charge curve is called differential elastance in this field.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an ultracompact antenna design suited for digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H) reception devices. The DVB-H frequency band is ranging from 4 70 to 862 MHz and divided in 49 channels of 8 MHz. Designed {{to be integrated}} in a tablet, {{it is not only}} heavily miniaturized (λ 0 / 49 × λ 0 / 71 ×λ 0 / 160 at 470 MHz), but also able to cover each channel thanks to the use of a magneto-dielectric material. The advantage of using such a material is studied and described in this paper. Moreover, the operating frequency is continuously tuned over the whole DVB-H band by the integration of a <b>varactor</b> diode. <b>This</b> <b>varactor</b> diode has been characterized and modeled to properly cosimulate its behavior within the antenna. Limitations in terms of accepted power by the diode are emphasizing. Finally, the antenna design, including both magneto-dielectric material and varactor diode is integrated in the DVB-H receiver device. Measurement performances are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Novel zipper {{varactors with}} the {{potential}} for achieving large tuning ranges have been fabricated and characterized. These varactors have a curved cantilever electrode that is actuated by a single pull-down electrode. The shape of the cantilever is designed such that its local stiffness is tailored to enable extended stable zipping. In a series-mounted varactor, the measured capacitance ratio was 16. 5 for actuation voltages between 0 and 46 V. However, the presence of an unexpected tuning instability at 32 V bias limited the practical tuning range in <b>this</b> <b>varactor.</b> <b>This</b> behaviour was attributed to fabrication imperfections. The first electrical self-resonant frequency of the same varactor was extrapolated to be 72. 6 and 17. 2 GHz at 20 and 329 fF, respectively. In a different shunt-mounted varactor, the quality factor (Q) was measured to be 91 (60 fF) and 176 (600 fF) at 2 GHz. Including the anchor, the varactors have a small device footprint and fit within an area of 500 by 100 µm...|$|R
