5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> {{in the world at}} similar latitudes. This {{is a result of the}} moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was Hurricane Hilda, a powerful Category4 hurricane that devastated portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially Mississippi and Louisiana. Upon striking the latter as a Category3, Hilda brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, tornadoes, and coastal flooding. <b>Many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the Southern United States experienced flooding from Hilda and its remnants. Overall, Hilda caused 38deaths and about $126million in damage. The names Cleo, Dora, and Hilda were retired following the season. Collectively, the {{tropical cyclone}}s resulted in 270fatalities and approximately $609.5million in damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the WLOL call letters is {{intertwined}} with <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>area</b> stations.

5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain and <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of}} the river throughout the 20thcentury. After the first irrigation dams on the river began operation {{in the first decade of}} the 20thcentury, much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture, and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake. Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal. Fertilizer, manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load, especially of phosphorus, fecal coliforms and nitrogen. During low water, algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river, depleting its oxygen supply.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|During Beebe's later years, Simla was an {{important}} gathering point for researchers in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh {{that had been a}} gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.|$|E

5|$|In {{the revival}} of neo-Platonism Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's {{greatest}} works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift {{took place in the}} way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were brought back from Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars {{for the first time since}} late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, would help pave the way for the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} the Southampton walls were used to mount {{searchlights}} and machineguns on during the Second World War; the walls escaped damage, unlike <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the medieval city. In the post-war period the historic importance of the town walls was recognised and considerable conservation work has been conducted on the walls, including reversing the Victorian alterations to the Arcades. The town walls became seen as {{an important part of}} Southampton's tourist industry; health and safety concerns, however, prohibit tourists walking along most of the circuit. God's House tower reopened in 1961 opened as Southampton's Museum of Archaeology. Today the walls are protected as grade I listed buildings and as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} to draw investment {{to the city}} after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by {{the construction of the}} Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European Jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews, came to the city during this period. This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of Texas and the western U.S.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{many of the}} city's slums were demolished, and {{replaced}} with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats. Large {{parts of the city}} centre were also cleared {{to make way for a}} new system of roads. Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> of the UK. The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Super Outbreak was the largest, costliest, {{and one of}} {{the deadliest}} tornado {{outbreaks}} ever recorded, affecting the Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake. The event affected Alabama and Mississippi the most severely, but it also produced destructive tornadoes in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, and affected <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> throughout the Southern and Eastern United States. In total, 362 tornadoes were confirmed by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) and Government of Canada's Environment Canada in 21 states from Texas to New York to southern Canada. Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, with April 27 being the most active day with a record of 218 tornadoes touching down that day from midnight to midnight CDT (0500 – 0500 UTC). Four of the tornadoes were destructive enough to be rated EF5, which is the highest ranking possible on the Enhanced Fujita scale; typically these tornadoes are only recorded about once each year or less.|$|E
