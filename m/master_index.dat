5000|$|The High Yield Master II Index {{came into}} being in 1989.

The existing High Yield <b>Master</b> <b>Index</b> excluded two types of issues that were becoming popular because of the boom in leveraged buyout financing, zero-coupon bonds and payment-in-kind (PIK) bonds. Galdi's solution was to maintain the existing rules for the <b>Master</b> <b>Index,</b> but to create a new index that included [...] "zeros" [...] and PIKs.

The patient is assigned a unique identifier {{that is used to}} refer to this patient across the enterprise. The objective is to ensure that each patient is represented only once across all the software systems used within the organization. The essential patient data includes name, gender, date of birth, race and ethnicity, social security number, current address and contact information, insurance information, current diagnoses, most recent date of hospital admission and discharge (if applicable), etc.|$|R

40|$|A <b>Master</b> Person <b>Index</b> (MPI) is a {{software}} system that links together the records about individuals from a diverse {{set of data}} sources and that allows data consumers to ¬¬retrieve correlated data for a given person. The Utah Department of Health recently contracted with Utah State University to build an MPI that links data from four initial data sources, and with enough extensibility that it will eventually handle dozens. This MPI, called the Utah Public-health <b>Master</b> Person <b>Index</b> or phMPI, was to include a special software component that automatically computed the “best version of truth” about each individual using correlated data from the various sources. This report documents the design, implementation, and {{testing of a prototype}} for that component. Because the phMPI’s design uses a service-oriented architecture, this component is a stand-alone software service that could be adapted and integrated into other MPI’s...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{applications}} {{are increasingly being}} deployed to support interactions among widely distributed users. Replication of state that enables interaction among distributed users {{can be used to}} provide acceptable repsonse time in the presence of high communication latencies. Recent research has suggested using shared objects as the middleware for developing collaborative applications to minimize communication traffic. One of the key issues in using shared objects middleware to support collaborative applications is to allow nodes to dynamically join and departure. This paper presents four methods to manage distributed object directories in the presence of dynamic join and departure operations in shared objects middleware: full redistribution, <b>master,</b> <b>indexed</b> hashing and ondemand indexed hashing. We have compared these four schemes with four criteria: even distribution, memory overhead, number of messages and algorithm complexity. Among these four schemes, the two indexed hashing schemes on average are better than the other two schemes...|$|R

He called the indices [...] "an exercise in clear and consise functionality" [...] and that using the [...] "effective notation system, it's easy to find anything" [...] listed in the index, but cautioned that [...] "you have to think in TSR terms and titles to find the entry". Webb summed up his review of the Dungeon Master Screen & <b>Master</b> <b>Index</b> by saying: [...] "The index is essential stuff; the screens less so, since most DMs have evolved their own screen or alternative system for ready reference.
