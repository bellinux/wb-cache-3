25|$|The book is {{in three}} sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, {{including}} animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of {{dogs and cats}} that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes {{for half an hour}} or <b>more</b> <b>ahead</b> of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when {{she was on her way}} home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.|$|E
500|$|Almost 250 {{different}} fires {{started in}} Yellowstone {{and the surrounding}} National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed [...] "Black Saturday", more than [...] were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted {{as far away as}} Billings, Montana, [...] to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6km) or <b>more</b> <b>ahead</b> of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over [...] high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of [...] a day, and there were even occasions when more than [...] in one hour were recorded.|$|E

500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said [...] "Eagleton" [...] further {{added to}} the mythology Parks and Recreation has built for itself by {{fleshing}} out the neighboring town." [...] He also praised Leslie's birthday surprise for Ron, claiming it [...] "sets Parks & Rec even <b>more</b> <b>ahead</b> of its competitors. Us Weekly writer John Griffiths gave the episode three-and-a-half out of four stars, and called {{it one of the}} show's [...] "sharpest outings yet". He described Poehler and Posey's performance off of each other as [...] "smart and feisty fun". USA Today writer Whitney Matheson called [...] "Eagleton" [...] the best episode of television of the week, and noted that Posey's performance contributed to an [...] "already-great series". Joel Keller of TV Squad said it was one of his favorite episodes of the season because the humor was driven by the characters Leslie and Ron had developed into throughout the series. However, Keller said he believed Eagleton seemed too unrealistic and exaggerated as parody of rich towns. Not all reviews were positive. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called it a cartoonish and [...] "strangely uneven" [...] episode, and felt Posey's appearance was distracting and disruptive to the natural flow of the show. However, Meslow called the subplot about Ron's birthday [...] "one of the season's best" [...] and said it demonstrated the strength of the relationships between the characters.|$|E
