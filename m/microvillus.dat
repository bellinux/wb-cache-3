50|$|Hypertrophy {{of cells}} caused by protists and fungi has been {{observed}} since the late nineteenth century. Scientists observed them in several organisms, of which the infection would have varied host cell specificity, ultimately leading to different cellular consequences. For example, the dinoflagellate protist Sphaeripara catenata induces hypertrophy, polyploid nuclei formation whilst forming a thick-walled hyposome where rhizoids extend into the cytoplasm for nutrient absorption in the appendicularian Fritillaria pellucida. This can be contrasted to the Microsporidium cotti infection of the testes of Taurulus bubalis where a dense <b>microvillus</b> layer is present for improved nutrient absorption.|$|E

There are three types of OSN cells: (1) ciliated cells, <b>microvillus</b> cells, and crypt cells.

50|$|Because glucose travels {{across the}} {{placenta}} (through diffusion facilitated by GLUT1 carrier), {{which is located}} in the syncytiotrophoblast on both the <b>microvillus</b> and basal membranes, these membranes may be the rate-limiting step in placental glucose transport. There is a two- to three-fold increase in the expression of syncytiotrophoblast glucose transporters with advancing gestation. Finally, the role of GLUT3/GLUT4 transport remains speculative. If the untreated gestational diabetes fetus is exposed to consistently higher glucose levels, this leads to increased fetal levels of insulin (insulin itself cannot cross the placenta). The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a large body (macrosomia). After birth, the high glucose environment disappears, leaving these newborns with ongoing high insulin production and susceptibility to low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia).|$|E

Plasma membranes can also form different types of [...] "supramembrane" [...] structures such as caveola, postsynaptic density, podosome, invadopodium, desmosome, hemidesmosome, focal adhesion, and cell junctions.

5000|$|Podocalyxin, a sialoglycoprotein, {{is thought}} to be the major {{constituent}} of the glycocalyx of podocytes in the glomerulus (Bowman's capsule). It {{is a member of the}} CD34 family of transmembrane sialomucins. It coats the secondary foot processes of the podocytes. It is negatively charged and thus functions to keep adjacent foot processes separated, thereby keeping the urinary filtration barrier open. [...] This function is further supported by knockout studies in mice which reveal an essential role in podocyte morphogenesis and a role in the opening of vascular lumens and regulation of vascular permeability. Of note, this is the only cell surface sialomucin knockout known to display a lethal phenotype. [...] Podocalyxin is also upregulated in a number of cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis. Sialylated, O-glycosylated glycoforms of podocalyxin expressed by colon carcinoma cells possess L-selectin and E-selectin binding activity, and may be pivotal to the metastatic spread of colon carcinoma cells. At the cellular level podocalyxin has also been shown to regulate the size and topology of apical cell domains and act as a potent inducer of <b>microvillus</b> formation.|$|E
50|$|Xenomas are {{provoked}} {{in various}} types of organisms, depending on the species of the parasite. Microsporidia are known to produce xenomas in oligochaetes, insects, crustaceans and fish. In addition to organism specificity, different species of parasite will have distinct host cell specificity, even if targeting the same organism. For example, Microsporidium chaetogastris infects solely connective and muscle tissue cells of the annelid Chaetogaster diaphanus, whereas other species of microsporidia will target other tissue types. Another example is microsporidial gill disease in different species of fish caused by Loma salmonae. It was found that certain species had a higher prevalence of xenoma formation following infection with the same parasite i.e. xenomas per gill filament in chinook salmon was 8 to 33 times greater than in rainbow trout, showing differences in host cell susceptibility. Once a host cell is infected with the microsporidian (or protist) parasite, a complete restructuring of the host cell ensues. This occurs as the parasite seeks {{to take control of}} the metabolism of the cell, in order to survive and exploit the host cell's resources and reproduction. It provides the parasite with optimal growth conditions and protection from the host's immune response. The parasite proliferates within the host cell where its mass replaces most of the host cell's cytoplasm, with the rest being taken up by <b>microvillus</b> structures and rhizoids. Other structures may be present inside the infected host cell including vesicles, fat globules and bundles of fibril. The nucleus may be in varying locations including the centre of the cell and may also vary in structure i.e. lobed, branched or divided into multiple fragments, but it will always be hypertrophic. The host also commonly envelops the proliferating parasite and the host cell itself in layers of membranes and cells.|$|E
40|$|P-selectin {{glycoprotein}} ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1) binding to P-selectin mediates leukocyte rolling {{under conditions}} of flow. In human neutrophils, a type of leukocyte belonging to the innate immune system, PSGL- 1 molecules are located on the neutrophil’s surface ruffles, called microvilli. Each newly formed P-selectin—PSGL- 1 bond can become load bearing, imposing on its <b>microvillus</b> a pulling force that deforms the <b>microvillus.</b> Depending on {{the magnitude of the}} bond force, a <b>microvillus</b> can be extended, or a thin membrane cylinder (a tether) can be formed {{at the tip of the}} <b>microvillus.</b> Here we propose a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic material as an improved model for <b>microvillus</b> extension. Using a modified version of our Event-Tracking Model of Adhesion (ETMA), we demonstrate how P-selectin—PSGL- 1 load-bearing bonds shape <b>microvillus</b> deformation during neutrophil rolling at low shear (wall shear rate of 50 s− 1, P-selectin site density of 150 molecules μm− 2). We also discuss the impact of <b>microvillus</b> deformability on neutrophil rolling. We find that the average <b>microvillus</b> extension constitutes 65 % of the total microvillus-tether complex extension, and that the rolling neutrophil may never fully rest.

Using this material we characterized the alterations {{that occur in}} <b>microvillus</b> mem-brane fluidity as the rabbit enterocyte matures and correlated these with kinetic studies of glucose transport. With increasing maturity the <b>microvillus</b> membrane becomes more rigid due to both {{an increase in the}} cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and al-terations in individual phospholipid subclasses. Maximal rates of glucose transport were greatest in <b>microvillus</b> membrane vesicles prepared from mature cells.

40|$|Containing {{most of the}} L-selectin and P-selectin {{glycoprotein}} ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1) {{on their}} tips, microvilli are believed to promote the initial arrest of neutrophils on endothelium. At the rolling stage following arrest, the lifetimes of the involved molecular bonds depend on the pulling force imposed by the shear stress of blood flow. With two different methods, electron microscopy and micropipette manipulation, we have obtained two comparable neutrophil <b>microvillus</b> lengths, both ≈ 0. 3 μm in average. We have found also that, under a pulling force, a <b>microvillus</b> can be extended (<b>microvillus</b> extension) or a long thin membrane cylinder (a tether) can be formed from it (tether formation). If the force is ≤ 34 pN (± 3 pN), {{the length of the}} <b>microvillus</b> will be extended; if the force is > 61 pN (± 5 pN), a tether will be formed from the <b>microvillus</b> at a constant velocity, which depends linearly on the force. When the force is between 34 pN and 61 pN (transition zone), the degree of association between membrane and cytoskeleton in individual microvilli will dictate whether <b>microvillus</b> extension or tether formation occurs. When a <b>microvillus</b> is extended, it acts like a spring with a spring constant of ≈ 43 pN/μm.

40|$|Rat {{intestinal}} <b>microvillus</b> membranes and lipid extracts prepared {{from them}} have been studied by fluorescence polarization with three lipid-soluble fluorophores: diphenylhexatriene, retinol, and anthroyl-stearate. The degree of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, which provides an index of the "microviscosity" of the lipid regions of the membrane, is exceptionally high in <b>microvillus</b> membranes, the highest yet reported in normal biological membranes. Both the membrane proteins and lipids were found {{to contribute to the}} high values. With each of the three probes the polarization values are higher in ileal <b>microvillus</b> membranes as compared to membranes from proximal intestinal segments. Temperature-dependence studies of the fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene and anthroylstearate demonstrate a phase transition in <b>microvillus</b> membranes and in liposomes prepared from their lipid extracts at approximately 26 +/- 2 degrees C. Ambient pH influences markedly the diphenylhexatriene fluorescence polarization in <b>microvillus</b> membranes but has little effect on that of human erythrocyte ghost membranes. The "microviscosity" of jejunal <b>microvillus</b> membranes is maximal at pH 6. 5 - 7. 0 and decreases as much as 50 % at pH 3. 0, an effect which depends largely upon the membrane proteins. Addition of calcium ions to suspensions of <b>microvillus</b> membranes increases the fluorescence polarization of retinol and anthroyl-stearate, but not that of diphenyl-hexatriene. This confirms the localization of the last compound to the hydrophobic interior of the membrane, relatively distant from the hydrophilic head groups of the polar lipids. <b>Microvillus</b> membrane proteins solubilized with Triton X- 100 give relatively high fluorescence polarization and intensity values with retinol, suggesting the presence of binding proteins which could {{play a role in the}} normal absorptive mechanism for the vitamin...|$|E

Several cytoplasmic {{factors have been}} identified that control the dynamics of actin filaments in microvilli. However, it remains unclear whether the plasma membrane participates actively in <b>microvillus</b> formation. In this paper, we analyze the function of Drosophila melanogaster cadherin Cad 99 C in the microvilli of ovarian follicle cells. Cad 99 C contributes to eggshell formation and female fertility and is expressed in follicle cells, which produce the eggshells. Cad 99 C specifically localizes to apical microvilli. Loss of Cad 99 C function results in shortened and disorganized microvilli, whereas overexpression of Cad 99 C leads to a dramatic increase of <b>microvillus</b> length.

40|$|The biogenesis of {{plasmalemma}} glycoproteins of rat small-intestinal villus cells was {{studied by}} following the incorporation of l-[1, 5, 6 - 3 H]fucose, given intraperitoneally with and without chase, into Golgi, lateral basal and <b>microvillus</b> membranes. Each membrane fraction showed distinct kinetics of incorporation of labelled fucose and was differently affected by the chase, which produced a much greater decrease in incorporation of label into Golgi and <b>microvillus</b> than into lateral basal membranes. The kinetic data suggest a redistribution of newly synthesized glycoproteins {{from the site of}} fucosylation, the Golgi complex, directly into both lateral basal and <b>microvillus</b> membranes. The observed biphasic pattern of label incorporation into the <b>microvillus</b> membrane fraction may be evidence for a second indirect route of incorporation. The selective effect of the chase suggests the presence of two different pools of radioactive fucose in the Golgi complex that differ in (1) their accessibility to dilution with non-radioactive fucose, and (2) their utilization for the biosynthesis of membrane glycoproteins subsequently destined for either the <b>microvillus</b> or the lateral basal parts of the plasmalemma. The radioactively labelled glycoproteins of the different membrane fractions were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-slab-gel electrophoresis and identified by fluorography. The patterns of labelled glycoproteins in Golgi and lateral basal membranes were identical at all times. At least 14 bands could be identified shortly after radioactive-fucose injection. Most seemed to disappear at later times, although one of them, which was never observed in <b>microvillus</b> membranes, increased in relative intensity. All but two of the labelled glycoproteins present in the <b>microvillus</b> membrane corresponded to those observed in Golgi and lateral basal membranes shortly after fucose injection.

To evaluate PSGL- 1 /P-selectin bond kinetics of microbeads and neutrophils, rolling and tethering on P-selectin-coated substrates were compared in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The dissociation rates for PSGL- 1 microbeads on P-selectin were briefer than those of neutrophils for any wall shear stress, and increased more rapidly with increasing flow. The <b>microvillus</b> length necessary to reconcile dissociation constants of PSGL- 1 microbeads and neutrophils on P-selectin was 0. 21 μm at 0. 4 dyn/cm 2, and increased to 1. 58 μm at 2 dyn/cm 2.

The length, diameter, and density of microvilli as well as cell apical diameter were measured in tip-villous enterocytes by transmission electron microscopy. The results obtained showed that during development: 1) <b>microvillus</b> length remained constant in duode-num and jejunum and decreased in the other segments; 2) <b>microvillus</b> diameter increased only in the jejunum and the rectum; 3) <b>microvillus</b> density increased in duodenum, ileum, distal cecum, and rectum (especially from 1 d to 2 wk) and did not change in the other segments; 4) cell apical diameter did not change; 5) apical surface area increased both in the duodenum (2 nd to 6 th wk) and in the jejunum (1 d to 2 wk) but did not change in the ileum.
