Although we do not carry out a whole featured DBMS, the project is still too large to work for single student. Due to this reason, we will do teamwork. Each team should contain 3 or 2 students, formed by free will. Finally, some suggestions for doing well in this course project: 1.

Hydrate Before Work: 1. Being hydrated when you start work makes it easier to stay hydrated through the day. 2. If you are dehydrated when you start work, {{you may not be able}} to drink enough to catch up with your body's need for water. Hydrate During Work: 1. Drink before feeling thirsty. By the time you feel thirsty, you are already behind in fluid replacement. Dehydration is a primary contributor to heat exhaustion. Your work performance may suffer when you are dehydrated, even if you don't notice. 2. When working in the heat, drink 1 cup (8 ounces) of water every 15 - 20 minutes. 3. This translates to 2 - 1 quart (24 - 32 ounces) per hour. 4. Drinking at shorter intervals is more effective than drinking large amounts infrequently. 5. Do not drink more than 48 oz (12 quarts) per hour! Drinking too much water or other fluids (sports drinks, energy drinks, etc.) can cause a medical emergency because the concentration of salt in the blood becomes too low. Hydrate After Work: 1. Most people need several hours to drink enough fluids to replace what they have lost through sweat. The sooner you get started, the less strain you place on your body from dehydration. 2. Hydrating after work is even more important if you work in the heat on a regular basis. Chronic dehydration increases the risk for a number of medical conditions, such as kidney stones.
