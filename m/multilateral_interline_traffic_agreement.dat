50|$|In April 2013, Somon Air jointed the IATA <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Interline</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Agreement</b> (MITA). The IATA <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Interline</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Agreement</b> (MITA) is an {{agreement}} where passengers and cargo use a standard traffic document on various transportation modes {{to reach the}} final destination on a particular routing. More than 350 of international and domestic airlines worldwide participate in MITA.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, a new {{corporate}} identity and aircraft livery were rolled {{out and the}} company completed its first major cabin-crew-upgrading program. In 2002, the airline obtained new International Air Transport Association (IATA) airline designator codes and joined both the IATA <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Interline</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Agreement</b> (MITA) and IATA Clearing House. The airline sent 122 employees on training courses at Malaysia Airlines and Royal Brunei Airlines training centres. In 2003, MAI launched a code-share agreement with Thai Airways International on the Bangkok-Yangon-Bangkok route. The company also has code-sharing with Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways and Jetstar Asia Airways. In 2004, the airline took delivery of new uniforms for ground staff and recruited a further 16 new cabin-crew trainees.|$|E
50|$|Between November 1935 and July 1936 Vidal {{directed}} {{the establishment of}} the first air traffic control centers in the United States, initially negotiating an <b>interline</b> air <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> with the airlines to build and operate several until funding could be appropriated for a Federal takeover of the system, which was obtained in March 1936 for the next fiscal year. The BAC took over air control duties at the first three centers in Cleveland, Newark, and Chicago on July 6, 1936, and hired the first 15 Federal air traffic controllers.|$|R

50|$|ZED is half of {{a larger}} {{organization}} known as the ZED/MIBA Forum. The Forum {{is made up of}} over 175 member airlines {{from all parts of the}} globe, participating in the ZED and/or the MIBA (<b>Multilateral</b> <b>Interline</b> Business Agreement) programs. ZED and MIBA conditions may be applied for travel on and by other airlines, as bilaterally agreed, or by the airline's own employees traveling on its own flights.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we ask how {{antitrust}} immunity {{subject to}} a carve-out affects collusion incentives in international airline alliances. We show that the gains from economies of density due to higher <b>interline</b> <b>traffic</b> under the alliance strengthen the incentive to collude on the interhub route, while the accompanying revenue gain heightens the incentive to defect from collusive behavior. These two effects exactly cancel {{in the case of}} linear demand and linear economies of density. Under this approximation, the incentives for interhub collusion are no different before and after the formation of an airline alliance {{subject to a}} carve-out...|$|R

50|$|Since 16 March 2015, the Russia-Ukraine local border <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> was {{unilaterally}} terminated by Ukraine citing national security. As a result, over 100 local {{border crossing}} points were closed.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, the Buffalo and Susquehanna {{was listed}} as having <b>traffic</b> <b>Agreements</b> with the Pennsylvania Railroad at Driftwood, Sinnemahoning, and Keating Summit. They also interchanged freight with the Erie Railroad at Addison and Wellsville. They also had a {{connection}} with the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad at Ansonia. What is surprising about this list {{is the fact that}} the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway is missing. The Buffalo and Susquehanna had a lease agreement with the BR&P to run B&S trains on their tracks for 21 mi, from Sykesville to Juneu, to access the B&S mines at Sagamore, for 20 years. Its odd that there was no <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> listed for them to interchange cars in that area. In 1917, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad dropped their <b>traffic</b> <b>agreements</b> with the Buffalo, Attica and Arcade Railroad, as well as the Pittsburg, Shawmut and Northern, since they no longer had a connection via the Wellsville and Buffalo Railway.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} timetable {{on the two}} Kinross lines {{worked in}} harmony, with trains making good connections at Kinross. There was a <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> between the two railways determining which route traffic originating or terminating on the line should take; this occasionally led to some counter-intuitive routings.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to such competition the L&NWR, which surprised {{by the success of}} the MB&MR's proposal, quickly came to an amicable <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> with the NSR. This deal negated the original purpose and urgency of the line because the NSR now no longer needed an independent route to Manchester as it could use L&NWR lines.|$|R
50|$|The L&DR {{generated}} considerable {{business from}} the many heavy industrial sites along the Clyde; the company provided sidings connections from its main line free of charge. However the very large Singer factory provided no goods traffic during the L&DR period: the North British Railway already served it, and concluded a long term exclusive <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> with it before completion of the L&DR line.|$|R
50|$|On 8 August 1878 the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway was incorporated. It {{was heavily}} {{sponsored}} by the Alexandra (Newport) Dock Company, which wished to bring the coal resources of the Rhondda and Cynon (Aberdare) valleys to Newport Docks. <b>Traffic</b> <b>agreements</b> were secured with the Taff Vale Railway to achieve the connection, {{as well as with}} the B&MR and the Rhymney Railway.|$|R

In 1960, {{local border traffic}} on the Yugoslavia — Italy border in Istria registered almost seven million crossings in both directions.

50|$|The European Cockpit Association (ECA) is an {{organization}} that represents European pilots. Founded in 1991, it works to improve European policies {{in all areas of}} aviation that affect pilots, such as safety, pilot licensing, air operations, fair competition, international air <b>traffic</b> <b>agreements,</b> air <b>traffic</b> management and employment conditions. ECA currently represents over 38,000 European pilots from 37 European associations and has its headquarters in the City of Brussels.|$|R
50|$|A further serious {{strategic}} {{mistake was}} {{the refusal of}} the SER to accept {{the terms of the}} contract for the cross-channel carriage of mails in 1862, as this stipulated the use of Dover rather than Folkestone. This enabled the London Chatham and Dover Railway which had only reached Dover in 1861 to secure the contract and the following year would give it leverage when it came to negotiating the Continental <b>Traffic</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed {{their first}} human rights {{convention}} in November 2012 and {{committed itself to}} a <b>trafficking</b> <b>agreement</b> in 2014. Original ASEAN member countries formed in 1967 included Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand. It has expanded to include Bruenei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam since then along with adding the ASEAN Plus Three of China, Japan, and Korea. These countries are dedicated to the fight against trafficking of people.|$|R
50|$|Rivalry {{among the}} {{independent}} companies, Bell and even between themselves was intense, often resulting in agitation for government {{ownership of the}} telephone business. While a 1905 parliamentary committee failed to produce any recommendations, the ensuing publicity did change Bell’s attitude to some degree. Instead of a reluctance {{to connect with the}} independents, Bell began encouraging and completing toll <b>traffic</b> <b>agreements</b> with them. In 1910 the Telephone Act brought all independent systems under regulation of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board.|$|R
40|$|This article {{sets out}} to analyse {{the role of the}} Kaliningrad region in the Polish foreign policy after 1989. The {{analysis}} focuses on the political and regional determinants, which had the greatest impact on the Poland-Kaliningrad region relations. The methodology used in the article is not unusual for political science and is based on analysing original (documents) and secondary (scholarly publications, press articles) sources. The authors also use the system and decision analysis methods. The analysis covers the period after 1989, when the geopolitical changes brought about by the collapse of the Yalta-Potsdam order resulted in Poland redefine the priorities of its foreign policy. One of the most important challenges for the Polish diplomacy after 1989 was the development of economic and political relations with the Russian Federation. Cross-border cooperation between Poland and the Kaliningrad Region is conducted, inter alia, through euroregional structures functioning in the border areas. The analysis of this issue is vital for further cooperation in the Polish-Russian borderland, especially after the conclusion of the local border <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> in 2012. The authors come to a conclusion that the implementation of the local border <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> can improve cross-border relations but it will not significantly change the role of the Kaliningrad region in the Polish foreign policy. ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{constituted}} a major competitive disadvantage BCal faced at Gatwick {{compared with other}} airlines that were based at Heathrow. It was further {{compounded by the fact}} that Gatwick had few connecting flights during the 1970s and early 1980s, as a result of the regulatory regime as well as the bilateral air services agreements the UK Government had negotiated with its overseas counterparts. (The former necessitated going through a costly and time-consuming process to gain a licence to operate a scheduled service. This involved lengthy hearings the CAA conducted for each route application where BA and other independent airlines, which felt the Government's policy of making BCal its [...] "chosen instrument" [...] of the private sector discriminated against them, objected to BCal's application and — in cases where there were several rival applications — against each other as well. The latter often had no scope for designating a second British scheduled airline in addition to the incumbent carrier. This meant that even in those cases where BCal had succeeded in securing licences to operate scheduled services on routes of its choice, it was prevented from using these licences if it involved an international service where there was no scope in the relevant bilateral agreement for the UK Government to designate it as the second UK flag carrier.) At the same time, Heathrow was the most important point in the world for <b>interline</b> <b>traffic</b> with more passengers changing flights there than at any other airport.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of traffickers in illegal migration. Traffickers finance liquidity-constrained migrants. Migrants enter {{temporary}} servitude {{to pay back the}} debt. When it becomes easier to transit from the illegal to the legal sector of the host country, more migrants default on their debt (in the legal sector, <b>trafficking</b> <b>agreements</b> are harder to enforce). Then, to finance migration becomes unprofitable for traffickers. Regularization campaigns, amnesties, more lenient deportation policies thus decrease rather then increase the flow of illegal migrants. We also show that they improve skill composition of immi-grants...|$|R

50|$|The desperate {{competition}} for business, and duplication of steamer sailings, continued for some time, until in March 1871 a <b>traffic</b> pooling <b>agreement</b> was reached: the CR would receive 57.67% of traffic income.|$|R

25|$|In 1873, the Richmond, York River and Chesapeake Railroad and the Richmond and Danville Railroad built a {{connecting}} line between their termini in Richmond. On April 8, 1875, the two railroads and the steamboat company {{entered into a}} <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> under which the rail and water lines {{became part of the}} Piedmont Air-Line for through business to and from the Southern United States. This agreement introduced the Clyde interests into the business of the Richmond and Danville Railroad.

50|$|Comprised {{within the}} Border Union Railway Act were powers {{allowing}} the NBR {{to cross the}} Caledonian Railway's main line and join the Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway at Rattlingate, {{as well as the}} granting of facilities at Carlisle Citadel railway station. The NBR would take a 999-year lease of the Silloth line from 1 August 1862. This brought two advantages: firstly, the NBR had access to Carlisle and Silloth harbour with access to Ireland and Liverpool and, secondly, it allowed freight to be sent by sea without having to work through Carlisle and thus not be subject to the Anglo-Scottish <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> which set the rates for goods workings via Carlisle.|$|R

50|$|On 30 December 2015, the {{administrative}} court in Braunschweig ruled {{in favour of}} the German civil aviation authority (the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt) and against Air Berlin regarding some of their codeshare operations with Etihad Airways.

One of the routes which is no longer allowed to use an Etihad codeshare is Air Berlin's service from Stuttgart to Abu Dhabi. The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt had only allowed these flights until a definite legal ruling was made.|$|R
500|$|The Aire and Calder {{tried to}} work with the {{railways}} when they arrived in the 1840s, by making <b>traffic</b> <b>agreements,</b> but still suffered a significant drop in trade. Receipts dropped by one-third between 1851 and 1856. Thomas Hammond Bartholomew, the chief engineer, had been experimenting with steam power since 1813, and steam paddle tugs had been operating on the system since 1831. When he died in late 1852, two-thirds of the traffic was pulled by steam tugs. His son, William Hammond Bartholomew, replaced him and introduced tugs with propellers soon afterwards. These could tow ten keels, carrying 700 tons, but were held up at locks, as the keels had to be worked through one at a time.

5000|$|British Caledonian, British Airways Helicopters and the British Airports Authority (the {{operator}} of both airports) began discussing a new service in mid-1977. Their rationale {{was that a}} quick, high-frequency shuttle would [...] "effectively link the two airports' flight networks" [...] and allow Gatwick and Heathrow [...] "to operate in tandem". [...] In 1978, they formed a joint venture company called London Airways to operate a new shuttle service using a Sikorsky S-61N helicopter. [...] This was owned by BAA, who [...] "saw link as another sweetener for airlines banished to Gatwick". (Moving to Gatwick was generally unpopular with Heathrow-based airlines because it was less convenient for passengers making connections.) [...] British Airways Helicopters (a subsidiary of British Caledonian's larger rival British Airways) could not provide one because all of its aircraft were already in use on services to North Sea oil rigs and the Isles of Scilly. [...] British Caledonian itself was responsible for marketing, ground crew and the single member of cabin crew. [...] Initially, British Airways Helicopters provided the pilots and engineering services; but they later withdrew from the joint venture and were replaced by British Caledonian Helicopters, who provided the same things. [...] The helicopter could accommodate up to 28 passengers, and the company set a target of 64,000 passengers per year. It claimed a potential annual benefit of £10 million to the British economy, {{on the assumption that}} each interlining passenger would be transferring to another British carrier and would be generating £150 profit. [...] These arguments—along with claims that international <b>interlining</b> <b>traffic</b> would be won from rival European airports such as Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol; that the British government's transport and economic policies treated Gatwick and Heathrow as a single entity; and the flight planners' demonstration that the route chosen for Airlink would have [...] "the least possible impact" [...] on residential areas below the flightpath—helped to convince the Civil Aviation Authority to allow the service to start.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1899, the Joy Line {{initially}} {{competed with}} the New Haven Railroad for transport between New York City and the ports of New England. By 1902, the New Haven had pressured other steamship lines not to lease their ships to the Joy (for example, by offering free annual passes along their rail to captains refusing Joy offers) {{and offered to}} carry American Sugar for almost nothing rather than allow the Joy to benefit from its traffic. In consequence, the Joy was forced to a <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement,</b> raising its rates to equivalence with the railroad's and limiting itself to local trade between New York and Providence, Rhode Island. The entrance of the Enterprise Line along the same route led the New Haven to purchase the Joy Line in December, 1905. The competition featured in the antitrust case against the New Haven in 1915.|$|R

5000|$|In July 1981, Aeroperú was {{gradually}} privatized, with the Peruvian government keeping a minority share of 20 percent. In 1982, plans {{were made for}} a merger with Faucett Perú, the other large passenger airline {{in the country at}} that time. As a preparatory measure, redundancies in the route networks of the two airlines were removed, so that Aeroperú had to suspend flights to a number of destinations, including Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, New York City and Los Angeles. No further steps were taken towards merging the two airlines, and so in 1983 flights to several destinations recommenced. [...] A bilateral air <b>traffic</b> <b>agreement</b> between Peru and the United States expired on 11 November 1983. Because of disagreements over the granting of fifth freedom rights, all flights between the two countries were suspended in May 1984 until mid-1985, which affected Aeroperú's Lima-Miami route.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR {{was now in}} {{possession}} of a shorter and more efficient route to Portsmouth.
