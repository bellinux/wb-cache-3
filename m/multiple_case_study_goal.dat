40|$|Recently, {{offshoring}} {{of information}} systems (IS) services to external vendors has seen considerable growth. Outsourcing to vendors in foreign countries brings about unique challenges which need to be understood and managed effectively. This paper explores cultural differences in IS offshoring arrangements involving German client organizations that outsource application development activities to Indian vendors. For this purpose, a research framework is developed based on both theoretical considerations and specific empirical observations from <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> The <b>goal</b> is to (1) explore the nature of cultural differences in offshoring arrangements in depth and to (2) analyze the relationship between those cultural differences and offshoring success. Based on the case findings, implications and practices {{for the management of}} offshore development projects are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{widespread}} use of quality improvement collaboratives (QICs), evidence underlying this method is limited. A QIC is a method for testing and implementing evidence-based changes quickly across organisations. To extend the knowledge about conditions under which QICs can be used, we explored in this study the applicability of the QIC method for process redesign. Methods We evaluated a Dutch process redesign collaborative of seventeen project teams using a <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> design. The <b>goals</b> of this collaborative were to reduce the time between the first visit to the outpatient's clinic and the start of treatment and to reduce the in-hospital length of stay by 30 % for involved patient groups. Data were gathered using qualitative methods, such as document analysis, questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and participation in collaborative meetings. Results Application of the QIC method to process redesign proved to be difficult. First, project teams did not use the provided standard change ideas, because of their need for customised solutions that fitted with context-specific causes of waiting times and delays. Second, project teams were not capable of testing change ideas within short time frames due to: the need for tailoring changes ideas and the complexity of aligning interests of involved departments; small volumes of involved patient groups; and inadequate information and communication technology (ICT) support. Third, project teams did not experience peer stimulus because they saw few similarities between their projects, rarely shared experiences, and did not demonstrate competitive behaviour. Besides, a number of project teams reported that organisational and external change agent support was limited. Conclusions This study showed that the perceived need for tailoring standard change ideas to local contexts and the complexity of aligning interests of involved departments hampered the use of the QIC method for process redesign. We cannot determine whether the QIC method would have been appropriate for process redesign. Peer stimulus was non-optimal {{as a result of the}} selection process for participation of project teams by the external change agent. In conclusion, project teams felt that necessary preconditions for successful use of the QIC method were lacking. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} some work on <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> are presented. Material {{for the paper}} {{have been found in}} books and the {{literature}}. Although, the literature offers much material on <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research there is not much to find on <b>multiple</b> <b>cases</b> <b>studies</b> as such.

40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>study</b> {{research}} by definition {{is well suited}} {{to the study of}} IS implementation, especially when context is important. Furthermore, its products are highly relevant and therefore they appeal to IS practitioners, an audience for which the IS literature has been critiqued of ignoring. While the value of single case research is methodologically viable in the <b>study</b> of critical <b>cases,</b> the <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> approach is believed to be more appropriate to the <b>study</b> of typical <b>cases</b> of IS implementations. However, the IS literature provides little guidance on strategies for <b>case</b> <b>study</b> selection, particularly for <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> More important, is the need to provide the rational for case selection that relates these suggested strategies to the particular objectives of the case research inquiry. The {{purpose of this study is}} to fill this gap by providing a review of strategies for single and <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> selection in the context of systems implementation.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{and suggests}} a methodological approach to capture processes in <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> While single <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> may address processes in an inductive or abductive manner, <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> entail a stronger need for analytical frameworks and methodological tools developed ex ante {{in order to}} maintain focus on the same phenomena across cases and over time. This is, however, difficult to pursue in studies that focus on processes. The aim of the paper is to suggest an approach to longitudinal <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> We use an example of an on-going <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> aiming at capturing the processes of strategizing in terms of how the networking of start-up companies interplays with their ideas of future network positions. The paper concludes by suggesting the use of a combination of narratives and network drawings. Network drawings can be instrumental in capturing the past, the present and the future at different points in time for the individual cases. Based on these descriptions, change patterns and how these evolve can be analyzed and compared across cases and over time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Without careful methodological guidance, <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> in {{software}} engineering {{are difficult to}} plan, design and execute. While {{there are a number}} of broad guidelines for <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research, there are none that specifically address the needs of a software engineer undertaking <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> in an industrial setting. Through a synthesis of existing best practices in <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research, we provide a set of comprehensive guidelines for conducting <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> {{in software}} engineering research. Our guidelines can assist software engineering researchers with all stages of <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research, although in this paper we concentrate on the early phases, such as focusing the <b>case</b> <b>study</b> and detailed plan design.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the contribution of qualitative methods and techniques in extending the understanding of relationship marketing theory. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigated six Australian sporting organisations using multiple data collection methods including semi-structured interviews with several senior executives within each organisation, secondary and historical data sources and participant observation. The application of triangulation and <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> is discussed in relation to their contribution toward a greater understanding of relationship marketing practice in the professional sport industry, as well as the barriers to the adoption of this strategy. Findings - Using triangulation and a <b>multiple</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> approach provided a richness of information which, upon analysis within and across cases, revealed a number of commonalities and some limited diversity. Using this approach maximised the depth of information and increased the transferability of the findings to allow for the development of a conceptual model, which advances relationship-marketing theory.
