40|$|Improving engine {{warm up time}} is {{of great}} {{interest}} because cold start engines suffer from increased fuel consumption. This study comprises of two phases: the first looking at global benefits from a novel engine cooling system incorporating coolant flow control valves and dual EGR setup. The new cooling system showed promising signs of influencing energy flows during warm up, however only limited analysis was possible. The second phase used an instrumented engine to show new ways of quantifying performance enhancements through combustion chamber heat transfer, local bearing oil film temperatures and bearing heat transfer. 1 dimensional heat transfer analysis demonstrated the significant energy required to warm up the engine structure and 25 - 50 kJ heat loss per <b>main</b> <b>crank</b> shaft bearing...|$|E
50|$|The New York Central had two L-1 {{locomotives}} rebuilt by Alco in 1922 {{with three}} cylinders {{to help determine}} if three-cylinder drive was worthwhile.

The NYC must have come down on the negative side of that question, for no more were built.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the urgent}} {{problems}} {{in mechanical engineering}} is development of efficient inexpensive thick-layered coatings for repair worn-out large-sized parts. To solve these problems a comparatively new method of electro-plating with simultaneous mechanical impact of a tool upon coating under formation is promising enough. In this paper there are considered the peculiarities of plating through this method of thick-layer electro-mechanical iron plating on medium carbon steel 30 and 38 ChN 3 MA, and the composition, structure and properties of coatings obtained are analyzed. Coatings were applied upon <b>crank</b> <b>main</b> journals made of steel 38 ChN 3 MA and upon models imitating <b>crank</b> <b>main</b> journals made of steel 30. Micro-hardness of the coating obtained, roughness, a chemical composition and a structure were analyzed. The results of the investigations have shown that a more significant role in hardness increase is played not by a chemical composition of medium carbon steel upon which it is applied, but a preparation of the surface and the technology of coating and also an electrolyte composition. The structure of electro-mechanical plating is less defective, contains a value of detrimental impurities considerably lower of allowable values and has a satisfactory adhesion strength with a substrate...|$|R
5000|$|The A-Series {{design was}} {{licensed}} by Nissan of Japan, {{along with other}} Austin designs. Improvements were rapid. Early change was to a fit 5 <b>main</b> bearing <b>crank.</b> Head was modified for first E series by swapping plugs and ports, plugs fitted between pushrods and 8 ports eliminated the Siamesed inlet and exhaust ports. Nissan modified the design into the later Nissan A engine that was launched in 1966 with an aluminium head and wedge combustion chambers. It {{became the basis for}} many of their following engines notably the later OHC Nissan E engine, was scaled up into Nissan CA engine and ultimately the DOHC 170bhp CA18DET. All these engines show their lineage by the characteristic un-skirted crankcase block of the BMC A series, the A and E also having the bulge in the sump joint face for the oil pump drive. (Nissan engines with deep crankcase skirts are derived from the Mercedes OHC inline 6 that Nissan also licensed in the 1950's.) ...|$|R
40|$|Three Mercury Marine {{outboard}} marine engines {{were evaluated}} for durability using E 15 fuel [...] gasoline blended with 15 % ethanol. Direct comparison {{was made to}} operation on E 0 (ethanol-free gasoline) {{to determine the effects}} of increased ethanol on engine durability. Testing was conducted using a 300 -hour wide-open throttle (WOT) test protocol, a typical durability cycle used by the outboard marine industry. Use of E 15 resulted in reduced CO emissions, as expected for open-loop, non-feedback control engines. HC emissions effects were variable. Exhaust gas and engine operating temperatures increased as a consequence of leaner operation. Each E 15 test engine exhibited some deterioration that may have been related to the test fuel. The 9. 9 HP, four-stroke E 15 engine exhibited variable hydrocarbon emissions at 300 hours [...] an indication of lean misfire. The 300 HP, four-stroke, supercharged Verado engine and the 200 HP, two-stroke legacy engine tested with E 15 fuel failed to complete the durability test. The Verado engine failed three exhaust valves at 285 endurance hours while the 200 HP legacy engine failed a <b>main</b> <b>crank</b> bearing at 256 endurance hours. All E 0 -dedicated engines completed the durability cycle without incident. Additional testing is necessary to link the observed engine failures to ethanol in the test fuel...|$|E
2500|$|The plywood covered {{centre section}} of the low wing {{was part of the}} {{monocoque}} fuselage and the two spar outer panels were ply covered back to the rear spar. [...] The fuselage was a rounded monocoque with the engine in a streamlined nose, its cylinders exposed for cooling. Its single seat cockpit was set back towards the wing trailing edge. The G-8 had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage with its <b>main</b> wheels on <b>cranked</b> V-strut axles hinged to the centre of the fuselage underside. [...] Each wheel had a faired vertical shock absorber leg to the outer part of the centre section.|$|R
50|$|When {{describing}} a crankshaft design, {{the number of}} main bearings is generally quoted, {{as the number of}} crank pins is determined by the engine configuration. For example, a crankshaft for an inline six engine will be described as three bearing or four bearing depending on its number of <b>main</b> bearings; The <b>crank</b> pins are not counted in this description. Similarly, when speaking of a crankshaft, the journals are the main bearing journals only. The crank pins are not normally called journals although they form the centre shafts of the big end bearings and are therefore journals in the more general sense.|$|R
5|$|Banagher has two bow-fronted Georgian {{buildings}} {{dating from}} the mid-to-late 18th century and both are listed as protected structures. One is a detached seven-bay, two-storey building, called Crank House, due to its location {{on the corner of}} <b>Main</b> Street and <b>Crank</b> Road. It was restored in the early 1990s by the Offaly West Enterprise Co-operative Society and opened in 1992. It now houses an exhibition hall, tourist office, retail and enterprise units and a hostel. It was formerly used as the headquarters for Crann, an NGO dedicated to planting native trees and protecting Ireland's woodlands. It is now used by the West Offaly Partnership as a Community Enterprise Centre.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the <b>crank's</b> <b>main</b> bearing journals, whereas many others form only one half, with a bearing cap forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|R
2500|$|Oldsmobile also {{introduced}} a 5.7L (350 cu-in, V8) diesel engine option on its Custom Cruiser, Delta 88 and 98 models in 1978 {{and a smaller}} 4.3L (260 cu-in, V8) displacement diesel on the 1979 Cutlass Salon and Cutlass Supreme/Cutlass Calais models. These were largely based on their gasoline engines but with heavier duty cast blocks, re-designed heads, fast glow plugs, and on the 5.7L, oversized <b>cranks,</b> <b>main</b> bearings, and wrist pins. There were several problems with these engines, including water and corrosion in the injectors (no water separator in the fuel line), paraffin clogging of fuel lines and filters in cold weather, reduced lubrication in the heads due to undersized oil galleys, head bolt failures, {{and the use of}} aluminum rockers and stanchions in the 4.3L V8 engines. While the 5.7L was also offered on various Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Pontiac models, it was eventually discontinued by all divisions in 1985. [...] 4.3L V6 diesels were also offered between 1982 and 1985.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} of the cabin is a tapered section of simple {{semi-monocoque}} construction, which is closed by a robust hinged rear loading ramp, which serves as the main entrance for bulky loads or equipment. The loading ramp is jettisonable in emergency situations. Additionally, there is a sliding door located on the forward starboard side, while a small hinged emergency door is set on the aft port side. The tail boom uses conventional semi-monocoque construction, supported by closely spaced notched channel-section frames and continuous stringers, absent of any major longitudinal sections or longerons. The cranked section carrying the tail rotor and trim plane is more robust, strengthened by a solid-web spar, frames, and stiffeners. The juncture of the <b>main</b> boom and <b>cranked</b> section is hinged {{in order to reduce the}} rotorcraft's folded length to 58ft. Along the top of the boom, the shaft for the tail rotor is covered by a fairing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Successful {{education}} of marine engineering students could {{be provided with}} combination of theoretical classes, training on simulators and real training onboard training vessels. The most effective practical training is correction of chance failures after they occur within the real engine room. This paper is dealing with technological model for detection and correction of the main engine chance failures from the training vessel Nase More. Methods for measuring cylinder liners, pistons, crankshafts, <b>main</b> bearings and <b>crank</b> bearings are described together with forms for registration and analysis of all measured data. The {{second part of the}} paper is presenting results from the main engine tests that are proving right maintenance actions after measuring relevant parameters and diagnosing present working conditions of the main engine. Presented model is uniting theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom and practical training for the students, provided on the training vessel. Index Terms Technological model, engine failures, maintenance action, engine testbed. TECHNOLOGICAL MODEL FOR FAILURE DETECTION AND CORRECTION Since one of the purposes of the school ship “Nase More ” is education and training of marine engineering students it is necessary to develop models for defectation and maintenance of all machinery and ship systems. Out of such models, students can find out what are the steps to be taken in detecting and correcting failures, as well as actively contribute in maintenance process. General repair of the main engine was the time to establish the first model and use it in active trainin...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of a novel crank system on laboratory time-trial cycling performance. The Rotor system makes each pedal independent from the other so that the cranks are no longer fixed at 180 °. Twelve male competitive but non-elite cyclists (mean ± s: 35 ± 7 yr, Wmax = 363 ± 38 W, VO 2 peak = 4. 5 ± 0. 3 L·min- 1) completed 6 -weeks of their normal training using either a conventional (CON) or the novel Rotor (ROT) pedal system. All participants then completed two 40. 23 -km time-trials on an air-braked ergometer, one using CON and one using ROT. Mean performance speeds were not different between trials (CON = 41. 7 km·h- 1 vs. ROT = 41. 6 km·h- 1, P > 0. 05). Indeed, the pedal system used during the time-trials had no impact on any of the measured variables (power output, cadence, heart rate, VO 2, RER, gross efficiency). Furthermore, the ANOVA identified no significant interaction effect between <b>main</b> effects (Time-trial <b>crank</b> system*Training crank system, P > 0. 05). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of the Rotor system on endurance performance rather than endurance capacity. These results suggest that the Rotor system has no measurable impact on time-trial performance. However, further studies should examine the importance of the Rotor 'regulation point' and the suggestion that the Rotor system has acute ergogenic effects if used infrequentl...|$|R
50|$|Replacing the {{previous}} Buick Skylark was the Buick Skylark 350, {{available as a}} two-door hardtop coupe or four-door sedan with the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment. This 350-cubic-inch engine was a different design than the Chevy's 350 CID engine (4.000 in × 3.48 in) the Buick design had a longer stroke and smaller bore (3.80 X 3.85 in) allowing for lower-end torque, deep-skirt block construction, higher nickel-content cast iron, 3.0 in <b>crank</b> <b>main</b> journals, and 6.5 in connecting rods, the distributor was located {{in front of the}} engine (typical of Buick), the oil pump was external and mounted {{in the front of the}} engine, the rocker arm assembly had all rocker arms mounted on a single rod and were not adjustable. The Skylark Custom continued to be available, also using the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and still available as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and four-door sedan. Buick Gran Sport models continued to be available as a separate series. The Buick Sport Wagon name was now used on a conventional four-door station wagon that no longer featured a raised roof with glass panels over the cargo area, or a longer wheelbase, as in the past. It now used the same 116 in wheelbase as the Buick Skylark four-door sedan and the now-discontinued Buick Special four-door Station Wagon. It became, in effect, a Buick Skylark four-door station wagon in all respects but the name..|$|R
