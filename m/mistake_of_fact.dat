40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} {{to hold that}} faultless <b>{{mistakes}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> justify [...] or, at least, excuse [...] an agent's actions. Less prominent, however, is the view that faultless mistakes about morality similarly come to bear on our attributions of moral blameworthiness. My aim in this dissertation is to defend what I call the symmetry thesis: faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> morality excuse just as do faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Opposition to this thesis, I think, falls out of an incorrect understanding {{of the way in}} which faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> come to bear on our attributions of moral responsibility. Accordingly, much of the dissertation is composed of an analysis of the excusing force <b>of</b> faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Chapter 1 argues that faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> are appropriately deemed excused, not justified, by morality and the law. Chapter 2 develops a challenge to what I call the traditional analysis of the excusing force <b>of</b> <b>mistakes.</b> This view holds that an agent's faultless mistake is excusing if, and only if, the mistake undermines, displaces, or, as they say in the criminal law, "negatives" the agent's subjective culpability. I suggest that concerns about voluntariness, not subjective culpability, are in order. Chapter 3 develops an account of voluntariness. I argue that an agent's actions are voluntary enough for an attribution of responsibility only if he did what he is accused of doing because this is something he was willing to do (in the fashion in which it was done) [...] only if, that is, what he did conforms to his will. Chapter 4 then applies this account of the excusing force <b>of</b> faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> to cases <b>of</b> faultless <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> morality. I conclude that an agent is morally blameworthy for his actions only if he believes that what he is doing is wrong, it is true that what he is doing is wrong, and his reasons for so believing properly identify the features of his actions that make them wrong...|$|R

Grievous bodily harm includes serious psychological trauma and serious infection; however, these are less controversial here because of the inclusion of intent. Intent narrows the crime considerably, and the term [...] "inflict" [...] is not used. In form (3), intent can be simply decided in the case of a direct attack, or [...] "virtual certainty", with knowledge of the virtual certainty [...] the Woollin principle. In form (1), where an injury does not amount to grievous bodily harm, intent to cause grievous bodily harm (in the advancement of a different cause) must be shown. Practically, the [...] "virtual certainty" [...] clause cannot come into force, since grievous bodily harm was not actually caused, by definition. In forms (2) and (4), the concept of [...] "malice" [...] has a role to play that it does not in (1) and (3). The defendant must foresee the risk of wounding or grievous bodily harm, where the core intent is to resist arrest. The defendant cannot be reckless to the resisting of arrest, it must be an intention. Concerning the requirement to resist a lawful arrest, the defendant only lacks the required mens rea if he believes in facts which, if true, would make the arrest unlawful; not just that he believes the facts as they are make the arrest illegal [...] a <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> suffices, a mistake of law does not.|$|E

40|$|Whether we {{understand}} it descriptively or normatively, the slogan that ignorance {{of the law is}} no excuse is false. Our legal system sometimes excuses those who are ignorant of the law on those grounds and should. Still, the slogan contains a grain <b>of</b> truth; <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> law excuse less readily than <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> and ought to. This paper explains the asymmetry by identifying a principle of excuse of the form "If defendant D has a false belief that p and _____, then D is excused ", which has the following feature: it is true frequently when p is a non-legal proposition, but it is false often when p is a proposition about the law. Under this principle <b>of</b> excuse, <b>mistakes</b> excuse by showing the agent to have acceptable commitments for recognizing, weighing, and responding to reasons. Many <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> show this; they show that the agent's deliberation led to objectionable action because of faulty inputs and not to fault in the deliberation itself. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>of</b> law, by contrast, frequently indicate that the agent has faulty commitments when it comes to legal reasons; they therefore do not provide excuse under the proposed principle of excuse. It is argued that this explanation of the asymmetry between <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and law takes us a great distance towards explaining the relevance of mental state to responsibility, an issue of great importance to moral philosophy...|$|R

2500|$|The {{relative}} {{social value}} given to an interest which the defendant seeks to further {{can affect the}} nature and extent of a privilege. Occasionally, the defendant may act at his peril if he makes a <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> or law; at other times, an actor is justified in acting on the basis of what the facts reasonably appear to be. At other times, the defendant is justified so long as he was acting in good faith. Or, the privilege may be regarded as absolute in the sense that the court will not permit an inquiry into motive or purpose, since this could result in subjecting the honest person to harassing litigation and claims. When no inquiry is permitted into motive or purpose, it is sometimes said that defendant has an absolute privilege; when the defendant can act in either good or bad faith, with impunity, it is more properly called [...] "immunity" [...] rather than [...] "privilege".|$|E
2500|$|Walker {{was also}} a cattle breeder and was party to a famous {{contracts}} case, Sherwood v. Walker, known as [...] "The Pregnant-Cow Case". (33 N.W. 919 (Mich. 1887).) According to the majority opinion, Walker agreed with Theodore Sherwood, a banker, to sell him a cow of distinguished ancestry known as [...] "Rose 2d of Aberlone". The price was $80, both parties believing Rose to be sterile. When Walker discovered {{that she was pregnant}} and worth between $750 and $1,000, he refused to deliver her. Sherwood sued and prevailed in the trial court, but lost on appeal. This case illustrates the contract law rules of rescission of contract by mutual mistake. Because both parties believed they were contracting for a sterile cow, there was a mutual <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> and therefore ground for rescission. [...] However, the dissent in the case, written by Justice Sherwood, notes that Sherwood believed that Rose [...] "might be made to breed" [...] and purchased her on that chance.|$|E
40|$|Impossible {{attempts}} are {{situations in}} which an actor fails to consummate a substantive crime because he is mistaken about attendant circumstances. Professor Robbins divides mistakes regarding circumstances into three categories: <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> law, and <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> mixed <b>fact</b> and law. Courts and commentators disagree primarily over the identification and treatment <b>of</b> mixed <b>fact</b> law cases. Professor Robbins surveys each category <b>of</b> <b>mistake.</b> He then examines the objective, subjective, and hybrid approaches {{to dealing with the}} mixed fact/law category. The objective approach requires an objective manifestation of the actor 2 ̆ 7 s intent before conviction is allowed. The subjective approach permits convictions based on intent alone. Under the hybrid approach, the individual 2 ̆ 7 s acts must independently evince an intent to commit a specific crime before conviction is allowed. Professor Robbins concludes that the hybrid approach strikes the optimal balance between crime prevention and freedom from unwarranted interference by law- enforcement authorities. Noting the growing acceptance of the hybrid approach, he proposes a model criminal-attempt statute that codifies it. The exploits of Lady Eldon, Mr. Fact and Mr. Law, the murderous Haitian voodoo doctor, the soldier who shot an enemy mistakenly believing that he was his sergeant, the individual who shot a tree stump mistakenly believing that it was his enemy, and the larcenous professor who mistakenly 2 ̆ 2 stole 2 ̆ 2 his own umbrella 6 have long baffled courts and commentators...|$|R

60|$|Your {{despatch}} of Tuesday morning induces me to {{hope your}} army is having some rest. In this hope {{allow me to}} reason with you a moment. When you ask for 50,000 men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces made last spring {{for the defense of}} WASHINGTON, and advising a return to that plan. I find it included in and about WASHINGTON 75,000 men. Now, please be assured I have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15,000. All of Fremont's in the valley, all of Banks's, all of McDowell's not with you, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not exceed, if they reach, 60,000. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, outside of your army, 75,000 men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you 50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply absurd. If, in your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that I blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of such impression. I only beg that in like manner you will not ask impossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take Richmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the army, material and personal, and I will strengthen it for the offensive again as fast as I can. The governors of eighteen States offer me a new levy of 300,000, which I accept.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the third}} {{resolution}} the meeting indicate their opinion that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually exists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where rebellion or insurrection does not actually exist. They insist that such arrests {{shall not be}} made [...] "outside of the lines of necessary military occupation and the scenes of insurrection." [...] Inasmuch, however, as the Constitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable {{to believe that there}} is any such constitutional distinction. I concede that the class of arrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require them; and I insist that in such cases--they are constitutional wherever the public safety does require them, as well in places to which they may prevent the rebellion extending, as in those where it may be already prevailing; as well where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and supplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may actually be; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally constitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety as against the dangers of rebellion or invasion. Take the particular case mentioned by the meeting. It is asserted in substance that Mr. Vallandigham was, by a military commander, seized and tried [...] "for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course of the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of the general." [...] Now, if there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the truth, and the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the arrest, then I concede that the arrest was wrong. But the arrest, as I understand, was made for a very different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the war {{on the part of the}} Union; and his arrest was made because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army, upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends. He was warring upon the military, and thus gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging the military power of the country, then his arrest was made on <b>mistake</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> which I would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence.|$|E
