40|$|In this paper, a novel unequal {{broadband}} out-of-phase {{power divider}} (PD) is presented. Double-sided parallel-strip lines (DSPSLs) are employed {{to achieve an}} out-of-phase response. Also, an asymmetric dual-band matching structure with two external isolation resistors is utilized to obtain arbitrary unequal power division, in which the resistors are directly grounded for heat sinking. A through ground via (TGV), connecting {{the top and bottom}} sides of the DSPSLs, is used to short the isolation components. Additionally, this property can efficiently improve the broadband matching and isolation bandwidths. To investigate the proposed divider in detail, a set of design equations are derived based on the circuit theory and transmission line theory. The theoretical analysis shows that broadband responses can be obtained as proper frequency ratios are adopted. To verify the proposed concept, a <b>sample</b> <b>divider</b> with a power division of 2 : 1 is demonstrated.

The most important influence factors are UV radiation, humidity and temperature. These can cause leaching of long-term and light stabilisers and finally oxidation of the polymer. In this study we demonstrate how the elemental steps of the photooxidative degradation of polyethylene pipes can be monitored by IR-microscopy. In detail the influence of UV radiation leads to a depletion of the phenolic long-term stabiliser, Irganox 1010.

In this study 30 high-yielding Holstein-Friesian dairy cows at different stages of lactation and free of udder infection were used. For each milk sample, the influence of milk sampling techniques was determined for the following parameters: somatic cell count, milk composition, bacterial contamination, viability, in vitro phagocytosis and overall killing of Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305, and cellular chemiluminescence. Because milk sampling occurred throughout lactation, the differences between early, mid- and late lactation were estimated. It was concluded that bacterial contamination was not significantly different in manual milking samples and the reference technique; bacterial contamination was, however, significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in machine milking samples than in the reference technique. Among the different sampling techniques, no significant effects on SCC, milk composition, viability and functions of the cells isolated from milk were observed. It was found that viability, intracellular killing and cellular chemiluminescence of milk PMN were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in early lactation compared to mid- lactation. Phagocytosis was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in early lactation compared to mid- and late lactation, and no significant differences were observed between mid- and late lactation.

40|$|Quality of {{oat flakes}} is {{dependent}} on end-use. Specific weight is used to steer the flaking process, and is important in ensuring that the correct pack weight is achieved. It is also related to flake thickness. Flake thickness in turn may affect other quality parameters such as water absorption, colour and breakage of the flakes. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the effect of specific weight on the quality parameters of oat flakes. Oat flakes were prepared from locally grown oats by a commercial mill. Five flake thickness levels were obtained by adjusting the gap between the rolls. According to usual practice, specific weight was used as an indicator of thickness. For determination of moisture content and pasting properties, samples were ground using a pin mill and cyclone mill. Thickness was measured from 10 randomly selected flakes. Moisture content was determined by air-drying. Water absorption was determined by weighing 50 g of flakes into a beaker and adding 200 ml of water at 24 °C. After 5 min the mixture was spread over a pre-weighed 0. 85 mm screen, tilted at 28 ° from the horizontal and allowed to drain. Flake colour was measured with a tri-stimulus instrument. Flake size distribution was measured using 5 and 2. 5 mm round-holed sieves, from a representative sample obtained with a <b>sample</b> <b>divider.</b> Pasting properties were measured using a Rapid Viscoanalyzer. There was a positive correlation between specific weight and flake thickness. Specific weight showed strong negative correlations with water absorption and the peak viscosity of flakes ground in a pin mill, however there were no significant difference between finely ground flakes, which suggests differences in the particle size distribution or extractability of starch. Thin flakes were whiter. The relationship between specific weight and breakage was less clear, although thin flakes were more susceptible to breakage. These results suggest some methods for measuring the quality of oat flakes and show the effect of a milling parameter (specific weight) on these quality parameters. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R

Here, we have tested the accuracy and reproducibility of absolute coccolith abundance estimates obtained with the filtration method in combination with a rotary <b>sample</b> <b>divider.</b> The examination of two different filtration devices, a funnel and an in-line system, analysing a known number of microbeads per weight, revealed that counts obtained with funnel systems are up to Ø 18. 6 % too high. Repeated analyses (15 ×) of a fine-fraction sediment sample revealed {{a standard deviation of}} ± 11. 4 % for the in-line system and ± 15. 2 % for the funnel system, respectively. The comparison between three sub-samples (three splits of 1 / 30) showed a standard deviation of 4. 6 % for the in-line system and 9. 9 % for the funnel system, respectively. Therefore, we assume that the potential split error for the rotary splitter is ? 4. 6 %. The comparison of our results with estimates for the same samples analysed with the random settling and the “spiking with microbeads and spraying method” (SMS method) reveal that only the data obtained with the SMS and in-line filter method are statistically equal. The results obtained with the settling method are too low, whilst the results obtained with funnel filtration are too high in terms of coccolith absolute abundances. Our results confirm that the filtration method, including sample splitting with a rotary splitter, is a suitable method for the analysis of absolute coccolith abundances. However, the use of different filtration devices appears to affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the number of splitting steps should be as small as possible to avoid an increase of error due to error propagation. In order to increase the reliability of the filtration method, we suggest calibrating a filtration device with microbeads as a standard measure. The reported reproducibility of the various preparation techniques may help to compare data sets obtained with different methods. <br/...|$|R
