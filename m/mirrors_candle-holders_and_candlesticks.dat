5000|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes <b>and</b> <b>candlesticks</b> <b>and</b> the restoration of roods, {{but some of the}} new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London, and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts, although she sometimes displayed a cross <b>and</b> <b>candlesticks</b> in her own chapel. Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration of [...] "popery" [...] was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing so. Amidst all the politics and danger (her accession was not wildly popular) it is not so easy to parse out what she wanted initially: an unmarried clergy; the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist without a theory of definition; mass vestments; a holy table against the wall with candlesticks, a fair linen <b>and</b> <b>candlesticks,</b> [...] "The Prayer Book communion would not be a mass, but at least it would look like a mass," [...] Haight, ibid. p. 241. With the exception of the real presence, she did not succeed.|$|R

5000|$|Inside, {{alterations}} {{have removed}} {{some of the}} original features, but much still remains. A room {{to the east of}} the entrance has Corinthian-style pilasters with volute capitals and various carvings, including inscriptions such as the Ten Commandments; it is believed it may have originally been a private chapel, and the wood on which the Commandments and other inscriptions are carved is known to be 17th-century. [...] The room also has high-quality late-16th-century panelling and floor tiles, a Tudor-style moulded ceiling with heraldic emblems, and a piscina (again suggesting a former religious use for this part of the building). [...] The main staircase winds round a square newel <b>and</b> has <b>candle-holders,</b> <b>and</b> in the attic there are the remains of an older staircase of similar design, with oak treads and chamfering.|$|R

25|$|During the {{suppression}} of the monasteries All Saints' medieval stained glass was destroyed, as was, in 1561, a rood screen with its attached gilded crucifix and figures of Mary and St John, and the Easter Sepulchre.

5000|$|In {{a classic}} {{experiment}} demonstrating functional fixedness, Duncker (1945) gave participants a candle, {{a box of}} thumbtacks, and a book of matches, {{and asked them to}} attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip onto the table below. Duncker found that participants tried to attach the candle directly to the wall with the tacks, or to glue it to the wall by melting it. Very few of them thought of using the inside of the box as a <b>candle-holder</b> <b>and</b> tacking this to the wall. In Duncker's terms, the participants were [...] "fixated" [...] on the box's normal function of holding thumbtacks and could not re-conceptualize it in a manner that allowed them to solve the problem. For instance, participants presented with an empty tack box were two times more likely to solve the problem than those presented with the tack box used as a container ...|$|R
