Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage, however, is every bit or even more critical to the survival of smaller startup businesses. Although much research has been performed on how startup companies create value for their constituencies and on how they launch products, few attempts have been made to apply classical large-company strategy ideas to startups. In this paper we consider eleven distinct differences between how large, established firms and their smaller startup counterparts consider strategy initiatives with an eye to guiding entrepreneurs toward higher probabilities of success. The eleven differences are building on <b>market</b> <b>strengths,</b> size of market, relationship to resources, presence of constraints, visibility of and by competitors, investor expectations, shareholder/investor risk tolerance, process, portfolio management, triage, and time horizon for results. ...|$|E
40|$|Measuring energy access through binary {{indicators}} is insufficient, and often, even misleading. In this work, the SE 4 ALL global tracking framework, and {{the recently}} introduced ESMAP multi-tier approach, is critically discussed analyzing questionnaire based primary data from rural Bangladesh. The performance of different energy interventions is evaluated {{using the new}} tier framework. The challenges in its application lie in reliable data collection, adequate gradation of indicators, and an effective algorithm for the tier assignment based on the specified set of attributes. The study showcases very high sensitivities to parameter changes, different algorithms, and data requirements. The results reveal a clear trade-off between capturing the multi-dimensionality of energy access and the simplicity of an easy to use global framework.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to examine}} leader–follower {{interdependence}} {{from a different perspective}} to learn whether variations in the market leader (ML) ’s level of <b>market</b> <b>strength</b> require followers to pursue different strategies Literature investigating this interdependence largely focuses on the market share consequences for the ML, considering the strategies that followers pursue. Design/methodology/approach: A consumer scanner data set containing 375 followers provided input for a regression model, aimed at explaining the market share performance of followers. Findings: The ML’s products and level of <b>market</b> <b>strength</b> influence whether a follower should be more similar to or different from it, as well as the performance outcomes of distinct product development strategies. Research limitations/implications: This analysis uses unique measures of <b>market</b> <b>strength</b> and product difference; both are significant, but their robustness is limited without further substantiation. Practical implications: Managers must consider three factors that influence the outcomes of their product development strategies: the ML’s products, its <b>market</b> <b>strength</b> and the sum of product attribute differences across their range. Originality/value: This study empirically validates several theoretical arguments for how an ML influences followers’ performance, including the existence of preference asymmetry toward the ML. In turn, it makes recommendations of optimal strategies that followers should pursue. Finally, this article details a method to measure overall differences and highlights the significance of this measure for explaining a follower’s performance.

The computed scores unraveled the depth of outreach of each microfinance institution. Five broad categories of microfinance institutions where identified namely; Rural and Community Banks, Financial Non-Governmental Organizations, Savings and Loans Companies, Susu Associations and Collectors and Credit Unions. The study results showed that the rural and community banks and the financial NGOs reached out to all categories of clients ranging from the extremely poor in the lowest wealth quintile to the poor in the highest quintile. At the other end, savings and loans companies and susu collectors reached clients within the above average and highest quintiles, while credit unions reached out to clients from the average to the highest quintile. Among factors alluding to the different market niches include; source of funds, strategies for outreach and mission of the institution.

40|$|The {{problem of}} chronic {{unemployment}} and low wages among immigrants in Canada is widely discussed in academia and official reports. Culture, {{as one of}} the factors proposed to account for the existing employment and wage gaps between immigrants and Canadian-born population, remains poorly understood. The current study contributes to the understanding of this factor by applying a theory of cultural models to explore Ugandan cultural model of work through interviews with Ugandan immigrants in Canada. The researcher adopted an outsider-to-insider position and employed person-centered interviewing to generate data. Linguistic analysis of keywords, metaphors, reasoning, and descriptions of behaviors was used to uncover the public aspect of the cultural model of work in Uganda. Results of the study suggest that the cultural model of work in Uganda has a tri-dimensional structure, with vertical and horizontal dimensions reflecting relationships based on hierarchy, and a third dimension reflecting relationships based on belonging to a group. The model’s terminal values of power, authority, and respect and dominant feelings of fear and belongingness serve as major motivating factors at the workplace. Results of the study are discussed in the context of immigrant integration into the Canadian labour <b>market.</b> <b>Strengths</b> and weaknesses of employed theory and methodology are discussed and recommendations for the theory development are given. In addition, comparative analysis of Canadian and Ugandan cultural models of work is recommended to inform the problem of immigrant unemployment and low wages among immigrants in Canada...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of foreign {{cultural}} capital, that is, Western knowledge, skills, dispositions and qualifications obtained through various modes of UK international tertiary education in facilitating social reproduction and mobility. The focus is on Malaysian young adults from middle-class backgrounds. It offers a critical exploration of the intricacies and contradictions surrounding the applicability of Bourdieu’s concept of cultural capital in explaining occupational and status distinction across different geographical and socio-relational contexts in Malaysia and the UK. Drawing on interviews with three samples of Malaysian students and recent graduates of UK tertiary education, I explored the anticipation and experiences of the rewards and disadvantages of undertaking international education in the UK and Malaysia. I investigated the planned and executed strategies to secure superior employment and status. I studied the intersection of class with age, ethnicity, gender, nationality and religion in structuring educational and occupational choices, practices and experiences. I explored perceptions and feelings of worth that surrounded planned and actual practices of translating cultural capital to economic and social privileges. Studying overseas in an elite UK university was believed to offer the most privileged opportunities to gain better quality education, experience a higher valued culture, lifestyle, social mix and physical landscape in the West and independently embark on a journey of personal growth and self-discovery. Graduates who studied physically in the UK were generally confident of their labour market and status advantages and saw themselves as more knowledgeable and globally exposed than those pursuing UK education in Malaysia. The latter believed that their relative labour <b>market</b> <b>strengths</b> lay in their enhancement and appropriation of more common local cultural capital in the forms of local knowledge, interaction skills and cultural sensitivity. Flexible and moderate personalisation of foreign and local cultural capital embodied in the self, alongside appropriate deployment and adornment of the physical body, provided the solution for the participants to overcome the relative limitations of the knowledge, skills and dispositions acquired through their respective modes of UK studies. Age, ethnicity and gender were perceived and experienced as significant factors shaping inclusion and exclusion in the Malaysian labour market. Nationality and ethnicity were the significant factors for labour market inclusion and exclusion in the UK. There was a general desire to convert enhanced cultural capital into occupational and status opportunities that allowed for work-life balance, personal contentment, religious fulfilment, emotional security and contribution to society. The thesis contributes to problematising the taken-for-granted singularity of cultural capital practices, showing that their associated benefits and shortcomings do not transfer smoothly across different place, situational and interactional contexts. It challenges {{the assumption that the}} scarcity and exclusivity of foreign cultural capital bring labour market advantage in the home context and it highlights the functional value of more common local cultural capital. It accounts for instrumentality and deliberateness in capital accumulation strategies as well as casts light on the principles, values and preferences which set limits to strategies of maximising material gains. It pieces together the practices, relations and feelings occurring at different points of the academic and occupational trajectories for the diverse Malaysian foreign student and graduate middle-class. It essentially adds depth and complexity to the investigation of intersecting individual, socio-relational and structural factors that shape perceived possibilities and experienced actualities of middle-class social reproduction and mobility among Malaysian students and graduates of UK international education. The thesis has important policy implications for the development of an equitable opportunity system in Malaysia and the socially responsible marketing and provision of international tertiary education in Malaysia and the UK...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. South African {{municipalities}} today face enormous challenges. They {{are faced}} with severe infrastructure backlogs, increased service provision and deteriorating municipal finance. These services, which include water, sanitation, electricity and waste disposal {{are essential to the}} basic needs of all citizens in South Africa, and contribute greatly to local economic development. Municipalities lack the necessary revenue to supply these essential services, or the necessary infrastructure to support these services. Because of this, and in order not to cause further deterioration of municipal service provision, additional infrastructure investment for municipalities in South Africa is needed, and fast. Additional investment can come from various sources, but government's ultimate goal is to see private finance or private capital, flow to the municipal sector. This can be achieved either through issuing municipal bonds, or by providing bank loans to municipalities. Previously (before 1994), South Africa still had a municipal bond market, and both of these instruments traded, but currently the composition of debt is changing. Securities debt remains to decrease, while loan debt increases continuously - a principle, which is inconsistent with that which government wishes to achieve at this stage. The residual credit market in South Africa is largely an intermediate one, with banks and other financial intermediaries holding most loans. Government wishes to see this market supplemented by the development and expansion of a securities market, or a "bond model" that lowers the cost of capital to the municipal sector. This market will imply that municipalities (usually the larger ones) issue debt in the form of bonds, which will then trade in the secondary market. To encourage this, government in South Africa designed the main elements of a municipal debt market necessary to support such a framework. This framework supports the direct access of municipalities to the municipal bond market, rather than the indirect access by intermediaries, which is currently the case. The two intermediaries currently operating in South Africa is INCA - a private sector intermediary, and the DBSA - a public sector intermediary. Together these two market players hold {{more than half of all}} municipal debt in South Africa. In supporting a market where direct capital market access is achievable, or where municipalities issue municipal bonds, a few essential things have to be in place first. This becomes obvious when one considers the underlying strengths of the United States municipal bond market, which makes use of the direct access method or municipal bond issuance. One of the most important <b>market</b> <b>strengths</b> of the United States is the fact that U. S. municipalities,. unlike most municipalities in South Africa, are creditworthy. This creditworthiness can mainly be ascribed to three things, (i) adequate revenue that supports borrowing, (ii) reliable financial information, which is necessary for public disclosure, and (iii) proper credit ratings. All three these elements are important to ensure municipal creditworthiness. South Africa faces enormous constraints on all three these elements. Firstly, South African municipalities do not have adequate revenue to support borrowing, mainly due to debt outstanding, and revenue collection problems. Secondly, the financial information of most municipalities in South Africa - which is imperative for public disclosure - is usually absent, late or unreliable, and thirdly, only five municipalities in South Africa currently reported having credit. The creditworthiness of most municipalities in South Africa seems to be the greatest obstacle in the way of municipal bond market development. If South Africa wishes to achieve successful and efficient ways to aid the re-emergence of the municipal bond market, it would have to reduce the credit risk of most municipalities. Municipalities can reduce credit risk by making use of certain credit enhancement mechanisms that will also provide additional investment. There are various forms of credit enhancement mechanisms available, which include government lending, government grants, government subsidies, and government guarantees, interception of intergovernmental transfers, municipal bond insurance, bank letters of credit, and making use of special purpose intermediaries. Many special purpose intermediaries do exist in the world today, which include anything from municipal development banks to bond banks. The United States successfully uses bond banks that give access to smaller, poorly rated municipalities via a process known as ''bond pooling. " Bond pooling involves a concept where a number of small municipalities pool their issues together to create one large bond pool with numerous advantageous. Although larger municipalities in South Africa would have no problem accessing the municipal bond market directly via bond issuance, smaller un-creditworthy municipalities would find it much more difficult to access the municipal bond market via bond issuance. One solution to the problem could be if the smaller poorly rated municipalities, makes use of a municipal bond bank similar to the municipal bond banks in the United States. The proposed bond bank, besides providing access assistance to smaller municipalities could also provide certain technical assistance and training concerning the municipal bond market, bond issuance, the role of municipalities in this market, all the requirements necessary for municipalities to access this market effectively, and municipal creditworthiness. Since the majority of municipalities in South Africa do not have the necessary requirements to access the capital market directly, and secondly, since this direct access method would solve the problem of only a few exceptional municipalities in South Africa, the government proposed framework seems ineffective. One solution could be if the South African government instead of making use of municipal bond issuance uses an intermediary like the bond bank to access additional finance. Although this would be indirect contrast with that, which government wishes to achieve it could be the only solution in reactivating or stimulating the municipal bond market. Master...|$|E
