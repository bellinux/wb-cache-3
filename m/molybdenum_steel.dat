500|$|During World War I, {{demand for}} {{molybdenum}} spiked; {{it was used}} both in armor plating and {{as a substitute for}} tungsten in high speed steels. Some British tanks were protected by 75mm (3in) manganese steel plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with much lighter [...] <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> plates allowing for higher speed, greater maneuverability, and better protection. The Germans also used molybdenum-doped steel for heavy artillery, like in the super-heavy howitzer Big Bertha, because traditional steel melts at the temperatures produced by the propellant of the one ton shell. After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In World War II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} century, {{molybdenum}} had no industrial use. [...] It was relatively scarce, the pure metal {{was difficult to}} extract, and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature. Early <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steel</b> alloys showed great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys {{on a large scale}} were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward brittleness, and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process.|$|E

Ti-doped {{diamond-like}} carbon(Ti-DLC) coatings and undoped diamond-like carbon(DLC) coatings were synthesized by unbalanced {{magnetron sputtering}} using carburized Chromium <b>Molybdenum</b> <b>Steels</b> (SCM 415) as substrates. Nanocomposite structure coatings with metal carbides nanocrystals uniformly dispersing in the amorphous carbon matrix {{were obtained by}} the optimization {{of the kinds of}} doped metals and deposited parameters.

The friction coefficients of Ti doping DLC coatings are relatively lower compared with undoping DLC coatings in engine oil. The analysis on the wear surface of coatings have indicated that: the surface of DLC doped with metal absorbs more elements from the engine oil, which indicates that the doping of metal can improve the affinity of the coating for the engine oil, enhance the formation of lubrication oil films, and reduce the friction coefficient thereby. 1...|$|R

50|$|However, during tempering, {{elements}} like chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum precipitate {{with the}} carbon. If the steel contains fairly low concentrations of these elements, the softening {{of the steel}} can be retarded until much higher temperatures are reached, when compared to those needed for tempering carbon steel. This allows the steel to maintain its hardness in high temperature or high friction applications. However, this also requires very high temperatures during tempering, to achieve a reduction in hardness. If the steel contains large amounts of these elements, tempering may produce an increase in hardness until a specific temperature is reached, {{at which point the}} hardness will begin to decrease. For instance, <b>molybdenum</b> <b>steels</b> will typically reach their highest hardness around 315 C whereas vanadium steels will harden fully when tempered to around 371 C. When very large amounts of solutes are added, alloy steels may behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which do not soften at all during tempering.|$|R
