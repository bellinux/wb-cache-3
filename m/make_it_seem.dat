5|$|While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd {{systematically}} kill several diamond smugglers, M {{suspects that}} South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond {{to uncover the}} smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> as though Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.|$|E
5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas.

Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated {{in front of her}} teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve pay for what he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode {{came from a}} story idea by Greg Daniels, and the writing staff came up with three major concepts. The first involves the Simpson family moving out of Springfield, which the writers initially hoped would fool the audience into thinking it was a permanent move. As a result, they tried to work in as many characters as they could during the first act of the episode to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> that the family really was leaving. The second involved Homer getting a new job for an employee-friendly boss {{in contrast to the}} tyrannical Mr. Burns. The third was that Homer's new boss would be a supervillain resembling Ernst Stavro Blofeld. This element was meant to be in the background and Homer would be ignorant to it.|$|E

In addition, direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E
5|$|In {{discussing}} the more lighthearted {{elements of the}} plot, such as Dr. Morris, a character who tells corny jokes, the developers commented that these elements accentuated the dark elements of the game rather than detracted from them, as well as showing {{the stability of the}} survivors' mental conditions. The decision to include more dialogue than previous entries in the series was to ensure that this new world and the new characters were understandable by the player, though the developers acknowledge that it could also distract from the strategic gameplay. The developers felt that the dialogue made the story more enjoyable for the players, as opposed to being a vehicle to move the gameplay forward. When asked if Days of Ruin was an attempt to bridge this series with fellow Intelligent Systems series Fire Emblem, developers commented that while the increase in volume may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> like this, it was not their intention. They explained that while Fire Emblem placed importance on individual units, Advance Wars was about improving as a commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E

5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape {{who was able to}} provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> the wounded man {{was the one who had}} killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not have to go to school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E
5|$|While {{the last}} three Fire Emblem titles had used a similar setting, with Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem both being set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, Kaga wanted to create something new for his next title. This was for two reasons: he wanted {{to move beyond the}} confines of Archanea, and also wanted to try his hand at a large-scale historical drama. Similar to other Fire Emblem titles, the setting drew inspiration from Medieval Europe. The story's inspiration changed, drawing from Norse and Celtic mythology as opposed to the elements from Classical mythology used by earlier titles. Similar to Mystery of the Emblem, the story was split into two halves, with the first half acting as an introduction for Seliph's quest. The story's main theme was how the stupidity of humans could forge history. The focus shifted away from the characters to the overall world of Jugdral, intended to show the scale of the conflict and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> like history in the making. While the backstory of Jugdral featured a clearly defined battle between good and evil, the main story's distinction between good and evil was blurred, exemplified by the descendants of the Twelve Crusaders being on opposing sides rather than united. A stated example was Alvis, whose conquests were driven by a wish to end discrimination against Loptyr descendants. Due to this, Kaga did not create a storyline focused on poetic justice and morality, instead aiming for a more realistic scenario. This realism also prompted the inclusion of elements such as patricide and incest, which had occurred in history but were not typically included in gaming narratives at the time. The story originally had three acts rather than two. The missing act would have covered the period {{between the first and second}} act, which put a more overt focus on the themes of patricide and incest. Due to time constraints, this third act needed to be cut. In a later interview, Kaga felt that the focus on narrative weakened the gameplay.|$|E

25|$|As the Qing dynasty weakened, its {{authority}} over Tibet also gradually declined, {{and by the}} mid-19th century its influence was minuscule.

25|$|Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001), {{directed}} by Christophe Gans, {{is a popular}} feature film based on the legend.

Rather than a wolf or wolf-dog crossbreed, the movie portrays the creature as the offspring of a lion crossbred with another unknown big cat, equipped with armor to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> more threatening. The Beast is the instrument of the film's eponymous secret organisation, which attempts to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country by stating that the Beast is a divine punishment for the King's indulgence of the modern embrace of science over religion.|$|E

But she did not kill Miss Vansittart, and has a perfect alibi for that night. Vansittart was killed by Chadwick, in an unpremeditated fit of passion. Chadwick had found Vansittart, whom she disliked, in the Sports Pavilion the second night, {{kneeling}} in front of Shaista's locker. Chadwick was carrying a sandbag for protection, and there was Vansittart in a perfect position to be coshed. Chadwick apparently suffered a psychotic break and bludgeoned Vansittart.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of a caterpillar can often repel a predator: its markings and certain body parts can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> poisonous, or bigger in size and thus threatening, or non-edible. Some types of caterpillars are indeed poisonous or distasteful and their bright coloring is aposematic. Others may mimic dangerous caterpillars or other animals while not being dangerous themselves. Many caterpillars are cryptically colored and resemble the plants on which they feed. An example of caterpillars that use camouflage for defence is the species Nemoria arizonaria. If the caterpillars hatch {{in the spring and}} feed on oak catkins they appear green. If they hatch in the summer they appear dark colored, like oak twigs. The differential development is linked to the tannin content in the diet. Caterpillars may even have spines or growths that resemble plant parts such as thorns. Some look like objects in the environment such as bird droppings.|$|E
