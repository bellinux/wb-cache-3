5|$|Five {{isotopes}} of zirconium {{also exist}} as <b>metastable</b> isomers: 83mZr, 85mZr, 89mZr, 90m1Zr, 90m2Zr and 91mZr. Of these, 90m2Zr has the shortest half-life at 131nanoseconds. 89mZr {{is the longest}} lived with a half-life of 4.161minutes.|$|E
5|$|The least stable {{ground state}} isotope is francium-215, with a {{half-life}} of 0.12μs: it undergoes a 9.54MeV alpha decay to astatine-211. Its <b>metastable</b> isomer, francium-215m, is less stable still, with a half-life of only 3.5ns.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{isotopes}} of francium {{ranging in}} atomic mass from 199 to 232. Francium has seven <b>metastable</b> nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 {{are the only}} isotopes that occur in nature, though the former is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid as {{the binary}} (two-component) mixture of HCl and H2O has a constant-boiling {{azeotrope}} at 20.2% HCl and 108.6°C (227°F). There are four constant-crystallization eutectic points for hydrochloric acid, between the crystal form of HCl·H2O (68% HCl), HCl·2H2O (51% HCl), HCl·3H2O (41% HCl), HCl·6H2O (25% HCl), and ice (0% HCl). There {{is also a}} <b>metastable</b> eutectic point at 24.8% between ice and the HCl·3H2O crystallization.|$|E
5|$|There are 35 known {{isotopes}} of molybdenum, {{ranging in}} atomic mass from 83 to 117, {{as well as}} four <b>metastable</b> nuclear isomers. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{radioactive}} isotopes {{of plutonium}} have been characterized. The longest-lived are plutonium-244, with a half-life of 80.8million years, plutonium-242, with a half-life of 373,300years, and plutonium-239, with a half-life of 24,110years. All {{of the remaining}} radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000years. This element also has eight <b>metastable</b> states, though all have half-lives less than one second.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 <b>metastable</b> isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two <b>metastable</b> isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E
5|$|Upon heating, α-berkelium {{transforms}} {{into another}} phase with an fcc lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group Fmm and {{the lattice constant}} of 500pm; this fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is <b>metastable</b> and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at room temperature. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 <b>metastable</b> ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple {{excitation}} states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers {{are expected to be}} less stable than their ground state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being <b>metastable.</b> The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|At least 32 <b>metastable</b> isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by {{isomeric}} transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known <b>metastable</b> state. All of these but the unconfirmed 278Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of darmstadtium have been reported with atomic masses 267, 269–271, 273, 277, and 279–281, although darmstadtium-267 and darmstadtium-280 are unconfirmed. Two darmstadtium isotopes, darmstadtium-270 and darmstadtium-271, have known <b>metastable</b> states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Hassium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 (with the exceptions of 272, 274, and 276), three of which, hassium-265, hassium-267, hassium-269, have known <b>metastable</b> states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some also undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Hopping or jumping is conceptually {{the most}} basic {{mechanism}} for diffusion of adatoms. In this model, the adatoms reside on adsorption sites on the surface lattice. Motion occurs through successive jumps to adjacent sites, the number of which depends {{on the nature of}} the surface lattice. Figures 1 and 3 both display adatoms undergoing diffusion via the hopping process. Studies have shown the presence of <b>metastable</b> transition states between adsorption sites wherein it may be possible for adatoms to temporarily reside.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as <b>metastable</b> states.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses 266, 268, 270, and 274–278, two of which, meitnerium-268 and meitnerium-270, have known but unconfirmed <b>metastable</b> states. A ninth isotope with atomic mass 282 is unconfirmed. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, although some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of roentgenium {{have been reported}} with atomic masses 272, 274, 278–282, and 286 (unconfirmed), two of which, roentgenium-272 and roentgenium-274, have known but unconfirmed <b>metastable</b> states. All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of seaborgium have been reported with atomic masses 258–267, 269, and 271, three of which, seaborgium-261, 263, and 265, have known <b>metastable</b> states. All of these decay only through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with the single exception of seaborgium-261 that can also undergo electron capture to dubnium-261.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, other true {{compounds}} may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF) {{which would}} be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000. Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable. Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a <b>metastable</b> FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.|$|E
5|$|All {{meitnerium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6seconds. (The unconfirmed 282Mt is yet heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of 67seconds.) A <b>metastable</b> nuclear isomer, 270mMt, {{has been reported to}} also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, 274Mt and 277Mt were predicted to have half-lives of 20seconds and 1minute respectively, but they were later found to have half-lives of only 0.44seconds and 5milliseconds respectively.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is <b>metastable</b> in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group {{congeners}} form stable or <b>metastable</b> allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{tantalum}} {{consists of}} two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a <b>metastable</b> state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} vanadium {{is composed}} of one stable isotope, 51V, and one radioactive isotope, 50V. The latter has a half-life of 1.5×1017 years and a natural abundance of 0.25%. 51V has a nuclear spin of , which is useful for NMR spectroscopy. Twenty-four artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 40 to 65. The most stable of these isotopes are 49V with a half-life of 330 days, and 48V with a half-life of 16.0 days. The remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives shorter than an hour, most below 10 seconds. At least four isotopes have <b>metastable</b> excited states. Electron capture is the main decay mode for isotopes lighter than 51V. For the heavier ones, the most common mode is beta decay. The electron capture reactions lead {{to the formation of}} element 22 (titanium) isotopes, while beta decay leads to element 24 (chromium) isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium {{of the rare}} earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of <b>metastable</b> δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium has one stable isotope, rhenium-185, which {{nevertheless}} {{occurs in}} minority abundance, a situation {{found only in}} two other elements (indium and tellurium). Naturally occurring rhenium is only 37.4% 185Re, and 62.6% 187Re, which is unstable but has a very long half-life (≈1010 years). This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of rhenium atom. decay of fully ionized 187Re: 187Re-187Os Cosmochronometry|date=1996|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=77|issue=26|pages=5190–5193|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5190|bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5190B|pmid=10062738}} The beta decay of 187Re is used for rhenium-osmium dating of ores. The available energy for this beta decay (2.6 keV) {{is one of the}} lowest known among all radionuclides. The isotope rhenium-186m is notable as being one of the longest lived <b>metastable</b> isotopes with a half-life of around 200,000 years. There are twenty-five other recognized radioactive isotopes of rhenium.|$|E
5|$|The RIKEN team {{produced}} a further atom on 2 April 2005, although the decay data were slightly {{different from the}} first chain, perhaps due to either {{the formation of a}} <b>metastable</b> state or an alpha particle escaping from the detector before depositing its full energy. In 2004, the RIKEN team also studied the 205Tl(70Zn,n)274Rg reaction, retaining the zinc beam and impinging it on a thallium rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce 274Rg in a cross-bombardment as the immediate daughter of 278Nh. However, the thallium target was weak compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became non-uniform in thickness; hence no atoms of 274Rg were observed. This reaction was repeated in 2010 with upgraded equipment, but again without success. The reasons for this weakness are still unknown, given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the <b>metastable</b> trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E
5|$|Tungsten {{exists in}} two major {{crystalline}} forms: α and β. The former has a {{body-centered cubic structure}} and is the more stable form. The structure of the β phase is called A15 cubic; it is <b>metastable,</b> but can coexist with the α phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the α phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the β form exhibits a columnar habit. The α phase has {{one third of the}} electrical resistivity and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the β phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1–4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits.|$|E
