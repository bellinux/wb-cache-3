On returning to Port Stephens, <b>Mr</b> <b>White</b> was invited to stand for Parliament and was elected for the seat of Gloucester. It was during this time that he purchased Tahlee for ₤850.|$|E

500|$|Bond disobeys M's {{order and}} travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Marco belonged to an {{organisation}} of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections.

After hearing Oberhauser give the order for [...] "the Pale King" [...] to be assassinated, Bond escapes the meeting and is pursued across the city by the organization's assassin, Mr. Hinx. Moneypenny informs Bond that the Pale King is <b>Mr.</b> <b>White,</b> {{a former member of}} the organization's subsidiary Quantum. White has fallen afoul of Oberhauser, prompting the assassination order. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Dave Bautista {{was cast}} as Mr. Hinx after {{producers}} sought an actor {{with a background}} in contact sports. The character only has one line in the entire film, [...] "Shit". Sam Mendes thought the silent nature would drive Bautista away, but the lifelong Bond fan expressed interest in reviving the quiet henchmen archetype of characters such as Jaws. Bautista's performance was inspired mostly by Oddjob from Goldfinger, and said not talking created an acting challenge, “trying to find this way where I am actually going to have speak without speaking." [...] After casting Bérénice Lim Marlohe, a relative newcomer, as Sévérine in Skyfall, Mendes consciously sought out a more experienced actor {{for the role of}} Madeleine Swann, ultimately casting Léa Seydoux in the role. Monica Bellucci joined the cast as Lucia Sciarra, becoming, at the age of fifty, the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl. In a separate interview with Danish website Euroman, Jesper Christensen revealed he would be reprising his role as <b>Mr.</b> <b>White</b> from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Christensen's character was reportedly killed off in a scene intended to be used as an epilogue to Quantum of Solace, before it was removed from the final cut of the film, enabling his return in Spectre.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable {{development}} {{took place}} during this period. Improvements and extensions were added to Tahlee House.

2500|$|The {{enclosure}} (privatisation) of its common {{fields of}} [...] {{in the east}} and its infertile land ('waste') of [...] was carried out in 1801.
