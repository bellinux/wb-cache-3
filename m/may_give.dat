5|$|Females of many spider species, {{including}} P. labiata, emit volatile pheromones {{into the}} air, and these generally attract males from a distance. The silk draglines of female jumping spiders also contain pheromones, which stimulate males to court females and <b>may</b> <b>give</b> information about each female's status, for example whether the female is juvenile, subadult or mature.|$|E
5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} males, are territorial. Some {{defend a}} territory against others {{of their own}} species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch <b>may</b> <b>give</b> a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there.|$|E

5|$|Thought {{processes}} are noncommutative: A person {{asked a question}} (A) and then a question (B) <b>may</b> <b>give</b> different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it <b>may</b> <b>give</b> rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This <b>may</b> <b>give</b> birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

5|$|Canon law {{concerns}} the Catholic Church's life and organisation and {{is distinct from}} civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors. Similarly, civil law <b>may</b> <b>give</b> force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E

Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks <b>may</b> <b>give</b> a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes <b>may</b> <b>give</b> way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh {{that is too}} tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even {{when there is no}} food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.|$|E
5|$|Royal assent is {{sometimes}} associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted {{at a ceremony}} held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general <b>may</b> <b>give</b> assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament {{of his or her}} agreement to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar <b>may</b> <b>give</b> a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E

5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it <b>may</b> <b>give</b> into American history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} <b>may</b> <b>give</b> advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge of the bill <b>may</b> <b>give</b> two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of the bill that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of the bill reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if the bill will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E

5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one <b>may</b> <b>give</b> up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology <b>may</b> <b>give</b> these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females <b>may</b> <b>give</b> birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
