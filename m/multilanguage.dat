40|$|Atemporal and {{context-free}} {{views of}} langue {{have been replaced}} by models focusing on context-bounded processes of sense-making and a strong determination of linguistic forms by the socio-cognitive functions of language. However, the view of separate, closed rule systems for each single language still prevails. Based on Hopper’s emergent grammar and socio-constructivist models of language acquisition, we argue, firstly, that language is a praxis rather than a structure, i. e. an open, dynamic and complex system that undergoes change each time it is used. We also strongly question the endoxa that different languages are bound to geographically and politically separate spaces. Highly polyglossic societies are the rule, where plurilingual repertoires represent resources upon which interlocutors can draw to solve their communicative tasks either by sticking to one language at a time or by blended combinations or <b>multilanguaging.</b> It is well known that such mixing follows norms which represent a multilingual emergent grammar. Finally, we call for language theories to explain <b>multilanguaging</b> as one of several forms of normal language behaviour...|$|R

In this report we look to identify the script of <b>multilanguages.</b> In the proposed script identification system, we have considered four Indian languages such as Hindi (Devanagari), Bangla, Telugu, Kannada. This system will let document images to accurate scan with higher accuracy. In this context, we modeled script identification of multilingual document using horizontal projection profile based analysis with head line features. A database of 450 text words of Hindi, 450 text words of Bangla, 450 text words of Telugu and 450 text words of Kannada are used for experimentation. The proposed system yields the 97. 83 accuracy with four specified languages. Since script identification {{plays an important role in}} analyzing the printed documents...|$|R

This paper presents a natural language processing based automated system for generating code in <b>multilanguages</b> after modeling the user requirements based on UML. UML diagrams are first generated by analyzing the given business scenario provided by the user. A new model is presented for analyzing the natural languages and extracting the relative and required information from the given requirement notes by the user. User writes the requirements in simple English in a few paragraphs and the designed system has conspicuous ability to analyze the given script. After compound analysis and extraction of associated information, the designed system draws various UML diagrams as activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, class diagrams and Uses cases diagrams. The designed system has robust ability to create code automatically without external environment. The designed system provides a quick and reliable way to generate UML diagrams and generate respective code to save the time and budget of both the user and system analyst...|$|R
40|$|Critical {{directions}} in applied linguistics {{can be understood}} in various ways. The term critical {{as it has been}} used in critical applied linguistics, critical discourse analysis, critical literacy and so forth, is now embedded as part of applied linguistic work, adding an overt focus on questions of power and inequality to discourse analysis, literacy or applied linguistics more generally. In this paper I will argue, however, that although critical discourse analysis and critical literacy still make claims to a territory different from their non-critical counterparts, much of this work has become conventional and moribund. The use of the term critical (with its problematic claims and divisions) has perhaps reached saturation level. This is not to say, however, that the basic need to bring questions of power, disparity and difference to applied linguistics is any way diminished, but rather that we may need to look in alternative directions for renewal. Here I want to pursue two main possibilities: On the one hand, the effects of critical work have been widely felt, so that the issues and concerns raised by work in this tradition have filtered through to many parts of the field. Work today that might be deemed critical may no longer need to wear this label. On the other hand, a range of different social theories (captured in part by a series of turns) has started to shift the thinking in many domains of applied linguistics in important ways. Just as work in sociolinguistics, for example, has shifted from a central focus on variationist accounts of language to include style, identity, practices and politics more broadly, and work in bi- and multilingualism has started to question the ways in which these are framed (hence, for example, <b>multilanguaging,</b> polylingualism and metrolingualism), so applied linguistics has shifted from a central focus on language teaching, testing and second language acquisition to a broader and more critical conceptualization of language in social life. It has started to take on board the implications of new turns in the social sciences (practices, sensory, somatic, postmodern, ecological, decolonial) and new influences from previously overlooked sources (queer theory, critical geography, postcolonial studies, philosophy). Critical and alternative {{directions in}} applied linguistics, therefore, may be found across a variety of domains that are engaging with notions such as language as a local practice...|$|R
