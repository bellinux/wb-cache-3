30|$|GaN-related III-nitride {{materials}} have drawn much attention {{over the last}} decade owing to its highly expected potential in short-wavelength optoelectronic devices, optical detectors, and semiconductor lasers [1, 2]. In order to further improve the performance of these devices, besides the optical and electrical properties of materials, mechanical characteristics and deformation behavior are also crucial for solving the problems of residual stress/strain introduced by heteroepitaxial films and multiple-layer device structures. Furthermore, semiconductor device processing involves extensively with surface contact, cracking, film delamination, and propagation of dislocations, which may degrade the performance of these devices. Consequently, significant interest in determining the <b>mechanical</b> <b>characterizations</b> of GaN materials is motivated, in particular at the nanoscale level, both in basic research and technological applications.|$|R
