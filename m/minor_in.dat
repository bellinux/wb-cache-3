In addition, Debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on Newfoundland.|$|E

Because few drugs have been tested in children, pediatricians are forced to prescribe medications off-label with uncertain efficacy and safety.

After {{a brief description of}} the problems associated with involving <b>minors</b> <b>in</b> clinical research, we consider how existing "relationships of trust" can be used as a place where the concerns of research subjects can be more fully discussed and addressed. Building on the tacit recognition of trust found in The European Clinical Trials Directive we make policy recommendations that allow for clearer, more ethically informed guidelines for enrolling <b>minors</b> <b>in</b> clinical research. status: publishe...|$|R
