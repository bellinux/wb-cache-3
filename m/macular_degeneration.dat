5|$|In 2015, Barr {{revealed}} she {{has been}} diagnosed with both <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and glaucoma, and thus is gradually losing her eyesight and expects to eventually go blind; she is consuming medical marijuana to decrease her intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} GWAS {{was published in}} 2005. It investigated patients with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. , {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals are tested in a typical GWA study, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and respiratory syncytial virus. RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> and other diseases that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The first GWA study, {{conducted}} in 2005, compared 96 patients with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls. It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency {{between the two}} groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding complement factor H, which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD. Another landmark publication {{in the history of}} GWA studies was the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted {{at the time of its}} publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, bipolar disorder, and hypertension) and 3,000 shared controls. This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, Dot is {{released}} and shares her regret with Ian {{that she did}} not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.|$|E

25|$|The Amsler {{grid test}} {{can be used}} to {{diagnose}} <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> For this test, patients are asked to look at a grid, and distortions or blank spots in the patient's central field of vision can be detected. A positive diagnosis of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> may account for a patient's micropsia.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is being done}} on <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> which could help prevent cases of micropsia. A variety of drugs that block vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are being evaluated as a treatment option. These treatments {{for the first time}} have produced actual improvements in vision, rather than simply delaying or arresting the continued loss of vision characteristic of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> A number of surgical treatments are also being investigated for <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> lesions that may not qualify for laser treatment, including macular translocation to a healthier area of the eye, displacement of submacular blood using gas, and removing membranes by surgery.|$|E
25|$|A {{new study}} {{suggests}} that common cholesterol-reducing drugs may also prevent <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> {{typically}} produces micropsia due to {{the swelling}} or bulging of the macula, an oval-shaped yellow spot {{near the center of}} the retina in the human eye. The main factors leading to this disease are age, smoking, heredity, and obesity. Some studies show that consuming spinach or collard greens five times a week cuts the risk of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> by 43%.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, a {{retrospective}} analysis comparing the incidence of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (AMD) between patients taking vs. not taking L-DOPA found that the drug delayed onset of AMD by ~8 years. The authors state that significant effects were obtained for {{both dry and wet}} AMD.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017 a {{team led}} by Masayo Takahashi {{completed}} the first successfull transplant of iPS-derived retinal cells into the eye of a patient suffering from advanced <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> The benefits of using autologous iPSCs are that there is theoretically no risk of rejection and that it eliminates the need to use embryonic stem cells.|$|E

Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> as well as Braille, DAISY, audiobooks and e-books.|$|E
25|$|Age {{can result}} in visual impairment, whereby non-verbal {{communication}} is reduced, {{which can lead to}} isolation and possible depression. <b>Macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> causes vision loss and increases with age, affecting nearly 12% of those above the age of 80. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and by growth of abnormal vessels around the retina.|$|E
25|$|Our {{cells are}} {{constantly}} breaking down proteins and other molecules {{that are no}} longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which canâ€™t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected {{in the form of}} lipofuscin granules. Atherosclerosis, <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> liver spots on the skin and all kinds of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease) are associated with this problem.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia that is {{induced by}} <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> {{can be treated}} in several ways. A study called AREDS (age-related eye disease study) {{determined}} that taking dietary supplements containing high-dose antioxidants and zinc produced significant benefits with regard to disease progression. This study was the first ever to prove that dietary supplements can alter the natural progression and complications of a disease state. Laser treatments also look promising but are still in clinical stages.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{factors that}} limit acuity {{are located in}} the retina or the brain (or the pathway leading there). Examples for the first are a {{detached}} retina and <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> to name just two. Another common impairment, amblyopia, is caused by the visual brain not having developed properly in early childhood. In some cases, low visual acuity is caused by brain damage, such as from traumatic brain injury or stroke. When optical factors are corrected for, acuity can be considered a measure of neural well-functioning.|$|E
25|$|Near-sightedness is {{the most}} common eye problem and is {{estimated}} to affect 1.5 billion people (22% of the population). Rates vary significantly in different areas of the world. Rates among adults are between 15 and 49%. Rates are similar in males and females. Among children it affects 1% of rural Nepalese, 4% of South Africans, 12% of Americans, and 37% in some large Chinese cities. Rates have increased since the 1950s. Uncorrected near-sightedness {{is one of the most}} common causes of vision impairment globally along with cataracts, <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> and vitamin A deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia is a {{condition}} affecting human visual perception in which objects {{are perceived to be}} smaller than they actually are. Micropsia can be caused by optical factors (such as wearing glasses), by distortion of images in the eye (such as optically, via swelling of the cornea or from changes {{in the shape of the}} retina such as from retinal edema, <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> or central serous retinopathy), by changes in the brain (such as from traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, migraines, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs), and from psychological factors. Dissociative phenomena are linked with micropsia, which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Two meta-analyses {{confirm a}} {{correlation}} between high diet content or high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin {{and a decrease in}} the risk of cataract. There is only one published clinical intervention trial testing for an effect of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on cataracts. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) were NOT less likely to progress to needing cataract surgery. The authors speculated {{that there may be a}} cataract prevention benefit for people with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, but recommended more research.|$|E
25|$|Yellow tinted {{glasses are}} {{a type of}} glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of {{reducing}} headaches {{due to lack of}} blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses. Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain. These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames. Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any {{pathological}} {{process in the}} visual system, even in older humans beyond the critical period, will often cause decreases in visual acuity. Thus measuring visual acuity is a simple test in accessing {{the health of the}} eyes, the visual brain, or pathway to the brain. Any relatively sudden decrease in visual acuity is always a cause for concern. Common causes of decreases in visual acuity are cataracts and scarred corneas, which affect the optical path, diseases that affect the retina, such as <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and diabetes, diseases affecting the optic pathway to the brain such as tumors and multiple sclerosis, and diseases affecting the visual cortex such as tumors and strokes.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the first}} report that carbon {{monoxide}} is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, {{as well as one}} of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as anti-inflammatories, vasodilators, and encouragers of neovascular growth. However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from wet <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.|$|E
