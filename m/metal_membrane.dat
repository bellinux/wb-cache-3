50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor uses {{a set of}} plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid {{in or out of}} an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible <b>metal</b> <b>membrane</b> that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio as well as high powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.|$|E

In {{the case of a}} sub-wavelength periodically modified metallic membrane, it is shown that an enhanced optical transmission can be achieved. The SPR condition depends on the lattice constant, incident angle, wavelength as well as dielectric constant of the material interfacing the membrane. The presence of a high refractive index chemical on the <b>metal</b> <b>membrane</b> will cause a spectral shift in the transmission peaks. This is the basis for SPR chemical sensing.

Unfortunately, the impurities present in the gasifier effluent streams, such as H 2 S, can have adverse effects on the mechanical and chemical stability of potential <b>metal</b> <b>membranes</b> in the form of corrosion or catalyst deactivation, respectively. Thus, this study has focused on the identification and characterization of dense <b>metal</b> <b>membranes</b> that can tolerate the harsh environments encountered in the gasification process without significant detrimental effects on permeability. Pd-Cu alloys have been of interest in recent years due to its catalytic activity for hydrogen dissociation, high permeability relative to Pd, suppression of the hydride-phase transition and limited reports of stability in the presence of H 2 S. Initially, the permeability of pure palladium, pure copper and palladium-copper alloys containing 80 wt%, 60 wt% and 53 wt% Pd was evaluated with hydrogen retentate streams at temperatures and pressures ranging from 350 to 900 oC and 0. 1 to 2. 86 MPa, respectively. Results indicate that crystalline phase plays a significant role in membrane performance, with the B 2, 60 wt%Pd-Cu alloy exhibiting the highest permeability of the alloys tested at temperatures below approximately 500 oC. However, at temperatures corresponding to an fcc crystalline temperature for all of the alloys, membrane performance increased with increasing palladium content of the alloy. Additionally, the permeability the above mentioned alloys, along with pure palladium, have been evaluated in a H 2 S containing retentate gas mixture at temperatures of 350, 450 and 635 oC.

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{our results}} on the feasibility of a novel dense <b>metal</b> <b>membrane</b> for hydrogen separation: Supported Molten <b>Metal</b> <b>Membrane,</b> or SMMM. 1 The goal in this work was to develop these new membranes based on supporting thin films of low-melting, non- precious group metals, e. g., tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), or their alloys, to provide a flux and selectivity of hydrogen that rivals the conventional but substantially more expensive palladium (Pd) or Pd alloy membranes, which are susceptible to poisoning by the many species in the coal-derived syngas, and further possess inadequate stability and limited operating temperature range. The novelty of the technology presented numerous challenges {{during the course of}} this project, however, mainly in the selection of appropriate supports, and in the fabrication of a stable membrane. While the wetting instability of the SMMM remains an issue, we did develop an adequate understanding of the interaction between molten metal films with porous supports that we were able to find appropriate supports. Thus, our preliminary results indicate that the Ga/SiC SMMM at 550 ºC has a permeance that is an order of magnitude higher than that of Pd, and exceeds the 2015 DOE target. To make practical SMM membranes, however, further improving the stability of the molten <b>metal</b> <b>membrane</b> is the next goal. For this, it is important to better understand the change in molten metal surface tension and contact angle as a function of temperature and gas-phase composition.

This fundamental understanding has allowed us to determine design characteristics to maintain stability in the face of changing gas composition. These designs are being developed. For further progress, it is also important to understand the nature of solution and permeation process in these molten metal membranes. For this, a comprehensive microkinetic model was developed for hydrogen permeation in dense metal membranes, and tested against data for Pd membrane over a broad range of temperatures. 3 It is planned to obtain theoretical and experimental estimates of the parameters to corroborate the model against mental results for SMMM...|$|E

For example, a 2 {micro}m pure Pd membrane on a Pall AccuSep{reg_sign} substrate achieved an ideal H{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 } separation factor of over 6000, with a pure hydrogen flux of 210 SCFH/ft{sup 2 } at only 20 psig feed pressure.

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>membranes</b> {{are useful}} for {{hydrogen}} separation from mixed gas streams. They can exhibit perfect selectivity for hydrogen. However, {{in order to be}} commercially viable, in addition to providing high hydrogen fluxes, they must also be resistant to poisoning, possess long operating lifetimes and be cost effective. Many types of <b>metal</b> <b>membranes</b> such as pure metals, disordered alloys and amorphous metals have been studied for this application. In this work, we aim to identify intermetallic stoichiometric compounds of two or more metals that could be used as potential membrane materials for hydrogen separation. In the past, first principle calculations combined with Monte Carlo methods have been developed that can accurately predict H₂ fluxes through <b>metal</b> <b>membranes</b> at different hydrogen pressures and temperatures. Although these models are accurate, they are computationally intensive. In this work, we use these methods and develop screening criteria based on calculated properties that enable us to perform detailed calculations on a diminishing set of materials and rapidly identify the favorable candidates for hydrogen separation. We screened 1059 intermetallics at this high level of theory, which is the largest set of materials studied for this application. We divided the intermetallics into Pd-based and non-Pd based materials using additional screening algorithms {{to reduce the number of}} calculations required to identify potential candidate materials. 8 intermetallics were identified that had permeabilities that was comparable or higher to that of pure Pd. MgZn₂ and MnTi were found to have the highest H permeabilities among all the intermetallics studied. In addition to ground state structures, metastable structures were also found to be stabilized in the presence of hydrogen. Our work demonstrates the ability of these computational methods to identify potential novel materials for specific applications from large sets of materials that would not be possible experimentally. In the models for hydrogen permeability developed above, H-induced metal lattice rearrangements were not considered. Experimental evidence suggests that hydrogen heat treated (HHT) Pd-Au alloys undergo lattice rearrangement that results in an ordered structure which has a higher solubility than the non-HHT alloys. Using a combination of cluster expansion methods developed for predicting hydrogen permeability of disordered alloys and Monte Carlo methods, we predicted the extent of H induced lattice rearrangement in Pd₉₆Au₄ and Pd₈₅Au₁₅ alloys. We also predicted the solubility, diffusivity and permeability of these rearranged phases and found that their H permeability is higher than the non-rearranged phases. Our models capture the H-induced lattice rearrangement and provide useful insight of the conditions where this phenomenon is significant. Using the tools developed in this work, similar alloys that have a tendency to undergo lattice rearrangement that results in enhanced H permeability can be identified. Ph. D...|$|R
