2500|$|The New York Times (NYT) {{described}} Obama's {{decision to}} delay the employer mandate as a [...] "self-inflicted wound" [...] which Republicans saw as an opportunity. [...] The NYT suggested that a Republican strategy might begin by having <b>multiple</b> <b>votes</b> - one on affirming/legalizing President Obama's decision {{to delay the}} employer mandate (which Democrats would back) and then one on delaying the individual mandate (which Democrats might now have difficulty voting against). [...] The Obama Administration's response to the criticism about this issue was seen as not very strong; the Administration refused to send a representative to a hearing about the matter being held at the House of Representatives.|$|E

On July 21, 1955, however, the Board of Estimate voted 10 to 6 to block Moses' park plans. Those opposed included the five borough presidents, {{as well as}} Gerosa who cast <b>multiple</b> <b>votes.</b> The two members in favor of park expansion were Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and city councilman Abe Stark, who each cast three votes. This led to a back-and-forth exchange of letters between Moses and Gerosa.

2500|$|The Poor Law Commission was {{independent}} of Parliament, but conversely, since {{none of its}} members sat in Parliament, it had no easy way of [...] defending itself against criticism in Parliament. It was recognised that individual parishes {{would not have the}} means to erect or maintain workhouses suitable for implementing the policies of [...] "no outdoor relief" [...] and segregation and confinement of paupers; consequently, the Commission was given powers to order the formation of Poor Law Unions (confederations of parishes) large enough to support a workhouse. The Commission was empowered to overturn any Unions previously established under Gilbert's Act, but only if at least two-thirds of the Union's Guardians supported this. Each Union was to have a Board of Guardians elected by rate-payers and property owners; those with higher rateable-value property were to have <b>multiple</b> <b>votes,</b> as for the Select Vestries set up under Sturges-Bourne's Acts. The Commission had no powers to insist that Unions built new workhouses (except where a majority of Guardians or rate-payers had given written consent), but they could order improvements to be made to existing ones. The Commission was explicitly given powers to specify the number and salaries of Poor Law Board employees and to order their dismissal. It could order the [...] "classification" [...] of workhouse inmates and specify the extent to which (and conditions under which) out-door relief could be given.|$|E

40|$|Weighted voting {{games are}} {{ubiquitous}} mathematical models {{which are used}} in economics, political science, neuroscience, threshold logic, reliability theory and distributed systems. They model situations where agents with variable voting weight vote in favour of or against a decision. A coalition of agents is winning {{if and only if}} the sum of weights of the coalition exceeds or equals a specified quota. We provide a mathematical and computational characterization of <b>multiple</b> weighted <b>voting</b> games which are an extension of weighted voting games 1. We analyse the structure of <b>multiple</b> weighted <b>voting</b> games and some of their combinatorial properties especially with respect to dictatorship, veto power, dummy players and Banzhaf indices. Among other results we extend the concept of amplitude to <b>multiple</b> weighted <b>voting</b> games. An illustrative Mathematica program to compute voting power properties of <b>multiple</b> weighted <b>voting</b> games is also provided. multi-agent systems; <b>multiple</b> weighted; <b>voting</b> games; game theory; algorithms and; complexity; voting power. ...|$|R

40|$|Two of the {{contentious}} problems generating crisis at election years in Nigeria {{has been the}} issue of multiple registration and <b>multiple</b> <b>voting.</b> These were discovered at the 2007 Governorship Elections in Ekiti and Osun States. These two forms of electoral malpractices were subject of litigations for years after the election and led to upturning of electoral victory of elected governors when the forensic experts tendered evidences before Electoral Petition Tribunals and later confirmed by Appeal Court. This paper therefore argued that though a step was taken by INEC in 2011 elections to guard against multiple registrations by introducing data capturing machine. This however, is not foul-proof. There are still cases of collusion by INEC Officials to frustrate efforts to guide against multiple registration and consequently, <b>multiple</b> <b>voting.</b> The position of this paper therefore is that, {{instead of waiting for}} years to prove cases of <b>multiple</b> registrations and <b>voting</b> by forensic experts hired by the political parties and their candidates, the Electoral Act can be amended to accommodate forensic investigation by finger-print experts before the declaration of election results. The investigation will however be determined by the type and scope of the election. The forensic investigation will also save the nation credibility crisis and non-violent conduct of election. The device will sort out the wheat from chaff in term of <b>multiple</b> <b>voting.</b> The paper which traces history of electoral crisis in Nigeria and adopted documentary method concluded that it is only this technological/ICT device that can discourage <b>multiple</b> registration and <b>voting.</b> This will enhance electorate confidence in the electoral process and non-violent conduct of election...|$|R
