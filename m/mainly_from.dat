However, most are known from at least some skull bones, so known shared features come <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> the skull.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{is in the}} {{oceanic climate}} zone (Köppen: Cfb ). Its weather is subject to {{low-pressure}} systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year.

Of the 23 pilots that {{passed through the}} squadron, four were killed and one captured. The squadron lost nine aircraft, and 38 others suffered damage, <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> anti-aircraft fire. The squadron was released from RAF control on 16 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|In Bucharest, the {{earthquake}} had an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on the Mercalli scale. It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery to collapse.

5|$|Industrial {{production}} is <b>mainly</b> <b>from</b> steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E

The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably {{as a result of a}} shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine. Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.|$|E
