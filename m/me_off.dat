He was, however, awarded the Companion of Honour in 1955, the Order of Merit in 1963 and Erasmus Prize in 1968.|$|E

A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened {{to go on a}} hunger strike unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: [...] "The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship.

500|$|... "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] is a pop ballad {{that lasts}} {{for three minutes}} and 51 seconds. The song is {{composed}} in the key of E major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute, and Spears' vocal range spans from the low-note of F3 to the high-key of D5. A NME staff reviewer said that the song takes the riff of David Bowie and Iggy Pop's [...] "China Girl" [...] (1983) and [...] "puts it over schmaltzy cocktail-hour bass and love film strings." [...] Tom Terrell of MTV, however, compared the riff to the one of A Taste of Honey's cover of [...] "Sukiyaki" [...] (1981). Terrell further commented that the [...] "Eagles-esque chorus" [...] features [...] "an '80s hair band power ballad groove" [...] where [...] "Britney soul-maxes with a vocal that channels both Stevie Wonder (via [...] "Knocks <b>Me</b> <b>Off</b> My Feet") and Shania herself." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stephen" [...] {{is a song}} {{composed}} in the dance-pop genre that also incorporates elements of country music. According to digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony-ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the key of D major and the tempo moves at 100 beats per minute at a moderately fast rate. Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of E3 to the higher note of D5. The lyrics begin with Kesha singing [...] "Stephen, Stephen, why won't you call me?." [...] The song's lyrics depict {{the tale of the}} singer stalking her then crush, Stephen, who ultimately would not call the singer. [...] "Stephen" [...] opens with layered a cappella and vocoder harmonies, later transitioning into a dominantly driven pop song. According to the singer, [...] "Stephen" [...] showcases her more vulnerable side and encompasses humor throughout its lyrics: [...] "'Stephen' shows the vulnerable side of me but it's still a funny pop song. It's me saying I'm totally obsessive and in love with this guy, but he's blowing <b>me</b> <b>off</b> in a pretty funny way." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{story has}} {{received}} {{a considerable amount of}} acclaim from reviewers. GamePro notes that [...] "the intense single-player campaign offers up an action packed experience that features a tremendously compelling narrative; there are moments in the game that will send chills down your spine." [...] GameSpot mentioned that the fact the [...] "single-player campaign is over in a flash" [...] as the only major flaw. While IGN described the campaign as [...] "still very linear" [...] like that of its predecessors, [...] "eschewing the concept of sandbox gameplay," [...] it noted that this resulted in [...] "a much richer, more focused experience" [...] with [...] "beautifully scripted set pieces." [...] IGN's Voodoo Extreme similarly remarked that it [...] "virtually plays on a rail, but that's part of its charm." [...] In contrast to later entries in the Call of Duty franchise, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw of Zero Punctuation gave the game a positive review, praising how it [...] "never sacrifices gameplay for story, or vice versa" [...] and that it featured [...] "less of the smarmy, black-and-white, 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee' jingoism that turns <b>me</b> <b>off</b> most war games".|$|E
500|$|Watson has {{promoted}} education for girls, visiting Bangladesh and Zambia to do so. In July 2014, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador. In September that year, an admittedly nervous Watson delivered an address at UN Headquarters in New York City {{to launch the}} UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate for gender equality. In that speech she said she began questioning gender-based assumptions at age eight when she was called [...] "bossy" [...] (a trait she has attributed to her being a [...] "perfectionist") whilst boys were not, and at 14 when she was [...] "sexualised by certain elements of the media". Watson's speech also called feminism [...] "the belief {{that men and women}} should have equal rights and opportunities" [...] and declared that the perception of [...] "man-hating" [...] is something that [...] "has to stop". Watson later said she received threats within 12 hours of making the speech, which left her [...] "raging. ... If they were trying to put <b>me</b> <b>off</b> , it did the opposite". In 2015, Malala Yousafzai told Watson she decided to call herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech.|$|E
500|$|Following a Japanese tour in April 1988, Echo & the Bunnymen's lead singer, Ian McCulloch, {{announced}} that the band were going to split up. Following the announcement, McCulloch returned to the United Kingdom to visit his father who had just suffered two heart attacks but was too late as he died shortly before arriving. After five months of speculation {{as to whether the}} split up was genuine, McCulloch met with {{the other members of the}} band in September 1988 and, despite the group's attempts to change his mind, told them he was leaving the band. McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview, [...] "The last days of The Bunnymen consisted of a bunch of people who were more interested in changing oil in their cars than rock 'n' roll. That pissed <b>me</b> <b>off.</b> I was doing every sodding interview, writing sodding every song." [...] Having been persuaded by Rob Dickins at WEA that the band could still be a success in the United States, Sergeant told McCulloch that he and the other two band members, bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete de Freitas, planned to continue. After a failed attempt to record with The B-52's singers Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson, the band advertised for a full-time replacement.|$|E
