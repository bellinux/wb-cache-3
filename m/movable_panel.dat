60|$|Herr Klesmer, who {{had been}} good-natured enough to seat himself at the piano, struck a thunderous chord--but in the same instant, and before Hermione had put forth her foot, the <b>movable</b> <b>panel,</b> which was on a line with the piano, flew open on the right {{opposite}} the stage and disclosed {{the picture of the}} dead face and the fleeing figure, brought out in pale definiteness by the position of the wax-lights. Everyone was startled, but all eyes in the act of turning toward the open panel were recalled by a piercing cry from Gwendolen, who stood without change of attitude, but with a change of expression that was terrifying in its terror. She looked like a statue into which a soul of Fear had entered: her pallid lips were parted; her eyes, usually narrowed under their long lashes, were dilated and fixed. Her mother, less surprised than alarmed, rushed toward her, and Rex, too, could not help going to her side. But the touch of her mother's arm had the effect of an electric charge; Gwendolen fell on her knees and put her hands before her face. She was still trembling, but mute, and it seemed that she had self-consciousness enough to aim at controlling her signs of terror, for she presently allowed herself to be raised from her kneeling posture and led away, while the company were relieving their minds by explanation.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the nature}} of our task I must {{continue}} to give some summary idea. The forecastle was lumbered with ship's chandlery, the hold nigh full of rice, the lazarette crowded with the teas and silks. These must all be dug out; and that made but a fraction of our task. The hold was ceiled throughout; a part, where perhaps some delicate cargo was once stored, had been lined, in addition, with inch boards; and between every beam there was a <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> into the bilge. Any of these, the bulkheads of the cabins, the very timbers of the hull itself, might be the place of hiding. It was therefore necessary to demolish, as we proceeded, a great part of the ship's inner skin and fittings, and to auscultate what remained, like a doctor sounding for a lung disease. Upon the return, from any beam or bulkhead, of a doubtful sound, we must up axe and hew into the timber: a violent and--from the amount of dry rot in the wreck--a mortifying exercise. Every night saw a deeper inroad into the bones of the Flying Scud--more beams tapped and hewn in splinters, more planking peeled away and tossed aside--and every night saw us as far as ever from the end and object of our arduous devastation. In this perpetual disappointment, my courage did not fail me, but my spirits dwindled; and Nares himself grew silent and morose. At night, when supper was done, we passed an hour in the cabin, mostly without speech: I, sometimes dozing over a book; Nares, sullenly but busily drilling sea-shells with the instrument called a Yankee fiddle. A stranger might have supposed we were estranged; as a matter of fact, in this silent comradeship of labour, our intimacy grew.|$|E

5000|$|According to The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians: The {{property}} of sympathetic vibration is encountered in its direct form in room acoustics in the rattling of window panes, light shades and <b>movable</b> <b>panels</b> {{in the presence}} of very loud sounds, such as may occasionally be produced by a full organ. As these things rattle (or even if they do not audibly rattle) sound energy is being converted into mechanical energy, and so the sound is absorbed. Wood paneling and anything else that is lightweight and relatively unrestrained have the same effect. Absorptivity is at its highest at the resonance frequency, usually near or below 100 Hz.|$|R

50|$|The STP-Paxton Turbocar {{was built}} around an {{aluminum}} box-shaped backbone. The driver was {{seated on the}} right side of the backbone, while the engine, a Pratt & Whitney Canada ST6B-62 turbine engine, was mounted on the left side of the backbone. Though never successful as an automobile powerplant, the small aircraft engine it was based on would become one of the most popular turboprop aircraft engines in history. The engine drove a Ferguson 4-wheel drive system, which transmitted the power to the wheels. A torque converter eliminated the need for a clutch pedal and gearshift. The engine idled at 54% of full throttle, which meant that the driver didn't even have to press the accelerator pedal to pull away; all he had to do was ease his foot off the brake pedal. A <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> was mounted behind the cockpit, which acted as an airbrake. The suspension's coil springs were located inside the backbone and the suspension A-frames had airfoil cross-sections.

40|$|Personalized {{ventilation}} {{has great}} potential to improve inhaled air quality and to accommodate individual thermal preferences. In order to quantify these perceived benefits, a numerical method has been developed. In this method, a numerical thermal manikin (NTM), {{with the real}} geometry of a human body, is obtained by employing a laser scanning technique. When placed in a virtual environment, the thermal interactions with the environment are calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By iteration, the calculated air velocity near the body surface is fed into a sophisticated thermoregulation model developed at the University of California, Berkeley, so that the local thermal comfort in a non-uniform environment created by personalized air (PA) is rigorously investigated. In this paper, the performances of three different PV systems are investigated, namely, the desk-edge-based PV, PV using a <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> (MP), and chair-based PV. The results exhibit reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements. The three types of PV are all able to lower human exposure to ambient room pollutants and bring a “cool head” thermal condition favorable for thermal comfort. The present work illustrates that {{in the development of}} localized personal environmental control systems, an NTM coupled with a human-body thermal regulation model is a useful tool for visualizing thermal comfort and ventilation effectiveness.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} novel hybrid signal {{processing}} technique to extract information on disbond-type defects {{from a single}} B-scan {{in the process of}} non-destructive testing (NDT) of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) material using ultrasonic guided waves (GW). The selected GFRP sample has been a segment of wind turbine blade, which possessed an aerodynamic shape. Two disbond type defects having diameters of 15 mm and 25 mm were artificially constructed on its trailing edge. The experiment has been performed using the low-frequency ultrasonic system developed at the Ultrasound Institute of Kaunas University of Technology and only one side of the sample was accessed. A special configuration of the transmitting and receiving transducers fixed on a <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> with a separation distance of 50 mm was proposed for recording the ultrasonic guided wave signals at each one-millimeter step along the scanning distance up to 500 mm. Finally, the hybrid signal processing technique comprising the valuable features of the three most promising signal processing techniques: cross-correlation, wavelet transform, and Hilbert–Huang transform has been applied to the received signals for the extraction of defects information from a single B-scan image. The wavelet transform and cross-correlation techniques have been combined in order to extract the approximated size and location of the defects and measurements of time delays. Thereafter, Hilbert–Huang transform has been applied to the wavelet transformed signal to compare the variation of instantaneous frequencies and instantaneous amplitudes of the defect-free and defective signals...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the transmission of}} respiratory droplets between two seated occupants equipped with one type of personalized ventilation (PV) device using round <b>movable</b> <b>panel</b> (RMP) in an office room. The office was ventilated by three different total volume (TV) ventilation strategies, i. e. mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD) system respectively as background ventilation methods. Concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameters of 0. 8 μm, 5 μm, and 16 μm as well as tracer gas were numerically studied in the Eulerian frame. Two indexes, i. e. intake fraction (IF) and concentration uniformity index R C were introduced to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. It was found that without PV, DV performed best concern protecting the exposed manikin from the pollutants exhaled by the polluting manikin. In MV when the exposed manikin opened RMP the inhaled air quality could always be improved. In DV and UFAD application of RMP might sometimes, depending on the personalized airflow rate, increase the exposure of the others to the exhaled droplets of tracer gas, 0. 8 μm particles, and 5 μm particles from the infected occupants. Application of PV could reduce R C for all the three TV systems of 0. 8 μm and 5 μm particles. PV enhanced mixing degree of particles under DV and UFAD based conditions much stronger than under MV based ones. PV could increase the average concentration in the occupied zone of the exposed manikin {{as well as provide}} clean personalized airflow. Whether inhaled air quality could be improved depended on the balance of pros and cons of PV. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

High temperature scrub tests performed between silicon nitride wafers and carbon-silicon carbide rub surfaces revealed high friction forces and evidence of material transfer from the rub surfaces to the wafer seals. Stickage between adjacent wafers was also observed after testing. Several design changes to the wafer seals were evaluated as possible solutions to these concerns. Wafers with recessed sides were evaluated as a potential means of reducing friction between adjacent wafers. Alternative wafer materials are also being considered as a means of reducing friction between the seals and their sealing surfaces and because the baseline silicon nitride wafer material (AS 800) is no longer commercially available...|$|R
