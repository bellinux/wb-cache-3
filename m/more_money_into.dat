5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole {{serviceable}} aircraft, {{the government}} {{decided not to}} pump <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively. The carrier owed over million, despite the government having injected million into the company in its last decade of operations. The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later. The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement. Even though Virgin Nigeria suceeded Nigeria Airways, the ground facilities of the folded Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates {{about what to do}} with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the entire amount created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn't spent as it came in, the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term savings account for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style of investments and what they should be used for.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the largest}} banks, brokerages, and {{insurance}} companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> investments {{when the economy is}} doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, {{they would be able to}} do both 'savings' and 'investment' at the same financial institution, which would be able to do well in both good and bad economic times.|$|E

The number of {{enterprises}} increased from 600–700 in 1762 to over 2,000 when her reign ended. Russian agriculture grew during Catherine's reign due to the economic pressure put upon the gentry that needed more wealth in order to indulge in Western European tastes. The gentry used potentially arable land in old areas {{as well as new}} land on the peripheries of the empire. This expansion occurred during the 1780s and 90s.|$|E

The Dodgers celebrated the Golden Anniversary of Dodger Stadium, their home since 1962. It was a transitional {{year as the}} sale of the team from Frank McCourt to Guggenheim Baseball Management was not finalized until May 1. The new ownership group put their stamp on the team quickly by making a number of big trades and putting <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> the team than McCourt did. After a fast start, the team faded down the stretch and finished eight games behind the World Series Champion Giants.|$|E

The authors argue that, {{as the federal government}} allocates 400 million in new support for venture capital, it must avoid the past pitfall of using the money to meet political goals. It must embrace a system that promotes competition and performance, and work with the provinces to transform how governments support venture capital...|$|R

25|$|In {{any given}} time period, the {{government}}’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. MMT states that {{as a matter of}} accounting, it follows that government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> private bank accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via taxes than it has put back in via spending.|$|E

Under the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, the group began {{performing}} at local night clubs {{under the name}} of their gang, Inner City Posse. By late 1991, the group had invested <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> production than was covered by returns. They decided that their gangsta rap style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Bruce suggested the band instead adapt a style similar to the hallucinatory, surrealistic [...] "acid rap" [...] of fellow Detroit rapper Esham, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E
500|$|The {{national}} {{financial crisis}} reached its nadir in February 1797, when the Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold. [...] In {{an effort to}} get <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> circulation, the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities of copper coins, and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March 1797, informing him of the Government's plan. [...] Four days later, Boulton attended a meeting of the Privy Council, and was awarded a contract {{at the end of the}} month. [...] According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797, King George III was [...] "graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment of the laborious poor in the present exigency... which should go and pass for one penny and two pennies". The proclamation required that the coins weigh one and two ounces respectively, bringing the intrinsic value of the coins close to their face value. Boulton made efforts to frustrate counterfeiters. Designed by Heinrich Küchler, the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers, features difficult for counterfeiters to match. The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a half across; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet. The exact measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits. [...] Küchler also designed proportionate halfpennies and farthings; these were not authorised by the proclamation, and though pattern pieces were struck, they never officially entered circulation. [...] The halfpenny measured ten to a foot, the farthing 12 to a foot. The coins were nicknamed [...] "cartwheels", both because of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both denominations. [...] The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in copper.|$|E
2500|$|A {{considerable}} number of programs featured on Global's schedule were cancelled {{in the spring of}} 1974. By that fall, it was obvious that Global's original model was unsustainable, and it was forced to pick up a large amount of American programming to fill in the gaps. With American imports filling as much of the schedule as Canadian content rules would allow (60% Canadian overall, 50% Canadian in prime time), Global had effectively become [...] "another CTV." [...] With the exception of the nightly newscasts, few other Canadian-produced programs remained on the station, and the ones that did exist were largely criticized as cheaply-produced filler. John Spalding, the station's original program director, quit in 1975 after being unable to convince the station's owners to invest <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>into</b> higher-quality production.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, donor-advised funds (DAFs), {{historically}} {{a relatively}} minor part of American philanthropy, have taken on an outsized importance. The dramatic growth of donor-advised funds has been driven {{not only by the}} inherent attractiveness of DAFs, but also by the profit margins of the financial services industry and the donors’ financial advisors. As <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>money</b> rushes <b>into</b> DAFs – as of 2013, roughly 7 % of all charitable gifts from individuals – the operating nonprofits that supposedly are the beneficiaries of donor-advised funds are losing out. At a time of higher demand for services and reduced funding, nonprofits are looking to individual donors for financial support, but increasingly donors are diverting their gifts into DAFs. This might be acceptable if DAFs were inspiring increased charitable giving, but there is little evidence to support that claim. And, because there is no mandated spend-down requirement, far <b>more</b> <b>money</b> is flowing <b>into</b> donor-advised funds than is flowing out into the charitable community. Wise public policy demands that Congress act to mandate an account-by-account spend-down of donor-advised funds within 15 to 20 years of the date of donation, and to prohibit private foundations from meeting their 5 % distribution requirement through grants to DAFs...|$|R
