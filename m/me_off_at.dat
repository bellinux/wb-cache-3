2500|$|The {{song was}} spoofed by Bob Rivers, as Shaggy One Handed, making a {{reference}} to the Scooby-Doo character, Shaggy Rogers. The video focused on him being caught masturbating (about the girl next door) by his mother. The song was also spoofed on Svengoolie. On The Chris Moyles Show, the song was used as a prank call with Shaggy trying to book a taxi, with the final line being [...] "Can you drop <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1?, 97 to 99 FM".|$|E
2500|$|West {{earned her}} first Top 40 hit in 1963 with [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Off</b> <b>at</b> the Corner", {{followed}} {{a year later}} by the Top Ten duet with Jim Reeves [...] "Love Is No Excuse". Also in 1964, she auditioned for RCA Victor producer Chet Atkins, {{the architect of the}} Nashville sound, who agreed to produce her composition [...] "Here Comes My Baby". The single made Dottie the first female country artist to win a Grammy Award (Best Female Country Vocal Performance), leading to an invitation to join the Grand Ole Opry. [...] "Here Comes My Baby" [...] reached No.10 on Billboard Magazine's Country charts in 1964. After releasing the Here Comes My Baby LP in 1965, Dottie and producer Chet Atkins reunited the following year for Suffer Time, which generated her biggest hit yet in [...] "Would You Hold It Against Me". In 1967, the West/Atkins pairing issued three separate albums: With All My Heart and Soul (featuring the No.8 smash [...] "Paper Mansions"), Dottie West Sings Sacred Ballads and I'll Help You Forget Her.|$|E
60|$|He held <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> arm's length, {{the old-time}} affection beaming from his {{handsome}} face.|$|E
6000|$|... "But let <b>me</b> start <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once," [...] {{returned}} Peter, eagerly. [...] "I've {{a pretty}} good guess, from your description, where you left them. Besides, the gale is not so bad now. After an hour's sleep {{you will be able}} to start fresh, maybe overtake me. Jess will be sure to waken you in--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eight. For {{a hundred}} and three. I was on the spot. Young Jackson caught a hot one <b>off</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> third man. That kid's good." ...|$|R
60|$|At last, in the exigency {{to which}} I was reduced, I {{proposed}} to Toby {{that he should}} endeavour to go round to Nukuheva, and {{if he could not}} succeed in returning to the valley by water in one of the boats of the squadron, and taking <b>me</b> <b>off,</b> he might <b>at</b> least procure me some proper medicines, and effect his return overland.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes! Utterly miserable! It must {{be because}} I'm unworthy of you--unequal every way. If you think so, cast <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once. Don't be weakly merciful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wherefore dost thou desire it?" [...] inquired Hester, shrinking, {{she hardly}} knew why, from this secret bond. [...] "Why not {{announce}} thyself openly, and cast <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of {{them got}} out by the back way, and we got some of them out by ladders. The others are seeing to that. They sent <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once." ...|$|E
5000|$|According {{to sound}} man Earl Bellamy: [...] "When Judy sang to playback, {{you could never}} hear anything...She wanted <b>me</b> to start <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a full blast and then she topped that...her huge voice {{carrying}} out over the rafters. You could hear Judy clear as a bell, and she sang right with it..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} ain't very {{convenient}} {{for me to}} go to 'Frisco just now. I went to see the governor yesterday afternoon, but I couldn't get to him. I saw the secretary, and he told me I'd got to take that boat and that was all there was to it. I just had to see the governor, so I waited outside his house this morning, and when he come out I spoke to him. He didn't want to speak to me, I'll say, but I wouldn't let him shake <b>me</b> <b>off,</b> and <b>at</b> last he said he hadn't no objection to my staying here till the next boat to Sydney if the Rev. Davidson will stand for it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stopped on}} {{reaching}} the inn, {{and was on}} the point of entering and taking up my position at once, when {{it occurred to me that}} this would be a false move. It was possible that Sam would not take my departure for granted so readily as I assumed. It was Sam's way to do a thing thoroughly, and the probability was that, if he did not actually come to see <b>me</b> <b>off,</b> he would <b>at</b> least make inquiries at the station to find out if I had gone. I walked on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Tom,--who scorned {{to tell a}} lie in any matter {{concerning}} Ayala. [...] "It was me. I struck Colonel Stubbs, and he got <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> {{the police}} office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Several," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "Look here, you've {{been asking}} {{me a lot}} of questions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn't you kill <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once before I regained consciousness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}}n't stay to see <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> all. When you've put {{the box in}} the gig you must go on to Mrs. Mehan's, and {{when you come back}} you can say you'd been down to look for {{something}} that was left the day of Mary's wedding; but mind, Biddy, don't say a word about it at Mrs. Mehan's, and above all, don't mention it to Katty." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 'This morning Fräulein {{and two of}} {{the girls}} laced me in fairly easily to 14½ in... After an hour or two, I got quite used to the sensation, which, as Fräulein told me it would be, is not very unpleasant, the pain which I {{scarcely}} knew how to bear {{for an hour or so}} having quite gone. My hips and waist feel rather numb, but that, Fräulein tells <b>me,</b> will pass <b>off.</b> <b>At</b> all events, I shall have the two dresses mother promised me at Christmas if I came back with a really small waist and a good figure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Child," [...] she said, [...] "I am your aunt, the {{daughter}} of the King of Waldenburg. You, too, are of the same race. You know well that I speak the truth. How dare you talk to me of a creature like Feurgéres? You have our blood in your veins. I command you to come with <b>me,</b> and break <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once and for ever these remarkable associations. You shall make what return you will later on to those whom you may think"--she darted a contemptuous glance at me--"have been your friends. But from this moment I claim you. Come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so they had, and divil a bit could I {{find where}} it had gone to. As I was about the first man hit, they carried <b>me</b> <b>off</b> the field <b>at</b> once, and {{put me in a}} waggon and, {{as soon as it was}} full, I was taken down to Salamanca. I only stopped there three weeks, and I have been here now more than two months, and my leg is all right again. But I am a lop-sided creature, though it is lucky that it is my left arm and leg that have gone. I was always a good hopper, when I was a boy; so that, if this wooden thing breaks, I think I should be able to get about pretty well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I; and not {{disposed}} {{to show the}} satisfaction I felt on this point, I, yielding to the whim of the moment, took up the subject as though I considered myself aggrieved rather than benefited by what had been done. [...] "Yes--thanks to you, I am. Crimsworth turned <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a minute's notice, owing to some interference of yours at a public meeting, I understand." ...|$|E
60|$|An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in {{his usual}} garb and style, was seated in my private room at the hotel. His {{explanation}} of his sudden and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding {{that he could get}} away from London, he determined to head <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the next obvious point of my travels. In the disguise of a workingman he had sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{she cried}} in horror into the sleep {{that was now}} {{mounting}} my body like a cloud, [...] "oh!" [...] Her hand swept out blindly in my direction as if to fend <b>me</b> <b>off.</b> <b>At</b> best my balance was insecure; and though the velvet petals of her rose scarcely grazed my cheek, the insane glaze of my mind was already darkening, I toppled and fell in a heap beside her plate.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is true,' said Lucy, {{sitting down}} by her. 'Perhaps I thought I did, {{but if the}} other had ever been as much to me, I could never have used him as I did! Oh, Honor, {{when a person is}} made of the stuff I am, {{it is very hard to}} tell which is one's heart, and which is one's flirting-machine! for the other thing does {{simulate}} all the motions, and feel real true pain! But I know now that Mr. Pendy was safe in my rear heart of hearts all the time, though I never guessed it, and thought he was only a sort of father; but you see that was why I was always in awe of getting under Robert's dominion, and why I survived his turning <b>me</b> <b>off,</b> and didn't <b>at</b> all wish him to bring it on again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get <b>off</b> from <b>me!</b> Get <b>off</b> from my feet, I say!" [...] cried {{an excited}} voice. [...] "What in the Sky {{do you mean}} by sitting on my feet? Get <b>off!</b> Get <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once!" ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{discovered}} James Darren around 1955, when he {{was about}} 19, recognizing his talent when he contacted her based on the recommendation of a photographer's secretary, Yvonne Bouvier, in 1959. Darren recalls:"I was studying acting in New York City with Stella Adler. I'd been studying with her for a couple of years.... Bouvier set up a meeting between me and Joyce Selznick, who worked for Screen Gems. I went down to 1650 Broadway, the Brill Building. On my way to the meeting with Joyce, we just happened to get on the elevator at the same time. She kept staring at me. I never met her. She never met <b>me.</b> We got <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the same floor and walked to the same office. That was our meeting. Joyce brought me over to Columbia Pictures about a week later and got me a contract there." ...|$|R
6000|$|At Fiume, {{when the}} train slowed down, I saw Rupert waiting on the [...] platform. He looked magnificent, towering over {{everybody}} there like [...] a giant. He is in perfect health, and seemed glad to see me. He [...] took <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once on an automobile to a quay where an electric [...] launch was waiting. This took us on board a beautiful big [...] steam-yacht, which was waiting with full steam up and--how he got [...] there I don't know--Rooke waiting at the gangway.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{called us}} fools," [...] the man explained, [...] "and for 'most a minute the skipper {{was going to}} take the axe to him. Then he hove it at the mate for being scared instead, and they all went down together, and I heard them light the stove. After that I went back and dropped off to sleep, and the skipper sent <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> sun-up to fetch the stranger's clothes. We set him ashore as soon as he'd got some breakfast into him." ...|$|E
60|$|Next, as I lay still, two {{men took}} the {{stretcher}} and carried <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> a slow pace, under Jack's direction. They walked single-file along the line, and {{turned down a}} rough road that led off near a river. I didn't ask where they were going: I was too weak and feeble. At last {{they came to a}} house, a small white wooden cottage, very colonial and simple, but neat and pretty. There was a garden in front, full of old-fashioned flowering shrubs; and a verandah ran round the house, about whose posts clambered sweet English creepers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, then," [...] said Nod, {{starting}} {{up out of}} his bed, [...] "I must be off to look for them. Their Little Horses ran faster than mine. And mine, he was a coward, and nibbled my sore shoulder to make me loose hold. But he could not buck or scrape <b>me</b> <b>off,</b> witch-hare, tried he never so hard. I must be <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once to look for my brothers. If they are dead, then I die too." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} something happened,--I do {{not know}} what, to this day. I heard a short, sharp cry behind me, a fall, and turning saw an awful face rushing upon me,--not human, not animal, but hellish, brown, seamed with red branching scars, red drops starting out upon it, and the lidless eyes ablaze. I threw up my arm to defend myself from the blow that flung me headlong with a broken forearm; and the great monster, swathed in lint and with red-stained bandages fluttering about it, leapt over me and passed. I rolled over and over down the beach, tried to sit up, and collapsed upon my broken arm. Then Moreau appeared, his massive white face all the more terrible for the blood that trickled from his forehead. He carried a revolver in one hand. He scarcely glanced <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but rushed <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once {{in pursuit of the}} puma.|$|R
6000|$|All that I write, then, is {{an attempt}} only to tell, not to explain. I realize that {{sometimes}} I was pretending things, yet {{did not know that}} I was pretending; that often I acted with no more conscience or consciousness, maybe, than has a carrion crow that picks out the eyes of a lamb, or a flower that draws in its petals at noon. Yet I know--know absolutely, that I was, and am, responsible not only for myself, but for everything. For my whole world. And I cannot explain this either. At times, as if to free myself, I had to stare at what appalled me. I am sure, for instance, that Mrs Monnerie never dreamed that her mention of Mr Crimble sent <b>me</b> <b>off</b> in fancy <b>at</b> the first opportunity to that woeful outhouse in his mother's garden to look in on him there--again. But I did so look at him, and was a little more at peace with him after that. Why, then, cannot I be at peace with one who loved me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Circumstances {{have always}} {{deprived}} {{me of the}} happiness of experiencing the tenderness and sympathy of your sex, Miss Effingham, and have thrown me more exclusively among the colder and ruder spirits of my own. My mother died {{at the time of}} my birth, thus cutting <b>me</b> <b>off,</b> <b>at</b> once, from one of the dearest of earthly ties. I am not certain that I do not exaggerate the loss in consequence of the privations I have suffered; but, from the hour when I first learned to feel, I have had a yearning for the tender, patient, endearing, disinterested love of a mother. You, too, suffered a similar loss, at an early period, if I have been correctly informed----" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{imagined}} {{that he was a}} wearisome hypochondriac. He was really much too well-bred to be a nuisance. He had an eye for the small weaknesses of humanity. But it was a good-natured eye. He made a restful, easy, pleasant companion for the hours between dinner and bedtime. We spent three evenings together, and then I had to leave Naples in a hurry to look after a friend who had fallen seriously ill in Taormina. Having nothing to do, Il Conde came to see <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> the station. I was somewhat upset, and his idleness was always ready to take a kindly form. He was by no means an indolent man.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{thicker than}} when I {{used to know}} you, then," [...] he {{returned}} with candor. [...] "To tell the truth, Crocker, I often wish I were back at the law, and had never written a line. I am paying the penalty of fame. Wherever I go I am hounded to death {{by the people who}} have read my books, and they want to dine and wine me for the sake of showing <b>me</b> <b>off</b> <b>at</b> their houses. I am heartily sick and tired of it all; you would be if you had to go through it. I could stand a winter, but the worst comes in the summer, when one meets the women who fire all sorts of socio-psychological questions at one for solution, and who have suggestions for stories." [...] He shuddered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou art welcome, father," [...] he said; [...] "in cutting <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from earth, the Council, I see, {{does not}} wish to cut <b>me</b> <b>off</b> from God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut me off!" [...] {{said the}} branch, {{as soon as}} it could speak distinctly,--"cut <b>me</b> <b>off!</b> cut <b>me</b> <b>off!</b> and carve <b>me</b> into a figure-head for your galley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, lad; I {{am going}} after these people. They were here that evening {{when we came}} in, and as they started in a hurry half-an-hour after we landed, I cannot help {{thinking}} they saw me. It seems they had another man {{with them when they}} were here, and I expect they came here to join him. I don't know whether he left with them; my own opinion is he did not, but when Truscott saw <b>me</b> he hurried <b>off</b> <b>at</b> once to his hotel and started, leaving the other man to prevent my following them. Probably he started by the boat in the morning after them, believing the negro he had hired had done his work. At any rate I have made up my mind to follow them. I was determined to do so before; but if I hadn't been, this would have decided me. They have got a long start, but we will come up to them sooner or later.' ...|$|R
