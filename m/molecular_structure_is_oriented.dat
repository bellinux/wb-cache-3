40|$|A new {{hydrazide}} derivative N′-(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) - 2 -fluorobenzohydrazide was synthesized and {{characterized by}} NMR and IR spectroscopy. The <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> also studied by X-ray diffraction, {{and the results}} of the optimized <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>are</b> presented and compared with density functional methods with 631 -G basis set.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using diffuse reflectance {{in combination with}} Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to obtain information on cured graphite fiber reinforced polymeric matrix resin composites was investigated. Several graphite/epoxy, polysulfone, and polyimide composites exposed to thermal or radiation environments were examined. An experimental polyimide-sulfone adhesive tape was also studied during processing. In each case, significant changes in resin <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> observed due to environmental exposure. These changes in <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>were</b> correlated with previously observed changes in material properties providing new insights into material behavior...|$|R

40|$|A {{completely}} new approach is under development for estimating properties of chemical compounds from their <b>molecular</b> <b>structure.</b> The approach <b>is</b> based on viewing each compound as {{a hybrid of}} several different <b>molecular</b> <b>structures.</b> The <b>molecular</b> <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> generated and manipulated by symbolic computation methods.

40|$|An X-band {{traveling}} wave maser of the folded-comb type is presented, with two figure-eight coils for gain and bandwidth control. One figure-eight coil covers the full lengths of the comb structure for bandwidth adjustment of an external magnetic field. The other coil covers a central {{half of the}} comb structure for independent gain adjustment of the external magnetic field. The half of each figure-eight coil at the turn around end of the comb <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> <b>oriented</b> to aid the external magnetic field, and the half of each coil at the input-output end of the comb <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> <b>oriented</b> to buck the external magnetic field.

25|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> identified by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Rosalind Franklin.|$|R
40|$|Liver glycogen, {{a complex}} {{branched}} polymer of glucose, {{plays a major}} role in controlling blood-sugar levels. Understanding its <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> important for diabetes, especially since it has been found that this <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> more fragile in diabetic than in healthy mouse liver. However, there are differences in metabolic processes between liver lobes, which would be expected to be reflected in differing glycogen <b>molecular</b> <b>structures.</b> This <b>structure</b> <b>was</b> examined for separated lobe regions in rat livers, using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. The results show that the SEC weight distribution of glycogen, and the molecular weight distribution of individual branches (chains), from different lobes are similar. This shows that (a) molecular structural characterization of glycogen from whole-liver biopsy is representative (which is convenient because the commonest animal model for diabetes is the mouse, whose livers are very small), and (b) the fact that <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> conserved (regulated) in different lobes suggests that this structure plays an important role in blood-sugar regulation...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{modeling}} {{for drug}} discovery includes analyses of three-dimensional structures of molecules. One-dimen-sional character strings of <b>molecular</b> <b>structures</b> <b>are</b> translated into three-dimensional structures of molecules. This three-dimensional <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> the principal basis of docking simulations for the structure-based drug design. 1 - 3 Researchers fit together such three-dimensional structures {{in terms of}} their shapes, features, and thermodynamic stabilities. The promise of molecular docking <b>is</b> that the <b>structure</b> of the receptor will provide a template for the discovery of novel ligands, dissimilar to those previously known. 4 There have been many researches and tools for molecular modeling.

50|$|The {{problem of}} {{pairwise}} additivity is completely avoided in the Lifshitz theory, where the <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> ignored and {{the bodies are}} treated as continuous media.

50|$|Specifically, PD1 is an {{endogenous}} stereoselective {{lipid mediator}} classified as an autocoid protectin. Autacoids are enzymatically derived chemical mediators with distinct biological activities and <b>molecular</b> <b>structures.</b> Protectins <b>are</b> signaling molecules that are produced enzymatically from unsaturated fatty acids. Their <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized by the}} presence of a conjugated system of double bonds. PD1, like other protectins, is produced by the oxygenation of the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and it is found in many tissues, such as the retina, the lungs and the nervous system.|$|R

[...] The three volumes of Molecular Spectra and <b>Molecular</b> <b>Structure</b> <b>were</b> re-issued by Krieger in 1989, including extensive new footnotes by Herzberg. Volume IV of the series, [...] "Constants of diatomic molecules" [...] is purely a reference work, a compendium of known spectroscopic constants (and therefore a bibliography of molecular spectroscopy) of diatomic molecules up until 1978.|$|R

50|$|The SRS {{is used to}} {{generate}} permanent, unique identifiers for substances in regulated products, such as ingredients in drug and biologic products. The SRS uses <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> and descriptive information to define a substance and generate the UNII. The primary means for defining a substance <b>is</b> by its <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> as represented on a two-dimensional plane.

30|$|One {{important}} aspect is the substance identity. Generally, for a well-defined substance under REACH, the substance identity is defined solely by the <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> and chemical composition. Bulk and nanomaterial {{with the same}} <b>molecular</b> <b>structure</b> <b>are</b> chemically identical. This means that the bulk form and nanoform of a substance generally have to be registered in the same dossier. Therefore, the concept follows the characteriser approach.|$|R
