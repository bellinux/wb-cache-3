50|$|Dociostaurus maroccanus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>locust,</b> is a grasshopper in the insect family Acrididae. It is found in northern Africa, southern and eastern Europe and western Asia. It lives a solitary existence but in some years numbers increase sharply, it becomes gregarious and congregates to form swarms which can cause devastation in agricultural areas.|$|E
40|$|The gut {{bacterial}} {{community from}} four species of feral locusts and grasshoppers {{was determined by}} {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene fragments. The study revealed an effect of phase polymorphism on gut bacterial diversity in brown locusts from South Africa. A single bacterial phylotype, consistent with Citrobacter sp. dominated the gut microbiota of two sympatric populations of <b>Moroccan</b> and Italian <b>locusts</b> in Spain. There was evidence for Wollbachia sp. in the meadow grasshopper caught locally in the UK. Sequence analysis of DGGE products did not reveal evidence for unculturable bacteria and homologies suggested that bacterial species were principally Gammapoteobacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae similar to those recorded previously in laboratory reared locusts.

50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>locust</b> extends from the Canary Islands and Madeira {{in the west to}} Kazakhstan and Afghanistan in the east. In Africa it is found in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. In Europe it is found in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy and the Balkan peninsula. It is also found in the Middle East and Central Asia.|$|E
50|$|This locust has {{traditionally}} been considered a serious agricultural threat. Its large numbers, voracious appetite, ability to eat almost all forms of vegetation and ability to migrate in swarms make it a feared pest. However, outbreaks of swarming activity have diminished {{in recent years and}} in some areas the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>locust</b> has become rare. This is particularly noticeable in European countries where the species no longer seems to be an economic threat while in north Africa and parts of central Asia it still flourishes. These alterations in population dynamics may be due to a change in climatic conditions with a decrease in spring rainfall. A more important factor may be the increase of cropland at the expense of grassland, since the female needs undisturbed soil in which to deposit her eggs. At the other extreme, overgrazing and deforestation in some areas provide a favourable environment for the species to thrive and remain destructive.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study in}} Iran in 1956 {{it was found that}} {{outbreaks}} of locusts originated from just eight distinct areas. All these districts were in mountain foothills that had been forested or in other rolling foothills. In all cases the vegetation consisted of annual grasses or shrub steppe communities with annual grasses and dwarf shrubs. There was a good supply of green food in winter which increased the longevity and fertility of the females. Outside these districts, the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>locust</b> had solitary populations whereas inside them, in some years, the locust became gregarious. The locust needs firm, bare soil for egg laying and when they hatch, the nymphs move to progressively taller and more dense vegetation. These districts principally had rainfall in winter and early spring, averaging 250 to 350 millimetres. The temperature averaged about 17 Â°C in the months immediately before and after egg laying. The sites were heavily grazed by sheep and goats, especially in winter. The conclusion of the study was that quite specific climate, vegetation, and topographical conditions were needed for breeding to take place.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Moroccan</b> <b>locust</b> {{lives in}} arid areas between 500 and 1000 metres above sea level. It breeds in {{undisturbed}} soil {{and does not}} reproduce in arable fields. The optimum rainfall for development in the months from March to May is one hundred millimetres. If the spring is unusually hot and precipitation is low, and especially {{if it is the}} second dry spring in succession, numbers of young locusts can increase dramatically. Mass outbreaks of nymphs occur and destroy the vegetation where they hatch. From the second instar stage onwards, the hoppers aggregate and the population density can reach several thousand nymphs per square metre. The hoppers move downhill to fertile regions damaging crops as they go. Multiple generations can be present, and the numbers of adults can build up rapidly, reaching 300 individuals per square metre in extreme cases. Winged adults take flight en masse at low altitudes, travelling at eight to ten metres per second and may migrate sixty kilometres during the season. Numbers begin to diminish in June when the vegetation is also declining.|$|E
40|$|The Carpathian Basin {{was until}} the middle of the 20 th century an {{important}} territory for locust outbreaks. This paper combines the earlier data and our own research related to the present status of three most important locust species of the period mentioned. It appeared that during the 19 th and 20 th centuries populations of Calliptamus italicus and Dociostaurus maroccanus generally decreased, and even Locusta migratoria lost its earlier economic importance in the Carpathian Basin/Hungary. In any case, the extensive and deleterious outbreaks known especially from the 14 th to 19 th centuries seem to stop in the Carpathian Basin. Beside the large waterway-regulations (= drying up the Pannonian Plain), the rapidly intensified agriculture might be the main reason for stopping of the earlier deleterious outbreaks and damages caused by L. migratoria, however, the desiccation of the Pannonian Plain temporarily created favourable habitats for extensive outbreaks of D. maroccanus and other xerothermous (e. g. C. italicus) species. Environmental changes evoked by a new trend in the agricultural land-use, in making extended surfaces of uncultivated (set-aside) lands/fallows, seem to provide suitable habitats for scattered local outbreaks in the future too, {{as was the case in}} 1993 with the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>locust</b> in Central Hungary...|$|E
