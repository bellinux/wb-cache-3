5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock {{enrolled}} in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed {{playing the role of}} a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E

25|$|Morricone {{never left}} Rome to compose his music and {{never learned to}} speak English. But given that the {{composer}} has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, {{and then as a}} composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> standing in the eyes of Hollywood.|$|E

25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E

Vashyron is voiced by Nolan North in English and Ken Narita in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) panics in the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff office, as his {{autobiography}} {{is due to}} a publisher the next day but he has not yet begun to write it. He begs Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) and James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) to help him get it done in time, and they agree. They run into a problem when Tracy cannot remember <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own life, and turn to English Wikipedia for the answers. They work non-stop on the project, until Tracy remembers that there never was an actual publisher for the book, thus shutting the project down.|$|E

[...] He was initially contracted as a guest star with [...] "potential regular status in [...] future", which came to fruition. [...] At first, Leung struggled with the show's secrecy, not knowing <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> character's background or motivations, but he found some understanding with his character's clothing. [...] Costume designer Roland Sanchez based Miles's wardrobe choice after that of The Rolling Stones member Keith Richards; specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest. [...] Sanchez believed that Miles fit the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cropped the sleeves and added a hood.|$|E
500|$|Eckhart {{has talked}} <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> beliefs, {{his way of}} life, and his future career ambitions. Talking to Entertainment Weekly {{regarding}} his Mormon faith, he revealed, [...] "I'm sure people think I'm a Mormon, but I don't know that I'm a Mormon anymore, you know? To be honest, to be perfectly clear, I'd be a hypocrite if I did say that I was, just because I haven't lived that lifestyle for so many years." [...] In other interviews, {{he has said that}} hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time. In an interview with Parade magazine, Eckhart revealed that before he discovered acting, he wanted to become a songwriter.|$|E
500|$|In Japanese animations, Sasuke is {{voiced by}} Noriaki Sugiyama. At the {{beginning}} of the Part I anime, Sugiyama found it difficult to voice Sasuke because he did not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> personality. Sugiyama felt that he started to better understand and portray the character when Sasuke encountered his brother Itachi. Sugiyama also read the manga and became particularly interested in Sasuke's development once the character left Konohagakure. Sugiyama even wanted to redo some scenes, including Sasuke's departure from Konohagakure. In the Behind the Scenes of Uchiha, a feature centered around Sasuke's and Itachi's backstory, Sugiyama noted that he got emotional during sixth season's recording sessions , when Sasuke learned the truth about his brother's role in the massacre of the Uchiha clan.|$|E

Malseed writes, [...] "For Genia, the {{decision}} ultimately came down to Sergey. While her husband admits he was thinking as <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own future as his son's, for her, 'it was 80/20' about Sergey." [...] They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, {{and as a result}} his father was [...] "promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother also had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. During this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.|$|E

2500|$|The Last Holiday is as <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> {{life as it}} {{is about}} context, the theater of late 20th century America — from Jim Crow to the Reagan '80s and from Beale Street to 57th Street. The {{narrative}} is not, however, a rise-and-fall retelling of Scott-Heron's life and career. It doesn't connect all the dots. It moves off-the-beat, at its own speed ... This approach to revelation lends the book an episodic quality, like oral storytelling does. It winds around, it repeats itself.|$|E

[...] Although John Nyren was at pains to show undue respect, almost amounting to obsequious fawning where social superiors were concerned (especially the unsavoury Lord Frederick Beauclerk), he tells of his father [...] "maintaining an opinion with great firmness against the 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio Mann and being proved right". [...] But while his father reportedly stood up to aristocrats, John Nyren himself resorted to [...] "social grovelling" [...] via the addition to his text of [...] "ingratiating remarks addressed to the great and powerful".|$|E

2500|$|Strangely, Luther {{does not}} seem to have known <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> older brother, Daniel Isaac Gotwald. He was a printer who died in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1849 when he was 21. Luther says of him that [...] "He was, I think, noble and upright in all his deportment, respectful and happy in his disposition, and a genial {{favorite}} among all who knew him. [...] At the time of his death, several of the Cincinnati papers spoke very favorably of him." [...] Luther admits that he does not even know whether Daniel Isaac was a Christian, but continued that [...] "Fervently do I hope that he was, for it is a dreadful thought that any of those we love, and especially one so dear as a Brother, should be called unprepared, from time into eternity, there to suffer forever for the misdeeds of this life." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II (1942–1945) he was interned {{in various}} Japanese {{concentration}} camps such as Tjimahi and the infamous Changi Prison. Imprisoned in Tjimahi Tjalie Robinson kept on writing. He {{was part of}} a small group of intellectuals (including Leo Vroman and Rob Nieuwenhuys) that engaged in cultural activity. For a while Tjalie Robinson was even able to print a camp periodical named 'Kampkroniek' (Camp Chronicles) and a pamphlet named 'Onschendbaar Domein' (Inviolable Domain). The gruesome war experience obviously influenced his life philosophy, nevertheless Tjalie Robinson never wrote <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> years as a POW. On occasion he tried to reflect with an uneasy mix of shame and fascination: [...] "Sometimes I reluctantly look back at that time I am supposed to hate. (60 years and 60 thousand emotions packed into 1 night.) Surrounded by life-threatening situations and you know your alone against Fate. Fight, Johny Brown, fight. Ulcers, malaria, diphtheria, bullits and landmines. [...] Knowing physical exhaustion, the stench of swamps, the rattling of snakes, anachoic hunting grounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barry {{attended}} LeMoyne–Owen College, in Memphis, {{graduating in}} 1958. In his junior year, the racial injustices {{he had seen}} started to come together. He and his friends went to a segregated fairground in Memphis, and went at a time reserved for whites, {{because they wanted to}} see the science exhibit. When they were close to the exhibit, a policeman stopped them and asked them to leave. Barry and his friends left without protest. At that time, Barry did not know <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> race, or why they were treated poorly, but he resented the incident. Barry became more active in the NAACP chapter at LeMoyne-Owens, serving as president. It is sometimes said that his ardent support of the Civil Rights Movement earned him the nickname [...] "Shep", in reference to Soviet politician Dmitri Shepilov, and then Barry began using Shepilov as his middle name. But Barry stated in his autobiography that he chose the name with regard to his middle initial S, which had initially stood for nothing, after having found Shepilov's name in newspapers: [...] "I had picked out “Shepilov” as a middle name {{because it was the only}} one that I knew and liked".|$|E
