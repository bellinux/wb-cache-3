40|$|Parenting a {{child with}} autism may {{differentially}} affect <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> Existing studies of mother–father differences often ignore the interdependence of data within families. We investigated gender differences within-families using multilevel linear modeling. <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> of children with autism (161 couples) reported on their own well-being, and their child’s functioning. Mothers {{reported higher levels of}} distress compared with <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> child behavior problems predicted psychological distress for both <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> We found little evidence of child functioning variables affecting <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> differently. Gender differences in the impact of child autism on parents appear to be robust. More family systems research is required to fully understand these gender differences and the implications for family support...|$|R

5|$|Charles Spencer Chaplin {{was born}} on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no {{official}} record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At {{the time of his}} birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|James Kaliokalani {{was born}} on May 29, 1835. His father High Chief Caesar Kapaʻakea and mother High Chiefess Analea Keohokālole were advisors to the reigning king Kamehameha III. His mother was the {{daughter}} of ʻAikanaka and Kamaʻeokalani while his father was the son of Kamanawa II (half-brother of ʻAikanaka) and Kamokuiki. From his parents, he descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, the royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> was one of the royal twins alongside Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Kaliokalani's family were collateral relations of the House of Kamehameha. Another relative of the family was the High Chiefess Kapiʻolani who plucked the ʻōhelo berries and openly defied the goddess Pele as a dramatic demonstration of her new faith in Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E

The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by {{the crew of the}} show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{enrolled}} at the recently established University College Dublin (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken was published in The Fortnightly Review; {{it was his first}} publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper, United Irishman, in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and Irish-speaking scholar living with his <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father,</b> six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.|$|E

40|$|The grief {{experienced}} by <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> when {{their child is}} diagnosed with a life threatening chronic-illness was investigated in order to validate the presence of grief in these parents {{and look at the}} factors that influence it. More specifically, I was interested in whether the grief experience differed for <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> the impact that perceptions and coping have on both these gender differences in grief and on grief in general. The particular population investigated in this study were parents of children with Cystic Fibrosis. Participants were recruited through questionnaires randomly sent out by the National Cystic Fibrosis Association. In all, 37 <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> 15 <b>fathers</b> took part. Results not only confirmed presence of grief in these parents but also indicated that this grief differs for <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers,</b> with <b>mothers</b> reporting significantly higher levels of physical distress. In line with the literature no gender differences were found in regards to perception of impact parents felt their child's chronic-illness had had on their lives. Contrary to what was expected, however, no differences were found amongst the coping strategies used by <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> In regards to the question of which factors have the greatest impact on the grief {{experienced by}} <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> combined, the coping strategy of self-blame was found to be the most important, followed closely by negative perceptions.
