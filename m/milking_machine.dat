25|$|Mechanically, {{a breast}} pump is {{analogous}} to a <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> used in commercial dairy production. A misconception is that the breast pump suctions milk out of the breast. A breast pump's job is to trigger the milk ejection response or letdown. Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. The breast pump is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|E
25|$|Milking is now {{performed}} {{almost exclusively}} by machine, though human technicians are still essential on most facilities. The most common <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> {{is called a}} cluster milker. This milker consists of four metal cups—one per teat—each lined with rubber or silicon. The cluster is attached to both a milk collection system and a pulsating vacuum system. When the vacuum is on, it pulls air from between the outer metal cup and the liner, drawing milk out of the teat. When the vacuum turns off, it gives the teat an opportunity to refill with milk. In most milking systems, a milking technician must attach the cluster to each cow, but the machine senses when the cow has been fully milked and drops off independently.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her sister}} died of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Currie founded {{a group in}} New Zealand called Mothers Against Genetic-Engineering in Food and the Environment (also known as MADGE), which soon had {{thousands}} of members. Currie described this group as a [...] "rapidly growing network of politically non-aligned women who are actively resisting the use of genetically-engineered material in our food and on our land". An advert for this group featuring {{a young woman with}} four breasts hooked up to a <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> became famous after appearing on billboards across New Zealand. Bailey and Currie split up in 2003, and are now divorced. They both left New Zealand to live separately in Britain, but are still close friends. In 2011, Currie married Jimmy Cauty (formerly of The KLF) and as of then gained a qualification in upholstery and continues to produce visual art under the pseudonym [...] "Miss Pokeno".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the parlors’ throughput for dairy ewes and influencing factors in some European countries and in Greece. A great progress was done in this direction with the simultainous improvement of the animals’ milkability, the technological characteristics of <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> and the technical knowledge provided to the farmers. Nowadays the average parlors’ throughput for the “Casse” system <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> is 160 - 200 ewes/milker/h, while for the “Carrousel” type <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> it is 200 - 280 ewes/milker/h. In the case of installation of the automatic cup removal system the parlors’ throughput ranges between 300 - 400 ewes/milker/h. In Greece, the average throughput for the “Casse” system parlors was found to range from 59 to 127 ewes/milker/h, while for the “Carrousel” type <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> was found around 90 - 100 ewes/milker/h...|$|R

2500|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{has been}} noted for its racy humor. Adults made up more than one-fifth of the {{audience}} for the show during its run. The series contained numerous adult innuendos, such as Rocko's brief stint as a telephone operator in the episode [...] "Canned": the instructions {{on the wall behind}} him helpfully remind all employees to [...] "Be Hot, Be Naughty, and Be Courteous" [...] while he flatly repeats [...] "Oh baby" [...] into the receiver. Joe Murray noted that the season one segment [...] "Leap Frogs" [...] received [...] "some complaints from some parents" [...] due to its sexual humor, leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air {{for the remainder of the}} show's run, although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons, and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix. In [...] "The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby", Heffer encounters a <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> and finds pleasure, although only his reactions are shown onscreen. According to writer/director Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer's eyes at the climactic moment. Although it clearly wasn't going to be included, they described the scene to Nickelodeon censors anyway: [...] "We described the scene, and then waited for the axe to fall, but all they said was 'can you change the hearts to stars?', we said sure, and it went in." [...] The scene, as well as a scene showing Heffer's break-up with the machine, were later removed. They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode, however. In addition, the uncut version can still be found on the VHS [...] "Rocko's Modern Life: With Friends Like These".|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time he was {{producing}} his steam cars, Reid was also developing a mechanical <b>milking</b> <b>machine.</b> Innovations included were a variable-speed pulsator and rubber cups with reinforced sections which simulated the natural sucking action of a calf. Mechanical milkers of the time were difficult to clean and therefore created a danger of contaminated milk. Reid's AWR machine was designed to be easy to clean. He founded the AWR <b>Milking</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited to produce and market the machine. He also had it patented. The first AWR machines came on the market in about 1907 and were sold as far away as Australia. The application for a patent for his machine was challenged in Australia in 1913 with the Commissioner of Patents. Reid was granted a hearing.|$|E

5000|$|The Rotolactor was {{the first}} {{invention}} for milking {{a large number of}} cows using a rotating platform. It was invented by Henry W. Jeffers. The Rotolactor was initially installed in a [...] "lactorium," [...] a building specifically designed for milking cows, in Plainsboro, New Jersey.

50|$|After European {{settlement}} of {{the area in the}} 1840s mixed farming was conducted by many landowners and leasees until the introduction of the <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> followed by a period where most farms derived a large proportion of their income from dairying.

50|$|Most milking in the {{developed}} world is done using <b>milking</b> <b>machines.</b> Teat cups are attached to the cow's teats, and then the cups alternate between vacuum and normal air pressure to extract the milk. The milk is filtered and cooled before being added to a large bulk tank of milk for storage.|$|R
25|$|The first <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> were an {{extension}} of the traditional milking pail. The early milker device fit on top of a regular milk pail and sat on the floor under the cow. Following each cow being milked, the bucket would be dumped into a holding tank. These were introduced in the early 20th century.|$|R
