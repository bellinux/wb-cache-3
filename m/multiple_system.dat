5|$|The {{most likely}} star-formation {{scenario}} for Betelgeuse {{is that it}} is a runaway star from the Orion OB1 Association.

40|$|Almost {{all young}} stars {{are found in}} <b>multiple</b> <b>systems.</b> This {{suggests}} that protostellar cores almost always fragment into multiple objects. The observed properties of <b>multiple</b> <b>systems</b> such as their separation distribution and mass ratios provide strong constraints on star formation theories. We review the observed properties of young and old <b>multiple</b> <b>systems</b> and find that the multiplicity of stars changes. Such an evolution is probably due to (a) the dynamical decay of small-N systems and/or (b) the destruction of <b>multiple</b> <b>systems</b> within dense clusters. We review simulations of the fragmentation of rotating and turbulent molecular cores. Such models almost always produce <b>multiple</b> <b>systems,</b> however the properties of those systems do not match observations at all well. Magnetic fields appear to supress fragmentation, prehaps suggesting {{that they are not}} dynamically important in the formation of <b>multiple</b> <b>systems.</b> We finish by discussing possible reasons why theory fails to match observation, and the future prospects for this field. 1.

Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} tail, Eta Serpentis, is similar to Alpha Serpentis' primary {{in that it is}} a red giant of spectral class K. This star, however, is known to exhibit solar-like oscillations over a period of approximately 2.16 hours. The other two stars in Serpens Cauda forming its asterism are Theta and Xi Serpentis. Xi, where the asterism crosses over to Mu Serpentis in the head, is a triple star system located approximately 105 parsecs away. Two of the stars, with a combined apparent magnitude of around 3.5, form a spectroscopic binary with an angular separation of only 2.2 milliarcseconds, and thus cannot be resolved with modern equipment. The primary is a white giant with an excess of strontium. Theta, forming the tip of the tail, is also a <b>multiple</b> <b>system,</b> consisting of two A-type main-sequence stars with a combined apparent magnitude of around 4.1 separated by almost half an arcminute.|$|E
5|$|The first ballast {{motor cars}} were former trailer cars {{built for the}} Central London Railway in 1900, which were {{converted}} to motor cars for trials of the first <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> {{to be used in}} Britain, and were retained for departmental use after 1903. These were followed by French and Hungarian Gate stock cars, built in 1906, which were converted in the 1920s and 1930s. The next batch consisted on 14 standard stock cars converted in 1953. Rolling stock reorganisation and replacement in the 1970s on the District and Metropolitan lines resulted in a number of surface stock cars being used for pilot motor duties. Subsequently motor cars of 1938 stock and 1960 stock were used for this purpose, and complete 4-car units of 1962 stock.|$|E
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} prion diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the prion protein, PrP; in 2015 <b>Multiple</b> <b>System</b> Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion, the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Coronae Borealis is {{a double}} star with two blue-white {{components}} 6.3arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at 100xmagnification. The primary is of magnitude5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude6.0. Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double, whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities, hence {{are assumed to be}} unrelated. The primary, Nu1 Coronae Borealis, is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, Nu2 Coronae Borealis, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30light-years away. Sigma Coronae Borealis, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726years. The fourth and fifth components are a binary red dwarf system that is 14,000AU distant from the other three stars.

25|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy can be {{explained}} as cell loss and gliosis or a proliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the central nervous system.

Recent {{studies have shown that}} the major filamentous component of glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions is alpha-synuclein. Mutations in this substance may play a role in the disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Cash was {{diagnosed}} with the neurodegenerative disease Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> atrophy; according to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to a concert audience that he had Parkinson's during a show in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997, after he nearly collapsed on stage; soon after his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager and Cash was told he had approximately 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.|$|E
25|$|The Wenshan Line was {{initially}} operated with VAL 256 trains cars, where two VAL 256 {{cars in the}} same set would share the same road number. As {{a result of this}} numbering scheme, the 102 cars of the VAL fleet have car numbers from 1 to 51. On June 2003, Bombardier was awarded a contract to supply the Neihu Line with 202 Innovia 256 train cars , to install the communications-based CITYFLO 650 moving-block ATC system to replace the fixed-block ATC system and also to retrofit the existing 102 VAL 256 cars with the CITYFLO 650 ATC system. Integration of Bombardier's trains with the existing Brown Line proved to be difficult in the beginning, with <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> malfunctions and failures during {{the first three months of}} operation. Retrofitting older trains also took longer than expected, as the older trains must undergo several hours of reliability tests during non-service hours.

40|$|It has {{now been}} known {{for over a decade}} that low-mass stars located in star-forming regions are very {{frequently}} members of binary and <b>multiple</b> <b>systems,</b> even more so than main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. This high multiplicity rate has been interpreted as the consequence of the fragmentation of small molecular cores into a few seed objects that accrete to their final mass from the remaining material and dynamically evolve into stable <b>multiple</b> <b>systems,</b> possibly producing a few ejecta in the process. Analyzing the statistical properties of young <b>multiple</b> <b>systems</b> in a variety of environments therefore represents a powerful approach to place stringent constraints on star formation theories. In this contribution, we first review a number of recent results related to the multiplicity of T Tauri stars. We then present a series of studies focusing on the multiplicity and properties of optically-undetected, heavily embedded protostars. These objects are much younger than the previously studied pre-main sequence stars, and they therefore offer {{a closer look at the}} primordial population of <b>multiple</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition to these observational avenues, we present new results of a series of numerical simulations that attempt to reproduce the fragmentation of small molecular cores into <b>multiple</b> <b>systems,</b> and compare these results to the observations. 1...|$|R

25|$|The Movie Channel traces {{its history}} to the {{development}} of Gridtronics, a pay television service which delivered videotaped movies to cable systems throughout the United States. The concept was originally developed in the late 1960s by Alfred Stern and Gordon Fuqua, both executives at <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> operator Television Communications Corporation (TVC) at the time, as part of a multi-channel service that was designed to include channels focusing on the arts, instructional programming and medical programs. The video-to-cable movie delivery concept was presented by Fuqua and Stern at the 1969 National Cable Television Association Convention. Over {{the course of the next}} several years, the two men subsequently discussed carriage agreements with other cable providers to distribute Gridtronics and engaged in discussions with various film studios to provide film content for the service. TVC was purchased by Warner Communications in 1972, and gave the service the financial funding and content that it needed to launch.|$|E
25|$|HBO {{pioneered the}} free preview concept – {{which has since}} become a {{standard}} in the pay television industry – in 1973, {{as part of a}} plan to increase subscribership of the channel. Cable providers were originally granted permission to carry HBO on a local origination channel in order for those who are not subscribers the ability to view the channel for a limited number of days; with the advent of digital cable and satellite, providers now unencrypt the designated slots of each HBO channel during preview periods. Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers to subscribe to the service. Although participation was voluntary, preview events are carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number of providers and the providers that choose to offer the event varies depending on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems owned by a <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> operator unless at the provider's discretion); HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film).|$|E
25|$|Construction of SkyTrain fare {{gates was}} {{completed}} in May 2014 but they remained unclosed until April 2016 owing to <b>multiple</b> <b>system</b> problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued {{to pass through the}} gates into the stations' fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their Compass Cards to the fare gates to tap in or out. Full implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with Compass Cards when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a tap-out was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit usage patterns. The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.|$|E
