40|$|The {{maintenance}} optimization {{criteria used}} {{in most of}} the maintenance optimization models are not addressing the business specific context of a company. Mostly only cost is taken into account and sometimes availability of the equipment. Safety only comes into the picture in very specific cases, like for example nuclear power plants. But there is never a clear proof that these criteria are the real objectives that need to be optimized to get to the optimal maintenance strategy. Moreover, there does not exist a clear cut method to determine which optimization criteria are important in certain environments, which makes it difficult to determine business specific maintenance optimization criteria. This can lead to suboptimal solutions to a maintenance optimization problem. Because there is no clear general method of how to perform maintenance optimization with the right objectives, all optimization models have a limited scope. The objective of this research is to develop a generic method to determine the maintenance optimization criteria for a business specific environment by applying the analytic network process (ANP). This ensures that the optimization objectives in a maintenance optimization model are the right ones, which assures that an optimal solution to the maintenance optimization problem is found. Of course it is also very important that the maintenance objectives are in line with the general business objectives of a company. The developed <b>maintenance</b> <b>criteria</b> selection tool is applied to two case studies. This selection method will be a first step in developing a generic maintenance optimization approach. After selection of the business specific <b>maintenance</b> <b>criteria,</b> these criteria and their corresponding weights will be used as objective functions in a maintenance optimization model. status: publishe...|$|E

We also repeated the residual activity calculation along the SC linac with novel experimental cross sections.

40|$|By nature, ballast {{interacts with}} railway {{concrete}} sleepers {{in order to}} provide bearing support to track system. Most train-track dynamic models do not consider the degradation of ballast over time. In fact, the ballast degradation causes differential settlement and impact forces acting on partial and unsupported tracks. Furthermore, localised ballast breakages underneath railseat increase the likelihood of centrebound cracks in concrete sleepers due to the unbalanced support under sleepers. This paper presents a dynamic finite element model of a standard-gauge concrete sleeper in a track system, taking into account the tensionless nature of ballast support. The finite element model was calibrated using static and dynamic responses in the past. In this paper, the effects of centre-bound ballast support on the impact behaviours of sleepers are highlighted.

40|$|Current <b>maintenance</b> <b>criteria</b> of {{railway wheel}} {{geometries}} consider mainly flange thickness, flange height, flange gradient, {{and depth of}} tread wear. These geometrical quantities are relatively simple to evaluate, but do not fully describe neither the worn profile nor its influence on subsequent deterioration of wheel and rail. With increased use of automatic wheel profile measurements {{there is a potential}} to plan maintenance from measures that provide a more elaborate description of the wheel profile and its operational capabilities. To this end, the paper first outlines a procedure to parametrise worn wheel profiles. This procedure is linked to multibody simulations of a curve negotiating freight wagon to identify parameters of the worn wheel profile with the largest influence on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear. To limit the number of parameter combinations, nearly orthogonal and space filling Latin hypercube sampling is employed. Regression analysis is then utilised to derive simple relationships (meta-models) between geometry parameters and deterioration measures. The derived meta-models of RCF and wear deterioration are shown to produce good agreement to results from fully fledged multibody simulations. The end result is identified geometrical quantities that provide an improved categorisation of the deteriorated wheel tread geometry for improved maintenance decisions...|$|E

Given that maintenance affects available production time and elapsed production time affects the probability of machine failure, this interdependency seems to be overlooked in the literature. This paper presents a comparative study on joint production and preventive maintenance scheduling strategies regarding flowshop problems. The sequential strategy which consists of two steps: first scheduling the production jobs then inserting maintenance operations, taking the production schedule as a strong constraint. The integrated one which consists of simultaneously scheduling both maintenance and production activities based on a common representation of these two activities. For each strategy, a constructive heuristic and two meta-heuristics are proposed: NEH heuristic, Genetic algorithm and Taboo search. The goal is to optimize an objective function which takes into account both production and <b>maintenance</b> <b>criteria.</b> The proposed heuristics have been applied to non-standard test problems which represent joint production and maintenance benchmark flowshop scheduling problems taken from Benbouzid et al.

All sites largely succeeded in achieving their original project aims, which included the use of indigenous vegetation, restoration of wildlife corridors, encouragement of passive recreation and use of regular <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Criteria</b> were used to assess the successful achievement of these aims, and `extra criteria' were developed to evaluate the success of other revegetation goals. The sites largely achieved satisfactory results for the extra criteria. Findings indicate a direct association between average leaf litter cover and average weed cover. This shows that high priority should be given to control and prevention of weeds through the application of mulch, and the development of strategies to increase leaf litter cover. Data also establishes that successful revegetation requires adequate planning, site preparation, site maintenance, consideration of landscape values and public awareness.

40|$|Abstract — Preventive {{maintenance}} (PM) {{can benefit}} systems having an increasing failure rate. However, PM is often scheduled {{in order to}} minimize the maintenance cost or to comply with production planning requirements or instruction from the equipment suppliers. Given that maintenance actions affect process time variability and resource utilization, such <b>maintenance</b> planning <b>criteria</b> may cause other adverse effects on the operational performance of the manufacturing system such as an increase in Work In Process (WIP) and cycle time. In this paper some approximate queueing models are utilize to asses the impact of PM interval on WIP. It is shown that WIP value is strongly influenced by the PM interval and that maintenance intervals corresponding to a minimum maintenance cost or minimum WIP can be quite different. This kind of analysis can help in making more informed decisions involving WIP and cost trade-offs.

40|$|The most {{important}} factors on life cost analysis and serviceability of roads and bridges are the vehicle loads and traffic volume. The traffic effect {{is related to the}} vehicle types and the load carrying capacity. In general, many countries and cities have a standard legal axle load limit. In Colombia, the Minister of Transport is responsible for establishing the maximum load in highways. The country´s economic growth has improved during the last years. Therefore, most on-road vehicles have a total weight that exceeds the legal load limit. This additional load damages the pavement structure and reduces exponentially its life span. In order to establish maintenance strategies for the city´s road network, the local government is interested in determining the actual vehicle loading. Bogota´s road network represents 35 % of the total roads built in Colombia. Taking into consideration the length of paved roads in the city (around 16. 000 km), the first step towards a life cost analysis is to select an important and representative section of the city´s road network. This study aims to evaluate the reduction in flexible pavement life of an urban highway (Boyacá Avenue) in Bogotá, due to an increase of loads.

The mission profile has usually been estimated through the use of questionnaires submitted to consumers. This procedure is time-consuming and not totally reliable due to the trustworthiness in the questionnaire compilation. In all the high power tractors numerous transducers are fitted to monitor some parameters to optimise the operation of the machines. All of these transducers are connected to an electronic central unit or with the tractor CAN-Bus. In this context, a system able to monitor the working parameters of the machines capitalising the existing transducers could represent the optimal solution for monitoring tractors distributed in different regions. The high number of signals are in any case difficult to memorise without a high quantity of memory. The goal of the paper is to define a methodology to memorise the operation parameters useful to define the mission profile of a tractor using a small memory.
