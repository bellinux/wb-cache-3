500|$|In {{writing a}} musical about film making in Hollywood, Sparks were also {{informed}} {{by their own}} past film projects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had spent six years {{trying to get their}} film Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. Based on a Japanese manga comic, the film was at one time supposed to be directed by Tim Burton. Although the music had been completed, the film failed to materialise, an experience that coloured their portrayal of the studio head in The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Earlier, Sparks had worked with French director Jacques Tati on Confusion, another film project that remained uncompleted. Having had numerous meetings with Tati {{over the course of a}} year, they were aware that, like other great European directors, Tati had been wooed by Hollywood: [...] "He showed <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Paramount", Ron Mael recalled. [...] "He said: 'Oooh! They take me to Hollywood and they have a limousine for me.' But it was kind of mocking of the whole similar situation to our fantasy Bergman thing. He could see Hollywood for what it was." ...|$|E
