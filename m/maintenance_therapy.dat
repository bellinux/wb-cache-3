Children and adults with increased bronchial secretions can benefit from routine chest therapy using the manual method, an a cappella device or a chest physiotherapy vest. Chest physiotherapy can help bring up mucous from the lower bronchial tree, however an adequate cough is needed to remove secretions. In people who have decreased lung reserve and a weak cough, use of an insufflator-exsufflator (cough-assist) device may be useful as a <b>maintenance</b> <b>therapy</b> or during acute respiratory illnesses to help remove bronchial secretions from the upper airways. Evaluation by a Pulmonology specialist however, should first be done to properly assess patient suitability.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the successes of the pilot, the {{programme}} began scale-up in 2004 and plans are in place to open an additional 1500 methadone maintenance treatment clinics for about 300,000 heroin users by 2008. A National Training Center for methadone maintenance treatment has been established in Yunnan to provide clinical and technical support. The services offered at such clinics have been broadened and provide access to other services, including HIV and hepatitis testing, antiretroviral therapy for eligible AIDS patients, group activities, and skills training for employment. The use of methadone <b>maintenance</b> <b>therapy</b> has been incorporated into the AIDS Regulations as a treatment for heroin addiction. Additionally, the requirements for entrance into methadone maintenance treatment programmes have been relaxed to encourage greater access. For example, patients are no longer required to have local residency or a previous history of internment in a detoxification centre. The programme is not without problems, however, and retaining drug users in the programme remains a critical challenge.|$|E

40|$|Ovarian cancer (OC) is {{the seventh}} most common cancer in women. Although women {{diagnosed}} with OC are usually treated frontline with platinum-based chemotherapy, {{most of them}} relapse once treatment is halted. Therefore, <b>maintenance</b> <b>therapies</b> {{have been developed to}} secure the response and delay further chemotherapy. There are two established <b>maintenance</b> <b>therapies</b> for women affected by platinum-sensitive recurrent OC: bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, and olaparib, an inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARPi). Loss-of-function mutations in genes in the homologous recombination pathway, especially BRCA 1 and BRCA 2, predict higher rates of platinum sensitivity, better overall survival (OS), and better response to PARPi in women with OC. Among patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent OC, a BRCA mutation is the first genetically defined predictive marker for targeted therapy, since these patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with a PARPi, such as olaparib. In patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent OC without a BRCA mutation, bevacizumab currently seems to be the best maintenance option. Women with OC are progressively more routinely screened for germline BRCA mutations, and the implication of somatic BRCA mutations is increasingly being recognized in OC. Therefore, the recommendations should be updated to reflect the importance of both types of mutations. Together, these data highlight the fact that treatment of recurrent OC can be optimized using genomic contributions to individualize therapy and to improve treatment response. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) are frequently colonized by macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, {{a result of}} <b>maintenance</b> macrolide <b>therapy.</b> As transmission of S. aureus between household contacts is common, we examined the prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. aureus colonization in CF patients on <b>maintenance</b> azithromycin <b>therapy</b> and their household contacts and compared this with the S. aureus macrolide resistance prevalence in the community. Patients and methods: Sixty-five CF patients on <b>maintenance</b> macrolide <b>therapy</b> and 194 household contacts were screened for S. aureus colonization by culturing sputa, cough swabs and nasal swabs. Resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and methicillin was determined by disc diffusion tests. The prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. aureus colonization in both groups was compared with figures from a nationwide study into S. aureus carriership and resistance. To assess possible transmission, genotyping of S. aureus was performed using the spa-typing method. Results: Macrolide resistance among CF patients with S. aureus colonization was 69. 6 %; 75 % of these isolates displayed lincosamide resistance too. Among household contacts, macrolide resistance preva-lence {{did not differ significantly}} from resistance prevalence in the community (9. 6 % versus 6. 3 %; P 5 0. 358).

2500|$|Second {{generation}} antipsychotics, including risperidone, {{are effective}} {{in the treatment of}} manic symptoms in acute manic or mixed exacerbations of bipolar disorder.

As <b>maintenance</b> <b>therapy,</b> risperidone is effective for the prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. [...] The long-acting injectable form of risperidone may be advantageous over long acting first generation antipsychotics, as it is better tolerated (fewer extrapyramidal effects) and because long acting injectable formulations of first generation antipsychotics may increase the risk of depression.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the utility of}} risperidone by mouth for <b>maintenance</b> <b>therapy</b> have reached varying conclusions. [...] A 2012 systematic review concluded that there is strong evidence that risperidone {{is more effective than}} all first generation antipsychotics other than haloperidol, but that evidence directly supporting its superiority to placebo is equivocal. A 2011 review concluded that risperidone is more effective in relapse prevention than other first and second generation antipsychotics with the exception of olanzapine and clozapine. A 2016 Cochrane review suggests that risperidone reduces the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, but firm conclusions are difficult to make due to very low quality evidence. Data and information are scarce, poorly reported and probably biased in favour of risperidone, with about half of the included trials developed by drug companies.
