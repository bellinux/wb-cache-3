25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of scrotal cancer detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem.

The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white <b>mineral</b> <b>oils,</b> which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|E

40|$|THE use of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> as a {{laxative}} {{has been}} reported to interfere with the absorption of vitamin A. If this is true, its use should be restricted.
