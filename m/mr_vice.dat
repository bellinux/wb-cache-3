500|$|It {{took some}} time for the {{cautious}} Obama and the blunt, rambling Biden to work out {{ways of dealing with}} each other. In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House. [...] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes, and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon. [...] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had [...] "misread how bad the economy was" [...] but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. [...] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration. On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was [...] "a big fucking deal" [...] during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied via Twitter [...] "And yes <b>Mr.</b> <b>Vice</b> President, you're right..."

[...] Biden gained a long-running alter ego persona, [...] "The President of Vice", on the satirical news site The Onion, which parodied his job title.
