5000|$|... at 2700 rpm, {{dry weight}} 439.5 lb. Similar to the IO-550-N {{but with the}} oil sump, oil suction tube and <b>mount</b> <b>legs</b> from the IO-550-B. Certified 1 March 2000.|$|R
50|$|The Che-25 has a flat sided, {{two step}} hull formed from a vacuum moulded {{fibreglass}} sandwich. The integral fin forms a cruciform tail with a swept, tapered, straight edged fin initially carried a balanced rudder, though the Che-25M variant with its higher tailplane abandoned the balance. The underwing cabin has dual controls and is entered via gull wing doors. There is a water rudder attached just aft {{of the rear}} step. The optional land undercarriage has mainwheels on mid-fuselage <b>mounted</b> <b>legs,</b> which rotate forward through 90Â° to allow water landings, and a tailwheel fixed to the water rudder.|$|R
50|$|The {{stage was}} created by 'Litestructures' and was {{constructed}} from standard components, the stage featured a 16' x 4' ramp, <b>mounted</b> on <b>leg</b> frames, a man-lift, and was set off by 21 polished handrails.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many digital pianos, {{which are}} {{designed}} for semi-permanent installation in a private home, and which have design elements which make regular transportation difficult (e.g., permanently <b>mounted</b> <b>legs,</b> modesty panel, internal power amplifier and speakers and a fixed sustain pedal), which would require a van and movers to relocate, a stage piano generally has a portable, detachable stand, no internal amp or speakers (an output jack is provided so the instrument can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier), and a detachable sustain pedal plugged into a jack. This enables a performer to remove all the detachable parts and {{makes it easier to}} transport the instrument to gigs and rehearsals.|$|R
50|$|Uchigatana {{became popular}} for several reasons, the uchigatana was more {{convenient}} to wear {{and did not}} {{get in the way}} of using a polearm as much as a tachi, also the frequency of battles fought on foot and the need for speed on the battlefield, were major reasons for the uchigatana being rapidly accepted and indicated that battlefield combat had grown in intensity. Since the uchigatana was shorter than the tachi, it could be used in more confined quarters, such as inside a building. Further, tactics of the period dictating unseating mounted soldiers by cutting off the <b>mounts</b> <b>legs,</b> hence <b>mounted</b> combat was seen as inherently disadvantageous.|$|R
50|$|Daimos Missile The missile {{launchers}} <b>mounted</b> on Daimos' <b>legs.</b> It {{is called}} Daimos Rocket in the Filipino English dub.|$|R
50|$|The Votec 252T has a cabin {{over the}} wing, with baggage space behind the seat, {{under a single}} piece canopy. It has a fixed {{tricycle}} undercarriage with fuselage <b>mounted</b> cantilever <b>legs</b> and with speed fairings on all wheels. The nosewheel casters; {{there is a small}} tailskid for rudder protection.|$|R
2500|$|The border defences were {{monitored}} {{from hundreds}} of watchtowers regularly spaced along the Schutzstreifen. Initially they were simple wooden huts <b>mounted</b> on <b>legs</b> between [...] high, usually constructed from locally sourced timber. Most were replaced with concrete watchtowers from the late 1960s onwards {{in conjunction with the}} upgrading of the border defences.|$|R
50|$|The Sprintair has fixed {{tricycle}} {{landing gear}} with main wheels on faired <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> on the lower fuselage and an unfaired, telescopic, sprung, steerable nosewheel.|$|R
50|$|The border defences were {{monitored}} {{from hundreds}} of watchtowers regularly spaced along the Schutzstreifen. Initially they were simple wooden huts <b>mounted</b> on <b>legs</b> between 4 and 12 m high, usually constructed from locally sourced timber. Most were replaced with concrete watchtowers from the late 1960s onwards {{in conjunction with the}} upgrading of the border defences.|$|R
5000|$|Gong bass drums {{are usually}} {{relatively}} large, and {{are most frequently}} found in 20" [...] and custom ordered 22" [...] diameters. Orchestral versions can be 28" [...] standard, but there are special larger ones (see below). They are often <b>mounted</b> on <b>legs</b> (much {{like that of a}} floor tom), 'rollaway' stands or ordinary tom stands/arms (though usually a pair are used for stability).|$|R
50|$|Strain gauges were <b>mounted</b> on each <b>leg</b> shock {{absorber}} {{to record the}} peak axial forces at landing impact of the spacecraft. They were designed to accept a force of approximately 800 kgf (7.8 kN).|$|R
6000|$|Look ye, carpenter, I {{dare say}} thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak {{thoroughly}} well for thy work, if, when I come to <b>mount</b> this <b>leg</b> thou makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg {{in the same}} identical place with it; that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive that old Adam away? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Committee on Gerrymander worked late, drawing {{intricate}} {{lines on}} {{a map of the}} State, and being weary sought repose in a game of poker. At the close of the game the six Republican members were bankrupt and the single Democrat had all the money. On the next day, when the Committee was called to order for business, one of the luckless six <b>mounted</b> his <b>legs,</b> and said: ...|$|R
50|$|Its {{tailwheel}} {{landing gear}} had its main <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> at the outer {{ends of the}} wing centre section at about 40% chord, retracting outwards into the outer wing panels, Each leg carried a single landing wheel.|$|R
50|$|Pinto was {{a soldier}} with the IDF's Golani Brigade during the Yom Kippur War. Injured during the battle at <b>Mount</b> Hermon, his <b>legs</b> were paralyzed and Pinto began {{practicing}} sports with the IDF Disabled Veterans' Organization.|$|R
60|$|He {{was left}} alone for {{the best part of}} an hour, only Noxton seeing to it that he did not run away. Then he was ordered to <b>mount</b> again, his <b>legs</b> being liberated for that purpose.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the more}} {{expensive}} tripods have additional features, such as a reversible center post so that the camera may be <b>mounted</b> between the <b>legs,</b> allowing for shots from low positions, and legs that can open to several different angles.|$|R
25|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels on a rigid axle, rubber {{sprung from}} the crosspiece between two tall V-form <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage {{at the same}} points as the interplane struts. The axle and crosspiece were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some additional lift.|$|R
50|$|The cabin seats two {{side-by-side}} under a large, single piece, forward hinged canopy, with supplementary transparencies {{behind the}} seats {{where there is}} baggage space. Wing lockers provide further stowage space. The NG4 has a tricycle undercarriage with fuselage <b>mounted</b> cantilever spring <b>legs.</b> All wheels have spats.|$|R
5000|$|The HD.6 was {{powered by}} a [...] Salmson 18Z two row, 18-cylinder radial engine, {{water-cooled}} by three circular section radiators <b>mounted</b> between the <b>legs</b> of its fixed conventional undercarriage. This had mainwheels on a single axle attached by V-struts to the lower fuselage, assisted by a tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The Kurir has a fixed, {{tailwheel}} undercarriage. The two tall, long-stroke, shock-absorbing main <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the upper}} fuselage sides just forward of the cabin have supplementary bracing; each carries a wheel fitted with brakes. Alternatively, skis can be fitted. At least one was configured as a floatplane.|$|R
5000|$|Its fixed {{undercarriage}} had mainwheels on a rigid axle, rubber {{sprung from}} the crosspiece between two tall V-form <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage {{at the same}} points as the interplane struts. [...] The axle and crosspiece were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some additional lift.|$|R
50|$|In Battroid mode, the VF-1 has {{a maximum}} {{airspeed}} of 220 kph mph. Its maximum running speed is 160 kph mph. In this mode, the Valkyrie {{can also be}} equipped with a reactive armor package called the GBP-1S Ground Battle Protector weapon system. Manufactured by Shinnakasu Heavy Industries this pack is armed with fifty-six 28 cm diameter Erlikon GH-32 Grenade Crusher high maneuverability micro-missiles (twenty-two mounted in two shoulder launchers, ten mounted in two chest launchers, sixteen <b>mounted</b> in side <b>leg</b> launchers, and eight <b>mounted</b> in rear <b>leg</b> launchers), eighteen Erlikon GA-100 Crusher high-speed armor-penetrating projectiles mounted in two lower arm launchers, and six Remington H-22T large hand grenades mounted on torso. This armor pack has to be ejected to allow the Valkyrie's transformation into GERWALK and Fighter modes.|$|R
50|$|The CAJO 59 was {{powered by}} two 65 hp (49 kW) Walter Mikron III {{inverted}} inline engines. Two fixed floats, mounted well outboard on single struts, stabilised flights off water. It had a manually retractable tricycle wheeled undercarriage, with main <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage and retracting into it above the waterline.|$|R
2500|$|The CCW-5 {{retained}} the fuselage and empennage of the Brigadier, but replaced the whole centre section {{with a pair}} of channels, starting at roots in {{the lower part of the}} fuselage. [...] Only beyond the channels did the conventional wings regain their mid-wing configuration. [...] A 225hp (168kW) Continental O-470 flat six engine was mounted on slender vertical and horizontal struts at the centre of each the channels, on the mid-wing line. These drove constant speed pusher propellers. The main undercarriage was much shortened by <b>mounting</b> its <b>legs</b> on the outer part of the channel section; the Brigadier nosewheel was retained.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was entirely}} ply covered. [...] Pilot and passenger sat {{side by side}} under a rear sliding canopy. [...] The D.63 had a fixed, unfaired tricycle undercarriage with wheels <b>mounted</b> on cantilever <b>legs</b> with shock absorbers. Its [...] Potez 4E-20 air cooled flat four engine drove a two blade propeller made by Melville Helices.|$|R
50|$|The L-17's {{fuselage}} was a plywood skinned wooden semi-monocoque, {{the cockpit}} seating two side-by-side {{under a single}} piece canopy. A 108 hp (80 kW) Lycoming O-235 flat four engine drove a two blade propeller. The fixed tricycle undercarriage had rearward sloping oleo <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> to the wings, giving a track of 2.40 m (7 ft 10 in).|$|R
50|$|The Stomo 3 had a {{tailskid}} undercarriage with a {{track of}} 1.63 m, its vertical, bungee-damped main <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the wing}} centre section spar, close to the junction with the outer panels. The legs {{and much of the}} wheels were enclosed in fairings and a long, cantilever tailskid kept the rudder clear of the ground.|$|R
2500|$|The Cheetah also {{adopted a}} DH.53 empennage, as the Scarab did later. [...] The fuselage, {{as with the}} Scarab, was new; a wooden wire braced structure, canvas covered was used {{in place of the}} plywood covered spruce members used in the DH.53. [...] There was a single open cockpit at the {{trailing}} edge of the (upper) wing, which had a slight cut-out in the new centre section for visibility, and a new single axle undercarriage <b>mounted</b> on <b>legs</b> to the lower longerons with rearward bracing. [...] Power came from a 35hp (26kW) Blackburne Thrush three cylinder radial, mounted in the inverted-Y orientation and driving a two-bladed propeller.|$|R
50|$|A floor tom is a double-skin drum, {{most often}} {{but not always}} as deep as its diameter, {{traditionally}} <b>mounted</b> on three <b>legs</b> and to the drummer's right for a right-handed drummer. It is normally the deepest-toned drum played by sticks in the kit, above the bass drum but below all others, and the most resonant, more so than even the bass drum.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in miniaturization of satellite transmitters {{have resulted in}} thumb-sized packages weighing less than 30 g. These are smaller than VHF radios routinely <b>mounted</b> on crane <b>leg</b> bands. With this development and with favorable signal reception results, {{there is no need}} for, and much to recommend against, the continued use of back-pack mounts. We provide details for leg-mount attachments...|$|R
50|$|The Potez 38 had a {{conventional}} tail-skid undercarriage, fitted with brakes. Its main wheels were on <b>legs</b> <b>mounted</b> near the wing root {{just behind the}} leading edge, containing rubber shock absorbers and spread outwards to provide a wide track. The axles were each hinged to the lower fuselage on V-struts with one end further forward and one {{in line with the}} legs.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the GXE features, the SE had a stiffer suspension, fog lights, 3 <b>leg</b> <b>mount</b> rear spoiler (1993 models with a clear LED brake light), side skirts (no upper side moldings), and sport seats (plus a standard sunroof in 1994-1995). It also had 4-wheel disc brakes, which came on the other trim lines when antilock brakes were ordered.|$|R

He replied in a most admirable manner, exceedingly flattering to my feelings, and undertook to obtain the consent of Mrs. Crewler to this arrangement. They had a dreadful time of it with her. It <b>mounted</b> from her <b>legs</b> into her chest, and then into her head--' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin and}} rear {{fuselage}} of the Twin-R {{are similar to}} that of the MCR4S. The cabin has a large, forward hinged, one piece canopy with trapezoidal windows aft. It seats the pilot and three passengers in two side-by-side rows. The twin 74 kW (99 hp) Rotax 912ULS flat four engines are wing mounted. The tricycle undercarriage has wing <b>mounted,</b> faired main <b>legs</b> and wheels.|$|R
