By conducting structured observations in a random sample of elementary and middle school classrooms in America’s Choice schools across the United States, and applying a rubric that assesses the fidelity <b>of</b> teachers’ <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> writers workshop, we have produced a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> a central component of the design.

In our study, we focus on three particular questions. First, what is the extent <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> writers workshop in elementary and middle schools {{at the end of their}} first year of America’s Choice?

5000|$|In the beginning, {{different}} views were expressed about the form {{the bill of}} rights should take. In 1948, General Assembly planned the bill to include UDHR, one Covenant and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation.</b> The Drafting Committee decided to prepare two documents: one {{in the form of a}} declaration, which would set forth general principles or standards of human rights; the other in the form of a convention, which would define specific rights and their limitations. Accordingly, the Committee transmitted to the Commission on Human Rights draft articles of an international declaration and an international convention on human rights. At its second session, in December 1947, the Commission decided to apply the term [...] "International Bill of Human Rights" [...] to the series of documents in preparation and established three working groups: one on the declaration, one on the convention (which it renamed [...] "covenant") and one on implementation. The Commission revised the draft declaration at its third session, in May/June 1948, taking into consideration comments received from Governments. It did not have time, however, to consider the covenant or the question of implementation. The declaration was therefore submitted through the United Nations Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly, meeting in Paris.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Ten {{years after}} the {{nationwide}} dissemination of two evidence-based treatment programs, the status <b>of</b> the <b>implementation</b> components was evaluated in a cross-sectional study. The aim {{of the study was}} to pilot a standardized <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> components by examining the factor structure, the reliabilities of the scores, and their association with implementation outcome variables. The aim was also to compare <b>implementation</b> profiles <b>of</b> the two evidence-based programs based on multi informant assessments. Methods The 218 participants in the study were therapists, supervisors, and agency leaders working with Parent Management Training, the Oregon model (PMTO), and Multisystemic Therapy (MST) in Norway. Interviewers filled in an electronic version <b>of</b> the <b>Implementation</b> Components Questionnaire during a telephone interview. Results The factor analysis of the eight one-dimensional subscales resulted in an individual clinical-level factor and an organizational system-level factor. Age, experience, and number of colleagues in the workplace were negatively correlated with positive ratings <b>of</b> the <b>implementation</b> process, but the number of colleagues working with the same program predicted positive ratings.

40|$|Date of {{publication}} August 6, 2014; date of current version September 19, 2014. This paper {{deals with the}} design of non-systematic irregular repeat-accumulate codes that are optimised for {{a finite number of}} decoding iterations. In many cases of practical interest, the usual approach for sparse-graph codes, which aims to approach capacity (with arbitrarily many decoder iterations), may not be suitable. This is of particular importance for systems with complexity or delay constraints. In this paper, we provide a design methodology which constrains the number of decoder iterations, as well as other <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> complexity. Our approach uses extrinsic information transfer analysis, and our main contribution is the formulation of code optimisation problems which directly incorporate the number of iterations into the constraints. We focus on the single user binary erasure channel and the two-user binary adder channel, where this transfer analysis is exact. Generalisation to other sparse graph codes and other channels (under usual approximations) is straightforward. Guangsong Wang, Ingmar Land, and Alex Gran...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> research, {{there is an}} {{increased}} interest in use of theory when designing implementation research studies involving behavior change. In 2003, we initiated a series of five studies to establish a scientific rationale for interventions to translate research findings into clinical practice by exploring {{the performance of a}} number of different, commonly used, overlapping behavioral theories and models. We reflect on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the methods, the performance of the theories, and consider where these methods sit alongside the range of methods for studying healthcare professional behavior change. Methods: These were five studies of the theory-based cognitions and clinical behaviors (taking dental radiographs, performing dental restorations, placing fissure sealants, managing upper respiratory tract infections without prescribing antibiotics, managing low back pain without ordering lumbar spine x-rays) of random samples of primary care dentists and physicians. Measures were derived for the explanatory theoretical constructs in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), and Illness Representations specified by the Common Sense Self Regulation Model (CSSRM).

40|$|This {{article has}} two aims: to qualify the UK government's ‘problem' of {{governance}} in a comparison with Scotland and Wales, {{and to use}} implementation studies (the ancestors of the new governance literature) to explore policy developments since devolution in Britain.

Using a ‘top-down' framework, it explores three main explanations for this finding: that the size of the implementation gap in England is exaggerated by a focus on particular governance problems; that pressure participant dissatisfaction follows unrealistic expectations in the devolved territories; and that the UK government undermines devolved policy implementation, by retaining control of key policy instruments and setting the agenda on <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> success...|$|E

The analysis of those <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation,</b> their weaknesses and the hopes attached to them show that although they are largely capable of meeting the contemporary challenges, what is still lacking, is a political will and, often, the knowledge of, or familiarity with humanitarian law; hence the importance of disseminating the norms and principles of this law, as emphasised in the paper. In this context the author shortly revises the case of responsibility for the crimes committed on the Guantanamo Bay detainees. 4...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{two decades}} of {{agri-environment}} schemes (AESs) aimed at mitigating farmland biodiversity losses, the evidence that such programmes actually benefit biodiversity remains limited. Using field-level surveys, we assess the effectiveness of AESs in enhancing bird abundances in an upland area of England, where schemes have been operating for over 20 years. In such a region, the effects of AESs should be readily apparent, and we predict that bird abundances will co-vary with both field- and landscape-scale <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation.</b> Using an information theoretic approach, we found that, for abundances of species of conservation concern and upland specialists, measures of AES implementation and habitat type at both scales appear in the most parsimonious models. Field-level bird abundances are higher where more of the surrounding landscape is included in an AES. While habitat remains a more influential predictor, we suggest that landscape-scale implementation results in enhanced bird abundances. Hence, measures {{of the success of}} AESs should consider landscape-wide benefits as well as localized impacts. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{previous}} {{literature in the}} fields <b>of</b> strategy <b>implementation</b> and leadership research tactics for strategy implementation are identified. Three categories proved empirically valid in this study: autocratic tactics, participative tactics and tactics which rely on the given culture of the organization. The paper {{is based on the}} assumption that implementation in general is dependent on environmental, strategic and organizational variables. In this sense implementation tactics can be interpreted as genuine organizational behaviour. Based on a discussion <b>of</b> associations <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> tactics with these variables it is hypothesized that the perception of environmental threats will lead to more autocratic tactics, whereas the existence of a formulated strategy will rather lead to more participative tactics. No such relationships are predicted for cultural tactics. A questionnaire-based <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> tactics is tested in a sample of 136 Upper-Austrian firms by referring to implementation projects or strategy related issues. For a sub-sample (n= 60) a moderated regression analysis on <b>implementation</b> tactics with <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> organizational structure, the environment, the strategy, and the interaction between environment and strategy as independent variables was performed. It shows that the use of autocratic tactics is significantly explained by environmental variables whereas participative tactics are significantly explained by the existence of a formulated strategy within the organization. For Culture as an implementation tactic only the interaction between environmental and strategic variables was a significant predictor. Implications for future theory building and empirical research into organizational behaviour in the context of strategy formulation and strategy implementation are discussed...|$|R
