25|$|In {{particular}} the investigations of MS Scandinavian Star, MS Estonia and MS Jan Heweliusz during the 1990s caused a {{questioning of the}} quality of <b>marine</b> <b>accident</b> investigations, and the other Nordic countries established marine investigation boards during that decade. Work on reforming the marine system started in 1998 and resulted in a committee recommending the system be scrapped in favor of an accident investigation board. The prime reason was that the Institute of Maritime Enquiry was regarded as having insufficient competence to investigate major accidents. There were also concerns that the system mixed the criminal prosecution and the safety investigation aspects, which could hinder a proper learning to take place from an accident. The system used court interviews with witnesses, with owners, insurance companies and press present. Facing both legal and economic consequences, witnesses would often give testimonies of reduced accuracy, hindering proper investigation from a safety point of view.|$|E
25|$|Southampton {{has always}} been a port, and the docks have long been a major {{employer}} in the city. In particular, it is a port for cruise ships; its heyday was {{the first half of the}} 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth-largest UK port by tonnage, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still-active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the Ocean Village development, which included a local marina and small entertainment complex, is a good example. Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the <b>Marine</b> <b>Accident</b> Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport in addition to cruise operator Carnival UK.|$|E

The objective of this paper is to indicate factors that contribute to human errors which is identified as the most frequent cause to <b>marine</b> <b>accidents.</b> Despite rapid technological development and safety legislation, this paper identifies the human factor as the waekest link in maritime safety system. This analysis could lead to decrease of vessel accidents. In addition, starting from the European Maritime Safety Agency data and by linear regression model application, we have obtained the trend of number of ships involved in <b>marine</b> <b>accidents</b> as well as the trend of lives lost in <b>marine</b> <b>accidents</b>  in and around European Union waters. </em...|$|R

Although Phips' own account of the expedition admitted only 30 dead in combat, smallpox and <b>marine</b> <b>accident</b> claimed about 1,000 more.

[...] Cotton Mather tells how one brigantine was wrecked on Anticosti; her crew maintained themselves on the island through the winter and were apparently rescued the following summer by a ship from Boston. Phips' defeat was complete and disastrous; fortunately for the French, since food was lacking to feed the large force assembled to defend Quebec {{in case of a}} prolonged siege. Phips himself had displayed no natural military talents to offset his lack of experience.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relation between marine casualty and dry bulk cargo freight rate according to the existence of spurious accident phenomenon in the dry cargo vessel accidents. According to the conventional expectation, the volume of <b>marine</b> <b>accidents</b> is a random process since it is accidently occurred and not a man-made outcome. Under this circumstance, it is expected that the volume of <b>marine</b> <b>accidents</b> should be statistically uncorrelated with the freight market rates and positively correlated with the fleet size. However, the existence statistics on dry cargo <b>marine</b> <b>accidents</b> indicate high level of negative correlation with freight markets (- 0. 95 for no. of vessels and - 0. 79 for the volume of accidents in dwt) and also high level of negative correlation with the fleet size (- 0. 81 for the volume of accidents in dwt). The asymmetric interaction between the widely accepted facts and the statistical foundations is the main concern of this paper which is named the “Fallacy of Random <b>Marine</b> <b>Accidents</b> (FRMA) ”. The possible reasons of the FRMA phenomenon are considered to be based on the man-made <b>marine</b> <b>accidents</b> because of the financial collapse or as the well known term the credit default risk...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>Marine</b> <b>Accident</b> Investigation Branch (MAIB) {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} the sinking. An MAIB underwater survey located the vessel on the seabed at a depth of around , [...] east of Muckle Skerry. The wreck was found to be intact but inverted and resting on its superstructure; no evidence was observed of structural failure. It is thought that the Cemfjord may have been overwhelmed so quickly by bad weather that the crew did not have time to evacuate. No bodies were seen or recovered during the survey or subsequently. The ship's owner, Brise of Hamburg, has said that no attempt to raise the wreck would be made and it will be left as a sea grave.|$|E

The collision {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, most notably the high wind speeds at the time. The <b>Marine</b> <b>Accident</b> Investigation Board determined that along with the high winds, an inappropriate helm order and the failure of a bow thruster prior to the incident had allowed the Pride of Portsmouth to pass close to the warship HMS Ocean and then make a starboard turn, which was accelerated by the high winds and lee from HMS Ocean towards HMS St Albans.|$|E

[...] In turn, they did not comply with the crew's wishes, but instead holed themselves up inside the ship and didn't even try to come out. [...] The crew {{had no choice but to}} the leave the Japanese and take to the lifeboats. [...] (Since the Normanton was a cargo ship, there was no staff in place to handle Japanese speaking passengers.)" [...] The captain and the crew were found not guilty by the investigation.|$|E
