30|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} characteristics of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> under nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres were macroscopically similar. The initial decomposition temperature, the maximum weight loss temperature, and the peak decomposition temperature of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> increased with increasing heating rates {{due to the}} increase of the activation energy and to the delay of heat transfer. However, the above-mentioned temperatures were much lower under an oxygen atmosphere, thus indicating that under oxygen <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> exhibited relatively poorer thermal stability. In addition, a kinetic model for {{thermal decomposition}} of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> was built up, and the kinetic parameters such as activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction order were obtained. The kinetic model was reliable in predicting the pyrolysis characteristics of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> and provided a theoretical basis for expanding the experiment and anti-decomposition in biodiesel applications. Finally, the kinetic compensation effect between the pre-exponential factors and the activation energy in the pyrolysis of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> was confirmed.|$|E

The MUC 5 AC mucin gene expression, and mucin protein production and secretion were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: Lobetyolin, lobetyol, and <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> inhibited the gene expression of MUC 5 AC mucin induced by PMA; lobetyolin did not affect PMA-induced MUC 5 AC mucin production. However, lobetyol and <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> inhibited the production of MUC 5 AC mucin; lobetyolin and lobetyol did not significantly affect PMA-induced MUC 5 AC mucin secretion from NCI-H 292 cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A model {{substrate}} oil using <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> {{was established}} for {{the determination of the}} antioxidant activity by Oil Stability Index (OSI) method. OSI values for <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> with different concentrations (5 – 100 %) in silicone oil were measured at different temperatures (70 – 120 °C). As the tempera-ture increased, the OSI value decreased in each concentration of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate.</b> Optimal temperature and concentration of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> were established. The effect of concentration of antioxidants, a-tocopherol, and butylated hydroxytoluene on OSI values for 10 % <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> model oil was measured at 90, 100, 110, and 120 °C. The logarithmic relationship between temperature and OSI using model substrate oil was similar to that of soybean oil. Furthermore, application of some spice ex-tracts to this model oil system was carried out to give results that compared well with those available in the literature. Thus, the procedure using methyl linoleate–silicone oil as a model sub-strate oil is available for evaluating the antioxidant activity by the OSI method...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} kinetics of conjugated <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> was {{compared with that}} of non-conjugated <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> under mild oxidation conditions (30 °C in the dark). Samples of methyl 9 -cis, 11 -trans-linoleate, methyl 10 -trans, 12 -cis linoleate and methyl 9 -cis, 12 -cis linoleate were assayed separately and in mixtures. For comparative purposes, methyl α-linolenate and methyl oleate were also used. Two complementary analytical approaches were selected to monitor the progress of oxidation, (1) the traditional follow-up of residual substrate by gas liquid chromatography, and (2) an analytical procedure by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) for direct measurement of the oxidation compounds formed. The HPSEC method enabled us to quantitate oxidized monomers, dimers and polymers concomitantly in a rapid and direct analysis. Results showed that conjugated <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> samples oxidized later than their non-conjugated counterparts, and showed a very different oxidation pattern. Thus, formation of oxidized monomers was negligible and the first and major compounds formed were polymerization products. Also, under the conditions used, non-conjugated and conjugated <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> samples in 1 : 1 mixtures led to decreased oxidation rate of non-conjugated <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> and increased oxidation rate of conjugated <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate.</b> This study supports the view that {{oxidation kinetics}} of conjugated dienes differ substantially from that of methylene-interrupted dienes. © AOCS 2007.

40|$|Lipoxygenases are key enzymes in the {{metabolism}} of unsaturated fatty acids. Soybean lipoxygenase- 1 (LOX- 1), {{a paradigm}} for lipoxygenases isolated from different sources, {{is composed of}} two domains: a ~ 30 kDa N-terminal domain and a ~ 60 kDa C-terminal domain. We used limited proteolysis and gel-filtration chromatography to generate and isolate a ~ 60 kDa fragment of LOX- 1 ('mini-LOX'), produced by trypsin cleavage between lysine 277 and serine 278. Mini-LOX was subjected to N-terminal sequencing and to electrophoretic, chromatographic, and spectroscopic analysis. Mini-LOX {{was found to be}} more acidic and more hydrophobic than LOX- 1, and with a higher content of -helix. Kinetic analysis showed that mini-LOX dioxygenates linoleic acid with a catalytic efficiency approximately 3 -fold higher than that of LOX- 1 (33. 3 × 106 and 10. 9 × 106 M- 1 ·s- 1, respectively), the activation energy of the reaction being 4. 5 ± 0. 5 and 8. 3 ± 0. 9 kJ·mol- 1 for mini-LOX and LOX- 1, respectively. Substrate preference, tested with linoleic, -linolenic, and arachidonic acids, and with <b>linoleate</b> <b>methyl</b> ester, was the same for LOX- 1 and mini-LOX, and also identical was the regio- and stereospecificity of the products generated thereof, analyzed by reversed-phase and chiral high-performance liquid chromatography, and by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mini-LOX was able to bind artificial vesicles with higher affinity than LOX- 1, but the binding was less affected by calcium ions than was that of LOX- 1.

On the same subjects, 2 measures of sebum secretion rate were obtained, namely the sustainable wax ester secretion rate (WESR) on the forehead and the ratio of wax esters/(cholesterol + cholesterol esters) [WE/(CH + CE) ] in the surface lipid. The proportions of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> in FAME from the wax esters decreased, and the proportions of methyl sebaleate increased, with increased rates of sebum secretion. For both <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> and methyl sebaleate, a better correlation was obtained when the ratio of WE/(CH + CE) {{was used as a}} measure of sebum secretion rather than the WESR. The proportions of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> in the FAME from the acylceramides were also inversely related to ratios of WE/(CH + CE). In acylceramides, linoleate was replaced by sapienate, a major fatty acid of human sebum.

Four extracts were isolated from the bio-oil through multi-fractionation steps using a liquid-liquid extraction method: water-soluble, neutral, phenolic and organic acids extracts. The crude bio-oil and the isolated extracts were characterized by GC-MS, GC-FID, total phenols by Folin-Ciocalteu assay, ATR-IR and 13 C NMR. The antioxidative effect of the crude bio-oil, its isolated extracts and two significant phenolic components (eugenol and catechol) of the crude bio-oil were also investigated using <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> as a biodiesel model by means of a high temperature (120 °C) oxidation test. The results show that <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> induction time increased after blending small amounts (1. 4 - 5. 6 % w/w) of either the crude bio-oil or the isolated extracts. However, the crude bio-oil showed higher induction times in comparison with its isolated extracts, which was significant because the crude bio-oil contained a lower concentration of phenolic species (23 % w/w), especially in comparison to the phenolic concentration in the phenolic extract (49. 6 % w/w).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} biodiesel on automotive engines during usage, the chemistry of two significant biodiesel components, <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> and oleate were examined. Both were oxidised in bench top reactors at temperatures between 100 - 170 °C to represent the different conditions across the engine. Products were identified and quantified by GC-FID and GC-MS to determine the main degradation mechanisms. Methyl oleate and linoleate were also oxidised with squalane in the reactors to simulate the effects of fuel dilution in the engine lubricant. At lower temperatures <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> was shown to enhance the rate of squalane oxidation, but as the temperature increased, the pro-oxidant character decreased to become inhibiting by 170 °C, with the temperature at which this crossover occurred measured at 158 ± 5 °C - methyl oleate had no effect however. This temperature dependent behaviour is attributed to the weak C-H bond of the doubly allylic system (the only feature not common to both molecules) and the subsequent reversibility of O 2 addition to the <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> radical formed via hydrogen abstraction. Studies of a similar molecule, 1, 4 -pentadiene, revealed ceiling temperatures for this specific reaction as 173 ± 6 °C which was in good agreement with the experimental value. The effects of lubricant additives (two antioxidants and a detergent) {{on the degradation of}} squalane-methyl linoleate mixtures was also examined. It was shown that at all temperatures the antioxidant could delay the onset of the reactions, but have no effect on them once they started. Similarly, <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> could reduce the effectiveness of the antioxidants at all measured temperatures showing that the reversible addition of O 2 to allylic radicals was not relevant for these reactions. Two possible mechanisms for this behaviour are discussed along with potential methods for testing them in future experiments. No noticeable effects were observed for the detergent.

The ionic liquids (ILs) [bmim][BF 4], [hydemim][BF 4], and [bmim][PF 6] {{were characterized by}} 1 H-NMR and UV-Vis spectra. The epoxidation of a technical mixture of methyl oleate and <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> with H 2 O 2, in [bmim][BF 4], [hydemim][BF 4] and [bmim][PF 6], catalyzed by MoO(O 2) 2 • 2 QOH (QOH = 8 -quinilinol) and with NaHCO 3 as co-catalyst has been studied for the first time. It was found that high conversions of methyl oleate and <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> to their respective oxidation products, {{as well as the}} total selectivity of their oxidation products to oxirane in [hydemim][BF 4] were obtained. Also, the IL phases containing the Mo(VI) catalyst can be readily recycled by washing with diethyl ether and drying, and the Mo(VI) catalyst can be reused at least five times...|$|E
40|$|The group {{contribution}} concept can {{be applied}} in the estimation of thermodynamic properties of pure compounds and mixtures. The Modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) is a successful and well-known group contribution model for phase equilibria prediction. In this paper the application of this model to the phase equilibrium of biodiesel - volatile organic compounds systems was tested. Infinite dilution activity coefficients of 30 selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> and methyl palmitate were estimated. The VOCs groups covered in the selection were alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, ethers and ketones. The estimated phase equilibrium is favourable for the absorption of these organics into <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate.</b> The solubility was found to decrease with increase in molecular weight of the VOCs in each group. Saturation was also found {{to have an effect}} on solubility. Experimental data are often not available, at least for preliminary design and feasibility studies of absorption processes, group contribution methods can be utilized to predict the required phase equilibria...|$|E

A similar transformation also takes place during hydrogenation of unsaturated lipids.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effects of}} {{tocopherols}} and ascorbic acid on the formation and decomposition of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> hydroperoxides (ML-OOH) were evaluated. The results contribute {{to the understanding of}} the antioxidant action of tocopherols and ascorbic acid during lipid oxidation reaction sequences. α- and γ-Tocopherols at 10 - 1000 ppm levels efficiently inhibited the formation of ML-OOH during the autoxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> at 40 °C. In addition, α-, γ- andδtocopherols (0. 2, 2 and 20 mM levels) inhibited the decomposition of ML-OOH in hexadecane. The more detailed analysis of the isomeric distribution of ML-OOH as well as the decomposition products of ML-OOH by HPLC provided information of the mechanisms of action of tocopherols on lipid hydroperoxides. The results suggest that all tocopherols act as hydrogen atom donors to both peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals. α-Tocopherol directed the isomeric distribution of ML-OOH to the cis,trans configuration during the formation and decomposition of ML-OOH. α-Tocopherol inhibited the isomerization reaction by acting as a fast hydrogen atom donor to peroxyl radicals.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{properties of}} the antithrombotic drug dipyridamole have been studied using lipid oxidation assays based on the generation of peroxy radicals by azo compounds. Dipyridamole was observed to prevent both peroxidation of arachidonic acid micelles in aqueous solution and peroxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> in organic solvents; in contrast to vitamin E, dipyridamole was found to scavenge both hydrophilic and hydrophobic radicals. The rate constant for the reaction of dipyridamole with <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> peroxyl radicals at 37 degrees C was calculated as 2 x 10 (6) M(- 1) s(- 1), in comparison to 1 x 10 (6) M(- 1) s(- 1) of vitamin E under the same conditions. The antioxidant efficiency of the drug was confirmed in experiments with radiolysis-induced oxidation and through measurements of malondialdehyde production and diene formation. As a result of radical scavenging, a relatively stable dipyridamole radical was formed that could be detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The particular antioxidant properties of dipyridamole may explain the vasodilating and antiplatelet effects of this cardiovascular drug...|$|E
40|$|High-purity oleate esters can {{decrease}} the melting points {{and improve the}} oxidative stability of lubricants. High-oleic soybean oil (HOSO) was esterified to butyl or isopropyl esters. Fractional distillation and low-temperature crystallization were applied to improve the purity of oleate of HOSO esters. Although the purity of butyl esters of HOSO attained 91. 8 % by fractional distillation, the rate of distillation must be slow which made this approach not very feasible. After subjecting the esters to a two-step crystallization at reduced temperatures, the percentage of oleate in the HOSO esters was increased from 83. 2 to 92. 5 %. The percentage of saturated fatty acids decreased to less than 2. 2 %, but polyunsaturates percentage remained almost unchanged. <b>Methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> monolayer has a highest lipid oxidation rate. It can be employed to produce useful oxidation products including expoxides and hydroxides. <b>Methyl</b> <b>linoleate</b> (20 % by weight) was coated to silica gel H to form monolayers and heated at 35, 40, 50 and 60 yC. Methyl palmitate (5 % by weight of <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate)</b> was added as internal standard. The identification of oxidation products was by comparison to standards. The oxidation rate increased with temperature. The temperature for optimal yields of epoxides (20. 26 %) and total non-scission products (NSPs, 38. 79 %) was 50 yC. Citric acid and EDTA (0. 01 % and 0. 02 % by weight of oil) were added as chelating agents to minimize the effects of iron on oxidation. Citric acid at 0. 01 % achieved higher PV and also reduced the loss of NSPs to scission products (SPs) after reaching the maximum peroxide value. The addition of 20 ppm vanadium (by weight of silica gel) increased the yield of epoxides (23. 85 %); however, it also led to lower peroxide values and longer induction period. After long operation of biodiesel engine, hard and dark deposits accumulate on injector tips, which affect engine performance. The type and composition of biodiesel have major effect on the formation of deposits. The major compounds of thermal stable residues of biodiesel from muffle furnace heated at 200 yC for 15 min were analysed by GC-MS. Those compounds were mostly fragments of fatty esters, in which the terminal ends are acids, aldehydes. Methyl linolenate formed significantly greater amounts of residue than neat biodiesel, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate, and <b>methyl</b> <b>linoleate.</b> The GC profile of methyl linolenate residues included more compounds than from other oils...|$|E
