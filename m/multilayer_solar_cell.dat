This allowed estimating pseudo-optical function, Drude conductivity, and carrier mobility change, {{as well as}} concentration before and after plasma treatments. Therefore, plasma treatment resulted in not only surface cleaning from organic inclusions but also relieved internal stress. Such processing can be performed inside vacuum chambers during the post-processing stage.

Protocrystalline phase can be well identified by Raman peak shift and the variation of dielectric function measured by spectroscopic ellipsometer. Increasing R can effectively increase the protocrystalline phase, optical energy gap, {{and reduce the}} density of films. More protocrystalline phase can suppress the photodegradation effects of the pc-Si:H/a-Si:H <b>multilayers</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells,</b> but reduce the initial efficiency.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} light {{trapping}} efficiency of a bidimensional photonic crystal (PC) integrated in a classical organic <b>multilayer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> The {{role of the}} PC is to enhance light absorption in the active layer by leveraging resonant mode excitation. However the light trapping efficiency is drasticallyinhibited by the overall absorption of the entire multilayer, which includes absorption by the passive layers that do {{not contribute to the}} photocurrent. This study focuses on the impact of passive absorption in ITO and PEDOT, which is often neglected in the study of light trapping organic solar cell systems, despite the significant role it plays in highly absorbing devices. Indeed, we show here that the absorption enhancement in the active layer can vary between 23 % and 46 % depending on the optical properties of the passive layers, which are dependent on fabrication conditions. We also detail how the PC behaves with coupled parameters such as the optical indices of the passive layers, as well as the period and the air filling fraction of the PC...|$|E

TiO₂ was chosen because of the unique optical and electrical properties it possesses {{as well as its}} ease of preparation and operational stability. The properties of sol-elaborated films vary significantly with processing environment and technique, and the sol formula; a systematic investigation of these variables enabled the selection of a consistent technique to produce relatively dense, crack-free TiO₂ thin films. Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) energy transfer was investigated by integrating plasmonic Au nanoparticles into multi-layer wide-band gap semiconductor (TiO₂) devices, and by doping strongly catalytic TiO₂ anodes in a 3 -electrode photochemical cell.

30|$|Self-assembled Ge {{quantum dots}} and well {{arrangements}} have attracted {{a lot of}} attention due to their ability of being integrated into silicon-based optoelectronic and nano-electronic devices [1, 2]. One of the motivations behind these efforts is to form devices and functions that take advantage of quantum confinement effects for electronic and optical applications, such as light emitting diodes, tunneling diodes, detectors, etc. [3, 4], where Ge quantum dots were formed by ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV-CVD). Recently, the Ge dots <b>multilayer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> made by molecular beam epitaxy was reported [5]. Another motivation is to find cost-effective methods for forming nanoscale devices without using expensive lithography techniques. Among the different ways in producing quantum dots [6 – 8], excimer laser annealing (ELA) to induce self-assembled Ge islands is an innovative technique. ELA has been widely used in low temperature poly-Si thin film-transistor processes for flat panel display products [9]. One of the characteristics of laser annealing is a shallow absorption depth, which avoids heating of layers underneath, due to the high absorption coefficient of semiconductor material in the UV laser wavelength range [10]. An advantage of laser annealing is the determination of dot localization on the surface. By contrast, dot patterning is difficult to directly use conventional chemical vapor deposition processes, except for selective epitaxial growth (SEG) over pre-patterned samples. Weizman et al. reported the formation of a ripple structure to hillock structure by single laser pulse with silicon-germanium (Si 1 −xGex), 0.3 [*]<[*]x[*]<[*] 0.7 [11]. In this work, we propose nominal pure Ge re-crystallization and self-assembly into dots by excimer laser irradiation, and discuss the resulting improvement in Ge crystallization quality. We also study the relationship between dot volume and beam energy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Organic <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> (OSCs) have {{recently}} attracted considerable research interest. For typical OSCs, {{it is highly}} desirable to have optically thick and physically thin thickness for strong light absorption and efficient carrier collection respectively. In the meantime, most organic semiconductors have short exciton diffusion length and low carrier mobility [1 – 3]. As a consequence, the active layers of OSCs are generally thin with a thickness {{of a few hundred}} nanometers to ensure the efficient extraction of carriers, hence limiting the total absorption of incident light. Optimizing both the optical and electrical (i. e., multi-physical) properties of OSCs is in demands for rationally designed device architectures. Plasmonic nanomaterials (e. g., metallic nanoparticles [4 – 6], nanorods [7, 8], nanoprisms [9, 10], etc.) {{have recently}} been introduced into different layers of <b>multilayered</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> to achieve highly efficient light harvesting. The <b>multilayered</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> structures commonly have active layer, carrier (electron and hole) transport layer and electrode (anode and cathode). Through the localized plasmonic resonances (LPRs) [11 – 16] from metallic nanomaterials, very strong near-fields will be generated, which can provide a large potential for enhancing optical absorption in the multilayered OSCs. Besides the optical effects, {{it has been reported that}} metallic nanomaterials can modify the morphology, interface properties as well as the electrical properties of OSCs which will significantly modify the performances of OSCs [17 – 23]. In this article, the effects of various optical resonance mechanisms and the theoretical studies of the multi-physical properties of OSCs will be reviewed. Meanwhile, the experimental optical and electrical effects of metallic nanomaterials incorporated in different layers of OSCs will be studied. The morphology and interface effects of metallic nanomaterials in the carrier transport layers on the performances of OSCs will also be described...|$|R

In another example where interfacial barriers are present, broadening of the energy levels due to disorder has to be taken into account to describe the IV curves showing S-Shape like behavior with realistic parameters.

40|$|The {{solar power}} {{satellite}} (SPS) {{will provide a}} clean, reliable source of energy for large-scale consumption. The system will use satellites in geostationary orbits around the Earth to capture the Sun's energy. The intercepted sunlight will be converted to laser beam energy that can be transmitted to the Earth's surface. Ground systems on the Earth will convert the transmissions from space into electric power. The preliminary design for the SPS consists of one satellite in orbit around the Earth transmitting energy to a single ground station. The SPS design uses <b>multilayer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> technology arranged on a 20 km squared planar array to intercept sunlight and convert it to an electric voltage. Power conditioning devices then send the electricity to a laser, which transmits the power {{to the surface of}} the Earth. A ground station will convert the beam into electricity. Typically, a single SPS will supply 5 GW of power to the ground station. Due to the large mass of the SPS, about 41 million kg, construction in space is needed in order to keep the structural mass low. The orbit configuration for this design is to operate a single satellite in geosynchronous orbit (GEO). The GEO allows the system to be positioned above a single receiving station and remain in sunlight 99 percent of the time. Construction will take place in low Earth orbit (LEO); array sections, 20 in total, will be sailed on solar wind out to the GEO location in 150 days. These individual transportation sections are referred to as solar sailing array panels (SSAP's). The primary truss elements used to support the array are composed of composite tubular members in a pentahedral arrangement.

40|$|The {{different}} size of Si and Ge atom in hydrogenated {{amorphous silicon}} germanium (a-Si 1 -xGex:H) thin-film solar cells {{is not easy to}} form good network that generates many defects and deteriorate the quality of the film. Therefore, control the arrangement of Si and Ge atoms can help {{to improve the quality of}} the film, which can be done by multilayer deposition. In this thesis, GeH 4 is pulse added into chamber and use residue GeH 4 to fabricate a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H multilayer to control the arrangement of Si and Ge atoms to explore the effect on the performance of a-Si 1 -xGex: H solar cells. The 13. 56 MHz pulse-wave modulated plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and with different GeH 4 to SiH 4 flow ratio and pulse adding GeH 4 is used to fabricate intrinsic layers of a-Si 1 -xGex:H thin-film solar cells. The i-layer structures are including single-layer a-Si 1 -xGex:H and a-Si 1 -xGex:H/ a-Si(Ge) :H multilayer. Single a-Si 1 -xGex:H i-layer solar cells are fabricated with [GeH 4]/[SiH 4] = 0. 11 and 0. 32 ratio and change the thickness of intrinsic layers to study the effects of different Ge/Si contents and i-layer thickness on the electrical properties of solar cells. A-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H <b>multilayer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> are also fabricate by [GeH 4]/[SiH 4] = 0. 11 and 0. 32 gas ratio. For gas ratio of 0. 11, A sublayer (GeH 4 flow of 3. 2 sccm) thickness is 1. 1 nm, and B sublayer (GeH 4 off) thickness is changed from 0. 55 nm to 1. 1 nm. The total i-layer thickness is fixed at 180 nm. For gas ratio of 0. 32, A sublayer (GeH 4 flow of 3. 2 sccm) thickness is 3 nm, and B sublayer (GeH 4 off) thickness is increased from 0. 087 nm to 3 nm, that the i-layer total thickness is fixed at 70 nm. The current-voltage and spectral response results show that, for single i-layer a-Si 1 -xGex:H solar cells, increasing [GeH 4] / [SiH 4] gas ratio with the same thickness of i-layer increase Ge/Si content can enhance the response in the long-wavelength, but the increase of defects in the film also decrease the efficiency. Reduce the i-layer thickness can enhance internal electric field to increase the carrier collection and conversion efficiency. For a-Si 1 -xGex:H/ a-Si(Ge) :H multilayer solar cells, B sublayer is deposited by residue GeH 4. Increasing B sublayer thickness can raise silicon content gradually, thus long-wavelength response is gradually reduced. Arrangement of Si and Ge atoms can be effectively adjusted by increasing the thickness of B sublayer, which can control the spectral response moved from long-wavelength to short-wavelength, and decrease short-circuit current density, increasing open- circuit voltage, and fill factor. For high Ge content of a-Si 1 -xGex:H solar cell, using a-Si 1 -xGex:H/ a-Si(Ge) :H multilayer structure can improve the electrical properties and still has significant response in long-wavelength region. 氫化非晶矽鍺薄膜太陽電池由於矽與鍺原子的大小不同，容易造成排列不均的情況，使得薄膜的缺陷增加，劣化薄膜品質。若能控制矽與鍺的排列，可以有助於提升薄膜品質。改善矽與鍺的排列可藉由多層膜鍍膜來改善。本論文以間斷加入鍺烷，利用鍺烷氣體滯留的方式製作a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜來改變矽與鍺之排列，探討對氫化非晶矽鍺太陽電池特性之影響。 本論文使用射頻 13. 56 MHz脈波調變電漿輔助化學氣相沉積技術並以不同鍺烷/矽烷流量比及間斷加入鍺烷之方法製作不同矽/鍺含量本質層結構的氫化非晶矽鍺薄膜太陽電池。製作的結構分別為a-Si 1 -xGex:H單層膜及a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜的本質層。 a-Si 1 -xGex:H單層膜太陽電池以[GeH 4]/[SiH 4] = 0. 11 及 0. 32 氣體比例製作，比較不同矽/鍺含量及本質層厚度對太陽電池特性的影響。a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜太陽電池亦分為[GeH 4] / [SiH 4] = 0. 11 及 0. 32 兩種系列。前者固定A子層(鍺烷流量為 3. 2 sccm) 厚度為 1. 1 nm，而B子層(鍺烷關閉) 厚度分成 1. 1 nm和 0. 55 nm，固定本質層厚度為 180 nm；後者固定A子層(鍺烷流量為 3. 2 sccm) 厚度為 3 nm，而B子層(鍺烷關閉) 厚度由 0. 087 nm增加至 3 nm，固定本質層厚度為 70 nm。 太陽電池的電性及頻譜響應結果顯示，對單層膜太陽電池而言，降低矽烷流量使Ge/Si含量增加，在相同本質層厚度下，雖可加強長波長的響應，但會增加本質層內部缺陷，降低轉換效率。縮短本質層厚度，則可加強本質層內部電場，提升載子收集及轉換效率。對a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜太陽電池而言，關閉鍺烷以殘留鍺烷鍍膜，隨B子層厚度增加而增加矽原子比例，使長波長響應逐漸減少，而往氫化非晶矽太陽電池趨勢移動。矽與鍺原子的排列可以由B子層厚度的增加而調整，其Ge/Si原子比例的調整對應於光譜響應由長波長往短波長移動，及短路電流密度逐漸下降，開路電壓與填充因子逐漸上升。 對高鍺含量的試片，以a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜結構可以改善電性並仍在長波長有明顯響應。第一章 序論 [...] 1 1. 1 前言 [...] - 1 1. 2 矽鍺合金薄膜太陽能電池簡介 [...] - 1 1. 3 研究動機與目的 [...] - 2 1. 4 論文架構 [...] - 2 第二章 文獻探討 [...] 4 第三章 研究方法 [...] 6 3. 1 實驗流程 [...] - 6 3. 1. 1 薄膜製程 [...] - 6 3. 1. 2 製程設備 [...] - 6 3. 1. 3 基板清洗方式 [...] - 7 3. 2 量測儀器 [...] - 8 3. 3 實驗參數設計 [...] 11 3. 3. 1 薄膜製作與量測 [...] 11 3. 3. 2 薄膜實驗參數設計 [...] 11 3. 4 太陽電池製作 [...] 12 3. 4. 1 單層膜太陽電池實驗設計 [...] 12 3. 4. 2 a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜太陽電池實驗設計 [...] - 14 第四章 結果與討論 [...] - 19 4. 1 薄膜量測分析與探討 [...] 19 4. 1. 1 薄膜之SE量測結果 [...] 19 4. 1. 2 薄膜之FE-SEM量測結果 [...] 20 4. 2 太陽電池光電特性量測與分析 [...] 22 4. 2. 1 太陽電池之XPS量測結果與分析 [...] - 22 4. 2. 2 單層膜太陽電池量測結果與分析 [...] 23 4. 2. 3 a-Si 1 -xGex:H/a-Si(Ge) :H多層膜太陽電池量測結果與分析- 30 第五章 結論 [...] - 40 第六章 未來工作 [...] - 41 參考文獻 [...] 4...|$|E

For total gas flow of 200 sccm series, due to high flow, the SiH 4 residence time is shortened, the B-sublayer thickness is very thin that the structure can not be changed to protocrystalline structure, therefore, the electrical properties of <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> is less affected by inserting of B-sublayer. 本論文使用射頻 13. 56 MHz脈波調變電漿輔助化學氣相沉積(Pulsed-PECVD) 技術沉積氫化非晶矽薄膜太陽能電池，以調變總氣體流量之方式製作單一本質層的氫化非晶矽太陽電池及以脈波間斷加入矽烷之方法製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池。 調變不同總氣體流量(50 、 100 、 150 、 200 sccm) 製作氫化非晶矽薄膜太陽能電池的本質層，探討其對太陽電池特性之影響。電流-電壓特性和量子效率量測結果顯示，提高總氣體流量增加矽烷氣體之供應量，使得高矽烷結構之粉塵容易產生，讓薄膜缺陷密度增加，導致降低理想因子和填充因子，太陽電池的光電轉換效率也隨之下降。因此改善太陽電池效率，必須使用適當的總氣體流量。 以脈波間斷加入矽烷製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H的多層膜太陽電池，總氣體流量分別為 50 及 200 sccm。A-子層(A-sublayer) 為氫化非晶矽薄膜，B-子層(B-sublayer) 使用在腔體滯留的矽烷(SiH 4) 進行薄膜的沉積，探討B子層鍍膜時間對於太陽電池的電性特性影響。 總氣體流量固定為 50 sccm，以脈波間斷加入製作的a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池的研究中，其太陽電池之短路電流密度、填充因子及轉換效率會隨著B-子層厚度增加而逐步下降，其原因為B子層之沉積主要是使用滯留於腔體之矽烷氣體，隨著B子層沉積時間的增加，腔體內部之矽烷濃度會逐漸下降，此時氫氣的供應並未改變，因此，沉積室之氫稀釋比例將會逐漸上升，而沉積之薄膜結構將會由非晶矽結構逐漸轉變成為原晶矽之薄膜結構，當原晶矽之薄膜結構的厚度增加時，會逐步減少短路電流密度、填充因子及降低光電轉換效率。 總氣體流量固定為 200 sccm，以脈波間斷加入製作的a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池的研究中，因其擁有較高之總氣體流量，故其腔體滯留時間縮短，使得B子層之薄膜厚度減少，此時，B子層沉積厚度不足以讓非晶矽結構轉換至原晶矽結構時，其太陽電池的特性變化並不明顯。中文摘要		 i 英文摘要		 ii 目錄		 iv 表目錄	 vi 圖目錄		 vii 		 第一章	緒論	 1 1. 1 	前言	 1 1. 2 	研究與目的 	 2 1. 3 	論文架構	 3 		 第二章	文獻探討 4 		 第三章	研究方法 	 14 3. 1 	實驗儀器設備	 14 3. 1. 1 脈波調變射頻電漿增強化學氣相沉積(Pulsed-PECVD) 系統 14 3. 1. 2 熱蒸鍍(Thermal Evaporator) 系統 14 3. 2 	實驗流程 15 3. 2. 1 基板清洗方式 15 3. 2. 2 背景真空抽氣程序	 16 3. 3 	實驗參數設計	 17 3. 3. 1 	調變總氣體流量氫化非晶矽太陽電池實驗參數設計 18 3. 3. 2 	以脈波間斷加入矽烷之方法製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池實驗參數設計	 19 3. 4 	量測儀器	 22 		 第四章	結果與討論	 24 4. 1 	太陽電池之光電特性量測結果與分析	 24 4. 1. 1 調變總氣體流量太陽電池之鍍率量測結果與分析	 24 4. 1. 2 調變總氣體流量太陽電池之光電特性量測結果與分析	 25 4. 1. 3 以脈波間斷加入矽烷之方法製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池之鍍率量測結果與分析	 31 4. 1. 4 以脈波間斷加入矽烷之方法製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池之光電特性量測結果與分析	 33 第五章	結論	 45 5. 1 	調變總氣體流量太陽電池之結論	 45 5. 2 	以脈波間斷加入矽烷之方法製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池之結論	 45 		 第六章	未來工作	 47 6. 1 	調變總氣體流量太陽電池之未來工作	 47 6. 2 	以脈波間斷加入矽烷之方法製作a-Si:H/pc-Si:H多層膜太陽電池之未來工作	 47 		 參考文獻	 4...|$|R

Specifically, an important research goal is to find potential substitutes for existing TCO materials such as indium tin oxide (ITO), which are high performing, but require rare, expensive and/or toxic materials such as indium. TCOs based on zinc oxides doped with aluminium (AZO), are promising candidates for such a substitute but exhibit much lower conductance than ITO. Gallium doped ZnO (GZO) materials perform better than AZO, but suffer from similar concerns as ITO, in terms of the rarity and high cost of gallium. This project focusses on transparent conductive AZO thin films, incorporating seed layers doped with traces of gallium. The research goal is to enhance the conductivity of AZO materials, using minimum quantities of gallium in the process. The project employed the sol-gel 61 process, a solution based chemical process for synthesis of AZO/GZO nanoparticles, which are then deposited as thin films using a spin coating technique.
