40|$|We {{present a}} process for the {{void-free}} filling of sub- 100 nm trenches with copper or copper-manganese alloy by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Conformally deposited <b>manganese</b> <b>nitride</b> serves as an underlayer that initially chemisorbs iodine. CVD of copper or copper-manganese alloy releases the adsorbed iodine atoms {{from the surface of}} the <b>manganese</b> <b>nitride,</b> allowing iodine to act as a surfactant catalyst floating on the surface of the growing copper layer. The iodine increases the growth rate of the copper and manganese by an order of magnitude. As the iodine concentrates near the narrowing bottoms of features, void-free, bottom-up filling of CVD of pure copper or copper-manganese alloy is achieved in trenches narrower than 30 nm with aspect ratios up to at least 5 : 1. The <b>manganese</b> <b>nitride</b> films also show barrier properties against copper diffusion and enhance adhesion between copper and dielec-tric insulators. During post-deposition annealing, manganese in the alloy diffuses out from copper through the grain boundaries and forms a self-aligned layer that further improves adhesion and barrier properties at the copper/insulator interface. This process provides nanoscale interconnects for microelectronic devices with higher speeds and longer lifetimes...|$|E

A-Mn-N (A = Fe, Co, K, Li) materials were synthesised by nitriding their oxide counterparts at low temperature using NaNH 2 {{as a source of}} reactive nitrogen. The reactivity of lattice nitrogen was assessed using ammonia synthesis as a model reaction. In the case of Mn 3 N 2, limited reactivity was observed and only 3. 1 % of the available lattice nitrogen was found to be reactive towards hydrogen to yield ammonia while most of the lattice nitrogen was lost as N 2. However, the presence of a co-metal {{played a key role in}} shaping the nitrogen transfer properties of <b>manganese</b> <b>nitride</b> and impacted strongly upon its reactivity.

PfrommApproximately 45 % of {{the global}} {{hydrogen}} production (from fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal totaling 2 % {{of the global}} energy generation) is absorbed as feedstock in the synthesis of over 130 million metric tons ammonia (NH[subscript] 3) annually. To achieve food security for a growing world population and to allow for additional uses of the nitrogen-fertilizer for production of bio-energy feedstock or as combustion fuel or H[subscript] 2 carrier - demand for NH[subscript] 3 is projected to increase. This work pursues the synthesis of ammonia at atmospheric pressure and without fossil fuel. Conceptually, concentrated solar radiation is utilized to transfer electrons from the lattice oxygen of a transition metal oxide to the metal ion. This yields a metallic reactant that provides the reducing power for the subsequent six-electron reductive cleavage of N[subscript] 2 forming a transition metal nitride. In a second reaction, the generated lattice nitrogen is hydrogenated with hydrogen from H[subscript] 2 O to NH[subscript] 3. This furnishes the transition metal oxide for perpetuated NH[subscript] 3 synthesis. Theory and experimentation identified <b>manganese</b> <b>nitride</b> as a promising reactant with fast diffusion characteristics (8 ± 4 x 10 [superscript]- 9 cm[superscript] 2 s [superscript]- 1 apparent nitrogen diffusion constant at 750 degree C) and efficient liberation of 89 ± 1 mol% nitrogen via hydrolysis at 500 degree C.

To aid the prospective design of a Mn or Mo-based reactant, correlating the diffusion constants for the hydrolysis of seven nitrides with the average lattice nitrogen charge (9. 96 - 68. 83 %, relative to an ideal ionic solid) indicates the utility of first-principle calculations for developing an atomic-scale understanding of the reaction mechanism in the future...|$|E

This indicates that noncollinear spins exist at the interfaces between two phases, creating a competition between interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and exchange interactions. Strikingly, {{in addition to the}} normal Hall effect by Lorentz force and anomalous Hall effect by magnetization, we observe new contribution namely topological Hall effect below 75 K.

This class of nitrides is attracting great attention {{because of their}} giant negative thermal expansion, {{which is achieved by}} doping Ge or Sn into the A site as a relaxant of the sharp volume contraction on heating (spontaneous volume magnetostriction ωs) because of the magnetovolume effects. The physical background of large ωs and mechanism of how the volume contraction becomes gradual with temperature are central concerns for the physics and applications of these nitrides. An entire dataset of thermal expansion, crystal structure and magnetization demonstrates that the cubic triangular antiferromagnetic state is crucial for large ωs. The intimate relationship between ωs and the magnetic structure is discussed in terms of geometrical frustration related to the Mn 6 N octahedron and magnetic stress concept. The results presented herein also show that ωs depends on the number of d electrons in the A atom, suggesting the important role of the d orbitals of the A atom. Not all the dopants in the A site, but the elements that disturb the cubic triangular antiferromagnetic state, are effective in broadening the volume change. This fact suggests that instability neighboring the phase boundary is related to the broadening. The relation between the gradual volume change and the local structure anomaly is suggested by recent microprobe studies...|$|R

Nanotubes at 350 °C or spherical shape particles were seen at higher temperatures. Capacitances were seen to drop with scan number when run for longer periods at higher scan rates. Molybdenum nitride samples were obtained by solution phase ammonolysis of MoCl 5 or Mo(NMe 2) 4 to obtain the polymers. Annealing the choloroimide polymer yielded hexagonal MoN at 500 °C, rock salt Mo 2 N at 700 °C and above and a mix of both the phases at 600 °C. Imide derivatives yielded distorted cubic up to 800 °C and a mix of hexagonal and rock salt at high temperature. Nanotubes were obtained from imide derivatives up to 900 °C, while spherical particles above this temperature and for chloroimide derivatives at any temperature. CVs obtained for chloroimide derivatives show to double layer supercapacitors dominating over redox reaction, while imide derivatives were found to be redox in nature. Chloroimide samples show high capacities up to 247 F g- 1 at 2 mV s- 1 and long cycling lifetime for both the derivatives through 1000 cycles. Vanadium nitride samples were obtained by solution phase ammonolysis of V(NMe 2) 4. Annealing the polymer at various temperatures under NH 3 produced VN with standard rock salt structure at 500 - 1000 °C while distorted rock salt in the samples obtained at lower temperature.

Capacitance was found to be stable through 1000 scans only when a short potential window was used. TiN samples were produced by obtaining a precursor from solution phase ammonolysis of Ti(NMe 2) 4 and annealing the precursor under ammonia or through sol-gel route using long chain amines as the templating agents.

40|$|Heat treated {{electrical}} steel laminations have shown evidence of low ductility behavior, {{characterized by a}} small number of bends till fracture, on repeated bending tests. The laminations were produced using a new grade of {{electrical steel}} with much lower aluminum content than usual. The problem happens when the oxygen potential (measured by the dew point of the atmosphere) of the heat treatment atmosphere is abnormally high. Furthermore, ductility can be restored by a low-oxygen potential heat treatment. Although the heat treatment resulted in a loss of ductility, the magnetic properties were not deteriorated. The low ductility samples always show intergranular fracture, whereas the un-treated laminations fracture by cleavage. The low ductility is associated with the formation of silicon <b>manganese</b> <b>nitride</b> precipitates formed at grain boundaries, although they are not the cause of the low ductility. Ductility could be restored by a low dew point heat treatment but the inclusions remained in the grain boundaries. The low ductility and its recovery must be ascribed to the presence of nitrogen atoms segregated to the grain boundaries when the heat treatment atmosphere has a high oxygen potential.

The chemical bonding character is determined using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Despite the wide variation in composition, all the precipitates exhibit a hexagonal close-packed (h. c. p.) crystal structure and lattice parameters of aluminium nitride.
