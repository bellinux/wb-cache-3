In early 2001, Bridget and Deacon elope, getting married in Las Vegas, but shortly after begin drifting apart. After Brooke is rejected by Ridge and dumped by Thorne, she sinks into a depression. Deacon comforts Brooke and they end up having an affair behind Bridget's back, resulting in the birth of Hope Logan (Kim Matula), who Bridget helped deliver. Brooke marries Whip Jones (Rick Hearst) to try and cover up her adultery, but Bridget eventually learns the truth about Deacon and Brooke's affair and is livid. In spring 2002, Bridget dates C.J. Garrison, while also meeting her medical school mentor Dr. Mark MacClaine (Michael Dietz). C.J. becomes jealous of <b>Mark,</b> <b>sensing</b> that Mark has feelings for Bridget. Soon, Mark resigns as Bridget's mentor and begins a relationship with her. C.J. discovers that Mark is his long lost half-brother, leaving Bridget stuck in the middle, with both relationships ending. Bridget later has a romance with Oscar Marone (Brian Gaskill), who eventually becomes her fiancé. They left Los Angeles for Copenhagen so that Bridget could finish her medical studies, but she returns alone a few months later, disclosing that she and Oscar had ended their engagement.|$|E
