In Drosophila, the Argonaute proteins AGO 1 and AGO 2 have {{been implicated in}} post-transcriptional gene-silencing (PTGS) /RNA interference (RNAi). In this study, we found that AGO 1 and AGO 2 depletion caused the accumulation of <b>multicopied</b> enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) transgene transcripts in Drosophila S 2 cells. Depletion of AGO 1, the essential factor for miRNA biogenesis, led to an increased transcriptional rate of the transgenes. In contrast, depletion of AGO 2, the essential factor for siRNA-directed RNAi, resulted in EGFP mRNA stabilization with concomitant shortening of the EGFP mRNA poly(A) tail. Our findings suggest that AGO 1 and AGO 2 mediate <b>multicopied</b> transgene silencing by different mechanisms. Intriguingly, Dicer 2 depletion phenocopies AGO 2 depletion, {{with an increase in}} EGFP protein levels and shortening of the EGFP mRNA poly(A) tail.

40|$|Streptomyces griseus NP 4, {{which was}} derived by UV {{mutagenesis}} from strain IFO 13350, showed a bald and wrinkled colony morphology {{in response to}} glucose. Mutant NP 4 formed ectopic septa at intervals along substrate hyphae, {{and each of the}} compartments developed into a spore which was indistinguishable from an aerial spore in size, shape, and thickness of the spore wall and in susceptibility to lysozyme and heat. The ectopic spores of NP 4 formed in liquid medium differed from “submerged spores” in lysozyme sensitivity. Shotgun cloning experiments with a library of the chromosomal DNA of the parental strain and mutant NP 4 as the host gave rise to DNA fragments giving two different phenotypes; one complementing the bald phenotype of the host, and the other causing much severe wrinkled morphology in the host. Subcloning identified a gene (dasR) encoding a transcriptional repressor belonging to the GntR family that was responsible for the reversal of the bald phenotype and a gene (dasA) encoding a lipoprotein probably serving as a substrate-binding protein in an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system that was responsible for the severe wrinkled morphology. These genes were adjacent but divergently encoded. Two genes, named dasB and dasC, encoding a membrane-spanning protein were present downstream of dasA, which suggested that dasRABC comprises a gene cluster for an ABC transporter, probably for sugar import. dasR was transcribed actively during vegetative growth, and dasA was transcribed just after commencement of aerial hypha formation and during sporulation, indicating that both were developmentally regulated. Transcriptional analysis and direct sequencing of dasRA in mutant NP 4 suggested a defect of this mutant in the regulatory system to control the expression of these genes. Introduction of <b>multicopies</b> of dasA into the wild-type strain caused ectopic septation in very young substrate hyphae after only 1 day of growth and subsequent sporulation in response to glucose. The ectopic spores of the wild type had a thinner wall than those of mutant NP 4, in agreement with the observation that the former was sensitive to lysozyme and heat. Disruption of the chromosomal dasA or dasR in the wild-type strain resulted in growth as substrate mycelium, suggesting an additional role of these genes in aerial mycelium formation. The ectopic septation and sporulation in mutant NP 4 and the wild-type strain carrying <b>multicopies</b> of dasA were independent of a microbial hormone, A-factor (2 -isocapryloyl- 3 R-hydroxymethyl-γ-butyrolactone), that acts as a master switch of aerial mycelium formation and secondary metabolism...|$|R

Interestingly, intracellular persistence of both r-BCG strains was reduced in macrophages {{as compared with the}} parental BCG strain. By immunogold labeling Hly was detected in membrane structures and within the phagosomal space of macrophages. In addition, Hly was localized within cytoplasmic vacuoles outside the mycobacteria-containing phagosome of host cells infected with r-BCG pAT 261 :Hly or r-BCG pMV 306 :Hly. Hly fusions consistently colocalized with a lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein, suggesting that membrane-attack conformation of Hly was not altered. Although r-BCG pAT 261 :Hly and r-BCG pMV 306 :Hly microorganims apparently did not egress into the cytoplasmic compartment of host cells, they both improved major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of cophagocytosed soluble protein as compared with wild-type BCG microbes.

In agreement with others, we find that Tn 10 tet exhibits a negative gene dosage effect. Strains carrying <b>multicopy</b> Tn 10 tet plasmids are 4 - to 12 -fold less resistant to tetracycline than are strains with a single copy of Tn 10 in the bacterial chromosome. In addition, we find that <b>multicopy</b> tet strains are 30 - to 100 -fold less resistant to the tetracycline derivative 5 a, 6 -anhydrotetracycline than are single-copy tet strains. <b>Multicopy</b> tet strains are, in fact, 10 - to 25 -fold more sensitive to anhydrotetracycline than are strains that lack tet altogether. The hypersensitivity of multi-copy strains to anhydrotetracycline is correlated with the effectiveness of anhydrotetracycline as an inducer of tet gene expression, rather than its effectiveness as an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Anhydrotetracycline is 50 - to 100 -fold more effective than tetracycline as an inducer of tetracycline resistance and as an inducer of beta-galactosidase in strains that harbor tet-lac gene fusions. In contrast, anhydrotetracycline appears to be two- to fourfold less effective than tetracycline as an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Both anhydrotetracycline and tetracycline induce synthesis of tet polypeptides in minicells harboring <b>multicopy</b> tet plasmids. Differences between E. coli K- 12 backgrounds influence the tetracycline and anhydrotetracycline sensitivity of <b>multicopy</b> strains; ZnCl 2 enhances the tetracycline and anhydrotetracycline sensitivity of these strains two- to threefold.

40|$|AbstractIn {{addition}} to the major cyclophilin-like peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) of Escherichia coli an enzyme of very low relative molecular mass (10. 1 kDa) was discovered in this organism which gave first indication {{of the existence of}} a novel family in this enzyme class [1994, FEBS Lett. 343, 65 – 69]. In the present report we describe the chemically determined amino acid sequence of four peptides derived from the 10. 1 kDa protein by the treatment with either cyanogen bromide or endoproteinase Lys-C. Together with a continuous run of 75 amino acids starting N-terminally, the sequence of the mature enzyme, 92 residues in length, was elucidated. Cloning and determination of the primary structure of a DNA fragment encoding this enzyme were also performed. Overexpression of the enzyme by using <b>multicopies</b> of plasmid pSEP 38 in E. coli and detecting an enhanced PPIase activity attributed to the 10. 1 kDa enzyme provided additional proof that the 92 amino acid protein was a PPIase. The enzyme was called parvulin (lat. : parvulus, very small). Homology analyses indicated that several parvulin-like proteins could be found in the database screened.

Northern (RNA) blot hybridization, RNase protection assays, and in situ RNA hybridization together showed that, except for the nodD transcript, none of the other nod gene transcripts were present in bacteroids. The amount of nodD transcript in bacteroids was reduced only two- to threefold compared with that in cultured cells. Identical results were found with a Rhizobium strain harboring <b>multicopies</b> of nodD and with a strain containing a NodD protein (NodD 604) which is activated independently of flavonoids. Furthermore, it was found that mature pea nodules contain inhibitors of induced nod gene transcription but that NodD 604 was insensitive to these compounds. In situ RNA hybridization on sections from P. sativum and Vicia hirsuta nodules showed that transcription of inducible nod genes is switched off before the bacteria differentiate into bacteroids. This is unlikely to be due to limiting amounts of NodD, the absence of inducing compounds, or the presence of anti-inducers. The observed switch off of transcription during the development of symbiosis is a general phenomenon and is apparently caused by a yet unknown, negative regulation mechanism...|$|R

Repeated growth on 3 -chlorobenzoate (3 -CB) results in {{selection}} of a recombinant strain, which degrades 3 -CB better but no longer grows on 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetate (2, 4 -D). We have previously proposed that this phenotype {{is due to a}} double homologous recombination event between inverted repeats of the <b>multicopies</b> of this plasmid within the cell. One recombinant form of this plasmid (pJP 4 -F 3) explains this phenotype, since it harbors two copies of the chlorocatechol degradation tfd gene clusters, which are essential to grow on 3 -CB, but has lost the tfdA gene, encoding the first step in degradation of 2, 4 -D. The other recombinant plasmid (pJP 4 -FM) should harbor two copies of the tfdA gene but no copies of the tfd gene clusters. A molecular analysis using a multiplex PCR approach to distinguish the wild-type plasmid pJP 4 from its two recombinant forms, was carried out. Expected PCR products confirming this recombination model were found and sequenced. Few recombinant plasmid forms in cultures grown in several carbon sources were detected. Kinetic studies indicated that cells containing the recombinant plasmid pJP 4 -FM were not selectable by sole carbon source growth pressure, whereas those cells harboring recombinant plasmid pJP 4 -F 3 were selected upon growth on 3 -CB.

These transformants produced MPP mainly with the same N-linked oligosaccharides as that produced by strain F 27, but still with truncated oligosaccharides in small amounts. All of these data show that Alg 2 is an α- 1, 3 or α- 1, 6 mannosyltransferase that elongates Man 1 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol to Man 2 GlcNAc 2 -PP-Dol. The slower growth of mutant 1116 was significantly recovered on introduction of alg 2. The viability of the alg 2 mutants of the zygomycete R. pusillus makes a contrast with the lethal effect of ALG 2 mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|The {{insertion}} sequence IS 6110 {{has been shown}} to be present only in members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. In this report, probes derived from a copy of IS 6110 from M. tuberculosis, namely IS 986, have been employed to fingerprint M. tuberculosis, BCG and M. bovis. BCG vaccine strains Brazil, Japan and Russia are shown to possess two copies of the {{insertion sequence}} at the sites BCG 1 and BCG 2 respectively, while the rest of the BCG substrains possess only one copy which is present at BCG 1. M. tuberculosis isolates from Tanzania were seen to vary widely in their restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, but groupings of these isolates were achieved employing the MolMatch analysis program. Some rare but widely distributed isolates of M. tuberculosis were analyzed and their relation to BCG assessed by employing Southern blots of restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. These strains were initially thought to have IS 6110 at the BCG 2 position, but PCR analysis indicated it might be at the BCG 1 position. IS 6110 typing of M. bovis strains from animal and human sources indicated most of these strains possessed only single copy of IS 6110 which was mainly located at BCG 2 although a few strains had IS 6110 located at the BCG 2 position (but on rare occasions, at a position between BCG 1 BCG 2), while the isolates with <b>multicopies</b> had two or three copies. Strains from human origins were also observed to be more likely to harbor multiple copies of IS 6110 than those from an animal origin. Experimental demonstration of transposition of IS 986 was also achieved, giving a range of structures from cointegrates, to genuine transposition and other structures not defined by conventional transposition models. These results have been analyzed and their significance fully discussed in the ensuing chapters...|$|R
40|$|The {{study has}} shown that it is {{possible}} to introduce the heterologous CHS gene in Arabidopsis thaliana and common <b>multicopies</b> of transgenes containing plants were obtained. Analysis of the change in metabolome of CHS transgenic plants, high expression transgenic lines can be identified by markers such as flavonoids and phenylpropanoids. It is also clear that UV-A/blue light stress does not further increase the levels of these marker compounds in CHS transgenic Arabidopsis plants, whereas in wild type plants such a treatment results in increased levels of these compounds, in fact similar to that in the transgenic plants. There are certain physiological limitations in the accumulation of certain products. This thesis starts with a review of the function of CHS in plants and especially in plant resistance (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 deals with the work on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of heterologous chalcone synthase in Arabidopsis thaliana Col. 0. The effect of overexpression of CHS on the transcriptional level is discribed in this chapter. The activity of the CHS enzyme in the transgenic plants is reported in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5 metabolic profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is described. In this chapter the primary and secondary metabolites of Arabidopsis thaliana Col. 0 which can be detected by NMR are reported. Chapter 6 reports the metabolic profiling of CHS transgenic Arabidopsis. Metabolomic changes upon UV-A/blue light treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated (Chapter 7). Chapter 8 deals with the study of the effect of the non-pesticide chemical, Benzo(1, 2, 3) thiadiazole- 7 -carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) on the Arabidopsis metabolome. Finally, the general summary and discussion of thesis are given in Chapter 9. Promotor: R. Verpoorte, Co-promotores: H. J. M. Linthorst, H. K. KimWith Summary in DutchVietnamese governmen...|$|R
