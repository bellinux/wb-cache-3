Under that name, the society conducted <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches</b> on 1 September 1843 The two organizations differed in their memberships: the S.A.A.& H.S. was largely composed of men of wealth and influence while the <b>Ploughing</b> <b>Match</b> Society/S.A.A.S. was more oriented to the practical farmer.

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century to the early 20th century, {{according}} to the newspapers of the time, Undalya was a thriving rural village with reports of <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches,</b> horse racing and even a shooting at the local hotel, where the owner shot a customer who, on being refused service, had jumped the counter to serve himself.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Taylor Report in 1990, which introduced new safety measures for stadia including the regulation that they be all-seater by August 1994, the board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be economically redeveloped to meet the new standards. The work required to modernise Plough Lane would have been difficult and expensive, but not impossible as the board claimed. A supposedly temporary groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park was announced the same year, to begin for the start of 1991 - 92. Wimbledon's final first team <b>match</b> at <b>Plough</b> Lane came on 4 May 1991, coincidentally against new landlords Crystal Palace. 10,002 spectators saw Crystal Palace beat Wimbledon 3 - 0, before swarming onto the pitch to bid farewell to the ground.|$|R

50|$|Preston-next-Wingham {{is located}} 10 {{miles east of}} Canterbury, and a mile south of the Stodmarsh National Nature Reserve. The village is fairly scattered, but it still retains a local pub, a farm shop and a butchers. The nursery there has also gained a {{nationwide}} reputation for quality and rather exotic range of plants it grows. It also holds an annual steam rally and <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches</b> at Preston Court, which attract people from all across the Kent area. The village has 2 neighbouring churches, St Mildred Church and Elmstone Church, which are both 0.7 miles away.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the show {{dates back to the}} 1790s when Monmouth's {{agricultural}} society organised <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches.</b> However it was not until 1857 that it was proposed that a cattle show should be created. On 30 May 1857, the eighth Duke of Beaufort gave ten pounds and John Rolls placed twenty pounds into a fund to start the Monmouth Cattle Show. The show was first staged in the October of the same year. Rolls was President of the show for his lifetime and he was succeeded by his son John Allan Rolls in 1870.|$|R
50|$|South Ronaldsay's main {{village is}} St Margaret's Hope, Orkney's third largest settlement. It is named either after Margaret, Maid of Norway, {{the heir to}} the Scottish throne who died in Orkney age seven or {{possibly}} St. Margaret. The village has a small blacksmith's museum and is known for its annual Boys' <b>Ploughing</b> <b>Match.</b> During this event young girls and boys dressed in dark jackets play the part of the horses and young boys using miniature ploughs compete with one another at ploughing a 4-foot square rig in the nearby sands.|$|R

The society tried {{to gain access to}} Hawthorne Lodge, the original home of the Bull family, on what is now Kennedy Road. Enlisted to help was the founding President of Trent University, Thomas H. B. Symons, who is the [...] "custodian" [...] of the Bull Collection. Funds were not then available, but Symons provided various rural artifacts from Peel, some of which have been restored and displayed.|$|R
50|$|Sir Abel arrives, {{encumbered}} by his inventions, and unrolls {{a plan of}} the castle, {{which his}} son will receive from Sir Philip as a dowry. Mr Ashfield points out the many problems with the tumbledown place, but the enterprising Sir Abel is untroubled, and mentions {{that he plans to}} further local agriculture by holding a <b>ploughing</b> <b>match,</b> so that his jack-of-all-trades son Robert can demonstrate his father's newly invented plough. Robert turns up, and his father asks him why he did not meet him in London. Robert says that he did not wish to disturb him on his honeymoon. He then playfully spars with Mr Ashfield.|$|R
5000|$|In 1878 the Bung Bong Farmers' Club {{held their}} first [...] "ploughing match". There were 18 {{entries in the}} {{competition}} to plough, [...] "virgin soil, of a rich chocolate colour". It was reported, [...] "that although the ploughmen were new to competitive trials, they showed by the excellence of their work their fitness for their calling." [...] For the 1886 (and ninth) <b>ploughing</b> <b>match</b> there were 22 entries. It was held on the Abbott property, {{half a mile from}} the Bung Bong railway station ( [...] Coordinates [...] ) and [...] "the attendance was large". This time, 10 entrants used double furrow ploughs with one entrant, [...] "exhibiting Gilsman's patent rotary harrows, which attracted great attention, and were pronounced excellent implements".|$|R
50|$|The Annual General Meeting of the Agricultural Society at Payne's Hotel on 7 May 1844 {{commenced}} {{with the}} chairman Mr Frew detailing activities {{of the previous year}} - (besides the <b>ploughing</b> <b>match</b> on 1 September, a Cattle Show on 20 October and exhibition of produce on 14 February) and looked forward to an Agricultural Show in September, in competition with that of the R.A.& H.S. Conceding that unification was necessary, he argued that the only way it could occur was by members of the other Society changing sides. The tone of the meeting changed however when Mr Lambert and Mr Harkness spoke in favour of union, with the proviso that Mr. Wotherspoon should by the Secretary of the unified Society.|$|R
5000|$|Dan's [...] "tractor" [...] won {{silver medal}} at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904; and in February 1904 an Ivel Agricultural Motor won a Gold Medal in the Chester <b>Ploughing</b> <b>Match</b> held at Waverton, this being the first {{occasion}} on which a competition of that kind had been open to mechanically propelled ploughs. About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used. Over time it became heavier and more powerful, but it failed {{to keep pace with}} its rivals. The company declined after 1910, and in 1920 it went into receivership. The assets were bought by United Motor Industries Limited.|$|R

"At a <b>Ploughing</b> <b>Match</b> near Trevecka in 1754, Howell Harris {{and some}} other people from the {{locality}} discussed {{the formation of a}} Brecknockshire Agricultural Society. There was at that time a County Club for Gentlemen in existence at Brecon and in March 1755 this became the Brecknockshire Agricultural Society. Howell Harris was not one of the original members of the Society. Howell and his brother Joseph Harris, were made Honorary Members in 1756 'in recognition of the offer of soldiers and contribution to their funds'" [...] John Davies [...] "Howell Harris and the Trevecka Settlement'. [...] It is likely that a January 1756 'Report of the Agricultural Society to prepare a scheme to develop a market in the county for woollen yarns' was written for them by Joseph. This agricultural society was the second established in the country.|$|R
5|$|The {{southern}} {{group of}} islands surrounds Scapa Flow. Hoy {{is the second}} largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the highest elevation in the archipelago. The Old Man of Hoy is a well-known seastack. Burray lies {{to the east of}} Scapa Flow and is linked by causeway to South Ronaldsay, which hosts the cultural events, the Festival of the Horse and the Boys' <b>Ploughing</b> <b>Match</b> on the third Saturday in August. It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles. Graemsay and Flotta are both linked by ferry to the Mainland and Hoy, and the latter is known for its large oil terminal. South Walls has a 19th-century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre. South Ronaldsay, Burray, Glims Holm, and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers.|$|R
50|$|The show began {{life as a}} <b>ploughing</b> <b>match</b> {{between local}} farmers {{organised}} by the Evercreech Farmers Club but by the 1870s this had metamorphosed into a cattle show, appropriate given the dairy farming in the region. Separate classes existed for horses, and for cheese and butter-making. The show championed agricultural improvement and the increased saleability of two local products, Cheddar cheese and cider. Despite breaks for two World Wars, the show thrived. After the centenary year in 1952 the show gradually lost importance as older trades died and farming and food production became more industrialised. A rekindling of interest in rural life and a backlash against intensive agriculture have been suggested to explain the recent recovery of the show's fortunes, despite the competition of larger regional shows such as the Bath and West show held only 3 km away. It seems more popular than previously in the local community. Since 2002 {{there has been no}} admission fee to the show although charges are made for competition entries.|$|R
500|$|Hagley's {{population}} {{increased significantly}} during the 1850s as people moved {{both to the}} village, and to farming properties in the district. A doctor was practicing in the area by 1854, and in 1855 a school opened in the Church of England; paid for with funds raised by local residents. That year a postal service began in Hagley. David Parry was appointed postmaster on 1 July 1855, probably operating an unofficial post office from the Hagley Inn. A post office officially opened on 10 June 1865, in a building that was demolished in 1970. This building also had a store called the [...] "six day store" [...] run by the postmaster and his wife. The town gained a second hotel in 1857 with Carmody's Meander Hotel, though this remained open {{for only a few}} years. [...] In 1857 also the town's first community organisation was formed, the Hagley Ploughing Association, and regular <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches</b> began. A second church was built, a Methodist Chapel on the Westbury road, in 1859.|$|R
40|$|This {{new study}} {{looks at the}} ways in which the years {{surrounding}} the First World War shaped the lives of the rural workforce in Britain and how the patriotism unleashed by the war was used by those in power to blur class divisions and build conservative attitudes in rural communities. Using the area of Shropshire and the Marches as a focus, the book looks at farmworkers and their trade unions, the structures of agrarian economy, class divisions, local loyalties, cultural institutions and political organisations. From 1917 the growing power of the farmworkers’ unions and the rural labour movement mounted a challenge to the landed elites and sought a radical change from rural poverty. The author shows how the elites met this threat dynamically by creating a range of new village institutions, such as <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches,</b> Women’s Institutes, village halls, war memorials and the British Legion. The extraordinary growth of rural radicalism at the end of the war was diffused by popular conservatism and local patriotism. Influenced by wartime experiences, the period 1900 – 1930 saw a change in rural society from parochial concerns to a new sense of loyalty to county and to the English nation...|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Canberra Show {{can trace}} its origins {{back to the}} first events {{organised}} by the Ginninderra Farmers' Union, which was formed in 1905. At first, it ran sporting events at Ginninderra, including <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches,</b> but in 1909 it held its first annual agricultural show. These shows were discontinued because of the First World War, despite the 1915 event being attended by 1,200 people and raising much-needed funds for the war effort. One of the driving forces, from the days of the Ginninderra Farmers' Union until 1944, was the Ginninderra blacksmith, Harry Curran, father of Babe Curran of Deasland, the district's preeminent wool grower. The Advance Hall and District Association organised a small district show in 1924 and 1925. The show of 1927 is officially recognised by the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society as the [...] "inaugural" [...] Canberra Show. The show continued to grow: the first two-day show was held in 1931, and the 1932 show was opened by Prime Minister J.A. Lyons. After a hiatus in the Second World War, the show resumed with the support of leading sheep breeder Sir Walter Merriman. In 1964 the show moved to its permanent home at the Canberra Showground. The Show was given [...] "Royal" [...] status in 1979.|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought there}} was enough {{suggestion}} of decay in that to satisfy a jackal, and to me there was something infinitely pathetic and appealing {{in the idea of}} the egg having a sort of St. Luke's summer of commercial usefulness. But the Duchess begged me to leave out any political allusions; she's the president of a Women's Something or other, and she said it might be taken as an endorsement of deplorable methods. I never can remember which Party Irene discourages with her support, but I shan't forget an occasion when I was staying at her place and she gave me a pamphlet to leave at the house of a doubtful voter, and some grapes and things for a woman who was suffering from a chill {{on the top of a}} patent medicine. I thought it much cleverer to give the grapes to the former and the political literature to the sick woman, and the Duchess was quite absurdly annoyed about it afterwards. It seems the leaflet was addressed [...] "To those about to wobble"--I wasn't responsible for the silly title of the thing--and the woman never recovered; anyway, the voter was completely won over by the grapes and jellies, and I think that should have balanced matters. The Duchess called it bribery, and said it might have compromised the candidate she was supporting; he was expected to subscribe to church funds and chapel funds, and football and cricket clubs and regattas, and bazaars and beanfeasts and bellringers, and poultry shows and <b>ploughing</b> <b>matches,</b> and reading-rooms and choir outings, and shooting trophies and testimonials, and anything of that sort; but bribery would not have been tolerated.|$|R
