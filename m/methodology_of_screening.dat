40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{diagnosed}} in American males. However, current methods of screening for prostate cancer have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing patients with prostate cancer. A new <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> for prostate cancer was formulated by developing a method and device to quantify the traditional digital rectal exam. The Quantitative Digital Rectal Exam (QDRE) measures the relative compliance at discrete locations on the posterior surface of the prostate. The Test Head of the QDRE indents the prostate and measures the pressure distribution across a rigid disk using an matrix of pressure transducers. The position of the Test Head is tracked by the Location Tracking System. The Mapping Algorithm analyzes each Test Head measurement and the position information recorded by the Location Tracking System, and generates a map showing magnitudes and locations of relative compliance across the measured surface of the prostate. A proof of concept test used a mock-up of the Test Head, a mechanical Location Tracking System and a rudimentary Mapping Algorithm to examine a clinical model of the prostate which had one nodule. The results were presented as a map of the measured surface of the prostate model, and results showed the size of the nodule (6. 4 mm in diameter) and the relative compliance of the nodule (0. 08 relative to the healthy tissue of the model), as well as the location within the measured surface. by Stacy J.

40|$|Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), {{also known}} as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease (ROW), is an {{autosomal}} dominant disease with multi-systemic vascular dysplasia characterized by mucocutaneous telangiectasia, arteriovenous malformations and recurrent spontaneous epistaxis (nosebleeds). Most cases of HHT result from mutations in the ENG, ACVLR 1 or SMAD 4 genes. Affected individuals suffer from multi-systemic vascular lesions, known as telangiectases, characterized by focal dilation of post-capillary veins, that are susceptible to rupture and haemorrhage because of weak vessel walls and high perfusion pressures, leading to major morbidity and mortality. Telangiectasia in the nasal mucosa and gastro-intestinal tract frequently haemorrhage, leading to chronic iron deficiency anaemia which may even be transfusion-dependent. This thesis focuses on several aspects that characterizing the HHT patient to enable more research into diagnostic and treatments modalities. Life expectancy of patients is evaluated, differentiating in the underlying genetic mutation. Data show a normal life expectancy of unscreened patients with a ACVRL 1 mutation and a lower life expectancy in unscreened and untreated patients with an ENG mutation. The prevalence of malignancies is analysed in an international patient cohort showing a higher prevalence of breast cancer but far lower prevalence of lung cancer, despite more severe smoking habits. The relationship between pulmonary arterial hypertension and HHT is described. This is a rare but severe complication that can arise, especially in patients with an ACVRL 1 mutation. The question on how to screen children is addressed and the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> in the St. Antonius Hospital is evaluated. The use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is discussed, which is particularly relevant considering the dilemma between protection for other comorbidities, like stroke due to cardiac arrhythmias, {{and the amount of}} blood loss patients already suffer without blood thinners. The use of Thalidomide (or Softenon) is evaluated, not only in its effectivity to treat epistaxis but also the side effects patients suffer. The final chapter identifies factors influencing the severity of epistaxis in HHT patient. Numerous dietary items, including alcohol, spices and foods high in salicylates, were identified as being detrimental to the epistaxis severity. This thesis concludes that ongoing advances in medical and scientific understanding of this hereditary disease help to continuously improve patient care. Future challenges lie in several areas including genetics and their relation to the widely variable HHT phenotype, optimisation of screening, diagnostics and treatment, and improving life expectancy and quality of life of the current and future generations affected by HHT...|$|E

The results showed that defining exposure as "ever/never " screened produced, as expected, a serious bias in favor <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Defining exposure as being screened no later than the time the case's cancer is diagnosed has a serious bias against screening. An alternative exposure definition—screening can occur no later than the time the case would have been clinically diagnosed—eliminates the bias against screening. Further, the results showed that the type of age matching and the time scale used can produce a bias against screening and that this bias can be quite strong when case-control studies are performed in populations with a periodic screening program that is the only source <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Finally, control eligibility criteria had little effect.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a high-throughput density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) <b>methodology</b> capable <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> compounds for their dielectric properties. The electronic and ionic dielectric tensors are calculated for 88 compounds, where the eigenvalues {{of the total}} dielectric tensors are compared with single crystal and polycrystalline experimental values reported in the literature. We find that GGA/PBE has a smaller mean average deviation from experiments (MARD = 16. 2 %) when compared to LDA. The prediction accuracy of DFPT is lowest for compounds that exhibit complex structural relaxation effects (e. g., octahedra rotation in perovskites) and/or strong anharmonicity. Despite some discrepancies between DFPT results and reported experimental values, the high-throughput methodology {{is found to be}} useful in identifying interesting compounds by ranking. This is demonstrated by the high Spearman correlation factor (ρ = 0. 92).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of developmental timetables relevant to hearing and of current pediatric audiological techniques and practices. The first sections summarize structural and functional development of the auditory pathway and the development of primary auditory processing. These developmental sequences appear to follow similar paths in humans and animals. Speech and music perception involve more complex processing and are strongly influenced by experience. Hearing disorders affect the perception of complex sounds in a variety of ways, depending on the site(s) of lesions. Early onset hearing impairment, including conductive loss from chronic otitis media, can seriously impede language development. Language cannot develop normally without adequate speech stimulation. Sensitive and inexpensive techniques are available for performing neonatal hearing screening, and early intervention has a positive effect on development of language skills in hearing-impaired children. Thus, the National Institute of Health has recommended nationwide universal newborns hearing screening.

40|$|The {{mortality}} rate arising {{from breast cancer}} has increased within {{the past few decades}} across the Asian countries. This study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness <b>of</b> mammography <b>screening</b> in reducing the {{mortality rate}} among breast cancer patients in Asia. The research involved a narrative review of secondary data of studies that addressed the effectiveness mammography screening. An inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in the study whereby sources published between 2000 and 2015 were reviewed in a comparative analysis of mammography effectiveness among women in Asia. The researcher reviewed studies from Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, China, and Japan. For comparison purposes in the discussion, previous related studies from Europe were reviewed. Studies not conducted in Asia and Europe was excluded. The findings were reviewed across all age groups and were analysed thematically in a case-by-case interpretation based of the research questions. Thematic analysis was used in the analysis of data. The effectiveness of mammography was evaluated using the specificity and sensitivity parameters separately and in combination with other screening techniques such as the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and physical examination. Findings from this study concurred to those of European countries on the effectiveness of mammography. The use <b>of</b> mammography <b>screening</b> considerably reduced breast cancer mortality rate. Although the use <b>of</b> mammography <b>screening</b> displayed substantial success, the findings showed that the use of mammography in combination with other screening techniques yielded far much accurate and better results than when mammography was used alone. For instance, the mortality rate for a combination of mammography and self-evaluation was found to be 32. 7 % in Asian women. The use of ultrasound and MRI proved to better compliment the use of mammography by enhancing its specificity and sensitivity. Ultrasound alone had a specificity of 89. 9 %, but its specificity increased to 98. 1 % when used together with mammography in Asian studies. Likewise, in European studies, a combination of mammography, MRI, and Ultrasound increased the sensitivity to 93 %. The findings confirmed a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate as a result <b>of</b> using mammography <b>screening.</b> Therefore, the researcher recommends that mammography screening should be used in combination with other <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> so as to achieve higher sensitivity and specificity. However, the cost and effectiveness of implementing the combined interventions should be considered. The researcher also recommends education of the public in order to increase awareness and knowledge of breast cancer among Asian women which would increase participation in breast cancer screening modalities. Health related concerns arising from mammography screening practice emerged due to the radiation. The findings indicated that radiations could trigger cancers that were initially absent. Cases of false positive results and overlooked breast cancers among women were found to be on the rise. More research should be conducted to determine the most effective technique that can be combined with mammography <b>screening.</b> The use <b>of</b> mammography <b>screening</b> will greatly reduce the breast cancer mortality rate among the Asian women. Additionally, raising women’s awareness about the importance <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> and early detection of breast tumour is vital in reducing the mortality rate of breast cancer. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

After screening out several potential engineering sites, an AHP ranking method {{was applied for}} ranking and selecting the preferred candidate {{on account of the}} economy factors, safety requirements, storage effectiveness, and potential storage capacity volume etc. As a result, preferred engineering site for pilot and demonstration plans were recommended. A deep saline aquifer under a Miocene basin near the western coast of Central Taiwan with estimated storage capacity up to 4  Gt- CO 2 is now regarded as a very high potential storage reservoir with advantages of its high capacity volume, geological stability and the short distance away from the largest emission plants.

40|$|Network Screening is {{increasingly}} {{being used by}} road authorities {{as a tool to}} assist in their planning of investments in road improvements. Network screening can be defined as the process of measuring safety within a road network, with the objective of targeting road improvements to achieve the maximum cost-benefit. In British Columbia, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) has been conducting network screening to prioritize locations for road safety improvements since the early 1990 ’s. Through its Road Improvement Program, ICBC partners with municipalities to identify and cost-share in upgrades to intersections and corridors. Results have shown significant savings in insurance claims and societal costs and returns on investment, through reduced injury and property damage collisions. In Alberta, the Alberta Motor Association has {{played a key role in}} assisting municipalities to identify improvements that can reduce insurance and societal costs associated with collisions, and several municipalities have subsequently set up their own network screening programs. Opus Hamilton has developed methodologies for and conducted numerous network screening exercises on behalf of several road agencies in both British Columbia and Alberta.

40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the nature of}} pictorial space within contemporary painting. It proposes, {{through the use of}} a studio-based investigation, a new condition of spatial construction that has been interpreted through the representational <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> the <b>screen.</b> It argues that the screen has become a dominant paradigm in the creation and articulation of an ambivalent condition of spatiality. This ambivalent condition is suggested in a body of painterly works as a closed cycle of movement in which objects and detail are dislocated within/on the pictorial plane whilst concurrently grounded in an illusion of reality. This project also establishes a perception of anxiety and spatial unease as being indicative of contemporary experience. This is instituted through the concept of something being a guise for "Nothing" and "Nothing" being a comment on contemporary experience. It argues that the something of "Nothing" is also a context for "otherness". The principle vehicle for this investigation is the inanimate figurine (toy soldier). It is used, within this context, as a paradoxical object from popular culture; it alludes to the current climate of unrest and quotes from propaganda imagery and other military representations within visual culture. The analysis of pictorial space was initiated through observation and interpretation of painting practices and it was within this examination that a definition <b>of</b> the <b>screen</b> was located. The screen is defined as a <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> literal and metaphorical representations that are part of an on-going evolution in pictorial construction. These practices are discussed under the related areas of the flat/deep space of the screen; the screen as a literal painterly boundary; and the screen as a metaphorical barrier. Other issues that are considered here are a re-definition of flatness; the allusion to "otherness"; and the perception of anxiety and unease in contemporary painting. This research has developed practical strategies that contextualize these issues by subverting traditional notations of figure/ground relationships. They include both technical and conceptual applications such as the concurrent use of a variety of spatial paradigms, decoration (camouflage patterning), the cut-out silhouette, an original paint surface (the mica glaze/ pearl surface) and an overall sense of spatial compression within the pictorial plane...|$|R
40|$|We report two {{improved}} assays for {{in vitro}} and in vivo <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> chemicals with potential anti-malarial activity against the blood {{stages of the}} rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. These assays {{are based on the}} determination of luciferase activity (luminescence) in small blood samples containing transgenic blood stage parasites that express luciferase under the control of a promoter that is either schizont-specific (anw- 1) or constitutive (eef 1 alpha a). Assay 1, the in vitro drug luminescence (ITDL) assay, measured the success of schizont maturation in the presence of candidate drugs quantifying luciferase activity in mature schizonts only (ama- 1 promoter). The ITDL assay generated drug-inhibition curves and EC 50 values comparable to those obtained with standard in vitro drug-susceptibility assays. The second assay, the in vivo drug-luminescence (IVDL) assay, measured parasite growth in vivo in a standard 4 -day suppressive drug test, monitored by measuring the constitutive luciferase activity of circulating parasites (eef 1 alpha a promoter). The IVDL assay generates growth-curves that are identical to those obtained by manual counting of parasites in Giemsa-stained smears. The reading of luminescence assays is rapid, requires a minimal number of handling steps and no experience with parasite morphology or handling fluorescence-activated cell sorters, produces no radioactive waste and test-plates can be stored for prolonged periods before processing. Both tests are suitable for use in larger-scale in vitro and in vivo <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> drugs.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> Genome-Wide Association <b>Screening</b> (GWAS) {{has been}} applied {{for more than a}} decade. Translation to {{clinical}} utility has been limited, especially in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It has become standard practice in the analyses of more than two dozen AD GWAS studies to exclude the apolipoprotein E (APOE) region because of its extraordinary statistical support, unique thus far in complex human diseases. New genes associated with AD are proposed frequently based on SNPs associated with odds ratio (OR)  <  1. 2. Most of these SNPs are not located within the associated gene exons or introns but are located variable distances away. Often pathologic hypotheses for these genes are presented, with little or no experimental support. By eliminating the analyses of the APOE-TOMM 40 linkage disequilibrium region, the relationship and data of several genes that are co-located in that LD region have been largely ignored. Early negative interpretations limited the interest of understanding the genetic data derived from GWAS, particularly regarding the TOMM 40 gene. This commentary describes the history and problem(s) in interpretation of the genetic interrogation of the “APOE” region and provides insight into a metabolic mitochondrial basis for the etiology of AD using both APOE and TOMM 40 genetics...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{improving}} the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> chironomid deformation <b>screening</b> as a biomonitoring tool in sediment toxicity assessment. Head capsule deformities were investigated in Chironomus riparius larvae in three contaminated Danish streams. A new scoring system for deformities of the mentum, mandibles and pecten was designed, {{in order to}} objectify and improve previously published scoring methods. A comparison of this new scoring system with deformation frequencies indicated that the more laborious scoring of deformities {{did not result in}} a higher resolution than the simple frequency counts of deformed larvae. However, the different mouthparts seem to react independently to pollution stress and display specific deformation frequency profiles. Hence, a separate calculation of their deformation frequencies remains essential for a correct evaluation. Using cluster analysis, all mouthpart deformation frequencies were combined into one sediment classification scheme. This classification could be adequately explained by the different levels of sediment contamination, as indicated by metal analyses and site-specific pollutant sources. However, when only mentum deformation frequencies were used, an almost identical classification was obtained. Deformation in mandibles, pecten, premandibles and antennae did not display a consistent relationship with sediment contamination by the paper mill. Hence, in the present study, a simple calculation of the frequencies of mentum deformation was the most efficient strategy for sediment toxicity assessment. status: publishe...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> methods in decreasing the mortality of oral cancer. A systematic review on the effectiveness <b>of</b> oral cancer <b>screening</b> was performed using all publications in MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, EMBASE, and Cochrane CCTR between 1966 and September 2002. The evidence was evaluated using the standardized <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> the Cochrane Collaboration. The search strategy revealed 1, 389 citations. From these, 100 potentially relevant articles were selected for review. However, only one randomized controlled study using visual examina-tion as the method for screening fulfilled the selection criteria.

40|$|Screening for {{coronary}} artery disease or for other forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a superficially attractive idea that has been proposed by many cardiovascular experts. However, guidelines panels that employ medical outcomes and evaluation of {{a full range of}} benefits, risks, and harms <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> have repeatedly advised against the adoption <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> programs for CVDs. In this commentary, we discuss the limitations of the predictive capacity <b>of</b> selected cardiovascular <b>screening</b> tools. Possible harms and risks <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> tools are also discussed, and the conclusion is reached that available evidence does not provide support for adoption of a strategy <b>of</b> routine <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> asymptomatic people for CVD with available testing tools or devices. More evidence is needed to justify a policy <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> for CVD...|$|R

Title of {{rigorous}} thesis: Development {{of a novel}} {{spectrophotometric method}} for zinc ions chelatation screening Zinc {{is the only one}} trace metal, which is a cofactor for over 300 active enzymes. It is localized in all tissues and organs. Zinc deficiency can cause many diseases such as e. g. diabetes, disorders of hemostasis, and cancer. The toxicity of zinc is usually considered to be mild, but the imbalance of zinc, e. g. its presence in extracellular plaques by patients with Alzheimer's disease suggests a more complex relationship. The purpose of this work was to create a new spectrophotometric <b>methodology</b> for <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> chelation of zinc ions. The first step was to measure the spectra of the selected indicator dithizone and its complex with zinc and finding the ideal wavelengths for accurate determination of the linear concentration of zinc ions. Thereafter, the linearity was checked at two selected wavelengths. After that, the stability of dithizone and its complex with zinc was measured in relationship to time. The final phase was to validate the methodology on two known zinc chelators which were [...] ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Analysing {{trends in}} {{population}} breast cancer mortality statistics appears a simple {{method of estimating}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> mammographic <b>screening</b> programmes. We reviewed such studies <b>of</b> population-based <b>screening</b> in Europe to assess their value. METHODS: A literature review identified 17 papers, of which 12 provided quantitative estimates of the impact <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Due to differences in comparisons and outcome measures, no pooled estimate of effectiveness was calculated. RESULTS: Comparisons included breast cancer mortality {{before and after the}} introduction <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> trends in early and late starting areas and trends in age groups affected and unaffected by screening. Studies that calculated the percentage annual change after the start <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> found reductions <b>of</b> 1 - 9 % per year (1 %, 2. 3 - 2. 8 % and 9 % for those with adequate follow-up). Of studies that compared mortality in time periods before and after introduction <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> three single country studies all had adequate follow-up and estimated mortality reductions ranging from 28 % to 36 %. Limitations of studies of population mortality rates include the inability to exclude deaths in women with breast cancer diagnosed before invitation to screening, diluting any observable impact <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> and the gradual implementation <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> in a country or region. CONCLUSIONS: Although analysing population breast cancer mortality rates over time can be a first step in examining changes following the introduction <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> this method is of limited value for assessment <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> impact. Other methods and individual data are necessary to properly quantify the effect...|$|R
40|$|The term'methodology'is {{sometimes}} {{given two}} diametrically opposed meanings, well characterized by Mark Blaug {{in the preface}} of a very informative book devoted to the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> economics. This {{is also the case}} with the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> design. One can find studies in which'the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> design'is simply a method or methods of design, given a fancy name to make it or them appear more scientific. Authors of such studies should not confuse their readers by taking methodological studies to mean technicalities of design or demanding that their interpretation and assessment of so-called'practical applicability'should follow this criterion. The <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> design - as we understand it has parallels in the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> Blaug's economics, the philosophy of practical science, the applied sciences or the sciences of artificial objects or artefacts. Understood this way, the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> design is neither the method of practising design nor an instruction for its use but a theoretical reflection - in the meaning given to methodology by the philosophy of science - of design. In this connection a study <b>of</b> the <b>methodology</b> <b>of</b> design should be provided with the subtitle,'How researchers of practical sciences and designers understand the concept of changes'...|$|R
