In 1920, Tomosada Iritani (1887–1957) administered a questionnaire to 43 persons dealing with Zen practice, in what was probably the first empirical psychological study of Zen.

50|$|To {{an outside}} reader, <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> may seem {{straightforward}} and simple. However, {{this is not}} a 'just do it' therapy or an early form of mindfulness therapy. <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> offers a philosophical orientation and experiential method that moves clients to 'follow Nature' and act according to the 'laws of emotion' that he described; in this way one can live according to her or his own essential nature'. Morita describes his own therapy as follows.|$|E

50|$|<b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> directs one's {{attention}} receptively to what reality {{brings in}} each moment—a {{focus on the}} present, avoiding intellectualising. Simple seeing what is (without judging), allows for active responding to what needs doing. Most therapies strive to reduce symptoms. <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy,</b> however, aims at building character to enable one to take action responsively in life regardless of symptoms, natural fears, and wishes. Character is determined by behavior, by what one does. Dogmatic patterns of collapse are replaced with the flexibility to call upon courage and empowerment. Decisions become grounded in purpose rather than influenced by the fluid flow of feelings.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, shinkei-suijaku {{is treated}} with <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> {{involving}} mandatory rest and isolation, followed by progressively more difficult work, and a resumption {{of a previous}} social role. The diagnosis is sometimes used as a disguise for serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and mood disorders.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese {{psychiatrist}} Shoma Morita, {{who trained}} in Zen meditation, developed <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment.

50|$|Shoma Morita, M.D. (1874-1938) was a psychiatrist, researcher, philosopher, and {{academic}} department chair at Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo. Morita's personal training in Zen influenced his teachings, yet <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is not a}} Zen practice. However, his treatment contains paradoxical methods that reflect Zen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> is an ecological, purpose-centered, response-oriented therapy {{created through}} case-based {{research}} by Shoma Morita, M.D. (1874-1938). Morita developed {{his theory of}} consciousness and medically-grounded four-stage progressive therapeutic method with as much rigor as his contemporaries, Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Anna Freud, Carl Jung, Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and Wilfred Bion.|$|E
50|$|The {{emphasis}} of ACT on ongoing present moment awareness, valued directions and committed action {{is similar to}} other psycho-therapeutic approaches that, unlike ACT, are not as focused on outcome research or consciously linked to a basic behavioral science program, including approaches such as Gestalt therapy, <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> and Voice Dialogue, IFS and others.|$|E
50|$|Morita Masatake (1874-1938), {{also read}} as Morita Shoma (森田 正馬), was a {{contemporary}} of Sigmund Freud {{and the founder}} of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy,</b> a branch of clinical psychology strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism. In his capacity as the head of psychiatry for a large Tokyo hospital, Morita began developing his methods while working with sufferers of shinkeishitsu, or anxiety disorders with a hypochondriac base.|$|E
50|$|Karen Horney, an American psychologist, {{acknowledged}} {{the usefulness of}} Morita's techniques as did, by extension, Albert Ellis. Perhaps most notable of Morita's followers is David K. Reynolds. Dr. Reynolds synthesized parts of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> along with the practice of Naikan into Constructive Living, an educational method intended for English speaking Westerners.

50|$|Ultimately, the {{successful}} student of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> learns {{to accept the}} internal fluctuations of thoughts and feelings and ground his or her behavior in reality {{and the purpose of}} the moment.

5000|$|In 1958-59, Caudill's studies {{focused on}} three {{psychiatric}} hospitals with varied theoretical orientations {{and methods of}} treatment.

50|$|In <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{character}} is developed by cultivating awareness, decentralizing the self, and honoring {{the rhythms of}} the natural environment and one's own diurnal rhythms. Aspects of mindfulness are contained in knowing what is controllable {{and what is not}} controllable, and seeing what is so without attachment to expectations. Knowing what one is doing, knowing what the situation is requiring, and knowing {{the relationship between the two}} are quintessential to self-validation, effective living, and personal fulfillment. Character is developed as one moves from being feeling-centered to being purpose-centered. A feeling-centered person attends to feelings to such an extent that the concern for self-protection reigns over decisions and perceptions. Given the human condition, change, pain, and pleasure are natural experiences. Indeed, emotions are a rich type of experience and a valuable source of information. Feelings are acknowledged even when what is to be done requires not acting on them. Constructive action is no longer put on hold in order to process or cope with symptoms or feelings. The individual can focus on the full scope of the present moment as the guide for determining what needs to be done.|$|E
40|$|This {{critical}} {{literature review}} examines the related cross-cultural issues {{linked to the}} traditional form of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy,</b> {{as it has been}} adapted to western contexts. Some differences between Japanese and Western cultures are explored to determine whether <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> techniques can be used with Western clients. Two essential questions are addressed: How can <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> be adapted into a western context? How can Western mental health professionals be adaptive, flexible, and culturally sensitive when using <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy?</b> The author looks at Eastern versus Western philosophical approaches and <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> being used with inpatient and outpatient clients in Japan and outpatient settings in Western cultures to help answer the first question. ·The second question is reviewed by addressing literature looking at how <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> and Western psychotherapy models are similar and different. The author also explores literature discussing the client-therapist relationship to help answer the second question.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to {{showcase}} best practice in intervention development by illustrating a systematic, iterative, person-based approach to optimising intervention acceptability and feasibility, as applied to the cross-cultural adaptation of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> for depression and anxiety. METHODS: We developed the UK <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> outpatient protocol over four stages integrating literature synthesis and qualitative research. Firstly, we conducted in-depth interviews combining qualitative and cognitive interviewing techniques, utilising vignettes of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> being delivered and analysed using Framework analysis to investigate potential patients and therapists' perceptions of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy.</b> Secondly, we developed qualitative themes into recommendations for optimising <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> and synthesised <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> literature in line with these to develop a draft protocol. Thirdly, we conducted repeat interviews with therapists to investigate their views of the protocol. Finally, we responded to these qualitative themes through protocol modification and tailoring our therapist training programme. RESULTS: As a consequence of literature describing <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> and participants' perceptions of the approach, we developed both a therapy protocol and therapist training programme which were fit for purpose in proceeding to a UK-based <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> feasibility study. As per our key qualitative findings and resulting recommendations, we structured our protocol according to the four-phased model of <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy,</b> included detailed guidance and warning points, and supported therapists in managing patients' expectations of the approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic approach towards optimising intervention acceptability and feasibility prioritises the perspectives of those who will deliver and receive the intervention. Thus, we both showcase best practice in intervention development and demonstrate the application of this process to the careful cross-cultural adaptation of an intervention in which balancing both optimisation of and adherence to the approach are key. This presentation of a generalisable process in a transparent and replicable manner will be of interest to those both developing and evaluating complex interventions in the future.

40|$|Published onlineJournal ArticleRandomized Controlled TrialResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from BioMed Central via the DOI in this record. BACKGROUND: <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy,</b> a {{psychological}} therapy for common mental health problems, is in sharp contrast to established western psychotherapeutic approaches in teaching that undesired symptoms are natural features of human emotion rather than something to control or eliminate. The approach is widely practiced in Japan, but untested and little known in the UK. A clinical trial of <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy</b> is required to establish the effectiveness of <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy</b> for a UK population. However, a number of methodological, procedural and clinical uncertainties associated with such a trial first require addressing. METHODS/DESIGN: The Morita Trial is a mixed methods study addressing the uncertainties associated with an evaluation of <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy</b> compared with treatment as usual for depression and anxiety. We will undertake a pilot randomised controlled trial with embedded qualitative study. Sixty participants with major depressive disorder, with or without anxiety disorders, will be recruited predominantly from General Practice record searches and randomised to receive <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy</b> plus treatment as usual or treatment as usual alone. <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy</b> will be delivered by accredited psychological therapists. We will collect quantitative data on depressive symptoms, general anxiety, attitudes and quality of life at baseline and four month follow-up to inform future sample size calculations; and rates of recruitment, retention and treatment adherence to assess feasibility. We will undertake qualitative interviews in parallel with the trial, to explore people's views of <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy.</b> We will conduct separate and integrated analyses on the quantitative and qualitative data. DISCUSSION: The outcomes of this study will prepare the ground for the design and conduct of a fully-powered evaluation of <b>Morita</b> <b>Therapy</b> plus treatment as usual versus treatment as usual alone, or inform a conclusion that such a trial is not feasible and/or appropriate. We will obtain a more comprehensive understanding of these issues than would be possible from either a quantitative or qualitative approach alone.

40|$|<b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> is a Japanese {{therapy for}} anxiety-related {{problems}} developed by Shoma Morita (1874 - 1938) in the 1910 's. Through didactic discussion and confrontation, it modifies anxious clients ' self-critical thinking and unproductive self-preoccupation. Clients in <b>Morita</b> <b>therapy</b> {{are encouraged to}} appreciate the existential and self-actualizing meaning of anxiety and to translate it into constructive action instead of resisting and becoming preoccupied with anxiety symptoms in a self-defeating manner. Using a multiple baseline design across two target problems (fear of speaking in groups and fear of approaching strangers), the present study examined therapeutic changes associated with brief (3 -session) Morita intervention in a socially anxious client. Notable changes regarding both problems were observed immediately after intervention and in the follow-up phase in the client's ratings on (1) acceptance of anxiety, (2) problem severity, and (3) effectiveness in coping with anxiety problems. Qualitative {{information provided by the}} client suggested the lasting therapeutic impact of Morita-based interpretation of anxiety and confrontation.
