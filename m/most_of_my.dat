[...] Frederick had discovered the use of operational maneuvers and with a fraction of his entire force3,500 horsemen, 18 artillery pieces, and three battalions of infantryhad defeated army {{of two of the}} strongest European powers.

500|$|The novel {{began its}} {{life as a}} 20,000-word novella, which was prize-winning in its own right. As it was an awkward length for a novel, {{publishers}} requested that Anderson extend the story, which she did following a trip to London in 1974. In 1975 Tirra Lirra was broadcast as a radio play, and in 1977 Macmillan Publishers in Melbourne accepted it for publishing. In the year of its publication, Tirra Lirra won the Australian Natives' Association Literary Award, and the Miles Franklin Literary Award, Australia's most prestigious literary award.

500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I {{got in touch with}} during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
500|$|Off track, the {{argument}} {{over the new}} rules implemented at the Grand Prix and the inclusion of lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward was renewed. FIA president Max Mosley published a letter dated from 19 October to Ron Dennis which accused him of damaging the image of Formula One with his recent stream of comments over the issues. Mosley also defended Race Director Charlie Whiting's announcement that marshals could use racing flags to caution drivers over unsportsmanlike behaviour. Dennis responded by apologising for his comments, saying {{that he did not}} intend to bring Formula One into disrepute and cause disrespect to Causo. [...] "It certainly has not ever been my intention to damage a sport to which I have devoted <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> working life." [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Potter {{produced}} two books per annum for Warne, but by 1910 she was juggling {{the demands of}} aging parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of the big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E
500|$|In May 1970, Clancy {{was traded}} by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming. [...] Clancy had begun a {{business}} selling {{real estate in}} Miami during the offseason, {{but he also had}} ties to Green Bay. [...] He had attended St. Matthew's Grade School there in the 1950s. [...] Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade: [...] "I don't like to leave Miami. [...] You hate to have to pick up and move and I definitely plan to come back (to Miami) in the offseason. [...] But <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dad's family are still up in Green Bay. [...] He's always wanted me to play for the Packers." [...] Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938. [...] Wisconsin columnist Lee Remmel said Clancy [...] "surveys the football scene with a pair of cool, calculating blue eyes and a computer-type mind." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. She published only one book in 1910, The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and wrote to a friend on New Year's Day 1911:I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and when I was at Bowness last summer I spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work.|$|E

500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Pitti-Sing in The Mikado (1885–87), one of the [...] "three little maids from school." [...] Sometimes, {{inspiration}} for plot points in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was provided by characteristics of the performers themselves. [...] For instance, Gilbert noted {{in an interview that}} the fact that the female singers to be engaged for The Mikado, Leonora Braham, Bond, and Sybil Grey, were all of short stature inspired him to make them schoolgirls—three [...] "little" [...] maids—and to treat them as a closely linked trio throughout the work as much as possible. [...] Bond, however, knew how to stand out on stage. [...] During preparations for The Mikado, she persuaded the wardrobe mistress to make the obi of her costume twice as big as that of the other [...] "little maids". [...] She wrote: [...] "I made the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> big, big bow, turning my back to the audience whenever I got a chance, and waggling it. [...] The gallery was delighted, but I nearly got the sack for that prank! [...] However, I did get noticed, which was what I wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Shakira {{getting out of}} bed in the middle of a full-moon night. Her nails begin to grow and she is shown lacing a pair of boots. Shakira then enters a closet, which leads to the inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near to the end of the video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E
