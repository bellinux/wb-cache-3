500|$|Klowden {{recalled}} {{later that}} [...] "he was very {{down in the}} dumps about his wife. [...] He told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had met Northrup. He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he {{woke up in the morning}} he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{was pleased}} that Wyman directed, as he found it nice to have [...] "somebody who's in the writer's room day-in and day-out and knows the show so intimately, come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information." [...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in just looks, and he told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was gonna shoot it so I could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to recollect. Something {{happened}} in the summer time, {{when we were talking}} at Netherwoods. I mean when that impudent master at the school showed his suspicions of <b>me.</b> (Lord! <b>how</b> <b>he</b> frightened <b>me,</b> when he turned up afterward at Sir Jervis's house.) You must have seen yourself <b>he</b> suspected <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> did <b>he</b> show it?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> {{often told}} <b>me</b> <b>how</b> badly <b>he</b> {{felt about the}} people he frightened.|$|R
60|$|With that he {{crashed into}} the cedar {{in a way that}} showed <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{impervious}} <b>he</b> was to slashing branches, sharp as thorns, and steep descent and peril.|$|R
2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me what I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Atlanta {{acoustic}} {{music scene}} {{at the time was}} split between the Trackside and The Freight Room. [...] When The Freight Room closed in 1992, Conoscenti, Wilcox, and most of Atlanta's other notable musicians like The Indigo Girls, Shawn Mullins, Kristian Bush, and others moved to Eddie's Attic. His first record, Carved in Stone on the DB Records label was released that year, followed by Beneath Your Moon. In 1994, he met Ellis Paul at Eddie's, and the two have been close friends and collaborators since. Conoscenti frequently plays guitar at Paul's shows around the country, including accompanying Paul for many years at his traditional New Year's Eve shows at Club Passim in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Conoscenti left Atlanta that year and toured the country almost continuously until 2004. [...] During that time he released Boxes of Bones, My Brilliant Masterpiece, One for the Road, Mysterious Light, Paradox of Grace, Extremely Live at Eddie's Attic, and Turn Here. Mysterious Light climbed into the top 20 albums played by folk and acoustic DJs worldwide. In his review of My Brilliant Masterpiece for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Shawn Linderman said: [...] "Weaving in and out of love from both directions, touching on friendships and loss, Don Conoscenti's latest solo acoustic work is cozy and warm. But don't be misled into thinking these tunes are slow and simple. Don can be blistering away on guitar, stretching his vocal range to its limits and interspersing wild wails and growls, and yet the song still comes across as comforting. Don't ask <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> does it-- that's what's so damned fascinating about his music!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must take}} good care of him, Matt," [...] Scott said, as they started down the hill. [...] "Write and let <b>me</b> know <b>how</b> <b>he</b> gets along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, I am {{responsible}} for you. You must come with me. Oh, I trust {{he is not}} offended with <b>me!</b> <b>How</b> could <b>he</b> have got in without my seeing him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What Sergeant Wilks meant, when he {{said that}} he had called to tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{grateful}} <b>he</b> felt to you for saving his little grandchild's life. I am proud of you, Jim." ...|$|R
60|$|After a brief silence {{we began}} to talk of other things. He told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{happened}} to see me first.|$|E
6000|$|... "O gentle wind, that bloweth south, From {{where my}} love repaireth, Convey a kiss from his dear mouth, And tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> fareth! ...|$|E
6000|$|But Tom Madison {{was in a}} mood {{to which}} her female nature cowered. He pushed the door open, saying authoritatively, 'Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> is!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] I begged. [...] "Oh, don't. Ray {{has told}} me his story. He has made me his confidant. <b>He</b> has told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> unhappy <b>he</b> has been, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> loves you. Oh, Lady Angela, what is there I can say? What can I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, uncle, he did {{not tell}} me that exactly;--but he said that--that--. <b>He</b> told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> much <b>he</b> loved Mary Lowther, and a great deal about her, and I felt sure it would come so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. She think him guilty! Nothing on earth,--or {{from heaven}} either, as I take it, {{would make her}} suppose it to be possible. She came to me simply to tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> good <b>he</b> was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "Vigo {{has told}} <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> settled the {{question}} of paper money. He might {{do something for the}} Congress in the East." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But he {{is equal}} to it," [...] said Andy. [...] "I know that {{by the way he}} tried to treat <b>me,</b> and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> tried to pull the wool over Uncle Si's eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Provoked! Could {{anything}} provoke {{you to make}} a brute of yourself? But I am {{glad that}} he is in no danger. If you hear of him, let <b>me</b> know <b>how</b> <b>he</b> goes on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And just a teeny bit of cake," [...] begged Victoria, daintily {{breaking}} off a piece, while the baby gurgled and snatched for it. [...] "Do tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> old <b>he</b> is, and <b>how</b> many more you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could {{you go to}} Geoffrey, and see him, {{and tell}} him all about me and--and come back and tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> looks, {{and what he said}} and--and so on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I could smoke a pipe," [...] said she, [...] "and get Mr. Matlack to {{come here}} and tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> killed a man, I should be {{perfectly}} happy." ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{considerable}} silence {{my father told}} <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had met Marx abroad. He had done him some service and they had become friendly. He latterly engaged him as secretary.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} to do with it. I merely told him everything, and he had to agree with <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> could <b>he</b> doubt when he saw that you had made me so happy! Even mamma does not doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing; only, I {{know that}} if I could get any man {{to look at me}} as that man looks at you, I'd--I don't know what I'd do. But <b>he</b> hates <b>me.</b> Oh, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> hates me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot beats me," [...] said Tommy again, as the {{policeman}} lifted the light corpse, and tried vainly to straighten the frozen limbs, [...] "Wot beats <b>me</b> is <b>how</b> <b>he</b> got in this here cart of ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "... I had {{arranged}} with Penrose {{that he should}} call at my lodgings, and tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had prospered at the first performance of his duties as secretary to Romayne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nas Ta Bega {{never told}} <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> learned about you. That he learned was enough. And, Fay, {{he will find}} Surprise Valley. He will save Uncle Jim and Mother Jane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, mamma," [...] said Henrietta, {{alarmed at}} her paleness, [...] "I assure you Fred has often told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> has driven our own horses {{when he was}} sitting up by Dawson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing; only, I {{know that}} if I could get any man {{to look at me}} as that man looks at you, I'd--I don't know what I'd do. But <b>he</b> hates <b>me.</b> Oh, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> hates me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hyah, you old gladiator! hyah! hyah!" [...] I yelled {{and yelled}} again. Moze {{passed over the}} saddle {{on the trail of}} the deer, and his short bark floated back to remind <b>me</b> <b>how</b> far <b>he</b> was from a lion dog.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} sergeant, [...] "there are {{one or two}} points I want explained, {{and as you know}} the man, it's {{possible}} that you can help <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> did <b>he</b> come to be here with only about three days' rations?" ...|$|R
