Haddad’s fixed-structure control framework provides the capability for simultaneously performing multiple design tradeoffs for multivariable systems with respect to competing constraints such as sensor noise, control effort, controller order, robustness, disturbance rejection, mean-square error, sample rate, and controller architecture. This approach provides the theoretical underpinning for the design of “industry standard” controllers that fully encompass classical design objectives within <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> theory.

40|$|Modern {{complicated}} dynamic {{objects are}} {{a set of}} related subsystems with parameters and structure, which may vary in different operating modes. For adaptation to structural-parametric changes in <b>multivariable</b> <b>controlled</b> object the logical control algorithms are often used. They can significantly improve the dynamic and static properties of the system. However, existing logical control algorithms do {{not take into account}} a dynamics of the controlled object. Therefore, calculation of parameters for the logical controller is required to ensure the specified quality of control processes. Thus, there is a relevant problem of synthesis of the logical control algorithms that take into account the change of parameters and structure of the controlled object. A solution of this problem will allow us to overcome the contradiction between accuracy, stability, and performance. The article proposes a mathematical model of the logical algorithm to control the autonomous separate subsystem by the error signal and its derivative. This algorithm creates a logically correcting error based on the analysis of the current state and dynamics of a separate subsystem. The article offers a comparative analysis of the existing logical control algorithm with synthesized one when structural-parametric characteristic of controlled object has been changed. Existing algorithms of logic control accelerate dynamics of autonomous separate subsystem thus leading to a significant deterioration in the quality of transition processes. The synthesized logic control algorithm stabilizes dynamics of autonomous separate subsystem and provides a required quality of control processes. In autonomous separate subsystem with a pure time delay the logical control algorithm elaborates a leading decision that significantly reduces the overshoot and oscillability of transition process. The proposed logical controller is capable of adapting to the structural-parametric changes of the <b>multivariable</b> <b>controlled</b> object without readjusting its parameters. The simulation proves that application of logic controller is efficient. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{the real}} world there are three types of <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> systems.

The second type of <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> system is where the number of inputs is greater than the number of the outputs, for this type of system the main controller designed is a fail-safe controller. This controller remains stable if a sub-set of actuator fail. The third type of <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> system is the number of outputs is greater than the number of inputs, for this type of system the main controller designed is an override control system. This controller only controls a sub-set of outputs based on a lowest wins control strategy. All the three types of <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> systems are included in this thesis. In this thesis the design of multivariable decoupling control, multivariable fail-safe control and multivariable override control as considered. The invention of evolutionary computing techniques has changed the design philosophy for control system design. Rather than using conventional techniques such as Nyquest plots or root-loci control systems can be designed using evolutionally algorithm. Such algorithms evolve solutions using cost functions and optimization. There are a variety of system performance indicators such as integral squared error operator has been used as cost functions to design controllers using such algorithms. The design of both fail-safe and override multivariable controllers is a difficult problem and there are very few analytical design methods for such controllers. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is to use the genetic algorithms to involve both fail-safe and override controller multivariable controllers, such that they perform well in the time-domain...|$|E

40|$|A <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> {{problem of}} an {{industrial}} gas-phase polyethylene reactor is investigated in this paper. This <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> problem affects directly the polymer properties and consequently the plant economics. The control task is particularly challenging {{because of the}} two-time-scale behavior {{of the process and}} because of the multirate sampling of the process controlled variables. Two control schemes and two control algorithms are tested and compared. One control scheme considers the overall control problem using one <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> algorithm such as a model predictive controller (MPC). Another control scheme separates the overall control problem into two levels. One level takes care of the controlled variables with fast dynamics via a multiloop proportional - integral algorithm, and the other level takes care of the slow controlled variables via a <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> algorithm such as MPC. The simulated comparison revealed the superiority of the second scheme only in providing a faster response. Other than the speed of response, the performances of the two schemes are almost comparable. Further, the first scheme may outperform the second one in the presence of input limitation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the design of a <b>multivariable</b> <b>control</b> law for a hot plate mill. The design is performed on models adapted to the plate mill at The Danish Steel Work Ltd. The model for the rolling mill is divided into nonlinear models for the hydraulic systems performing the thickness control and a multivariable linear model for the rolling stand. The parameters of the models are found using measurements from the rolling mill at The Danish Steel Work Ltd. Most of the measurements are collected during rolling, but plate thickness measurements are performed after rolling using special equipment. In general, good agreement is obtained between measurements and model outputs. The multivariable nonlinaer model is used for designing a multivarialbe thickness control law which can be seen as an unified approach to control mean thickness and plate wedge. The result is a second order nonlinear controller with rolling forces and roll positions as inputs and control signal to the servo valves as outputs.
