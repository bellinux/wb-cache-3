5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms.

Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E

The second is {{to know how the}} acceleration students committed the errors <b>and</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the syntactical level. The third is to investigate the sources of errors of the syntactical errors made in the English writing at grade XII Acceleration Program of SMA N 2 Purwokerto. This qualitative research was a descriptive study which provided the description of the kinds of <b>mistakes</b> <b>and</b> errors made in English writing, how the acceleration committed <b>mistakes</b> <b>and</b> errors, and the sources causing the <b>mistakes</b> <b>and</b> errors. There subjects of the research was the English writing result of fifteen acceleration students. The data were collected through a writing test in which the students were required to write paragraphs and two semi-structured interviews {{in order to get the}} information in details. The first was the interview about the writing test result which aimed to know the students’ knowledge about grammar, and the second was the interview to investigate the sources of errors made by the students. The data were analyzed through the inductive analysis by using the equal method. The research result showed that the most frequently made <b>mistakes</b> <b>and</b> errors deal with the inappropriate subject-verb agreement which reaches 35. 82...|$|R

The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> stop the production of liquors.|$|E

Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, who was just 0.077 seconds slower.
