It operated in every U.S. state, and established ten CCC camps in the Susquehannock State Forest, of which eight were in Potter County.|$|E
5|$|Official state {{horses are}} one of <b>many</b> <b>state</b> symbols officially {{designated}} by states. Each state has its own flag and state seal, and many states also designate other symbols, including animals, plants, and foods. Such items usually are designated because of their ties to the culture or history of that particular state. In addition to being state symbols in their own right, horses have also appeared in state symbols; for example, a horse's head appears on the Seal of New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|After Corzine's breakup with Katz, {{their lawyers}} {{negotiated}} a financial payout in November 2004. According to press accounts, the settlement for Katz exceeded $6million, including cash (in part {{used to buy}} her $1.1million condominium in Hoboken), a college trust fund to educate her children, a 2005 Volvo sport utility vehicle, and Corzine forgave a $470,000 loan he had made to Katz in 2002 to buy out her ex-husband's share of their home in Alexandria Township. Katz enrolled in Seton Hall University School of Law on a full scholarship in 2004. Corzine later acknowledged he had given $15,000 to Katz's brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who {{was forced to resign}} after being accused of examining income tax returns for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of the CWA Local 1034, which bargains on behalf of <b>many</b> <b>state</b> employees.|$|E
5|$|Charles Keating was {{a long-time}} {{supporter}} of U.S. swimming and beginning in 1969 {{he and his}} brother William donated $600,000 to St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati to build a state-of-the-art competition pool. The school's swimming team went on to win <b>many</b> <b>state</b> titles. St. Xavier named the Keating Natatorium after the brothers' father, and inducted Charles Keating into its initial Athletic Hall of Fame class in 1985. The University of Cincinnati's 2006 athletic building is named the Keating Aquatic Center, in honor of William Keating, and donations from the Keating family used to construct it. Charles Keating funded Cincinnati's Marlins swim club; six swimmers on the 1980 Summer Olympics squad were from its roster, including future Olympic champion Mary T. Meagher. When he later moved to Phoenix, Charles Keating built the Phoenix Swim Club, where Olympians also trained.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>state</b> {{conventions}} elected delegates {{pledged to}} support bimetallism {{in the party}} platform. Gold Democrats were successful in a few states in the Northeast, but had little luck elsewhere. Speakers in some states cursed Cleveland; the South Carolina convention denounced him. Cleveland issued a statement urging Democratic voters to support gold—the next convention to be held, in Illinois, unanimously supported silver; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland's 1892 nomination. Gold and silver factions in some states, such as Bryan's Nebraska, sent rival delegations to the convention.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite <b>many</b> <b>state</b> liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when <b>many</b> <b>state</b> and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.|$|E
25|$|Many {{assume that}} the advent of modern psychotropic {{medications}} was the catalyst for deinstitutionalization in the U.S. However, large numbers of patients began leaving state institutions only after new laws made unpaid patient labor illegal.
