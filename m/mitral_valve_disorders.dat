40|$|Of 129 {{patients}} with either mitral or aortic valve disease angina {{was present in}} 55 (42 %). It was more frequent in aortic (60 %) than in mitral valve disease (33 %). The standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram was not helpful in distinguishing underlying occlusive coronary artery disease. Coronary arteriography demonstrated coronary artery disease in 26 patients (20 %), only 2 of whom had no angina. The incidence of coronary artery disease was almost identical in both the mitral and aortic groups (22 % and 17 %, respectively), but the percentage of those with demonstrable coronary artery disease accompanying angina was much higher in the mitral group (67 % as against 29 %). Angina in <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders</b> is thus {{much more likely to}} be the result of disease of the coronary arteries.

40|$|Introduction Ortner's syndrome, {{also known}} as cardiovocal syndrome, is a rare {{clinical}} entity with hoarseness due to left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy owing to a cardiovascular disease. Norbert Ortner ascribed hoarseness of voice RLN palsy in patients with several mitral stenosis, postulating that an enlarged left atrium could {{be responsible for the}} recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Case report A 63 -year-old man with a history of progressive hoarseness of voice developed since over three months. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a fixed left vocal cord in the paramedian position. The chest enhanced axial computed tomography confirmed a large left ventricular aneurysm. Conclusions Hoarseness has significant public health implications. Patients suffer from social deprivation, depression and a poor quality of life. Several underlying conditions are associated with the cardiovocal syndrome, including iatrogenic, congenital, <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders,</b> aortic and ventricular aneurysms.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that alterations in normal ECM structure and mechanotransduction {{play a role in}} heart valve diseases. Current paradigms in valve biology, cell culture and animal models, are inadequate for study of the agents that cause these alterations. A mitral valve organ culture system has been designed that stimulates mitral valves in a simulated in vivo environment for periods of 4 - 6 weeks. We hypothesize that a mitral valve exposed to its native mechanical stresses over this period will maintain its ECM structure and cell viability, making this a valid system for studying disease agents. The first part of this validation study involved analyzing freshly excised mitral valves and testing them for collagen, GAG, and DNA content using the hydroxyproline, uronic acid, and Hoechst DNA assays, respectively, in their anterior, posterior, and chordal regions. The discovered amounts were consistent with data from previous studies and with knowledge of regions of tensile and compressive loads in the valve. This data will be reinforced with histology and mechanical testing and later compared with an analysis of biochemical and mechanical data for valves involved in medium-term static and dynamic runs in this bioreactor. Once validated, this system is a powerful tool for the study of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders.</b> Backgroun...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ischemic mitral {{regurgitation}} (IMR) is {{a common}} complication after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We aimed to investigate the frequency of IMR following first-time AMI and its association with infarct location, in-hospital mortality, and complications. Methods: From September 2011 to November 2012, all patients with a diagnosis of first-time acute ST-elevation MI {{were enrolled in the}} study. Patients with previous MI and heart failure, organic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders,</b> and previous mitral surgery were excluded from the study. The patients ' baseline characteristic, echocardiographic parameters, and complications were recorded. The frequency of IMR after AMI and its relation to infarct location and in-hospital mortality were evaluated. Results: Altogether, 250 patients (180 male) at a mean age of 60. 21 ± 12. 90 years were studied. IMR was detected in 114 (45 %) patients. There was no association between the presence of MR and gender, systemic hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, or body mass index; however, serum LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the patients with IMR. The most frequent territory of MI was anterior in the patients without MR, while the anterolateral territory was the most common one in the patients with IMR.

We try to delineate the risk factors of persistent AFL/Af. MethodsFrom 1998 to 2010, all patients older than 18  years of age who received ASD occluder implantation in our hospital were enrolled, and their records were retrospectively reviewed. In addition, renin–angiotensin system gene polymorphisms including angiotensinogen gene, A 1166 C polymorphism on the angiotensin II type I receptor gene, and insertion/deletion (I/D) patterns on the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene were checked using direct sequencing. ResultsA total of 517 patients (male/female 127 / 390) were enrolled. The mean age of patients receiving occluder deployment was 41. 5  ±  14. 5  years. Prior to occluder deployment, 3. 9 % of patients had persistent Af, 3. 1 % of patients had paroxysmal Af, and 0. 8 % had AFL. After a follow-up of 1894 patient-years, 3. 5 % had persistent Af and 1. 9 % of patients had paroxysmal Af. The greatest risk factors of AFL/Af genesis included age, occluder size, presence of multiple ASDs, and underlying thyroid or <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorder</b> (p <  0. 001, p <  0. 001, p =  0. 033, p =  0. 016, and p =  0. 012, respectively).

40|$|<b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> {{diseases}} and <b>disorders</b> affect {{tens of thousands}} of Americans each year, but understanding of the disease processes has yet to be fully developed. The behavior and characteristics of valve cells and tissue are highly dependent on their surrounding environment, including neighboring cells, extracellular matrix composition and 3 D structure, mechanical forces, and signaling molecules both in the tissue and the circulation. In order to study native valve behavior and responses, an ex vivo bioreactor system was developed to culture whole <b>mitral</b> <b>valves.</b> The organ culture system simulated a physiologically relevant mechanical environment and provided nutrients and gas exchange.

40|$|PURPOSE: In post-marketing {{drug safety}} surveillance, data mining can {{potentially}} detect rare but serious adverse events. Assessing an entire collection of drug-event pairs is traditionally performed on a predefined level of granularity. It is unknown a priori whether a drug causes {{a very specific}} or a set of related adverse events, such as <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders,</b> all valve disorders, or different types of heart disease. This methodological paper evaluates the tree-based scan statistic data mining method to enhance drug safety surveillance. METHODS: We use a three-million-member electronic health records database from the HMO Research Network. Using the tree-based scan statistic, we assess the safety of selected antifungal and diabetes drugs, simultaneously evaluating overlapping diagnosis groups at different granularity levels, adjusting for multiple testing. Expected and observed adverse event counts were adjusted for age, sex, and health plan, producing a log likelihood ratio test statistic. RESULTS: Out of 732 evaluated disease groupings, 24 were statistically significant, divided among 10 non-overlapping disease categories. Five of the 10 signals are known adverse effects, four are likely due to confounding by indication, while one may warrant further investigation. CONCLUSION: The tree-based scan statistic can be successfully applied as a data mining tool in drug safety surveillance using observational data. The total number of statistical signals was modest and does not imply a causal relationship. Rather, data mining results {{should be used to}} generate candidate drug-event pairs for rigorous epidemiological studies to evaluate the individual and comparative safety profiles of drugs.

Ten percent of daily hospital admissions of the included hospitals (n[*]=[*] 1618) across Germany that were available between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011 (n[*]=[*] 5, 235, 600) were extracted from Statistisches Bundesamt, Germany. We identified I 30 -I 51 other forms of heart disease by the International Classification of Diseases version 10 as the study outcomes. Daily weather data from 64 weather stations that have covered 13 German states, including air temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, radiation flux and vapour pressure, were obtained and generated into physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Admissions due to other diseases of pericardium, nonrheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders,</b> nonrheumatic aortic valve disorders, cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular and left bundle-branch block, other conduction disorders, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and other cardiac arrhythmias peaked when PET was between 0 and 10  °C.

Cardiac arrest and heart failure admissions peaked when PET was between 0 and - 10  °C while the rest did not vary significantly. A common drop of admissions was found when PET was above 10  °C.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} valvular abnormalities after radiation therapy involving the heart region and/or treatment with anthracyclines and to identify associated risk factors in a large cohort of 5 -year childhood cancer survivors (CCS). The study cohort consisted of all 626 eligible 5 -year CCS diagnosed with childhood cancer in the Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center between 1966 and 1996 and treated with radiation therapy involving the heart region and/or anthracyclines. We determined the presence of valvular abnormalities according to echocardiograms. Physical radiation dose was converted into the equivalent dose in 2 -Gy fractions (EQD 2). Using multivariable logistic regression analyses, we examined the associations between cancer treatment and valvular abnormalities. We identified 225 mainly mild echocardiographic valvular abnormalities in 169 of 545 CCS (31 %) with a cardiac assessment (median follow-up time, 14. 9 years [range, 5. 1 - 36. 8 years]; median attained age 22. 0 years [range, 7. 0 - 49. 7 years]). Twenty-four CCS (4. 4 %) had 31 moderate or higher-graded abnormalities. Most common abnormalities were tricuspid valve disorders (n= 119; 21. 8 %) and <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders</b> (n= 73; 13. 4 %). The risk of valvular abnormalities was associated with increasing radiation dose (using EQD 2) involving the heart region (odds ratio 1. 33 per 10 Gy) {{and the presence of}} congenital heart disease (odds ratio 3. 43). We found no statistically significant evidence that anthracyclines increase the risk. Almost one-third of CCS treated with potentially cardiotoxic therapy had 1 or more asymptomatic, mostly mild valvular abnormalities after a median follow-up of nearly 15 years.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{hearts of}} three {{children}} who died with Duchenne's progressive muscular dystrophy and features of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse syndrome were examined to find if the <b>valve</b> <b>disorder</b> arose from cardio-myopathy due to the primary disease or from dystrophic changes in the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> itself. Gross, histologic and ultrastructural features of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> annulus, anterior and posterior leaflets, chordae tendineae, right and left ventricles, and anterior and posterior papillary muscles were {{compared with those of}} similar tissues from normal children of matched age and sex. Fibrosis and myofibrillar lysis most extensive in posterior papillary muscle and in the posterobasal segment of the left ventrile- were the main histopathologic find-ings. Myofibrillar lysis was characterized by a total loss of actin and myosin myofilaments. By contrast, the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> annulus, its leaflets and the origin, distribution pattern, length and thickness of chordae tendineae were entirely normal. These observations establish that <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse syndrome in Duchenne's dystrophy is an expression of cardiomyopathy involving papillary muscle and ventricular myocardium rather than a result of dystrophic changes in the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets, annulus or chordae tendineae. <b>MITRAL</b> <b>VALVE</b> PROLAPSE (MVP) syndrome, first described by Reid 1 and Barlow et al. 2 nearly 2 decades ago, has {{emerged as one of the}} most commo...|$|R
40|$|Heart valve {{disease is}} {{estimated}} to cost over {{a billion dollars in}} the Unites States annually and <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>disorders</b> account for the largest portion of the disease with treatments involving valve repair and replacement (Iung et. al). It is estimated that an experienced surgeon can effectively repair 95 - 100 percent of mitral valve (MV) disorders but a recent study showed that the average rate of MV repair is 41 percent. The current paradigm in treatments include diagnostic imaging data to see {{the current state of the}} patient, empirical data from previous similar cases to evaluate the efficacy of prior treatment and the judgment of the surgeon. Due to immense variability amongst patients in terms of anatomy and physiological conditions, this data alone is insufficient to predict outcomes of treatments. We therefore propose a new paradigm of combining imaging techniques and computational modeling allowing for patient specific modeling of anatomical structures and finite element analysis to predict surgical outcomes. Performing this approach currently requires extensive knowledge of the particular fields and can be difficult to follow for a non-expert. We are thus in the process of developing a user friendly tool which combines these techniques into a single framework which can easily be used by non-experts. The hypothesis of this work is that providing surgeons with prior knowledge of post-repair dynamics of a diseased MV will improve surgical decision making and increase repair rates. This work outlines a framework of user interactive tools for simulating the common techniques used by surgeons to correct mitral regurgitation. This toolset is built as an extension of IA-FEMesh (Grosland et. al) and enables MV leaflet mesh and chordae tendinae mesh generation from point cloud data. It also includes tools for repairing the chordae tendinae, resecting a portion of the valve, applying MV material properties, boundary conditions and exporting these as an Abaqus (. inp) file where the simulation is carried out. The results of these simulations ultimately serve as biomechanical markers for identifying the best surgical method to be used...|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a cross-sectional, case-control echocardiographic study to assess the valvular status in 102 subjects receiving cabergoline for endocrine disorders and 51 matched control subjects. Cabergoline treatment ranged from 12 to 228 months, with a cumulative dose of 18 - 1718 mg. Valvular regurgitation was equally prevalent in both groups and was almost exclusively mild. Two cabergoline-treated subjects had moderate mitral regurgitation; there was no relationship between cabergoline dose and the presence or severity of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation (P=NS). <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> tenting area was significantly greater in the cabergoline group {{when compared with the}} control subjects (P= 0. 03). <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet thickening was observed in 5. 9 % of cabergoline-treated subjects; no relationship with the cumulative cabergoline dose was found.

Patients and Methods: From 1975 to 1998, 813 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with either <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement (n 518) or <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair (n 295). <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease was rheumatic in 71...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> annuloplasty is a {{surgical}} technique for the repair of leaking <b>mitral</b> <b>valves.</b> Due to various factors, the two leaflets normally involved in sealing the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> to retrograde flow may not [...] properly. Surgical repair typically involves the implantation of a device surrounding the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> called an annuloplasty device, which pulls the leaflets together to facilitate coaptation and aids to re-establish <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> function.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIn “true” {{parachute}} <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> chordae insert {{into one}} papillary muscle. In parachute-like asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> {{most or all}} chordal attachments are to one papillary muscle. This study compared morphologic features, associated lesions, and palliation strategies of the two parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> and dominant papillary muscle types and examined interventions and midterm outcomes in patients with biventricular circulation. MethodsEchocardiography and autopsy databases were reviewed to identify patients with “true” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> or parachute-like asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> from January 1987 to January 2006. Predictors of palliation strategy in the entire cohort, mitral stenosis on initial echocardiogram, and mortality in the biventricular cohort were determined with logistic regression. ResultsEighty-six patients with “true” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> (n = 49) or parachute-like asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> (n = 37) were identified. Chordal attachments to the posteromedial papillary muscle were more common (73 %). The presence “true” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> (P =. 008), hypoplastic left ventricle (P <. 001), and two or more left-sided obstructive lesions (P =. 002) predicted univentricular palliation. Among 49 patients maintaining biventricular circulation at follow-up, 8 died median follow-up 6. 4 years (7 days– 17. 8 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that “true” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> was associated with mitral stenosis on initial echocardiogram (P =. 03), and “true” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> (P =. 04) and conotruncal anomalies (P =. 0003) were associated with mortality. Progressive mitral stenosis was found in 11 patients; 2 underwent <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> interventions, and 1 died. ConclusionNearly two thirds of this parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> cohort underwent biventricular palliation. Some progression of mitral stenosis occurred, although <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> intervention was rare. “True” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> was associated with mitral stenosis on initial echocardiogram. “True” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> and conotruncal anomalies were associated with mortality in the biventricular population...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveSuccessful <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> {{replacement}} {{in young}} children {{is limited by the}} lack of small prosthetic valves. Supra-annular prosthesis implantation can facilitate <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement with a larger prosthesis in children with a small annulus, but little is known about its effect on the outcomes of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement {{in young children}}. MethodsOne hundred eighteen children underwent <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement at 5 years of age or younger from 1976 – 2006. <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement was supra-annular in 37 (32 %) patients. ResultsSurvival was 74 % ± 4 % at 1 year and 56 % ± 5 % at 10 years but improved over time (10 -year survival of 83 % ± 7 % from 1994 – 2006). Factors associated with worse survival included earlier <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement date, age less than 1 year, complete atrioventricular canal, and additional procedures at <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, but not supra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. As survival improved during our more recent experience, the risks of supra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement became apparent; survival was worse among patients with a supra-annular prosthesis after 1991. A pacemaker was placed in 18 (15 %) patients within 1 month of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement and was less likely in patients who had undergone supra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. Among early survivors, freedom from redo <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement was 72 % ± 5 % at 5 years and 45 % ± 7 % at 10 years. Twenty-one patients with a supra-annular prosthesis underwent redo <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. The second prosthesis was annular in 15 of these patients and upsized in all but 1, but 5 required pacemaker placement for heart block. ConclusionsSupra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement was associated with worse survival than annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement in our recent experience. Patients with supra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement were less likely to have operative complete heart block but remained at risk when the prosthesis was subsequently replaced...|$|R
40|$|Valve {{replacement}} {{in patients}} with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation is indicated when symptoms occur or left ventricular function becomes impaired. Using different surgical techniques, <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> reconstruction has lead to earlier interventions with good clinical results. In {{order to determine the}} possibility of a <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> reconstruction, echocardiographic parameters are necessary. With transoesophageal echocardiography a segmental analysis of the entire <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> can be performed; <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> motion abnormalities and severity and direction of the regurgitation jet can be judged. From this analysis clues for underlying pathology can be derived as well as the eligibility of a successful <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> reconstruction.

40|$|Abstract. Problems {{that occur}} in the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> are now {{worrying}} an increasing number of patients each day. In the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> regional variations in structure and material properties combine to affect the biomechanics of the entire valve. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet tissue is highly extensible. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the rigidity of <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> leaflet and backflow problems. Two stages of <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> analysis systolic and diastolic condition and also with and without ventricle were investigated. 2 D models of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet (MVL) were created in ADINA-FSI for computational fluid dynamic analysis. The results show a linear relationship between rigidity of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> leaflet and volume of backflow. In conclusion, these computational techniques are very useful in the study of both <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet disease and failure of prostheses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> {{prolapse}} is {{a benign}} condition. Mitral regurgitation is only complicated {{in patients with}} severe <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse. Women with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse {{in the absence of}} other cardiovascular disorders tolerate pregnancy well and do not develop remarkable cardiac complications. Nevertheless, serious complications of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse, including arrhythmia, infective endocarditis and cerebral ischemic events, can be present in pregnancy. Debates remain with regard to the use of prophylactic antibiotics and β-blockers in the pregnant women with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse. The prognosis of the pregnant patients might be closely related to the pathological and (or) functional changes of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve.</b> Non-myxomatous <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse poses no or little obstetric risks in terms of pregnancy, labor and neonatal complications; whereas myxomatous <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse is a major etiology of valvular heart disease in women of childbearing age. In the pregnant patients with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse progressing into major complications, surgical interventions are considered. Medicinal treatment of such patients with β-blockers should be a concern for the fetal safety...|$|R
