5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E

40|$|The {{studies on}} the cause of fault at machine {{elements}} and materials have been explained by many authors already. But, the studies of actual machine parts {{under the influence of}} dynamic load are rare explained. Here the studies of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> siud at diesel engine are achieved and its solutlhn is proved. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The insufficient rigidity of engine bed is most cause of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studs at diesel engine. 2. Seconrlly, the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> stud suffered severe load by the weak structure of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> cap and therfore the better type of structure is recommended by the writer. 3. Tightness of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is important too. The maximum tensile stress of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studis about 2 times in comparison with one of the other studby fault of tighting and its value indicates about 28 kg/㎟. ディーゼル機関に於て主軸受スタッドの切損を屡々見受ける。この切損の特徴として，その装着位置からして早期発見が仲々むつかしく従って慨事故を発見した時は主軸受メタルの焼付・亀裂又はクランクジャーナル部の偏摩粍等を併発している事が多く，甚だしきに至っては機関台床亀裂等の大事故を起し機関再選転を不能ならしめた例もある。筆者の過去数年間に互る調査結果より推察すると，概切損事故の特色は機関主軸受NO・としてクランク両・端側の主軸受（例えば 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 1 及 8 主軸受）には事故皆無であり，切損の過半数は中央主軸受（ 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 4 及 5 主軸受）に発生している事である。尚スタッドの切損個所としてはスタッド植込部からが殆んどである。此等の調査結果を本稿中の表- 1 に示してある。主軸受スタッド切損に就て調査研究並びにこれに基ずく実験を行い，その原因を究明し得たのでその対策と併せて茲に発表する...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the health {{monitoring}} of a wind turbine drivetrain in a system perspective. A 5 -MW reference drivetrain installed on a spar type floating wind turbine is selected. Degradation and damage in the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be {{a key factor in}} the “system” failure. This is a step forward in monitoring the wind turbine drivetrains on a system level...|$|R

The <b>main</b> <b>bearings,</b> connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray.

25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} pneumatic valve springs a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting rod ends allowing for narrower <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once {{for each of the four}} strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). [...] Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center and is in the region of 95,000m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000g.|$|E
2500|$|The engines {{featured}} a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed {{in a cast}} housing. Engine oil was picked {{up from the bottom}} of the crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. [...] From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the main bearing caps, and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. [...] The <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> were ball bearings and were splash fed. [...] Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 reduction gearbox at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. [...] This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.|$|E
