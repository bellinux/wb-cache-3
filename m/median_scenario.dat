(1) In {{accordance with the}} findings on mean single-tree volume increment periodic volume increment of all species benefits from climate change in the first projection period in both regions except for European beech and oak in Uelzen under the <b>median</b> and maximum <b>scenario.</b> (2) The uncertainty range widens over time {{and in most cases}} encompasses positive as well as negative deviations. Especially European beech strongly reacts on climate scenarios with positive deviations up to 2 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 as well as negative values down to – 3 m 3 ·ha– 1 ·yr– 1 in the third period. (3) Basically, the positive effect of climate change in the first period diminishes over time and even turns negative in many cases. While the deviation in periodic volume increment of Scots pine shows only a few small negative values in the third period, periodic volume increment of oak is negatively affected by climate change in Uelzen entirely but not so much in Fläming. The climate effect on periodic volume increment of European beech shows a disparate picture over time with positive tendencies under minimum and <b>median</b> climate <b>scenario</b> in Uelzen and a clearly negative trend under median and maximum climate scenario in Fläming. (4) Scots pine is the least sensitive species, both positive and negative. Climate change has the strongest impact on European beech with the most positive deviations in Fläming in the first period and the most negative deviations in Uelzen and Fläming in the third period. Oak takes on an intermediate position looking at the deviations in periodic volume increment. (5) Comparing both regions a stronger climate effect is noticeable in Fläming looking at Scots pine and European beech. In Fläming the periodic volume increment of both species shows more positive reactions in the first period and under <b>median</b> and maximum <b>scenario</b> significant negative deviations in the third period. Periodic volume increment of pedunculate and sessile oak, however, is affected more heavily by climate change in Uelzen.|$|R

Economic viability of reforestation under payment per hectare and payment per tonne schemes for carbon sequestration was assessed in a region in southern Australia supporting 6. 1 Mha of rain-fed agriculture. The results show that under the <b>median</b> <b>scenario,</b> a carbon price of 27 A$/tCO 2 -e could make one-third {{of the study area}} (nearly 2 Mha) more profitable for reforestation than agriculture, and at 58 A$/tCO 2 -e all of the study area could become more profitable.

Pareto-optimal land allocation could realize one-third of the potential carbon sequestration from reforestation (16. 35 MtCO 2 -e/yr at a carbon risk factor of 0. 8) with a loss of less than one-tenth (107. 89 A$M/yr) of the agricultural production.

Given {{the shape of the}} glacier, the velocity of ice u is obtained by solving a 3 D nonlinear Stokes problem. Then, the shape of the glacier is updated by computing the volume fraction of ice ϕ, which satisfies the transport equation ∂ϕ／∂t +u · ∇ϕ = bδΓA. Here bδΓA is a source term acting only on the ice-air interface ΓA which accounts for the accumulation or ablation of ice due to snow falls or melting. A decoupling algorithm allows the two above problems to be solved using different numerical techniques. The nonlinear Stokes problem is solved on a fixed, unstructured finite element mesh made of tetrahedrons. The transport equation is solved using a fixed, structured grid made of smaller cells.

Therefore a failure to consider the potential impact of climate change on municipal buildings would be both costly and detrimental to sustainable development. In this paper the authors present research undertaken to ascertain the potential impacts of climate impacts on municipal buildings in South Africa. A two-phase approach was adopted. Firstly the appropriate climate effects on a given building inventory, in a selected location, were determined; then the cost impacts on that building (based on a set of stressor-response functions) were applied. The results of the study predict that the total impact of climate change on buildings in South Africa could vary between USD $ 42. 7 million average annual costs in the <b>median</b> <b>scenario</b> and USD $ 214. 3 million average annual costs in the maximum scenario. The results presented are all incurred costs, which need to be addressed to avoid health and safety issues. However costs would be much higher if the existing stock was augmented without considering climate change impacts. The research provides an understanding of the cost of climate change and how the maintenance and adaptation of the unsustainable buildings may divert resources from sustainable development. The results of the research may also present an opportunity for existing buildings to be retrofitted with alternative, sustainable technologies, which serve to decrease vulnerability to climate change impacts going forward...|$|E
40|$|The mid-term and {{long-term}} growth potential of China's insurance {{industry is a}} subject of significant interest to governments, business and academia. In this paper, the “world insurance growth curve” is {{used in conjunction with}} estimates of China's future GDP growth to estimate the growth and size of China's insurance industry for the period 2006 – 2020. There are clearly other factors – social, political, cultural, demographic and market structure – that also have an impact, but other empirical {{studies have shown that the}} key factor in the long term is growth and development of the overall economy. Assuming that China's GDP grows over that period at a rate of 6 – 9 percent per year, we conclude that the possible range of China's insurance industry growth rate would be 7. 7 – 17. 9 percent, with a more likely range of 9. 8 – 14. 8 percent. In the <b>median</b> <b>scenario,</b> the average annual real growth rate for China’s insurance industry during the period 2006 – 2020 would be 12. 3 percent.

40|$|Background: Among {{patients}} in skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care, increased registered nurse, total licensed staff, and nurse assistant staffing {{is associated with}} a decreased rate of hospital transfer for selected diagnoses. However, the cost-effectiveness of increasing staffing to recommended levels is unknown. Methods: Using a Markov cohort simulation, we estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of recommended staffing versus median staffing in patients admitted to skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care. The outcomes of interest were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness of recommended staffing versus median staffing was $ 321, 000 per discounted quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to the likelihood of acute hospitalization from the nursing home. The cost-effectiveness ratio was also sensitive to the rapidity with which {{patients in}} the recommended staffing scenario recovered health-related quality of life as compared to the <b>median</b> staffing <b>scenario.</b> The cost-effectiveness ratio was not sensitive to other parameters. Conclusion: Adopting recommended nurse staffing for short-stay nursing home patients cannot be justified on the basis of decreased hospital transfer rates alone, except in facilities with high baseline hospital transfer rates. Increasing nurse staffing would be justified if health-related quality of life of nursing home patients improved substantially from greater nurse and nurse assistant presence...|$|R

This assessment is based on forecasts of electricity demand and available supply combined with current information on the configuration and capability of the transmission system. Based on existing and proposed facilities, Ontario is expected to have a reliable supply of electricity during the forecast period under a wide-variety of conditions. Opportunities also exist for additional enhancements to improve the efficiency of the Ontario electricity market. The assessments in this report were made based on a number of key planning assumptions.

However, the ability of markets to motivate the supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services from agricultural land is uncertain, especially given the future changes in environmental, economic, and social drivers. We quantified the potential supply of these services from the intensive agricultural land of Australia from 2013 to 2050 under four global outlooks {{in response to a}} carbon price and biodiversity payment scheme. Each global outlook specified emissions pathways, climate, food demand, energy price, and carbon price modeled using the Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM). Using a simplified version of the Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, economic returns to agriculture, carbon plantings, and environmental plantings were calculated each year. The supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services was then quantified given potential land use change under each global outlook, and the sensitivity of the results to key parameters was assessed. We found that carbon supply curves were similar across global outlooks. Sharp increases in carbon sequestration supply occurred at carbon prices exceeding 50 $ tCO(2) (- 1) in 2015 and exceeding 65 $ tCO(2) (- 1) in 2050. Based on GIAM-modeled carbon prices, little carbon sequestration was expected at 2015 under any global outlook. However, at 2050 expected carbon supply under each outlook differed markedly, ranging from 0 to 189 MtCO(2) yr(- 1). Biodiversity services of 3. 32 % of the maximum may be achieved in 2050 for a 1 $B investment under <b>median</b> <b>scenario</b> settings. We conclude that a carbon market can motivate supply of substantial carbon sequestration but only modest amounts of biodiversity services from agricultural land. A complementary biodiversity payment can synergistically increase the supply of biodiversity services but will not provide much additional carbon sequestration. The results were sensitive to global drivers, especially the carbon price, and the domestic drivers of adoption hurdle rate and agricultural productivity. The results can inform the design of an effective national policy and institutional portfolio addressing the dual objectives of climate change and biodiversity conservation that is robust to future uncertainty in both national and global drivers.

30|$|As {{indicated}} in the previous section, it appears that only one study has been conducted so far that makes a comprehensive investigation of historical production data and resources/reserves data {{for each type of}} non-conventional gas resources that of Wang et al. (2016 c). Based on these data, Wang et al. (2016 c) also carried out what we believe was the first quantitative study of China’s long-term non-conventional gas production. This used the geologic resources supply–demand model (GeRS–DeMo), which is a widely used model for developing the projections of non-conventional fossil fuel production (Mohr and Evans 2010, 2011; Wang et al. 2015). Wang et al. (2016 c) develop three scenarios based on different URR assumptions. These are a high scenario (where TRR is treated as the URR), a low scenario (where “cumulative production plus reserves” is used as the URR), and a <b>median</b> <b>scenario</b> (which uses the average of these high and low URRs). It should be noted that resource availability is the only factor considered in Wang et al. (2016 c). The potential constraints from environmental issues are not included. Taking shale gas as an example, extracting shale gas may result in many environmental problems, including methane emissions, water use, water pollution, and induced earthquakes (Howarth and Ingraffea 2011; Entrekin et al. 2011; Frohlich 2012). Among these, water issues may be the most significant constraining factor for China shale’s gas development. Hydraulic fracking is usually needed in extracting shale gas resources due to their low permeability, which will consume large amounts of pressurized water. Generally, one shale gas well will use more than 20 thousand cubic metres water, and large-scale development of shale gas will surely have serious impacts on local water resources (Jiang et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2013 a, b). However, China itself is facing serious water shortage issues (Zhu et al. 2001), which means that local water availability will be an important constraint for shale gas development. In a report released by the World Resources Institute, China is labelled as “high” average exposure to water stress over its shale gas and shale oil area (Reig et al. 2014). Therefore, if other constrained factors are considered, the forecast results of Wang et al. (2016 c) should be seen as the upper bound of the future production and that the actual production will very likely be lower than results shown in Wang et al. (2016 c).|$|E

MethodsForty-six hepatic surgeons across Canada were invited. A patient with biologically favourable disease was presented after having received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The scenario was matched with 10 different scrollable abdominal CT scans representing a maximum response after six cycles of chemotherapy. Surgeons were asked to offer an opinion on resectability of liver metastases, and whether they would use adjunct modalities to hepatic resection. ResultsTwenty-six surgeons participated. Twenty responses were complete. The <b>median</b> number of <b>scenarios</b> deemed resectable was 6 / 10 (range 3 – 8). Two control scenarios demonstrated perfect agreement. Agreement on resectability was poor for 4 / 8 test scenarios, of which one scenario demonstrated complete disagreement. Among resectable cases, the pattern of use of adjunct modalities was variable. A median ratio of 0. 87 adjunct modality per resectable scenario per surgeon was used (range 0. 25 – 1. 75). ConclusionA significant lack of agreement was identified among surgeons on the resectability and use of adjunct modalities in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of various quantitative techniques and assumptions by different authors to forecast the world’s conventional crude oil {{production in the}} 21 st Century results in highly inconsistent predictions. The forecasts attempt to pin-point the peak world oil production year (Hubbert’s Peak), peak production rate, and post-peak decline rate, based on estimates of the ultimate recoverable reserves (EURR). These techniques, pioneered by M. K. Hubbert in the mid- 1950 s, generally consider economic factors, such {{as the price of}} oil, as irrelevant in the long run. Some authors support a Low EURR World Scenario (about 2. 0 trillion barrels, of which half has already been produced) and forecast Hubbert’s Peak in this decade. Other authors estimate the EURR at about 3. 0 trillion barrels (<b>Median</b> EURR World <b>Scenario),</b> and this estimate is the mean EURR assessment of the United States Geological Survey and similar to assessments by several major oil and gas companies. An EURR of 3. 0 trillion barrels implies Hubbert’s Peak will occur in 2020, or so, at a production rate of about 90 – 100 million barrels/day (compared to 85 million barrels/day in late 2005). A few authors support a High EURR World Scenario (4. 0 trillion barrels or more) with Hubbert’s Peak in 2030 at a rate of 120 million barrels/day. Sensitivity analysis for Hubbert’s Curve suggest that Hubbert’s Peak moves by three years for every 200 billion barrels of error in the EURR...|$|R
40|$|Low, mid {{and high}} daily climate {{scenarios}} (2000 – 2070), as per the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were generated using the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's (CSIRO's) global atmosphere models. These scenarios based on IPCC's 21 st century emission scenarios that combine {{a variety of}} assumptions about demographic, economic and technological driving forces likely to influence such emissions in the future, were used as input to a crop model to predict the impact of climate change on wheat yield at a location in south-eastern Australia. At this locality there are important likely changes in the primary climatic variables of temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. Generally, we found a strong and consistent positive trend in mean diurnal temperature range, followed by a significant negative trend in wheat yield under three climate scenarios with and without elevated CO 2 concentration. It is possible that negative trends identified over the future decades may be artefacts of the method of substituting historical variance for future variance. We observed that from present climate to projected low, mid and high global warming <b>scenarios,</b> <b>median</b> wheat yield may decrease by about 29 %. Under these scenarios, but with an elevated atmospheric CO 2 climate, median wheat yield may decrease by about 25 %. The effect of elevated CO 2 reduces {{the severity of the}} warmer air temperatures and lower rainfall but the effect is small (4 %). Advances in agronomy and breeding must boost crop yields by around 25 % over the coming decades, to keep in step with predicted climate change...|$|R
40|$|Promising {{environmental}} {{mechanisms to}} control malaria are presently underutilized. Water level fluctuations to interrupt larval development {{have recently been}} studied and proposed as a low-impact malaria intervention in Ethiopia. One impediment to implementing such new environmental policies is the uncertain impact of climate change on water resources, which could upend reservoir operation policies. Here we quantified {{the potential impact of}} the malaria management under future climate states. Simulated timeseries were constructed by resampling historical precipitation, temperature, and evaporation data (1994 – 2002), imposing a 2 °C temperature increase and precipitation changes with a range of ± 20 %. Runoff was generated for each climate scenario using the model GR 4 J. The runoff was used as input into a calibrated HEC ResSim model of reservoir operations. The malaria operation management increased the baseline <b>scenario</b> <b>median</b> energy generation by 18. 2 GWh y- 1 and decreased the energy generation at the 0. 5 percentile (during dry conditions) by 7. 3 GWh y- 1. In scenarios with - 20 % precipitation, malaria control increased average annual energy generation by 1. 3 GWh y- 1 but only decreased the lowest 0. 5 percentile of energy by 0. 2 GWh y- 1; the irrigation demand was not met on 8. 5 more days, on average, per year. Applying the malaria control rule to scenarios with + 20 % precipitation decreased the likelihood of flooding by an average of 1. 0 day per year. While the malaria control would divert some water away from other reservoir operational goals, the intervention requires 3. 3 – 3. 7 % of the annual precipitation budget, which is much less than reduction from potential droughts...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Plant Health (PLH) Panel {{performed}} a risk assessment for Ceratocystis platani in the EU with the aim to assess the effectiveness of risk reduction options (RROs) {{on the basis of}} the mechanisms of spread identified in the pest categorisation (natural and human-assisted means, including waterways, root anastomosis, contaminated pruning tools, machinery, insects, contaminated insect frass and sawdust). C. platani is a destructive pathogen of Platanus trees, which is currently present in the EU (in France, Greece and Italy). Three scenarios were considered: the current situation (A 0 scenario); the situation without RROs (A 1); and the application of additional RROs (A 2). The risk of new introductions into the EU of C. platani by means of the main pathways of entry (i. e. plants for planting, wood and machinery, e. g. construction machinery and pruning/cutting tools) is relatively limited, but about 250 times higher for the A 1 scenario compared to the A 2 <b>scenario</b> (<b>median</b> numbers of established populations). The risk of spread from already affected EU regions is higher, but varies depending on the scenario. Machinery is the most important mechanism of long-distance spread. Focusing the additional RROs in A 2 scenario on this mechanism of spread – which is not currently regulated – would be an effective way to reduce the likelihood of further spread and thus impacts of C. platani to not yet affected EU regions. The emergency measures applied by the C. platani-affected EU Member States (France, Greece and Italy) could be harmonised and improved. An enhanced programme could be developed which includes surveillance, early detection of the disease foci, effective eradication measures and planting resistant Platanus clones in new plantations in affected areas. Surveillance could also be intensified in the EU MSs not yet known to be affected by the disease...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{aspects of}} the ecology of West Nile virus (WNV) including factors contributing to the distribution of WNV, possible future distribution, and effects of WNV on host abundance in the Canadian prairies provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Using mosquito surveillance data collected between 2005 and 2008, models integrating abiotic and biotic factors were constructed to predict the weekly and monthly scales of WNV infection rate in Culex tarsalis, which is the primary vector of WNV in the Canadian prairies. At the weekly scale, the WNV infection rate in Cx. tarsalis increased with increasing Cx. tarsalis abundance and mean temperature lagged from 1 to 8 weeks, but decreased with an increasing mean precipitation lagged from 2 to 6 weeks. Furthermore, precipitation was a ‘distorter variable’ which altered the association between Cx. tarsalis abundance and the WNV infection rate. Study at the monthly scale showed that higher mean temperature and time lagged mean temperature elevated were associated with increased numbers of Cx. tarsalis and higher WNV infection rates. However, increasing precipitation was associated with higher abundance of Cx. tarsalis and lower WNV infection rate. In addition, this study found that increased temperature fluctuation and wetland land cover were associated with decreased WNV infection rate in Cx. tarsalis. Climate change could drive dramatic alterations in the spatial and temporal distribution and overall incidence of vector-borne diseases. The constructed models and biological thresholds were used to predict the distribution of Cx. tarsalis and WNV infection rate in the prairie provinces under a range of potential future climate and habitat conditions. In the current endemic regions, the projected WNV infection rate under the <b>median</b> outcome <b>scenario</b> in 2050 was 18 times higher than under current climate conditions. Seasonal occurence of Cx. tarsalis infected with WNV extended from June to August to include May and September. Moreover, models predicted northward range expansion for Cx. tarsalis and WNV. The declines of susceptible bird abundance caused by WNV may further influence the bird community composition and, in turn, affect the incidence of WNV through a dilution effect. The North American Breeding Bird Survey data {{was used to evaluate}} the effect of WNV on the abundance of selected birds in the Canadian prairies, as well as the effects of bird community composition on the WNV risk. There was no significant decline in bird abundances of selected birds following the emergence of WNV. These findings suggest that the effect of WNV on selected bird abundance and bird community composition is insignificant. In addition, {{there is no evidence to}} support the association between bird community composition and WNV infection rate in Cx. tarsalis in the Canadian prairies. Lastly, findings in this thesis and current knowledge were integrated to create a decision making flowchart for the prevention of WNV infection in the prairie provinces...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Plant Health (PLH) Panel {{performed}} a risk assessment for Cryphonectria parasitica in the EU with the aim to assess the current EU phytosanitary requirements and identify the risk reduction options (RROs), which would preserve the protected zone (PZ) status {{in some parts of}} the EU, where the pathogen is not known to occur. C. parasitica, a bark-inhabiting fungus causing blight of chestnut trees (Castanea spp.), has a wide distribution in the EU (non-PZs). Three regulatory scenarios were considered for the whole risk assessment (RA) area: the current situation in non-PZs (scenario A 0), the situation in the EU without measures (A 1) and the current situation in PZs with additional RROs (A 2). The Panel considered both the risk of potential spread to PZs of C. parasitica strains currently present in the non-PZs and the risk of introduction from Third Countries and spread in non-PZs of new, virulent strains that would be able to jeopardise the currently effective hypovirulence and cause severe impact. The number of new introductions of C. parasitica into the EU is reduced by approximately a factor 5, 000 (<b>median</b> values) in <b>scenario</b> A 2 compared to scenario A 0. Under the A 0, A 1 and A 2 scenarios, 2, 3. 5 and 0. 5 (median values) EU Member States, respectively, are expected to be affected in the next 10 years due to spread of C. parasitica strains. The estimated relative impact on ecosystem services, due to the introduction and spread in the EU of new, virulent strains, is higher for scenario A 1 compared to scenarios A 0 and A 2. The current EU requirements and the additional RROs considered in scenario A 2 were assessed to be effective in reducing the risk of introduction and spread of C. parasitica, thus preserving the PZ status {{in some parts of the}} EU...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic Ocean Circulation Models and Lagrangian {{particle}} tracking {{models are}} valuable tools e. g. in coastal ecology {{to identify the}} connectivity between offshore spawning and coastal nursery areas of commercially important fish, for risk assessment and more for defining or evaluating marine protected areas. Most studies are based on only one model and do not provide levels of uncertainty. Here this uncertainty was addressed by applying a suite of 11 North Sea models to test what variability can be expected concerning connectivity. Different notional test cases were calculated related to three important and well-studied North Sea fish species: herring (Clupea harengus), and the flatfishes sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). For sole and plaice we determined which fraction of particles released in the respective spawning areas would reach a coastal marine protected area. For herring we determined the fraction located in a wind park after a predefined time span. As temperature {{is more and more}} a focus especially in biological and global change studies, furthermore inter-model variability in temperatures experienced by the virtual particles was determined. The main focus was on the transport variability originating from the physical models and thus biological behavior was not included. Depending on the <b>scenario,</b> <b>median</b> experienced temperatures differed by 3 °C between years. The range between the different models in one year was comparable to this temperature range observed between modelled years. Connectivity between flatfish spawning areas and the coastal protected area was highly dependent on the release location and spawning time. No particles released in the English Channel in the sole scenario reached the protected area while up to 20 % of the particles released in the plaice scenario did. Interannual trends in transport directions and connectivity rates were comparable between models but absolute values displayed high variations. Most models showed systematic biases during all years in comparison to the ensemble median, indicating that in general interannual variation was represented but absolute values varied. In conclusion: variability between models is generally high and management decisions or scientific analysis using absolute values from only one single model might be biased and results or conclusions drawn from such studies need to be treated with caution. We further concluded that more true validation data for particle modelling are required...|$|R

Therefore, we investigated {{the effect of}} DNR orders on physician decision making in relation to performing noncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and CPR procedures. Methods: A case-scenario-based questionnaire that included a case of advanced cancer, a case of advanced dementia, and a case of nonadvanced heart failure was administered to physicians. The questions determined whether physicians would perform different non-CPR procedures and CPR procedures in {{the presence or absence}} of DNR orders. The number of non-CPR procedures each physician would perform and the number of physicians who would perform each non-CPR and CPR procedure in the absence and presence of DNR ocrders were compared. Physicians from three Japanese municipal acute care hospitals participated. Results: We analyzed 111 of 161 (69 %) questionnaires. Physicians would perform significantly fewer non-CPR procedures in the presence of DNR orders than in the absence of DNR orders for all three case <b>scenarios</b> (<b>median</b> [interquartile range] percentages: Case 1 : 72 % [45 %– 90 %] vs 100 % [90 %– 100 %]; Case 2 : 55 % [36 %– 72 %] vs 91 % [63 %– 100 %]; Case 3 : 78 % [55 %– 88 %] vs 100 % [88 %– 100 %]). Fewer physicians would perform non-CPR and CPR procedures in the presence of DNR orders than in the absence of DNR orders. However, considerable numbers of physicians would perform electric shock treatment for ventricular fibrillation in the presence of DNR orders (Case 1 : 26 %; Case 2 : 16 %; Case 3 : 20 %). Conclusion: DNR orders affect physician decision making about performing non-CPR procedures. Although some physicians would perform CPR for ventricular fibrillation in the presence of DNR orders, others would not. Therefore, a consensus definition for DNR orders should be developed in Japan, otherwise DNR orders may cause harm. Keywords: code status, do-not-resuscitate order (DNR...|$|R
