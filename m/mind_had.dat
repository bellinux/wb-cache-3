25|$|Since Descartes's {{proposal}} of dualism, {{it became a}} general consensus that the <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> {{become a matter of}} philosophy and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman are two neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation {{play a critical role in}} high level cognition, and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation. In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms primary consciousness and secondary consciousness.|$|E

25|$|In {{works of}} art, battles between Amazons and Greeks {{are placed on}} the same level as – and often {{associated}} with – battles of Greeks and centaurs. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly {{in the shape of a}} crescent, called pelta, and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> apparently been the goddess Athena. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly Persian – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the kidaris. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{composed}} of the 325th, 326th and 327th Infantry Regiments, {{all of which were}} due to be converted into glider infantry, the 327th was soon transferred out of the 82nd to help form the 101st Airborne Division, commanded by Major General William C. Lee. Unlike his men, Ridgway did not first go through airborne jump school before joining the division. However, he successfully converted the 82nd into a combat-ready airborne division; he remained in command and eventually earned his paratrooper wings. To replace the 327th, Ridgway received the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), commanded by Colonel Theodore Dunn, later replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Reuben Tucker. In February 1943 the 326th was also transferred out and replaced by the 505th PIR, under Colonel James M. Gavin. In April the 82nd, which in Ridgway's <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> received only a third the training time given to most divisions, was sent to North Africa to prepare for the invasion of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Adams's first {{literary}} work {{was the result}} of her dissatisfaction with the prejudice of most writers on the various religious sects. Her <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> been turned to the subject by reading a manuscript from Broughton's Dictionary giving an account {{of some of the most}} common of the sects. The publication of A View of Religions was published in 1784, in accordance with the custom of the time, after subscriptions had been obtained to the' proposal' of the work, sufficient in number to warrant its issue. It was fairly profitable, but owing to a bad bargain with the printer the author's returns were slight, A second edition with additions, secured by copyright, then newly established by law, was published in 1791, at the instance of influential Boston friends whom the first issue had made for her. This edition was dedicated to John Adams, then Vice-President of the United States, who had headed its list of subscribers, which included such leading names as Samuel Adams, John Hancock, President Joseph Willard of Harvard College, Rt Rev. John Carroll, D.D., the Roman Catholic Bishop of Baltimore, the Rev. Henry Ware, and the Rev. Adoniram Judson. Her father was an enthusiastic seller of the book, traveling about the country on horseback with saddlebags filled with the volumes. A fourth edition of her first work, with further additions, appeared in 1817, under the broader title of A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations. Jared Sparks gave it his stamp of approval.|$|E

25|$|Spencer's {{attempt to}} explain the {{evolution}} of complexity was radically different from that {{to be found in}} Darwin's Origin of Species which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin's work on natural selection. But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase 'survival of the fittest' as his own term for Darwin's concept, and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism was also necessary to explain 'higher' evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution had a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society was the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man's <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. Intuition, or knowledge learned unconsciously, was the inherited experience of the race.|$|E
500|$|Writer David Halliwell was {{approached}} by Eric Saward in early July 1985 as a prospective writer for the [...] "new" [...] series 23. Halliwell submitted his untitled first draft of the then untitled two-part story for episodes 9 & 10 [...] to the production office in late July 1985. The story dealt with a conflict between the ugly looking Freds and the beautiful Penelopeans. Work on a second draft began on 14 August 1985 and was completed by 22 August 1985, with a third draft submitted on 11 September 1985. Saward spent much time with Halliwell on further drafts, changing {{the name of the}} Freds to Trikes. The fourth revision was delivered on 26 September 1985 and 7 October 1985 saw a fifth draft arrive at the production office. Halliwell received a letter from Saward on 18 October 1985, advising him that Attack from the <b>Mind</b> <b>had</b> been cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{increasing}} popularity of unreliable narrators in television, Hawley {{said that he}} did not want the audience thinking that the series is a puzzle that needs to be solved, saying, [...] "We're going to take a character out of confusion into clarity and an audience out of mystery into clarity"; this is seen in the season's latter episodes, which are more narratively straightforward after Haller becomes [...] "clear on what’s going on [...] we are as well." [...] A noted sequence in the season's penultimate episode sees Haller explain the series' backstory and events to himself (and the audience)—Haller was institutionalized not because of his abilities, but because his <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> been infected by the Shadow King. Hawley wanted to indicate to the audience that this would be the only sequence in the series so exposition heavy, and so it features Haller creating a class room environment within his mind to make the teaching purpose of the scene explicit.|$|E

500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his <b>mind</b> <b>had</b> ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E
