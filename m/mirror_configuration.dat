5000|$|The {{input voltage}} of the Wilson current mirror is [...] The input node {{is a low}} {{impedance}} node so its voltage remains approximately constant during operation at [...] volts. The equivalent voltage for the standard two-transistor mirror is only one base-emitter drop, , or half that of the Wilson mirror. The headroom (the potential difference between the opposite power rail and the input of the mirror) available to the circuitry that generates the input current to the mirror is the difference of the power supply voltage and the mirror input voltage. The higher input voltage and higher minimum output voltage of the Wilson current <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> may become problematic for circuits with low supply voltages, particularly supply voltages less than three volts as are sometimes found in battery powered devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{layout of}} the Haunted Castle was two sets of eight {{semi-trailers}} lined up in a <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration.</b> A single trailer {{was placed in the}} middle of the configuration for use as a control room, from which the lights, sounds, and other effects were managed; and for changing rooms for the young men and women who acted the parts of the monsters and ghouls present on the tour. During slow times only one side of the attraction would be used. Peak attendance would cause the park to open both sides, allowing thousands of visitors to enjoy the attraction. Guests would enter the Castle via the typical switchback guide rails used at amusement park which led to a gate. From there, the guests would enter through the drawbridge main portal where a doorman would direct them to the entrance of the actual walk-through. At peak times, the doorman would alternate sides to keep a gap between groups to allow for greater effect and to keep the leaders from warning the following group of upcoming surprises.|$|E

40|$|Attention {{is given}} to an opposed cathode {{sputtering}} system constructed {{with the ability to}} coat parts with a size up to 15 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length. Initial trials with this system revealed very low substrate bias currents. When the AlNiCo magnets in the two opposed cathodes were arranged in a <b>mirrored</b> <b>configuration,</b> the plasma density at the substrate was low, and the substrate bias current density was less than 1 mA/sq cm. If the magnets were arranged in a closed-field configuration where the field lines from one set of magnets were coupled with the other set, the substrate bias current density was as high as 5. 7 mA/sq cm when NdFeB magnets were used. In the closed-field configuration, the substrate bias current density was related to the magnetic field strength between the two cathodes and to the sputtering pressure. Hard well-adhered TiN coatings were reactively sputtered in the opposed cathode system in the closed-field <b>configuration,</b> but the <b>mirrored</b> <b>configuration</b> produced films with poor adhesion because of etching problems and low plasma density at the substrate...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{limitation on}} the use of the Wilson current mirror in MOS circuits is the high minimum voltages between the ground connection in Fig. 5 and the input and output nodes that are required for proper operation of all transistors in saturation. The voltage difference between the input node and ground is [...] The threshold voltage of MOS devices is usually between 0.4 and 1.0 volts with no body effect depending on the manufacturing technology. Because [...] must exceed the threshold voltage by a few tenths of a volt to have satisfactory input-output current match, the total input to ground potential is comparable to 2.0 volts. This difference is increased when the transistors share a common body terminal and the body effect in M4 raises its threshold voltage. On the output side of the mirror, the minimum voltage to ground is [...] This voltage is likely to be significantly greater than 1.0 volts. Both potential differences leave insufficient headroom for the circuitry that provides the input current and uses the output current unless the power supply voltage is higher than 3 volts. Many contemporary integrated circuits are designed to use low voltage power supplies to accommodate the limitations of short-channel transistors, to meet the need for battery operated devices and to have high power efficiency in general. The result is that new designs tend to use some variant of a wide swing cascode current <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration.</b> [...] In the case of extremely low power supply voltages of one volt or less, the use of current mirrors may be abandoned entirely.|$|E

Three primary mirror configurations were considered: solid, standard lightweight, and mushroom. All of these are of low expansion material. Specifically, the study consisted of evaluating the mirrors with regard to: manufacturing metrology, manufacturing risk factors and ultimate quality assessment. As a result of this evaluation, a performance comparison of the configurations was made, and a recommendation of <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> is the final output.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating the six-degrees-of-freedom transformation between a camera and {{the body of the}} robot on which it is rigidly attached. The robot maneuvers in front of a planar mirror, allowing the camera to observe fiducial features on the robot from several vantage points. Exploiting these measurements, we form a maximum-likelihood estimate of the camera-to-body transformation, without assuming prior knowledge of the robot motion or of the <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration.</b> Additionally, we estimate the <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> with respect to the camera for each image. We validate the accuracy and correctness of our method with simulations and real-world experiments. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} made of a toroidally linked mirror system with a zero {{rotational}} transform and a three-dimensional magnetic field that ensures good confinement of charged particles. A toroidally linked magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> at low plasma pressures is calculated by numerically solving the isometry equation for the magnetic field to second order in the small parameter of the paraxial approximation. The calculations carried out with the VMEC code for a particular linked magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> demonstrate the possibility of achieving good confinement of drifting particles. The calculated results show that it is, in principle, possible to link mirror cells into a toroidal configuration capable of providing plasma confinement at a tokamak level.

40|$|In {{the current}} article we discuss an {{illumination}} problem proposed by Urrutia and Zaks. The {{focus is on}} configurations of finitely many two-sided mirrors in the plane together with a source of light placed at an arbitrary point. In this setting, we study the regions unilluminated by the source. In the case of rational-π angles between the <b>mirrors,</b> a planar <b>configuration</b> {{gives rise to a}} surface with a translation structure and a number of planar infinities. We show that on a surface of this type with at least two infinities, one can find plenty of unilluminated regions isometric to unbounded planar sectors. In addition, we establish that the non-bijectivity of a certain circle map implies the existence of unbounded dark sectors for rational planar <b>mirror</b> <b>configurations</b> illuminated by a light-source.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} {{have indicated}} an increase {{rather than a}} decrease in the solar absorptivity of second surface mirrors at angles of incidence greater than 80 deg. These observations stimulated an analytical effort which revealed that the increase does occur. Using electromagnetic wave theory, the solar absorptance equations for the <b>mirror</b> <b>configurations</b> commonly encountered in application are developed. An increase in mirror solar absorptance has also been deduced from the temperatures of a second surface mirrored radiator being monitored on the Nimbus E microwave spectrometer experiment. Test and calculated results substantiating the solar absorptance increase are presented...|$|R

The fluorescence from the atomic cloud was imaged after it had bounced off a mirror. The transverse width of the cloud reached a local minimum at an optimal current corresponding to minimum mirror roughness.

40|$|As the {{resolution}} and throughput of optical sensors increase, they require higher line-of-sight slew rates and more precise stabilization. Furthermore, smaller and lighter sensor systems are also preferred because on-vehicle space is always at a premium. Consequently, mirror based line-of-sight control and stabilization systems {{have become more}} attractive as they are generally lighter and more compact than other systems. A general strategy for deriving the kinematic equations for mirror based imaging systems is established in this paper. Some {{of the most common}} <b>mirror</b> <b>configurations</b> and their basic kinematic equations are also presented.

The vacancy exhibits a nonsymmetric rebonded atomic configuration with a charge transfer level 0. 75 +- 0. 1 eV above the valence band maximum. The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images show only a time average of two degenerate geometries, due to a thermal flip motion between the <b>mirror</b> <b>configurations.</b> This leads to an apparently symmetric STM image, although the ground state atomic structure is nonsymmetric.

Finite element programs, using the STRUDL 2 analysis system, were written for specific mirror structures encompassing all types of active and passive mirror designs.

50|$|As yet, {{little is}} known about ASL phonotactic {{constraints}} (or those in other signed languages). The Symmetry and Dominance Conditions (Battison 1978) are sometimes assumed to be phonotactic constraints. The Symmetry Condition requires both hands in a symmetric two-handed sign to have the same or a <b>mirrored</b> <b>configuration,</b> orientation, and movement. The Dominance Condition requires that only one hand in a twohanded sign moves if the hands {{do not have the same}} handshape specifications, and that the non-dominant hand has an unmarked handshape. However, since these conditions seem to apply in more and more signed languages as cross-linguistic research increases, it is doubtful whether these should be considered as specific to ASL phonotactics.|$|R

40|$|For the {{baseline}} design of advanced LIGO interferometers, use of optical cavities with non-spherical mirrors supporting flat-top ("mesa") beams, potentially capable of mitigating the thermoelastic {{noise of the}} mirrors, has recently drawn a considerable attention. To overcome the severe tilt-instability problems affecting the originally conceived nearly-flat, "Mexican-hat-shaped" <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration,</b> K. S. Thorne proposed a nearly-concentric <b>mirror</b> <b>configuration</b> capable of generating the same mesa beam profile on the mirror surfaces. Subsequently, Bondarescu and Thorne introduced a generalized construction {{that leads to a}} one-parameter family of "hyperboloidal" beams which allows continuous spanning from the nearly-flat to the nearly-concentric mesa beam configurations. This paper is concerned with a study of the analytic structure of the above family of hyperboloidal beams. Capitalizing on certain results from the applied optics literature on flat-top beams, a physically-insightful and computationally-effective representation is derived in terms of rapidly-converging Gauss-Laguerre expansions. Moreover, the functional relation between two generic hyperboloidal beams is investigated. This leads to a generalization (involving fractional Fourier transform operators of complex order) of some recently discovered duality relations between the nearly-flat and nearly-concentric mesa configurations. Possible implications and perspectives for the advLIGO optical cavity design are discussed...|$|E

These concepts include consideration of continuous as well as segmented mirror surfaces and the major stow-deployment categories of inflatable, variable geometry and assembled-in-space structures. The mirror surface for each concept would be actively monitored and controlled to maintain diffraction limited performance at 10. 6 microns during operation.
