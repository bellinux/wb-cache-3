Five evaporation equations (Abtew, Hargreaves, Makkink, Priestley and Taylor and Turc), where each represents one generalized form, were then compared with pan evaporation measured at Changins station in Switzerland. The comparison was first made using the original constant values involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. Evaluation of the Priestley and Taylor equation requires net radiation data as input, in this study, net radiation was estimated using Equation (16) {{owing to the}} lack of observation data. The results showed that when the original constant values were used, large errors resulted for most of the equations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the original constant values, four of the five equations improved greatly, and all five equations performed well for determining <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation.</b> For seasonal and monthly evaporation, the Hargreaves and Turc equations showed a significant bias, especially for cold months.

40|$|SummaryThe major {{groundwater}} {{resources of}} the Arabian Peninsula are stored in the large sedimentary basins in its eastern part. Evaporation from continental salt pans (playas) is an important process in water resources assessments of its upper principal aquifers – the Upper Mega Aquifer system – as it constitutes a significant sink. However, literature values on evaporation rates vary widely and usually report about coastal salt pans where seawater evaporation is assumed. The present study applies different methods to provide a comprehensive picture of groundwater evaporation from salt pans of the Upper Mega Aquifer system. A remote sensing approach provided the spatial distribution and total salt pan area of about 36, 500 km 2. Hydrochemical and isotopic investigations revealed that from about 10 % (3600 km 2 ± 1600 km 2) of the mapped salt pan area seawater evaporates. To estimate the groundwater evaporation rate from continental salt pans a laboratory column experiment was set up, implying a <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate of about 42 mm± 13 mm. In-situ analysis of water table fluctuations in the field suggested about 3 mma− 1 originate from recently infiltrated rainwater leading to an annual net groundwater evaporation of 39 mm± 13 mm. Relating this number to the mapped salt pan area, from which groundwater evaporates, provides a total annual groundwater loss of 1. 3 km 3 ± 0. 5 km 3 for the Upper Mega Aquifer system...|$|E

We investigate {{the impact of this}} dependence in a land surface model (LSM) using meteorological data collected on the moraine of a Bolivian glacier. The relationship which is implemented to simulate albedo variations with soil moisture is deduced from a previous ﬁeld study. The model is set up at the scale of the meteorological station plot to have the most accurate control on the model calibration and validation. A snow parameter is modiﬁed to account {{for the fact that the}} model was designed for larger cell sizes. Water content measurements are used to calibrate the parameter controlling the vertical water ﬂuxes within the soil surface layer. This allows us to enhance the model's ability to capture the fast changes in surface soil moisture. The comparison of simulated ground heat ﬂux and outgoing longwave radiations with observations shows that the model performs well despite the fact that all other parameters are set a priori based on local properties of the surface. The results show that the dependence of bare soil albedo on soil moisture, which causes an increase in the net radiation, importantly inﬂuences the turbulent ﬂuxes at the annual and monthly timescales. The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> is increased by 12 %.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the mean annual runoff (MAR) -hydrological variable is paramount for catchment planning, development and management. MAR depicts the amount of uncertainty or chaos (implicitly information content) of the catchment. The uncertainty associated with MAR of quaternary catchments (QCs) in the Upper Vaal catchment of South Africa has been quantified through Shannon entropy. As a result of chaos {{over a period of}} time, the hydrological catchment behavior/response in terms of MAR could be characterized by its resilience. Uncertainty (chaos) in QCs was used as a surrogate measure of catchment resilience. MAR data on surface water resources (WR) of South Africa of 1990 (i. e., WR 90), 2005 (WR 2005) and 2012 (W 2012) were used in this study. A linear zoning for catchment resilience in terms of water resources sustainability was defined. Regression models (with high correlation) between the relative changes/variations in MAR data sets and relative changes in entropy were established, for WR 2005 and WR 2012. These models were compared with similar relationships for WR 90 and WR 2005, previously reported. The MAR pseudo-elasticity of the uncertainty associated with MAR was derived from regression models to characterize the resilience state of QCs. The MAR pseudo-elasticity values were relatively small to have an acceptable level of catchment resilience in the Upper Vaal catchment. Within the resilience zone, it was also shown that the effect of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> (MAE) was negatively significant on MAR pseudo-elasticity, compared to the effect of mean annual precipitation (MAP), which was positively insignificant...|$|E

These changes are estimated for 22 Australian catchments covering a range of climates, from cool temperate to tropical and moist to arid.

The SIMHYD, AWBM and Zhang 01 models show mean sensitivities of 2. 4 %, 2. 5 % and 2. 1 % change in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> flow for every 1 % change in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> rainfall, respectively. All rainfall sensitivities have a lower limit of 1. 8 % and show upper limits of 4. 1 %, 3. 4 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. The results for potential evaporation change are - 0. 5 %, - 0. 8 % and - 1. 0 % for every 1 % increase in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> potential <b>evaporation,</b> respectively, with changes rainfall being approximately 3 - 5 times more sensitive than changes in potential evaporation for each 1 % change in climate. Despite these differences, the results show similar correlations for several catchment characteristics. The most significant relationship is between percent change in annual rainfall and potential evaporation to the catchment runoff coefficient. The sensitivity of both A and B factors decreases with an increasing runoff coefficient, as does the uncertainty in this relationship. The results suggest that a first-order relationship can be used to give a rough estimate of changes in runoff using estimates of change in rainfall and potential evaporation representing small to modest changes in climate.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reviews {{our current}} {{understanding}} of Quaternary climate and landscape {{changes in the}} desert areas of northern China, a key portion of the middle-latitude drylands on Earth. Combining earlier studies with our recent research and experience, we offer a comprehensive picture {{of the state of}} Chinese deserts during the Quaternary and, in the interest of enhancing future research, identify knowledge gaps and areas of uncertainty. Lacustrine deposits found over an area ranging from China's western Taklamakan Desert to the eastern Hunshandake Sandy Lands suggest that extensive lakes occurred in China's deserts during the Pleistocene. Analysis of digital elevation models from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data supports this interpretation and shows the significant extent of these former lakes. New estimates of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> of ca. 1000 mm from lake surfaces and ca. 100 mm from land surfaces, confirms that local and regional rainfall is critical for maintenance of desert lakes in this temperate zone, especially during intervals when the mean annual rainfall is more than 100 mm. Rapid shifts between sand seas and lakes in geologically and environmentally diverse settings suggest that the drylands of China are very sensitive ephemeral systems, and not long-lasting as previously thought. Available chronologies suggest that there were large lakes in the western Taklamakan Desert and the Chadamu Basin during MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 3, at ∼ 30 ka, probably related to a period of strong influence of northern hemispheric westerly winds. Channels and elevation models revealed by SRTM data and remains of lacustrine sediments also indicate that there was a large lake in the Hunshandake Sandy Lands in the eastern portion of the desert belt during the Quaternary. There is significant evidence that during the middle Holocene strong summer monsoons led to a relatively large increase in moisture availability in the entire desert belt of northern China. Lacustrine records from the Badain Jaran Desert in western Inner Mongolia suggest that it was generally dry before 10 cal ka, becoming wetter from 10 to 4 cal ka, and dry again afterwards. Study of palaeosols widely occurring in dune stratigraphy in the eastern portion of the desert belt, suggests that there was a period of wet and warm climate in this region during the mid-Holocene Optimum, at a minimum between 6 ka and 4 ka, but possibly lasting longer. Recent observations dealing with the generation and transport of dust from Central Asia indicate that the causal relationship between sand seas and loess sequences is not as close as previously assumed. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to examine whether the frequency and amplitude of climatic variation in Chinese deserts are somehow similar to that having occurred in the Sahara Desert of North Africa. Deserts in northern China were also important focal regions for Neolithic cultures during intervals when environmental conditions supported a denser vegetative cover. There is evidence that some areas of woody vegetation to the west of Badain Jaran Desert were deforested by humans by ca. 4000 yr B P, although it is still debatable whether humans have had a significant impact in other areas at that time. Opinions on the severity of desertification vary and are sometimes contradictory {{due to the lack of}} long-term, field-based, investigations...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation {{losses and}} {{groundwater}} interaction of Lake Nasser were studied {{to determine the}} influence of both processes on the hydrologic budget of the lake. Lake Nasser, southern Egypt, is located in a hyper-arid region. Since evaporation {{is by far the most}} important factor in explaining the water losses from the lake, accurate estimation of the evaporation losses is essential to be able of better managing the lake resources. This research presents an update of previous evaporation estimates, making use of local meteorological and hydrological data collected from instrumented platforms (floating weather stations) at three locations on the lake: at Raft, Allaqi and Abusembel (respectively at 2, 75 and 280 km upstream of the Aswan High Dam). Results from seven conventional evaporation methods were compared with the values obtained by the Bowen Ratio Energy Budget method (BREB). The results of the BREB method showed that there is no significant difference between the evaporation rates at Allaqi and Abusembel. At Raft, higher evaporation rates were obtained, which were assumed to be overestimated due to the high uncertainty of the Bowen Ratio (BR) parameter. The average BR value at Allaqi and Abusembel was used to eliminate the overestimated evaporation. Several of the seven conventional methods showed substantial bias when compared with the BREB method. These were modified to eliminate the bias. For the daily time scale the Penman method yielded the best agreement with the estimates of the BREB method, while for the monthly time scale the best match with the BREB method was obtained with the Priestley-Taylor and the deBruin-Keijman methods. Differences in mean evaporation estimates of these methods with respect to the BREB method were found to be in the range 0. 14 and 0. 36 mm/d. All estimates were based on calculations at the daily time scale covering a 10 years period (1995 - 2004). As pointed out by various researches, variations in lake evaporation can have a significant impact on the energy and water budgets of lakes. For accurate water management under current and climate change conditions it is important to fully understand these variations. To this end a comprehensive 10 -year analisis was conducted of the seasonal, intraseasonal, and interannual variations of the lake evaporation analyzing the meteorological data at Raft station to provide bi-weekly energy budget estimates of the lake evaporation rate. The mean evaporation rate for Lake Nasser over the study period is 5. 88 mm/d, with a coefficient of variation of 63 %. Considerable variability in evaporation rates is found on a wide range of timescales, with seasonal changes having the highest coefficient of variation (32 %), followed by the intraseasonal (28 %) and interannual timescales (11. 6 %; for summer means). Intraseasonal changes in evaporation are primarily associated with synoptic weather variations, with high evaporation events tending to occur during incursions of cold, dry air (due, in part, to the thermal lag between air and lake temperatures). At the other hand seasonal variations in evaporation are largely driven by temperature and net energy advection, but are out-of-phase with changes in wind speed. On interannual timescales, changes in summer evaporation rates are strongly associated with changes in net energy advection and show only moderate connections to variations in temperature or humidity. A qualitative identification and evaluation of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in the context of the evaporation estimates from Lake Nasser was made using data collected at the floating station Raft and 12 evaporation models. Based on their approach the evaporation models were ranked in 5 classes, respectively the BREB approach, 3 energy-aerodynamic based methods, a mass transfer method, 2 temperature and 5 solar radiation-temperature approaches. State dependent parameter models were used to estimate the sensitivity indices of the different evaporation estimation methods at daily and monthly frequencies. A drastic reduction in the cost of the sensitivity analysis was obtained when coupled with efficient sampling methods, producing quasi Monte Carlo sequences (Latin Hypercube samples). Analysis of the sensitivity indices (Si) revealed that the energy and advective parameters (Qx and Qv) in the BREB method most strongly affect evaporation estimates. The most sensitive parameters for the energy-aerodynamic methods (Penman, Priestley-Taylor and the deBruin-Keijman methods) are the change in heat storage (Qx) and solar radiation. For the other methods the most sensitive parameters are solar radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure, but with lower sensitivities. After investigation of the first and second order sensitivity indices, it was found that the first-order sensitivity indices capture more than 90 % of the total variance of the evaporation estimates. Interactions between input parameters were found limited with a maximum contribution to variance of less than 3. 3 % for daily frequency and less than 8. 5 % for the monthly frequency. Results indicated that many parameters in the 12 evaporation models could be fixed without appreciably affecting the output of these models. This helped to reduce the computational load of these models. The uncertainty results show that the Dalton group is subject to the highest error. The overall uncertainty ranged from 9 % (BREB method) to 15 % (mass transfer method) of the mean evaporation rate. The groundwater recharge from/or groundwater discharge to Lake Nasser is another significant factor to be considered in the analysis of the lake water budget. A cross sectionmodeling using the analytical solutions of Edelman (1947) was applied at 7 transects distributed over 4 geological cross sections to estimate groundwater heads and recharge from/or groundwater discharge to Lake Nasser. The cross section model, constrained by regional-scale groundwater flow and groundwater head data in the vicinity of the lake, was successfully calibrated to timeseries of piezometeric heads collected at the cross sections in the period 1965 - 2004. Inverse modeling using Edelmans analytical solution(s) (1947) yielded high values for the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the range 6. 0 to 31. 0 m/day and storage coefficient in the range 0. 01 to 0. 40. The results showed the existence of a strong vertical anisotropy of the aquifer; the calibrated horizontal permeability is systematically higher than the vertical permeability (&# 8776; 1000 : 1). The calibrated model was used to assess the temporal and spatial variations in the recharge from/or groundwater discharge to Lake Nasser. The analysis for the last 20 -year period, 1985 - 2004, revealed that recharge from Lake Nasser reduced by 37 % compared to the estimates for the first 20 -year period, 1965 - 1984. In the period 1965 - 2004, seepage of Lake Nasser to the surrounding was estimated as 1. 15 billion cubic meter per year. This led to a significant increase of the groundwater table. Variance-based sensitivity and uncertainty analysis on the Edelman results were conducted applying the quasi-Monte Carlo sequences (Latin Hypercube sampling). The maximum standard deviation of the total uncertainty on the groundwater table was 0. 88 m at Toshka (west of the lake). The distance from the lake, followed by the storage coefficient and hydraulic conductivity, were identified as the most sensitive parameters. In this study, MATLAB® environment was selected for modeling the hydrologic budget of Lake Nasser. MATLAB® is a high-performance language for technical computing. The hydrologic budget of Lake Nasser is modeled using a lumped model approach. Similar flow items considered by preceding studies were also taken into consideration. These flow items include inflow, evaporation, groundwater lake interaction terms of through-flow and bank storage, and release. The developed model possesses several distinctive features such as a GUI, and forward and inverse modeling capabilities. An ordinary differential equation governs the water budget of Lake Nasser, which is a delay differential equation and is solved numerically using the Euler and the Runge Kutta methods. The forward model is linked internally to an optimization algorithm, the trust-region method, to optimize a least-square objective function to estimate optimum parameter values. Sensitivity coefficients required by the optimization algorithm are obtained using the variance based method. The results showed that the evaporation parameter and bank storage parameters are among the most sensitive parameters that greatly affect the model results. Data from 1968 to 1997 are used to obtain unknown model parameters. One of such obtained optimal values is the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> equal to 2. 1 m/yr. The hydrologic budget of Lake Nasser is analyzed for the 10 -years study period. Evaporation is found to be the most significant component controlling the water budget. Changes in the evaporation rates indeed can substantially alter the lake stage. Groundwater fluxes (bankstorage and leakage) are also significant, but less important than the evaporation, which is found to be the major outflowcomponent of the lake water budget. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Eastern Cape {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the remaining forested areas in South Africa (95. 8 percent Coastal forests and 47. 6 percent Afromontane forests), however these occur in fragments. Due to the rapid rise in the human population and its needs, conversion of forests to agricultural land and the extraction of timber increases, natural vegetation are lost and this therefore leads to forests becoming fragmented into small forest patches. One of the main consequences of forest fragmentation is loss of contiguous habitat, which is the dominant threat to species globally as it negatively affects both species richness and genetic diversity. This research investigates the effects that forest fragmentation has on small mammal diversity and abundance. The study sampled small mammals in Southern Mistbelt Afromontane forest patches in the Eastern Cape. The first aim {{of this study was to}} identify which environmental variable, or combinations of variables, affect the diversity and abundance of small mammals in fragmented forest patches in the Eastern Cape during the austral summer. The second aim was to compare seasonal changes in small mammal diversity and abundance at a forest edge compared to the forest core at Beggars Bush, an Afromontane forest in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. To identify the environmental impacts that different forests have on small mammals, nine different forests were chosen in the Eastern Cape and sampled during the summer in 2013. These nine forests were: Fort Fordyce Forest, Thaba Ndoda Forest, Hogsback Forest, Dassie Kraans Forest, Langeni Forest, Burchell’s Reserve Forest, Maiden Dam Forest and Kagaberg Forest. At each site, three transects of 30 Sherman Traps each were used. Trapping periods within each forest patch lasted between three to five consecutive nights and traps were inspected once a day in the morning. Nine environmental variables were initially identified and after being tested for normality and colinearity, five variables were chosen. These variables were Altitude, <b>Mean</b> <b>Annual</b> Temperature, Gradient, Patch Size and <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> potential <b>evaporation.</b> The number of individuals captures and species richness were then incorporated as dependent variables for best subset multiple regression model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For the second aim, the same trapping methods were used when comparing seasonal changes to diversity and abundance within the forest core. However at the forest edge, due to the small size of the forest, only 20 Sherman traps were used in each transect with five traps (25 percent) placed in the grassland and 15 (75 percent) placed in the forest along each transect. This study was one of few to survey small mammal diversity and abundance in fragmented forests in the Eastern Cape. Gradient, patch size and <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> potential <b>evaporation</b> were the variables that best predicted the individual number of small mammal captures while only gradient best explained species richness. It does however, need to be noted that capture rates and species richness were very low and this would therefore effect the analysis of environmental variables. Future studies should have a larger sample size of forest patches and include more microhabitat environmental variables to determine their effects on small mammal diversity and abundance. However, it should be noted that through climatic extinction filtering, forest mammals are resilient generalists that can tolerate fragmentation effects. Furthermore, it was found that forest edges appear to play a significant role in small mammal diversity and abundance in the Beggars Bush Afromontane forest. Some species were habitat specialists such as Rhabdomys pumilio preferring the grassland habitat and Graphiurus murinus and Aethomys namaquensis the forest habitat, while Myosorex varius was the only species that was not habitat dependant. It was found that there was a greater diversity and abundance at the forest edge compared to within the forest core throughout most of the seasons. One possible flaw was that the sampling methods were different at the edge and within the forest and therefore future studies should ensure that the method stays uniform throughout the study...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{evaporation}} {{rates is}} essential for efficient management of reservoirs and water resources, particularly in water-scarce countries such as Australia. Today, {{it is estimated that}} open water reservoirs in Australia lose around 40 % of their total water storage capacity per year to evaporation. While this loss is of significant concern, the threat of a changing climate has been directing greater focus to how much water will be lost from Australia's reservoirs in the future. This paper analyses evaporation rates from a large water supply reservoir in South-East Queensland (SEQ), Australia, under current climate and predicted climate change conditions using modelling. Daily meteorological projections from nine global climate models were used in the model DYRESM as the driving forces of the thermodynamics of the reservoir under study. Two future 20 -year period simulations were undertaken, one from 2030 to 2050, and the other from 2070 to 2090. The modelled future evaporation rates, as well as water temperatures, were then compared with modelled evaporation rates and temperatures obtained using observed meteorological variables for the period of 1990 - 2010. The results showed that the evaporation rates from the study reservoir will increase in the future. For the period centred in 2040, the <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> will be approximately 8 % higher than the 20 -year average <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> estimated for the present climate. A more pronounced increase in evaporation is expected in 2070 - 2090, with <b>annual</b> <b>evaporation</b> predictions being approximately 15 % higher than the baseline evaporation. The main agent behind this increase is higher surface air temperatures in the future. According to the modelling results, the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> surface air temperature will grow from the present value of 20. 4 àto 21. 5 àin 2030 - 2050, and to 23. 2 àin 2070 - 2090. As a consequence, the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> surface water temperatures of the reservoir will increase by 0. 9 àand 1. 7 àin both time frames, respectively. This will {{have a significant impact on}} the evaporation rates, particularly in spring and summer, when the temperature increases will be more significant.

40|$|Located on the Bahr el Jebel in South Sudan, the Sudd {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{floodplain}} wetlands in the world. Seasonal inundation drives the hydrologic, geomorphological, and ecological processes, and the annual flood pulse is essential to the functioning of the Sudd. Despite the importance of the flood pulse, various hydrological interventions are planned upstream of the Sudd to increase economic benefits and food security. These will not be without consequences, in particular for wetlands where the biological productivity, biodiversity, and human livelihoods are dependent on the flood pulse and both the costs and benefits need to be carefully evaluated. Many African countries still lack regional baseline information on the temporal extent, distribution, and characteristics of wetlands, making it hard to assess the consequences of development interventions. Because of political instability in Sudan and the inaccessible nature of the Sudd, recent measurements of flooding and seasonal dynamics are inadequate. Analyses of multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing datasets are presented in this paper, in order to investigate and characterize flood pulsing within the Sudd wetland over a 12 -month period. Wetland area has been mapped along with dominant components of open water and flooded vegetation at five time periods over a single year. The total area of flooding (both rain and river fed) over the 12 months was 41 334 km 2, with 9176 km 2 of this constituting the permanent wetland. <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> total <b>evaporation</b> is shown to be higher and with narrower distribution of values from areas of open water (1718 mm) than from flooded vegetation (1641 mm).
