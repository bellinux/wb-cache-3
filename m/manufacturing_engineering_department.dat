40|$|INFORMATION Towards {{a process}} {{technical}} data management Abstract. Often, the development of Computer Aided Process <b>Engineering</b> (CAPE) for <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Departments</b> (MED) leads to isolated Databases (DB) because of the past vertical orientation of system design (one database- one application). This usually caused {{a tremendous amount of}} data redundancy, heterogeneous manufacturing DB and, as a result, a configuration of manufacturing design that was far from optimal. Our objective here is to overcome those difficulties, by proposing a new Information System scheme, based on the construction of two models with interactions in two directions: the "Business Model " is a representation of business processes according to different views of the company: Function, Activity, Milestone … and at different levels of detail: Conceptual, Logical and Physical. The second one consists in modeling the trade objects (common and specific) with their mutual interactions. Eventually, this project should lead to a standardization of process specification (resource and operation stated references) with special emphasis on the data handled during the engineering stage. ...|$|R

40|$|Multi-axis milling is a {{manufacturing}} material removal {{process in which}} computer numerically controlled (CNC) tools cut away excess material through movement in four or more axes. Compared to traditional three-axis machining, multi-axis machining greatly increases the capability and accuracy of the CNC machining processes by {{reducing the amount of}} operations required to completely machine a part. Currently, the Industrial and <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> at Cal Poly lacks an advanced CNC class that incorporates fourth and fifth axis CNC machining in the curriculum.

The class will demonstrate the increased capability of multi-axis machining through a multi-axis positioning machining project. To create the project for the class, a demo part was designed on SolidWorks to be machined on a multi-axis CNC mill. The part required initial operations to create a machining blank and workholding for the multi-axis mill, so these items were developed prior to the fabrication of the part. Each operation required a computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, post-processing files, and engineering documentation.

FHEs, which are comprised of a flexible plastic substrate (thermoplastic polyurethane), screen-printed silver ink, and a thin silicon wafer, have {{a wide range of}} potential applications. At the time of this project, FHEs and other flexible electronics did not have a set of test standards to characterize their mechanical and electrical properties. The Cal Poly NextFlex Group recruited three Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering students (known as the BendatroniX Team) from the Fall 2016 Senior Project class to create a Reliability Test Fixture to test the FHEs that they were manufacturing.

40|$|While most {{instruction}} aims {{to provide}} students with content knowledge accompanied by practical application, the classroom experience typically has difficulty providing students with non-trivial examples. Graduating students also express a lack of confidence in integrating knowledge gained in disparate courses regarding identifying problems and synthesizing solutions. Many programs include industry-based projects as a solution to these issues. This approach has various drawbacks, including the difficulty of implementing such a project in a sizable number of the courses, the need for a significant commitment of class time, establishing contacts and ensuring that students have sufficient access to them to develop a model.

40|$|Automotive {{industry}} is currently characterized by very fierce competition {{in which an}} automaker {{has no choice but}} to run at the highest speed to survive. Challenges are too many, but design as a function is in the center due to its tight connection to time to market and competitive advantage capabilities such as production flexibility, speed, cost and quality. Design requirements, standards and guidelines represent an essential part of these product- and process-oriented design capabilities. Design guidelines for manufacturing (DGM) have very limited discussion in literature concerning associated terminology and characteristics. As a result, it is not obvious that the available information systems are designed to support the management workflows of DGM related to a rather technically complex context similar to automotive industry. As such, this thesis is dedicated to first build a solid ground represented by a clear definition for DGM and detailed criteria for how these guidelines live up to the proper level of design support. Then, what information systems have to offer in terms of functionalities and characteristics to enable effective management and continuous improvement of supportive DGM is investigated. Organizational enablers required to assure high quality of DGM using information systems are identified. The study is conducted at Volvo Car <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>department.</b> The results show that DGM systems should enable effective knowledge management process by enabling knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and storage, and knowledge use and application. That is basically represented by key functionalities, characteristics and organizational enablers in which users are enabled to communicate each other as they create, assure the quality of, share, change, tag, filter, cluster and structure individual and multiple DGM. The main driver for how DGM user-interface functionalities should be oriented is related to how the layout patterns and options are perceived as common by the majority of target users.

40|$|Because of the {{increasingly}} globalized world we live in, companies today {{are very interested in}} going overseas to develop and utilize global engineering resources. By doing so, they hope to take advantage of new global product development (GPD) enablers and motivators such as the internet, new collaborative information technology tools, access to new markets, and the increasing availability of low-cost engineering talent. While globalization has significantly decreased barriers so that more companies are hurrying to move engineering activities to its global sites, it is no secret that GPD teams pose significant coordination challenges. Cost savings from lower labor rates abroad can easily be eaten up by the increased coordination costs required to manage overseas interactions between local and global activities. This paper introduces a model that maps a project's coordination structure to help managers decide which activities should be allocated to a global site and which ones should be kept at home. It introduces a new multi-site coordination matrix based on the Design Structure Matrix and an optimization model that chooses where to locate activities to minimize project coordination costs.

The different processes within engineering, logistics and the local office at the customer factory are not lean and can be optimized.

Coach, which is the current software tool, is about 20 years old, and cannot support the need of {{a new way of}} working brought by the increased complexity of the machine. The main goal of the project is to provide efficient software tools to ASML engineers so that they can prepare and execute replacements of new machines’ critical parts, the fastest, the easiest and the most cost effective way possible. Three alternatives to solve these problems are ranked using a Multi-Criteria Analysis method. These alternatives are: Incorporate ARE (Automatic Recovery Engine) to replacements, adapt a module called SAP-ME from <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>department</b> and, last, to implement an external software called Cortona 3 D that uses CAD designs to create Work Instructions for the procedures. The result is that adapting SAP-ME is the best alternative, and with that the goal initially set, has been properly achieved. The collaboration of experts in the field of this project was essential to reach them. It is a profitable solution in 4 years long and its implementation will give high benefits such as time saving as well as benefits to the customers by increasing the up-time of the machine.

The LunaTech team has developed a product that is bright, simple, compact, versatile and competitive with existing products. Through a partnership with the non-profit organization One Million Lights, LunaTech has improved a previous team’s design to address user feedback, concerns of durability, and manufacturability. The LunaLight design includes a 5 component plastic housing held together by 4 screws, a surface mounted PCB, a lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery, one high-brightness LED, a solar panel, and a buckled strap. The plastic housing is compact and can be worn comfortably across the front of the body. LunaTech designed the product to meet a set of engineering specifications based on both user and distributor needs and to provide the unique benefit of hands-free use. With the final design complete, LunaTech has laid out the current design and plans for design verification and production in the following report. To produce initial prototypes, LunaTech utilized the 3 D printers operated by the Materials Engineering and Mechanical Engineering departments at Cal Poly as well as the reflow lab operated by the Industrial and <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>department.</b> The team completed the first fully assembled prototype including a 3 D printed ABS housing and an assembled PCB.

As part of the departments streamlining efforts this study aimed on evaluating streamlining possibilities related to the existing tool design used for static balancing and function testing controllable pitch propeller assemblies before packaging and shipping, along with the related tool development and manufacturing processes has been conducted. The process evaluation started from the point when a hub assembly design was finalized until when a manufactured tool was delivered for use in production. Work focused on locating inefficient activities and product properties, with respect to tool cost and lead time, followed by setting up an amendment proposal, implementing it and producing an alternate tool design of which the effects on tool cost and manufacturing lead time would be evaluated. Post evaluating {{the current state of}} the process and product a set based front loaded product development methodology known as Modular Function Deployment was chosen to be the applied method. This application resulted in a modular tool design that avoided the determined most inefficient manufacturing operation combination of welding and annealing. Modularity increased manufacturing flexibility, enabling more concurrent manufacturing, to reduce the lead time. The tool design also applied integral properties by identifying the common components and features between tool sizes. This led to reducing manufacturing and material costs. Possible lead time reduction for manufacturing was determined to be 35 - 45 %, 3 - 4 weeks, in comparison with the original tool design due to increased parallel manufacturing and avoiding inefficient manufacturing methods. The estimated cost reduction for combined development and manufacturing was determined to be 105 K SEK the initial year followed by 175 K SEK the second year assuming the current tool manufacturing rate. The combined effects of reduced cost and lead time would be beneficial to Rolls-Royce AB by contributing to an increase in delivery reliability and competitive prices on the marke...|$|E
