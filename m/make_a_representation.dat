5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>representation</b> against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

Bajrang Dal State convener Suryanarayana also disputed the veracity of the Somasekhara report in its statements about the Bajrang Dal involvement and former Bajrang Dal state convener Mahendra Kumar. He issued a statement saying that [...] "Bajrang Dal had no role to play in the incidents of attacks on churches and the statement given by Mr. Kumar during the attacks in 2008 were his personal views and the organisation had clarified this aspect then. However, Uday Kumar Shetty, the president of the district unit of the BJP, approved of the report, believing that the report was correct in its assertion that the Sangh Parivar were not involved in the attacks.|$|E

40|$|Shaping {{functions}} {{can be used}} in multi-task {{reinforcement learning}} (RL) to incorporate knowledge from previously experienced tasks to speed up learning on a new task. So far, researchers have pre-specified <b>a</b> separate <b>representation</b> for shaping and value functions in multi-task settings. However, no work has made precise what distinguishes these <b>representations,</b> or what <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> good <b>representation</b> for either function. This paper shows two alternative methods by which an evolutionary algorithm can find a shaping function in multi-task RL without pre-specifying <b>a</b> separate <b>representation.</b> The second method, which uses an indirect fitness measure, is demonstrated to achieve similar performance to the first against a significantly lower computational cost. In addition, we define a formal categorisation of representations that makes precise what <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> good <b>representation</b> for shaping and value functions. We validate the categorisation with an evolutionary feature selection method and show that this method chooses the representations that our definitions predict are suitable...|$|R

5000|$|Robinson was {{the most}} {{important}} member of the Family Compact, an unofficial clique of Upper Canada's elite, who held the true power in the province. One of the more contentious issues dealt with in the 9th Parliament was the naturalization process for persons who had remained in the United States after 1783 and later came to Canada. Robinson supported a policy dictated by the British Colonial Office which required these people to renounce their American citizenship. He was embarrassed when a new colonial secretary reversed this decision under pressure from those who held opposing views. In 1827 Robinson had a disagreement with John Walpole Willis, a puisne judge. Willis took an unusual course of stating in court that Robinson had neglected his duty and that he would feel it necessary [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>representation</b> on the subject to his majesty's government".
