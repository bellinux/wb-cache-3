40|$|We {{document}} {{and describe the}} change in attitudes, hunting behaviour and historic subsistence use of sea turtles by Cocos Malay people of Islamic faith in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Indian Ocean over the last 180 years. We used several lines of evidence including historical documents, scientific journals, archived records and interviews with current and former residents. The results are grouped in two time categories: 1) use of turtles prior to mid- 1980 s and 2) use of turtles after mid- 1980 s. Prior to the mid- 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>turtle</b> meat was popular with Muslim residents and was consumed when available and was particularly appreciated during times of ceremony.

CFPHV glycoprotein H (gH) expressed in recombinant baculovirus was used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect virus-specific 7 <b>S</b> <b>turtle</b> antibodies. Using captive-reared green turtles (Chelonia mydas) with no history of virus exposure as “known negatives” and others with experimentally induced FP as “known positives,” the assay had 100 % specificity but low sensitivity, as seroconversion was detected in {{only half of the}} turtles bearing experimentally induced tumors. Antibodies were detected only in samples collected after cutaneous fibropapillomas appeared, consistent with observations that tumors are significant sites of virion production and antigen expression and the possibility that prolonged/repeated virus shedding may be required for adequate stimulation of 7 S antibody responses to gH. Natural routes of infection, however, may produce higher seroconversion rates. High gH antibody seroprevalences (∼ 80 %) were found among wild green turtles in three Florida localities with different FP prevalences, including one site with no history of FP. In addition, all eight loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) tested were seropositive despite FP being uncommon in this species. The possibility that CFPHV infection may be common relative to disease suggests roles for environmental and host factors as modulators of disease expression. Alternatively, the possibility of other antigenically similar herpesviruses present in wild populations cannot be excluded, although antibody cross-reactivity with the lung/eye/trachea disease-associated herpesvirus was ruled out in this study...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{distribution}} and {{natural history of}} amphibians and reptiles have been little studied in the northern states of the great plains. Relative to other vertebrate groups, the herpetofauna of grasslands is depauperate particularly at higher latitudes where temperature becomes a limiting factor to poikilotherms. Nevertheless, certain species of amphibians and reptiles are common in specific habitats and thus form a conspicuous component of the prairie fauna. The purposes {{of the present study}} were to document the distributions of herpetiles in a specified region of western Nebraska and to describe general aspects of their natural history. We hope such information will stimulate additiona work as well as provide a baseline reference for future studies on the herpetofauna of the northern great plains. Previous work on herpetiles in western Nebraska are either in need of updating (e. g. Hudson, 1942) or are anecdotal or not comprehensive (Heyl and Smith, 1957; Gehlbach and Collette, 1959; Iverson, 1975; Lynch, 1978). Summary: The herpetofauna of the seven county study area in western Nebraska may be characterized in general by a preponderance of organisms exhibiting both wide geographical and wide ecological distributions and tolerances. Species exhibiting little microhabitat specificity and which are found widely throughout the region include the tiger salamander, spadefoot toad, rocky mountain toad, striped chorus frog, lesser earless lizard, fence lizard, racerunner, common racer, bullsnake, red-sided garter snake, plains garter snake, snapping turtle and painted turtle.

Icarus 176, 351 - 381) {{developed}} a useful {{test for the}} internal consistency of crater-count chronometry systems. They argued that certain multi-kilometer, fresh-looking martian craters with prominent rays should be the youngest or near-youngest craters in their size range. The "McEwen et al. test" is that the ages determined from crater densities of the smallest superimposed craters (typically diameter D similar to 5 - 20 m) should thus be comparable to the expected formation intervals of the host primary. McEwen et al. concluded from MOC data that crater chronometry failed this test by factors of 700 - 2000. We apply HiRISE and other imagery to eight different young craters in order to re-evaluate their arguments. We use existing crater chronology systems as well as the reported observed production rate of 16 m craters (Malin, MC., Edgett, K., Posiolova, L., McColley, S., Noe Dobrea, E. [2006]. Science 314, 1573 - 1557; Hartmann, W. K., Quantin, C., Mangold, N. [2007]. Icarus 186, 11 - 23; Kreslavsky [2007]. Seventh International Conference on Mars, 3325). Every case passes the McEwen et al. test. We conclude that the huge inconsistencies suggested by McEwen et al. are spurious. Many of these craters show evidence of impact into ice-rich material, and appear to have ice-flow features and sublimation pits on their floors. As production rate data improve, decameter-scale craters will provide a valuable way of dating these young martian geological formations and the processes that modify the...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: p. 147 - 160. Protective {{gillnets}} (shark nets) {{have been}} successful in reducing the frequency of shark attacks on the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. This is achieved primarily through a reduction in numbers of large sharks. The nets also take a by-catch of dolphins, sea turtles, batoids and teleosts. Catch rates of most shark species declined initially but have shown no trend since the mid- 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Turtle</b> and teleost stocks {{do not appear to be}} threatened by net mortalities, but there is concern about the sustainability of catches of the humpback dolphin. Certain batoids may have declined despite a high release rate. A published contention that shark netting has resulted in a proliferation of small sharks through reduced predation is re-examined and considered to be exaggerated. Reduced predation on dolphins, as a result of shark netting, is estimated. Considerably less fishing effort is applied in the shark control programs of New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, than in that of KZN. On the basis of a comparison of factors such as the nearshore physical environments and trends in shark catch and catch rate, it is concluded that the number of nets used in KZN could be reduced. To test whether a 70 cm mesh would continue to capture potentially dangerous sharks, while at the same time reducing by-catch, a gamma distribution model was used to determine length-specific selectivities in 50. 8 cm and 70 cm mesh nets respectively. A reduction in relative selectivity from 81 to 25 for a shark of 1. 6 m PCL would result from an increase in mesh size from 50. 8 to 70 cm. Despite a probable reduction in catch of dolphins. and certain other by-catch species, the introduction of the larger mesh would constitute an unacceptable reduction in levels of bather safety. Baited lines, or drumlines, were tested as possible alternatives to gillnets. They demonstrated greater species selectivity for sharks, including a higher catch of two of the target species, Carcharhinus leucas and Galeocerdo cuvier, and also a reduced by-catch of nonshark animals. The probability of the bait being scavenged, or a shark being caught, was modelled in relation to a number of physical factors. Although there were insufficient data for a quantitative comparison of catch rates between nets and drumlines, the results indicated that an optimal solution may be to deploy a combination of nets, using the existing 50. 8 cm mesh, and drumlines, using 14 / 0 shark hooks...|$|R

40|$|Northern Plains Borders and the People in Between is a {{transnational}} {{history of}} colonialism and mixed, mobile indigenous {{people in the}} borderlands of the northern Great Plains from 1860 to 1940. Based on archival documents from Canada and the United States, it focuses on social, spatial, political and legal developments. It demonstrates that when American and Canadian militaries invaded, they relied on and targeted mixed indigenous communities. Members of these communities were affiliated with tribes across the region, and moved often and far. As they mixed and moved, {{they were involved in}} the many different conflicts that wracked the Northern Plains after 1860, and they physically linked period violence in Canada and the United States. Subsequently, both countries incorporated Plains inhabitants through Indian treaties and state status categories that created mutually-exclusive, spatialized legal classifications—American or Canadian, Sioux or Cree, Métis, Indian, citizen, or alien. These classifications conveyed different rights, and status and rights were tightly tied to particular places, like homesteads, or nations or specific Indian reservations. One’s legal status thus had direct material implications, linking boundaries of race, place, tribe, and band to land. On both sides of the international line, these social and spatial borders criminalized mixture and mobility. With the concurrent spread of allotment and tribal enrollment, many borderlands indigenes were left stateless—they were excluded from every legal category through which Canada and the U. S. allocated status and rights. This study shows how statelessness flowed through prior racial, tribal and spatial classifications—like enrolled member of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Turtle</b> Mountain Chippewa Indians. It wasn’t just the international boundary that created indigenous statelessness, but the multi-faceted and layered boundary-making of settler colonialism. For indigenous people, tribal membership boundaries, or enrollment, became the most significant aspect of allotment, both in terms of land loss and in terms of enduring community consequences. This dissertation concludes that statelessness originated not in overseas imperialism but in the earlier colonization of the continent. It also finds that the most critical implications of statelessness were material: stateless indigenes were not just landless, or homeless, but worse—their mere presence was forbidden everywhere. Legally, they had the right to occupy no place, no space. In this context, people contested their statelessness, pursuing legal status, rights and property into the 20 th century. This study maps that ongoing political activity and associated mobility, revealing enduring indigenous geographies in a period when Indian people have been considered politically inactive, and reservation-bound. It shows how, into the 1940 s, indigenous mixture and movement entwined Canadian and American histories, making them not just parallel but inseparable. Ultimately, it engages discussions of space, power, violence, law and the state as they relate to histories of borderlands, frontiers, and the West, Native Americans, First Nations, immigration and race...|$|R

However, such data streams are often lacking for protected species, especially highly mobile marine vertebrates. Using five decades of aerial surveys, we assessed changes in marine megafauna on the insular coral reef ecosystem of Guam (Marianas Archipelago in Micronesia). The data allowed estimates of relative abundance, trends, and geographic distributions for several important taxa: sea turtles, sharks, manta rays, small delphinids, and large delphinids. These surveys occurred in 32 years from 1963 - 2012 amounting to 632 flights lasting 809 hours over a 70. 16 km 2 area. Over this span, surveyors recorded 10, 622 turtle, 1, 026 shark, 60 manta ray, 7, 515 small delphinid, and 95 large delphinid observations.

Protections in the region may be working to recover turtle populations, but failing (or have not yet had sufficient time) to recover overfished shark populations.

40|$|That most Columbidae {{birds have}} no {{conspicuous}} sexual dimorphism often {{makes it difficult}} to identify their sex on the basis of external morphology. In the present study, we report a novel sex-specific DNA marker in Columbidae birds. DNA was extracted from one member of this bird group, Streptopelia orientalis (<b>S.</b> orientalis, oriental <b>turtle</b> dove), and used to identify a female-specific DNA marker using a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting. One hundred and sixty random primers were used for the RAPD-PCR reactions. When using the OPAV 17 primer, a novel 902 bp sex-specific PCR product was amplified from known female birds. This fragment of DNA was cloned and sequenced. Two primers, TurSexOPAV 17 -F and TurSexOPAV 17 -R, were designed from the cloned sex-specific sequence, and were successfully used to amplify a 777 bp female-specific fragment using PCR from S. orientalis DNA. This sex-specific marker was also amplified from genomic DNA samples of two other female Columbidae, S. chinensis and Columba livia. Sequence analysis showed that this novel sex-specific marker was highly conserved amongst these three bird species. In contrast, the PCR product was not amplified from male DNA of these species, nor from either sex of the S. chinensis formosa birds. Therefore, we concluded that our novel marker can be used to rapidly and accurately identify the sex of birds from three species of Columbidae. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three essays {{that contribute}} to the economics literature on designing and evaluating conservation policies for protecting endangered species. We focus on bycatch, an externality that arises when commercial fishing activities result in the capture of non-target marine species, often killing them in the process. ^ The first essay analyzes the effectiveness of environmental policies involving voluntary approaches as alternatives to regulation for protecting bycatch species. The chapter employs a game theoretical model to investigate whether a policy involving a voluntary approach, coupled with a permanent tax threat, can be designed and applied to reduce stochastic bycatch. We show that both when the policy is imposed on a single fisher and when it is applied to the industry as a whole, the background threat of a permanent tax can be sufficient to induce fishers to make an efficient avoidance choice voluntarily to avoid bycatch if the performance standard is optimally set. The optimal performance standard, which will trigger the tax penalty upon violation, depends on the discount factor and the degree of variability in the bycatch level. The net impact of both these factors on the optimal standard is ambiguous and depends {{on the nature of the}} underlying distribution of bycatch mortalities, given the efficient level of avoidance measures. ^ The second chapter focuses on the economic impact of a U. <b>S.</b> sea <b>turtle</b> bycatch reduction policy: the TED (Turtle Excluder Device) regulation, which aims to reduce sea turtle bycatch mortalities that result from commercial shrimp harvesting activities. The objective of this chapter is two-fold. First, we develop a theoretical model that identifies the three ways in which the regulation affects domestic supply: (i) directly through the use of TEDs (a negative effect), (ii) indirectly by affecting the fishers 2 ̆ 7 choice of avoidance activities which reduce the likelihood of turtle interactions and hence, the need to use TEDs (an ambiguous effect), and (iii) through a positive effect on the equilibrium market price. The model shows that the net effect of a more stringent TED regulation on industry supply is ambiguous. However, it unambiguously reduces industry profit. Second, we use an instrumental variable approach to estimate the effect of this regulation on the aggregate domestic shrimp supply. The estimation results indicate that when we account for the effect of the TEDs on price, the total estimated harvest loss from TEDs is approximately equal to 12. 1...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> 12 living <b>turtle</b> {{families}} with approximately 250 species, only two families, comprising eight species, are marine. All eight species are endangered or threatened. Seven species {{are in the}} family Chelonidae, the hard-shelled turtles. The leatherback is in the family Dermochelyidae. Five species of sea turtles inhabit the nearshore of the Southeastern United States and the Gulf of Mexico: Kemp 2 ̆ 7 s ridley (Lepidochelys kempi), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea). They have several common characteristics, including relatively nonretractile extremities, extensively roofed skulls, and limbs converted to paddle-like flappers {{with one or two}} claws. They are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Public Law 93 - 205) because their populations had declined {{largely as a result of}} human activity. Today, sea turtles continue to be killed all over the Caribbean for both local consumption and international trade. Kemp 2 ̆ 7 s ridely is now most endangered sea turtle, decimated by egg harvesting, especially for the aphrodisiac market in Mexico City, and by accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets (Anne and Rudloe, 1994). The shell from the hawksbill is the principal product traded internationally with almost all of the shells sent from the Caribbean to Japan. In some islands, the shells are also worked locally to make jewelry for the tourist trade. In 1987, an optimistic estimate of the number of hawksbills nesting in the Caribbean was 4, 975. In contrast in 1988 alone, Japan imported the shells of almost 12, 000 adult hawksbills from the Caribbean (Cruising World, 1990). This paper reviews the legal aspects, especially the Endangered Species Act, and sea turtle management, including turtle excluder devices, head start, land acquisition program, and nest relocation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the regional climatic {{effects of the}} formation of the “Nevadaplano” plateau during the Sevier Orogeny in an overall warming world. Paleohydrology was reconstructed from 590 individual measurements of phosphate O isotopes in continental faunas of the Lower Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation, Utah, U. <b>S.</b> A. Semi-aquatic (<b>turtles,</b> crocodiles) and terrestrial (dinosaurs) taxa are compared to coeval pedogenic carbonates to interpret changing water sources over time. Samples were grouped into four stratigraphic faunas (lower Yellow Cat, upper Yellow Cat, Ruby Ranch, and Mussentuchit members). Resulting isotopic values were converted to δ 18 Owvalues using established δ 18 Op–δ 18 Ow and δ 18 Oc–δ 18 Ow relationships. At a formation scale, turtles (δ 18 Op  =  14. 1 to 15. 7 ‰ V-SMOW) and crocodiles (δ 18 Op  =  15. 0 to 19. 2 ‰) document water compositions of − 8. 1 to − 6. 1 ‰ and − 7. 7 to − 4. 2 ‰, respectively, within the zonal range for formation-scale meteoric water at 34 ° N paleolatitude (− 7. 1 to − 4. 8 ‰) established by pedogenic carbonates (δ 18 Oc  =  22. 0 to 23. 5 ‰ V-SMOW). These data suggest that, like soil carbonates, turtle and crocodile phosphate isotopes can be used as proxies for meteoric water isotopic composition. Dinosaur δ 18 Op(sauropods: 19. 7 to 21. 9 ‰, ornithischians: 16. 6 to 21. 7 ‰, small theropods: 16. 9 to 18. 2 ‰, and large allosauroids: 19. 1 to 20. 3 ‰) values generally exceed those of semi-aquatic taxa. Using mass-balance equations for modern terrestrial animals adjusted for size and inferred dinosaur physiology, ingested water is calculated for the above dinosaur groups. On a member scale, when meteoric-water values are compared with calculated dinosaur drinking water, values are equal to or lighter than meteoric water for most herbivorous groups (as low as − 15. 5 ‰ for ornithischians) and equal to or heavier than meteoric water for most carnivorous groups (as high as − 2. 0 ‰ for allosauroids). Changes in δ 18 Ometeoric water, δ 18 Odinosaur ingested water, faunal assemblages, and sedimentology, from member to member, correlate to thrusting events of the Sevier Orogeny. High elevations in the orogeny attenuated the influences of Pacific moisture, causing rainshadow-induced aridity on the leeward foreland basin during upper Yellow Cat time, and hosted seasonal snow accumulation by the end of Ruby Ranch time, as suggested by 18 O-enriched water (e. g., up to an average of − 2. 0 ‰ from an allosauroid tooth) and extremely 18 O-depleted water (e. g., − 15. 5 ‰ for ornithischians) in the Ruby Ranch Member.

40|$|Rensch 2 ̆ 7 s rule (RR) {{states that}} sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD) increases with body size in male-biased SSD taxa, and decreases with body size in female-biased SSD taxa. This pattern implies that males change body size faster than females through evolutionary time, and that sexual selection {{might be the}} main evolutionary force behind this pattern. Phenotypic plasticity has been proposed as a proximate potential mechanism of RR by affecting body growth in a differential manner in males and females. In this dissertation I studied the role of phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism affecting sexual size and shape dimorphism in two turtle species exhibiting contrasting SSD: Chelydra serpentina that exhibits male-biased SSD, and Podocnemis expansa that exhibits female-biased SSD. I found that males of the male-biased SSD species exhibited increased growth plasticity relative to females, thus supporting the differential plasticity hypothesis as a mechanism that facilitates body size enhancement and thus the evolution of SSD {{in a manner consistent}} with RR. Whether differential plasticity enhances body size of the larger sex in general, or of males in particular, was addressed in the second experiment. In this second experiment I found no differences in growth plasticity between males and females, thus failing to support the differential plasticity hypothesis in the female-biased SSD species. The combined evidence from both studies suggest that differential plasticity is neither specific to males nor to the larger sex, but instead that it is species-specific. Whether turtles follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 s rule or not was tested in a third analysis by correlating body size of males and females of 138 turtle species in a phylogenetic context and at multiple taxonomic levels. I found no support for Rensch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> rule in <b>turtles</b> at the order level and in most families. Instead, results suggest that SSD has evolved independently of the species average body size in those clades. I also found that the family Chelydridae and one subclade within the Testudinidae family follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 s rule, while the Podocnemididae family follows a pattern exactly opposite to Rensch 2 ̆ 7 s rule. These results are in agreement with the result of the common garden experiments. Namely, I found support for sex-specific growth plasticity as a mechanism facilitating RR in C. serpentina, a species belonging to the family Chelydridae that follows RR. Furthermore, no support for sex-specific growth plasticity as a mechanism facilitating RR was detected in P. expansa, a species belonging to the family Podocnemididae that does not follow RR. Further research is warranted to test the role of the sex-specific growth plasticity in female-biased SSD species belonging to clades that follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 s rule. Likewise, similar studies should be conducted in male-biased SSD species belonging to clades that do not follow Rensch 2 ̆ 7 s rule...|$|R
40|$|A {{quarter of}} a century ago, the U. S. Congress enacted one of the first {{domestic}} laws aimed at enforcing marine species conservation agreements beyond U. S. territorial limits, the Pelly Amendment. That amendment gave the President the authority and discretion to impose trade sanctions on foreign nations as a means to gain compliance with international fishery conservation agreements. Since the Pelly Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s enactment in 1971, Congress has amended it and promulgated other statutes aimed at conserving not only fish, but a wide array of living marine resources such as whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other wildlife threatened by commercial fishing practices. The most recent statutes require, rather than allow, the Executive Branch to impose trade sanctions on nations deemed to be violating marine resource protection pacts. In some cases, sanctions imposed on foreign nations have resulted in bitter trade disputes, such as the tunadolphin conflict that went before a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade dispute resolution panel. Until recently, the Executive Branch had been successful in limiting conflicts between international conservation and international trade objectives. However, the more recent and less discretionary statutory requirements may impose difficult duties upon members of the Executive Branch who are more comfortable with flexible approaches to trade and foreign affairs issues. This Article reviews the application of three United States statutes which may trigger trade sanctions for violations of marine resource conservation programs. Recently, three issues have arisen which illustrate the range of enforcement measures that may be taken, the circumstances under which they may be employed, the relative discretion {{on the part of the}} Executive Branch in administering the laws, and the repercussions that may result. Part Two of this Article discusses the oldest U. S. domestic law used to protect whale stocks worldwide, the Pelly Amendment. It outlines the U. S. Secretary of Commerce 2 ̆ 7 s investigation of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s recent scientific whaling efforts, the resulting certification of Japan under the Pelly Amendment, and Japan 2 ̆ 7 s response to certification. It concludes by underscoring the great discretion afforded the President in determining whether or not to impose trade sanctions. Part Three discusses the United States Court of International Trade 2 ̆ 7 s December 1995 application of the Endangered Species Act 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> sea <b>turtle</b> provision (Section 609). It outlines the Executive Branch 2 ̆ 7 s initial, limited application of Section 609 to the wider Caribbean region. It then examines the claim of environmental organizations that the law mandates worldwide application. Part Three next summarizes the court 2 ̆ 7 s determination that the law demands global application. It explains the court 2 ̆ 7 s finding that Section 609 leaves little discretion to the Executive Branch in imposing trade sanctions. The section concludes by noting that free trade violation charges levied by affected nations could subject U. S. imposed trade sanctions to an international dispute resolution process. Part Four reviews the March 1996 U. S. Court of International Trade decision ordering the U. S. Secretary of Commerce to apply the trade sanction provisions of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act against Italy for driftnetting operations in contravention of a global moratorium. It presents the concerns that led to a global moratorium on the use of large scale driftnets on the high seas. It sets out the United States High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act with its congressionally- created worldwide enforcement mechanism, and explains how that law reaches into the Mediterranean Sea to affect Italian fishing practices. Part Four concludes by revisiting questions concerning the need for, and authority of, the global moratorium. It also suggests that a U. S. law that imposes its fishery conservation objectives on fishing in the Mediterranean, an area over which other nations have potentially exclusive fishery jurisdiction, merits review. Based on the three issues referred to above, this Article concludes that the increase in statutorily mandated enforcement measures, at a time when the United States is entering larger and more comprehensive trade agreements, inevitably leads to an increasing likelihood of conflict between free trade and marine species conservation goals. Fair trade and sustainable use issues cannot be addressed when isolated from one another. These recent developments indicate that U. S. policymaking in both areas needs to be reviewed and integrated to achieve a mutually acceptable and balanced practice that will be respected by other States and will withstand the scrutiny of international arbiters...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} from 2009 to 2011 in the Lake of Angitola on the reproductive biology of the slider turtle Trachemys scripta elegans, an alien species that in this site has been naturalized since the 1980 ’s. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), invasive species {{are one of the}} most important causes of biodiversity decline on a global scale. As a consequence, the impact of introduced species on local ecosystems is important to evaluate. Pet voluntary introductions are done by private people and usually concern only the release of a few individuals. However, the number of releases is as numerous as the number of pet owners that don't want to keep their pet anymore and consequently decide to "release" it. Although only a small percentage of these alien species will become invasive, the environmental impact would be insidious and often irreversible. In fact on a global scale alien species may be as damaging to native species and ecosystems as the loss and degradation of habitats. We can describe 3 steps in the biological invasions processes, comprising the initial dispersal, when an organism moves long distances to areas outside its native range, for example through human assisted dispersal; establishment of self-sustaining populations within the non-native range; and invasion of the new range. However, when species are invasive, they have strongly positive demographic trends and are often numerous, therefore their management can be extremely difficult and expensive. Our experimental model was Trachemys scripta elegans, the most popular freshwater turtle in the pet trade in the world. It is a medium to large-sized turtle as females reach a carapace length of up to 24 cm and males up to 20 cm. This reptile lives in a wide variety of freshwater habitats and it is a habitat generalist. It prefers larg pools and ponds with soft bottoms, and with many aquatic plants and suitable basking sites for thermoregulation. Trachemys scripta elegans is an opportunistic omnivore subsisting on a wide variety of plant and animal foods. The food preferences change with age. Juveniles are highly carnivorous. Instead the adults, mainly eat vegetable food. In the late 1970 <b>s</b> a several <b>turtle</b> farms were established in southern USA, where the hatchlings are packed, in hundreds in small boxes, and are shipped abroad. At least 80 % of them die during the first year in captivity. If released terrapins survive in nature, they pose a threat to local wildlife. Only in 1996 the total exports of Trachemys scripta elegans from USA were 8 million individuals, of which 3 million individuals were imported by Europe. With effect from 1997 the EU implemented a ban on the import of this species, in fact already in 1975 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of turtles under 10 cm carapace length in the United States and Canada because they transmitted human salmonellosis. Trachemys scripta elegans distribution includes eastern USA, in particular the Mississipi valley from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. It now has a far greater distribution area that include a lot of countries in America, Europe and Asia, where it has naturalized in some cases. Trachemys scripta elegans released in seminatural conditions were first recorded in Campobasso in the early 1970 s, but sightings only becoming more common in the mid- 80 s. It is presently known in all of Italy except for Valle d’Aosta, Sardinia and Campania. Reproduction is common in captivity, but little is known about its reproduction in nature. Some authors suggest that naturalization wouldn’t be a serious problem, but it is known that this species is certainly able to reproduce in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Latium, Emilia Romagna and in Calabria. This {{research was}} aimed to investigate reproductive biology of Trachemys scripta elegans in order: • to evaluate if reproduction is an effective phenomenon that could interest the study area; • to estimate the reproductive success in natural condition; • to determine preferences of Trachemys scripta elegans in the nest site selection; • to define the step of the invasion process of slider turtle in the Lake of Angitola, in order to suggest conservation measures. The research was conducted at Lake of Angitola, a 196 ha artificial lake located about 5 km from Pizzo Calabro. The lake became a WWF oasis in 1975, and ten years later was declared an International Ramsar area due to the large presence of migratory birds. Today the lake is included in the Regional Park of Serre and in 2005 the area was proposed as a Site of Community Importance (SIC) by ministerial decree. The climate is typically Mediterranean; the vegetation is very varied: the shrub layer is formed by aromatic herbs; the arboreal layer includes a forests of genus Quercus. The animal communities are very interesting, especially the bird population; in fact we can see more than 150 different species per year. The study was conducted from three years, and included 3 monitors per month, in particular from April to October, when the turtles were more active. The lake’s shores were divided into eight transects using environmental criteria. Data collection were sampling focused on visual census observations, on the nesting sites research and on trapping. Also to analyze the nest site selection we divided the whole lake perimeter by differing vegetative covers and differing soil types to study the use of these selected environments by nesting females. Vegetative cover was classified by five categories by a buffer of 50 m, and including shrub land, grass, fruit growing and reforestation; mixed category was used in cases where no one coverage was present in more than 75 % of the subdivisions. Soil type was classified by using the methodology of Casanova (1991), yielding three main categories of dirt, sand and clay substrates and the possible combination of them. Collected variables used in this research were tested with InStat 3. 0 software; in particular we used Chi-square goodness of fit, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman Rank Correlation tests. The results of the visual census showed that Cavalcavia was the preferred basking area for Trachemys thermoregulation. In fact, in this area was observed the highest percentage of turtle presence that performed basking on the emerged deadwood. The heterogeneity χ² test, that was used to compare number of observation and the areas, was statistically significant (N= 2015; χ²= 893, 03; d. f. = 5; P‹ 0, 0001). Monthly monitoring activities of basking showed an increasing of turtle presence from April to July, and it is possible to observe a subsequent decreasing of basking activities from August to October. During the research we found 229 nests. The greatest distance of a nest from the shoreline was 100 m, but the greatest number of nests was found between 0 and 20 m from the shoreline. Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test association between number of eggs and months of the year was statistically significant (KW= 14, 318; P= 0, 0137). “Movrella” and “Ceramida” were the main nesting areas; in these transects there are a lot of emerged spaces that female turtles can use for nesting activities. The correlation between the number of eggs and the depth of the nest was statistically extremely significant (N= 229; r= 0, 2105; P< 0, 0001). More than 85 % of nests were found in mixed soil type habitats, particurarly in dirt-sand and dirt-clay soil types. Chi squared test between number of nests and soil type categories was statistically significant (N= 229; χ²= 116, 22; d. f. = 3; P< 0, 0001). More than 65 % of nests were found in environments with mixed vegetative cover (Grass+Shrubland). Chi squared test associations between number of nests and the 4 vegetative cover types were statistically significant (N= 229; χ²= 116, 22; d. f. = 3; P‹ 0, 0001). We collected by trapping, and marked 26 specimens and in particular 6 juveniles; the more effective trapping method was represented by “basking trap”, that we used on the water surface. In Europe reproduction under natural conditions has been reported only for Spain and France. As we said before, little is known about Trachemys scripta elegans reproduction out of captivity in Italy, but in 2002 Ficetola recorded the first reproduction case of Trachemys scripta elegans on the Po Delta on sympatric condition with an Emys orbicularis population. The population of Angitola represents one of the largest reproductive population of Europe and the most important for our country. In Italy Trachemys scripta elegans deposition in seminatural conditions takes place once a year at the end of June. We recorded for the first time that in our study area deposition takes place twice a year, as reported for the American populations: we think that the first event in April-May, with hatching in June and July, and the second event in July- August, with hatching in September-October. Some tropical Trachemys species tend to nest in open areas that receive direct sunlight for at least part of each day. Analysis of the use of vegetative cover in our study area revealed that Trachemys scripta elegans nests were not randomly distributed within the general area used for nesting, and it suggesting that females were actively selecting nesting sites. In fact the largest number of nests around the lake was found in areas with mixed vegetative cover, as reported for Trachemys callirostris in Colombia. Mixed vegetative cover might reduce thermal stress to the nesting females, as well as lower the detectability of nests to natural predators and human hunters. It has been reported that Trachemys nesting females prefer only dirt soil, but in our study area the largest number of nests in our study area were found in habitat with mixed soil type categories, these zones were characterized by heterogeneous granulometry that increase the ventilation of the nest and the humidity degree for hatching success. We investigated experimentally the occupation of basking sites thus providing a better knowledge on this behavioral pattern. During thermoregulation turtles of lake Angitola mainly bask along the emergent deadwood. Floating (thermoregulation on the water surface) is showed especially during the summer season. This population performs basking from April to October at different times of the day: for example during the cooler months the time of sunlight exposure increases and the basking behavior occurs during the hottest hours of the day. These results are also important for further evaluations on competition for occupation of basking places between this allocthonous specie and Emys orbicularis, our endangered European pond turtle. In fact as reported in literature that Trachemys scripta elegans requires less exposure time for thermoregulation than Emys orbicularis, and for this reason American slider turtle is the winning species in competition for basking sites in sympatric conditions. The invasion process of the Trachemys population inhabiting the lake of Angitola is at the second step, in fact we are in front of a self-sustaining and growing population. Moreover the local population of Emys orbicularis, historically present in the lake until the early 2000 's, nowadays is probably extinct. In conclusion it is very important to complete echo-ethological investigations for better understanding the biology and ecology of this invader, and to provide a monitoring and controlling plans, and to define translocation and eradication plans, but this operations could be extremely difficult and more expansive. The results of this research were objects of a scientific paper and of same participation for congresses. Two more papers are in preparation.
