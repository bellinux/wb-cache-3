40|$|The {{composition}} of the well-preserved fusion crust of the meteorite Jesenice was characterised by means ofoptical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM investigations revealed three structurally distinct layerswithin the crust. The features of the first layer on the surface are precipitates, enriched in metal elements (iron,nickel), and the partial melting of silicate grains, which continues deeper into the second layer. The second layerbeneath has veins with a heterogeneous composition that indicates a different source of <b>melting</b> <b>minerals.</b> The thirdlayer, which is located deeper within the fusion crust, has not undergone any structural changes and its features aresimilar to {{the interior of the}} meteorite. This is additionally confirmed by the presence of cracks, which are a consequenceof shock metamorphism, and irregularly shaped metal and sulphide grains. The structural changes of thethin fusion crust on the surface of this stony meteorite indicate high temperatures (more than 1500 °C) accompaniedby high pressures...|$|E

There have been many experimental studies of mineral-mineral and mineral-fluid fractionations but few involving silicate melt, particularly basic and ultrabasic melts relevant to study of mantle geochemistry and basaltic volcanism (Muehlenbachs & Kushiro, 1974). Consequently, fractionations involving such melts are generally estimated based on the systematics of differences in δ^(18) O between phenocrysts and co-existing glass or groundmass. Estimates of this type, although useful, are insufficient for interpreting the usually subtle oxygen isotope variations observed in many basaltic suites.

The change in the carbon structure was correlated to the proportions of inertinite and vitrinite macerals in the coals. High vitrinite content resulted in an increase in the order of the disordered carbon structure after gasification and this lead greater graphitised ordered carbon structures. While a high inertinite content resulted in low or no structural transformation of the chemical structure. The transformation of inorganic mineral constituents of the coal was correlated to the amount of inerntinite present in the selected coals.

Melting experi-ments were made in a piston-cylinder apparatus, using graphite capsules at 5 kbar. Lower Zone assemblages crystallized from 1245 C, 5 % normative augite in the liquid, to 1203 C, 24 % normative augite in the liquid at saturation with augite crystals. This transit is consistent with modal data and the large volume of the Lower Zone. The 1245 C cotectic composition matches the average Inner Border Zone composition. Quenched troctolitic liquid from the Upper Border Zone, and others from nearby Newark Island, plot on or near our experimental cotectic, supporting a common fractionation history. Olivine–plagioclase intergrowths from cotectic troctolitic melt show mosaic textures reflecting the differing barriers to nucleation of these two phases.

The most characteristic infrared (IR) spectral shape of shock-annealed sub-grained pyroxene was identified: the strongest peak occurs at 860  cm − 1 {{with a smaller}} shoulder at 837 − 840  cm − 1, and small bands are at 686, 635 − 638, and 1, 044 − 1, 050  cm − 1. The appearance of forbidden bands in pyroxene and shift of band positions to a lower wave number in olivines clearly demonstrate the crystal lattice disordering due to shock metamorphism. The shock annealing produced mixed dark melt along fractures, which consists of feldspar−pyroxene and olivine−pyroxene melt. The dark shock melt at sub-grain boundaries of shocked pyroxenes and along fracture of pyroxenes is characterized by elevated Ca, Na, and Al content relative to its environment, detected by element mapping.

40|$|Accessory phases {{and minor}} {{components}} in minerals are commonly ignored in thermodynamic modelling. Such an approach seems unwarranted, as accessory phases can represent a significant element reservoir and minor components can substantially change their host mineral's stability field. However, {{a lack of}} thermodynamic data prohibits assessment of these effects. In this contribution, the polyhedron method is used to estimate the thermodynamic properties of tourmaline, a common and widespread accessory phase, stable over a range of P-T-X conditions. The polyhedron method allows Δ H, S, V, Cp and Vm (T, P) properties to be estimated from a linear stoichiometric summation over the fractional properties of its polyhedron constituents. To allow for estimates of tourmaline, fractional thermodynamic properties for B III and B IV polyhedra were derived. Mixing contributions to molar volume were evaluated and symmetrical mixing parameters derived for Al-Mg, Al-Fe and Al-Li interaction on tourmaline's Y-site and T-site Al-Si interaction. Evaluation of the estimated properties using experimental and natural equilibria between tourmaline and <b>melts,</b> <b>minerals</b> and hydrothermal fluids, shows that reliable semi-quantitative results are obtained.

Glass pools interstitial between minerals and glass inclusions in clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase {{as well as}} matrix glasses are rhyolitic to dacitic indicating that the melts were more evolved than their andesitic bulk host rock analyses indicate.

The assumption that the crustal contaminant in these open magmatic systems is a single composition was assessed through in situ analysis of quenched anatectic melt trapped within its crustal xenolith. Our results show {{for the first time}} significant chemical and Sr-isotopic disequilibrium between melt and source over submillimeter-length scales in a natural system. Sampled glass is rhyolitic in nature, enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and depleted in heavy rare earth elements (HREE). Analysis of the melt for its 87 Sr/ 86 Sr composition revealed isotopic heterogeneity ranging from 0. 7164 to 0. 7276. The isotopic disequilibrium between melt and source is understood to reflect the <b>melting</b> of <b>minerals</b> with different Rb/Sr (and therefore 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) more quickly than the isotopic composition can diffusively equilibrate between <b>melt</b> and <b>minerals.</b> Our results suggest that the mechanism of crustal anatexis produces contaminating melts which are geochemically heterogeneous both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, time scales of Sr diffusion and anatectic melt segregation promote the preservation of isotopic disequilibrium at the micro (submillimeter) and macro (crustal) scale.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new technique for the experimental determination of the activities of oxide components in <b>melts</b> and <b>minerals</b> using the equilibrium between Pd alloy, oxygen, and the oxide component in the sample of interest. If a <b>melt</b> or <b>mineral</b> sample is equilibrated with Pd metal at fixed P, T, and f_(O 2), {{a small amount of}} each constituent oxide will reduce to metal and dissolve into the Pd, forming an alloy. Due to the extraordinary stability of dilute alloys of Pd with Mg, Al, and Si, these metals dissolve into the Pd in amounts easily measured with the electron microprobe at f_(O 2) s that can be achieved with conventional gas-mixing techniques. We determined the activity-composition relations for Pd–Mg, –Al, and –Si alloys by equilibrating Pd at fixed f_(O 2) and T with periclase, corundum, and cristobalite (α_(oxide) ≡ 1). Because Mg, Al, and Si have constant activity coefficients in Pd at low concentrations, the activity of the oxide of each metal is a simple function of the ratio of the concentration of the metal in Pd in equilibrium with the sample to that in Pd in equilibrium with the pure oxide. Therefore, if Pd plus a <b>melt</b> or <b>mineral</b> and Pd plus pure oxide standards are equilibrated simultaneously at fixed T and f_(O 2), the precision of the analytical technique is the major limitation on the determination of oxide activities. We used Pd-oxide equilibration to explore activities in silicate melts analogous to Type B Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from carbonaceous chondrites; the measured activities deviate systematically from model valves but agree to within 1 – 30 %. The activities imply that Type B CAIs did not condense as liquids from a gas of solar composition, and that only very aluminous compositions are potential liquid condensates from the solar nebula. We also used Pd-oxide equilibration to determine the free energy of formation from the oxides, ΔG_f^O, of the spinel end-member MgAl_ 2 O_ 4 at 1150 to 1400 °C to a precision of 2 – 19 % (1 σ). Because the technique reflects equilibration at high temperature, the ΔG_f^Os accurately represent the mineral with equilibrium Mg–Al disorder at temperature, a feature not true of drop calorimetric results because of partial reordering during quenching.
