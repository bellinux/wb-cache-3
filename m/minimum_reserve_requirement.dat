A large share of nonperforming assets in the portfolio of large banks, stemming from losses in the enterprise sector, has been a key impediment to financial sector development. The banking system has been crippled with low levels of intermediation, high cost of capital, severe lack of financial discipline, and poor allocation of credit.

40|$|Our {{proposal}} {{draws on}} the premise that the availability of stable demand deposits for bank lending, in the process of which inside money is created, does not require any act of intentional saving. The mechanism allowing banks to lend deposits does not function well in low-income countries, owing to a number of structural constraints. We argue that separating inside money creation from lending, and distributing it on a nonlending basis to depositors through specialized payment service institutions, could broaden access to financial resources, fuel non-inflationary, demand-led growth; and foster financial deepening, diversification, and stability. We also argue that the proposed reform is consistent with market incentives and sound economic management.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a supervisory framework {{that addresses the}} vulnerabilities of partially dollarized banking systems. The tendency to underprice systemic liquidity risk and currency-induced credit risk creates vulnerabilities that need supervisory responses. The framework seeks to induce agents to better internalize risks by implementing a risk based approach to supervision, following the risk management guidelines of the Basel Committee, and by establishing buffers to cover higher liquidity and solvency risks. The paper also shows that most dollarized countries have addressed their liquidity vulnerabilities, but few have addressed those arising from currency-induced credit risks.

It also looks for systematic differences in the behavior of domestic and foreign banks during periods of financial distress and tranquil times. Using differences in bank ownership as a proxy for financial constraints, the paper finds weak evidence that foreign banks have a lower sensitivity of credit to monetary conditions relative to their domestic competitors, with the differences driven by banks with lower asset liquidity and/or capitalization. The lending and deposit rates of foreign banks tend to be smoother during periods of financial distress. However, the differences across domestic and foreign banks {{do not appear to be}} strong. These results provide weak support to the existence of supply-side effects in credit markets and suggest that foreign bank entry in emerging countries may have contributed somewhat to stability in credit markets.

Germany has taken steps to enhance accounting and auditing practices and to align corporate governance with best international practices. The German banking system is resilient, but relevant indicators show some deterioration. The main vulnerability facing all sectors of the insurance industry is the pressure on capital ratios and risk-bearing capacity from the poor performance of investment portfolios. Securities regulation is of a high standard.

40|$|Most {{central banks}} oblige {{depository}} institutions to hold <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> against their liabilities, predominantly {{in the form}} of balances at the central bank. The role of these <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> has evolved significantly over time. The overlay of changing purposes and practices has the result that it is not always fully clear what the current purpose of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> is, and this necessarily complicates thinking about how a reserve regime should be structured. This paper describes three main purposes for <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> - prudential, monetary control and liquidity management - and suggests best practice for the structure of a reserves regime. Finally, the paper illustrates current practices using a 2010 IMF survey of 121 central banks.

40|$|We {{introduce}} an endogenous {{network model}} of the interbank overnight lending market.  Banks are motivated to meet the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> set by the Central Bank, but their reserves are subject to random shocks. To adjust their expected end-of-the-day reserves, banks enter the interbank market, where borrowers decrease their expected cost of borrowing with the Central Bank, and lenders decrease their deposits with the Central bank in attempt to gain a higher interest rate from the interbank market, but face a counter-party default risk. In this setting, we show that a nancial network arises endogenously, exhibiting a unique giant component {{which is at the}} same time connected but bipartite in lenders and borrowers. The model reproduces features of trading decisions observed empirically in the Italian e-MID market for overnight interbank deposits...|$|R
40|$|The ECB {{has been}} arguing {{in the past}} that since there is no {{trade-off}} between price stability and financial stability, the pursuit of price stability is the best a central bank can do to also maintain financial stability. We argue that there is a potential trade-off between price stability and financial stability. In order to make this trade-off less constraining we propose that the two-pillar strategy of the ECB should be reformed. In this new two-pillar strategy, the ECB should pursue two objectives, i. e. price stability and financial stability. In this new strategy the interest rate should be used to achieve the inflation objective, while other instruments (<b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> and macro prudential control) should be used to achieve financial stability. inflation targeting, financial stability, two pillar strategy...|$|R
