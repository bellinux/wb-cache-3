40|$|The studies {{reported}} in the present thesis have been concerned with the biochemistry of the varietal susceptibility of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to the substituted phenylurea herbicide, <b>metoxuron</b> (N'-(3 -chloro- 4 -methoxyphenyl) -N,N-dimethylurea). The introduction includes an historical account of the substituted phenylureas and reviews {{of the relationships between}} structure and phytotoxicity and mechanism of action. In addition selective properties of phenylureas are discussed together with their metabolic fate not only in plants but also in microorganisms and mammalian systems. Present concepts of the photosynthetic process are also outlined with special emphasis on those aspects directly pertinent to the mode of action of the substituted phenylureas. Studies of Hill activity of isolated chloroplasts incubated with <b>metoxuron</b> showed a similar inhibition of DCPIP and potassium ferricyanide photoreductions in both resistant (Capelle Desprez, Cama) and susceptible (Maris Nimrod, Maris Huntsman) plants. Examination of the Hill activity of chloroplasts isolated from herbicide-treated plants showed a greater inhibition of DCPIP and ferricyanide photoreductions in susceptible compared with resistant varieties. Whereas a severe inhibition of Hill activity in susceptible varieties was followed by scorching and eventual death of the plant, tolerant cultivars recovered from an initial slight visible injury in parallel with a return of Hill activity to normal levels. A reduction in the proportion of ethanol soluble material of leaves was also observed 24 h following treatment of wheat plants with <b>metoxuron,</b> the susceptible varieties showing the greater decrease. The distinction between resistant and susceptible varieties was more apparent when plants that had contacted the herbicide for longer periods were investigated. These results were also reflected in a greater inhibition of CC fixation by metoxuron-treated leaves of susceptible plants compared to similarly treated resistant strains. Studies of absorption and translocation of (methoxy-C) -metoxuron in resistant and susceptible wheat varieties, indicated that a differential rate of herbicide uptake may represent a factor which contributes to the observed difference in varietal response. A subcellular organelle localisation study of absorbed (methoxy-C) -metoxuron indicated that on the basis of protein content the greatest amounts of radioactivity were associated with the chloroplast fraction. In addition, chloroplasts from susceptible varieties contained a quantity of <b>metoxuron</b> several fold greater than those of resistant plants. Metabolism studies made using (methoxy-C) -metoxuron indicated that a major degradative pathway in wheat involves a two-step N-dealkylation followed by hydrolysis of the ureido group to give the corresponding aniline derivative. The various metabolites were separated by thin-layer chromatography and their identity was revealed by a comparison of their Rf values with those of known synthesised standards. Time course studies indicated that <b>metoxuron</b> metabolites represented a greater proportion of the radioactivity of the total methanol extract from resistant plants than from susceptible types. The metabolic route outlined was shown to result in an effective detoxication of <b>metoxuron</b> in in vitro assays of Hill reaction activity where the N-monodes methylated derivative was found to be some 80 % as inhibitory as <b>metoxuron</b> and the N-bisdesmethyl and aniline derivatives were ineffective as photosynthetic inhibitors. Experiments made using leaf discs contained in Warburg flasks in 14 14 the presence of a CO 2 trap demonstrated a loss of CO from (methoxy-C) -metoxuron indicating that cleavage of the methoxy substituent of the aromatic ring represents a significant additional step in the metabolism of the herbicide. Cleavage of the methoxy group occurred at an appreciably greater rate in leaf discs of resistant compared to susceptible plants. Preliminary experiments would indicate that metabolism of <b>metoxuron</b> by wheat leaves is achieved by the microsomal fraction of the cells which contains an N-demethylase activity requiring molecular oxygen and reduced pyridine nucleotide as co-factors. This activity was most apparent in the microsomal fraction prepared from leaves of resistant varieties. The various experimental results are discussed in terms of their significance in accounting for the differences in response to <b>metoxuron</b> of the wheat varieties studied. <p...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{done during the}} rainy season of 1984 � 85 and 1985 � 86 at Harma, Qatar. A weed survey of barley fields was conducted with the primary purpose of identifying the weed vegetation present.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} possible {{deleterious effects}} of commonly used herbicides on leukocytes, cytokine production {{was selected as}} a sensitive indicator. After in vitro exposure of human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from normal donors, the production of all 3 cytokines tested - interferon-χ (a type 1 cytokine), interleukin- 5 (a type 2 cytokine) and tumor necrosis factor-α (an inflammatory cytokine) - was impaired by up to 70, 50 and 70 % respectively in a concentration-dependent manner in cultures exposed to atrazine (0. 03 - 3 μM in 1 % dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO). The effect paralleled that seen with dexamethasone, a known immunosuppressive agent. Other pesticides also dissolved in DMSO - mecoprop, simazine or MCPA (each up to 1 μM) - or dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline - diuron (up to 1 μM), isoproturon (up to 3 μM), <b>metoxuron</b> (up to 8 μM) or metamitron (up to 80 μM) - showed no concentration-related effects on cytokine production. There was, however, an inhibition of IFN-χ and TNF-α production by simazine, <b>metoxuron</b> and mecoprop and of all three cytokines tested by diuron. MCPA (0. 01 and 0. 1 μM) stimulated the production of TNF-α. Thus, exposure to herbicides leading to plasma levels in the micromolar range induces imbalance in cytokine production.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} during 1984 - 85 season at two experimental sites near Riyadh {{to evaluate the}} efficiency of some post-emergence herbicides in the control of weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The experimental sites were of loamy sand soil and were under sprinkler irrigation. The herbicides included bentazon, bromoxynil, chlortoluron, 2, 4 -D, dichlorprop, diclofop-methyl, difenzoquat, isop-roturon, MCP A, <b>metoxuron,</b> terbutryn {{and some of their}} combinations. The bromoxynil-contained treatments (Brominal plus, Buctril M, Pardner and Brominal, each at 2. 5 l/ha) were effective in controlling broad-leaved weeds, improved wheat growth and yield besides being safe and selective. Bentazonldichlorprop (Basagran DP, at 1. 51 /ha) was almost similar in many aspects to those contained bromoxynil, but did not appreciably improve the wheat biological or grain yield. Dic-lofop- methyl (IlIoxane) and difenzoquat (Avenge) each at 4. 0 1 /ha, showed effective control for grasses, and insignificantly improved the wheat growth and yield. Slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity appeared after their application, but rapidly recovered. 2, 4 -DIMCP A (U- 46 fluid Combi, at 1. 0 l/ha) showed good control of broad-leaved weeds with slight symptoms of crop phytotoxicity and did not improve the wheat growth or yield.

40|$|For wheat, initial 30 - 40 {{days after}} sowing are {{critical}} {{in the context of}} crop-weed competition. In case of cultivation of dwarf varieties, grassy weeds in particular are the major problem. Manual weeding or hoeing after 25 - 30 days after cultivation followed by second round 40 - 50 days after cultivation effectively control weed infestation. Spraying the field with 2, 4 -D ethyl ester @ 0. 4 kg/ha in 700 - 800 lit water, 35 days after sowing is recommended for broad leaved weeds. Grasses and sedges growing as weed can also be controlled by spraying Isoproturon (Isoguard/Tolkan/Aretan) @ 1 kg/ha or <b>Metoxuron</b> (Dosanex/SAN 6602) or Methabenzthiazuron (Tribunil/Ucil) @ 1. 5 kg/ha 30 - 35 days after sowing.

40|$|Phenylurea {{herbicides}} are {{an important}} group of herbicides utilized in weed control. They have been on sale since the 1950 s and are still in common use throughout the world from pre- and post-emergence control of many annual and perennial broad-leaved weeds. The aim of this work was to evaluate {{the utility of the}} QuEChERS method for the determination of phenylurea pesticides (chlortoluron, isoproturon, linuron, metobromuron, <b>metoxuron,</b> monolinuron) in beetroot by HPLC with UV/Vis detection. Different types of sorbents (PSA, C 18, SAX and NH 2) and solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate) were applied. The obtained results showed that the best recovery ratios were received for the method with PSA and GCB sorbents and using acetonitrile as an extraction solvent with RSD lower than 15 % for most compounds.

40|$|Four {{different}} methacrylic acid-based, molecularly imprinted, polymers, using fenuron or isoproturon as template and acetonitrile or toluene as porogen, {{were prepared}} {{in order to}} evaluate the template size effect on the selectivity and the porogen effect on the affinity of recognition in molecular imprinting solid-phase extraction. The results of different tests applied to both polymers have shown that fenuron-polymers were highly selective whereas isoproturon-polymers were able to recognise several structurally related compounds (<b>metoxuron,</b> fenuron, metobromuron, chlortoluron, linuron and chlorbromuron). On the other hand, the polymers prepared using toluene as porogen showed a higher affinity for the tested compounds than those prepared in acetonitrile. Accordingly, the isoproturon-imprinted polymer prepared in toluene has been evaluated as a new sorbent in solid-phase extraction procedures for the trace-enrichment and clean-up of phenyureas in ground water and soil samples.

40|$|Two {{different}} molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) {{were prepared}} by precipitation polymerization using linuron or isoproturon (phenylurea herbicides) as templates and trifluormethacrylic acid as functional monomer. These materials {{were used as}} selective sorbents {{in the development of}} molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) procedures for the determination of several phenylurea herbicides (fenuron, <b>metoxuron,</b> chlortoluron, isoproturon, metobromuron, and linuron) in plant samples extracts. The MISPE procedures were fully optimized and applied to the clean up of selected phenylurea herbicides in carrot, potato, corn, and pea sample extracts and finally determined by HPLC-UV at 244 nm. Although a high degree of clean up was obtained, a decrease of the MIP recognition capabilities was observed in subsequent runs. Thus, a previous clean up protocol based on the use of a non-imprinted polymer was used to prevent the loss of MIP performance and to ease the removal of interferences. Following this procedure, namely two-step MISPE, matrix compounds were almost completely removed by the non-imprinted polymer retaining the ability of MIPs to selectively rebind target analytes unaltered. The developed MISPE procedures allowed the screening of phenylurea herbicides in plant samples at concentration levels required by established European maximum residue limits.

40|$|A 2 -year {{study was}} {{implemented}} {{to characterize the}} contamination of estuarine continuums in the Bay of Vilaine area (NW Atlantic Coast, Southern Brittany, France) by 30 pesticide and biocide active substances and metabolites. Among these, 11 triazines (ametryn, atrazine, desethylatrazine, desethylterbuthylazine, desisopropyl atrazine, Irgarol 1051, prometryn, propazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and terbutryn), 10 phenylureas (chlortoluron, diuron, 1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 3 -methylurea, fenuron, isoproturon, 1 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 3 -methylurea, 1 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) -urea, linuron, <b>metoxuron,</b> and monuron), and 4 chloroacetanilides (acetochlor, alachlor, metolachlor, and metazachlor) were detected at least once. The objectives were to assess the corresponding risk for aquatic primary producers and to provide exposure information for connected studies on the responses of biological parameters in invertebrate sentinel species. The risk associated with contaminants was assessed using risk quotients based on the comparison of measured concentrations with original species sensitivity distribution-derived hazardous concentration values. For EU Water Framework Directive priority substances, results of monitoring were also compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards. The highest residue concentrations and risks for primary producers were recorded for diuron and Irgarol 1051 in Arzal reservoir, close to a marina. Diuron was present during almost the all survey periods, whereas Irgarol 1051 exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with highest concentrations recorded in June and July. These {{results suggest that the}} use of antifouling biocides is responsible for {{a major part of the}} contamination of the lower part of the Vilaine River course for Irgarol 1051. For diuron, agricultural sources may also be involved. The presence of isoproturon and chloroacetanilide herbicides on some dates indicated a significant contribution of the use of plant protection products in agriculture to the contamination of Vilaine River. Concentration levels and associated risk were always lower in estuarine sites than in the reservoir, suggesting that Arzal dam reduces downstream transfer of contaminants and favors their degradation in the freshwater part of the estuary. Results of the additional monitoring of two tidal streams located downstream of Arzal dam suggested that, although some compounds may be transferred to the estuary, their impact was probably very low. Dilution by marine water associated with tidal current was also a major factor of concentration reduction. It is concluded that the highest risks associated to herbicides and booster biocides concerned the freshwater part of the estuary and that its brackish/saltwater part was exposed to a moderate risk, although some substances may sometimes exhibit high concentration but mainly at low tide and on an irregular basis...|$|E
