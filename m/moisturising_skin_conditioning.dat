The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based teat dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid teat dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage. This study illustrates the high risk of traditional design skin toleration studies inaccurately attributing effects to teat dips...|$|R

Only one ‘colorant’ (Beta vulgaris/Beta vulgaris extract) and one ‘hair dye’ (Lawsonia inermis extract, {{which is the}} extract of the henna plant) is among them. Some are ‘antimicrobials’[*], {{but no one has}} the function ‘preservative’ (Note: There are many non-natural compounds listed in the INCI with the function ‘preservative’, e.g. benzylalcohol or benzylparaben.). For Usnea barbata extract, the function ‘deodorant’ and for ten other natural substances, e.g. Citrus aurantium bergamia oil, Mentha viridis oil¸ Prunus amygdalus amara oil, Ruta graveolens oil, and Sambucus nigra oil, ‘masking’ was the only function indicated. Some natural substances are ‘deodorant’ or ‘masking’ in addition to other functions, e.g. ‘tonic’. Other cosmetic ingredients used due to their odor are listed in the INCI list part II ‘Perfume and aromatic raw materials’ [15] and not in the INCI list analyzed here. It was found that some substances with different INCI names, different origins, obviously different chemical compositions, and also different functions in a product were itemized with identical EC and CAS numbers in the INCI list, e.g. Avena sativa bran extract (abrasive), Avena sativa extract (emollient), and Avena sativa meal extract (soothing), all three with the CAS 84012 - 26 - 0 and the EC 281 - 672 - 4, or Citrus aurantium dulcis flower oil (astringent and tonic), Citrus aurantium dulcis flower water (<b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> Citrus aurantium dulcis peel cera (emollient and <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> Citrus aurantium dulcis peel extract (emollient, <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> and Citrus aurantium dulcis seed extract (<b>skin</b> <b>conditioning),</b> all five with the CAS 8028 - 48 - 6 and the EC 232 - 433 - 8.|$|R

50|$|Water-based oil-free {{eliminates}} oil altogether, but substitutes an emollient ester or {{fatty alcohol}} in the base, and adds a mattifying agent — usually clay — to dry to a flat, non-reflective (“matte”) finish. Oil-free liquids are quite thick and heavy, and the earliest versions took time to pour out of the bottle. They provide solid medium coverage but dry quickly, and can thus set before blended is complete. The result is streaking, which is then difficult to smooth out without starting over from scratch. The usual recommendation is to divide the face into quarter sections, and to apply and blend the makeup over one section (rather than the entire face) at a time. Blending over <b>moisturised</b> <b>skin</b> with a wet sponge can also help compensate {{for the lack of}} slip. However, they will last a long time and resist smudging, even on very oily skin.

50|$|At highest {{concentrations}} (50-70%) {{applied for}} 3 to 8 minutes {{under the supervision}} of a physician, glycolic acid promotes slitting between the cells and can be used to treat acne or photo-damaged skin (e.g. due to mottled dyspigmentation, melasma). The benefit of such short-contact application (chemical peels) depends on the pH of the solution (the more acidic the product, or the lower the pH, the more pronounced the results), the concentration of GA (higher concentrations produce more vigorous response), the length of application and prior <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> such as prior use of topical vitamin A products. Although single application of 50-70% GA will produce beneficial results, multiple treatments every 2 to 4 weeks are required for optimal results.

The comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date handbook presents the sources, identification, analysis, biosynthesis, biotechnology and applications of important polysaccharides likes starches, cellulose, chitin, gum and microbial polysaccharides. Polysaccharides can exhibit complex structure and various functional activities. These bio macromolecules can therefore serve as raw materials for various different materials, e. g. rayon, cellulose acetate, celluloid and nitrocellulose; and they find multiple applications, for instance as surgical threads (chitin), as sources of energy, dietary fibers, as blood flow adjuvants, in cosmetics, emulsion stabilizers, film formers, binders, viscosity increasing agents or <b>skin</b> <b>conditioning</b> agenta, as food additives in gums, chewing gum bases and as vaccines. Polysaccharides form the basis for useful products, like xanthan gum, dextran, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum and pullulan. Some of the polysaccharide-derived products have interesting and useful properties and show biological activities, such as immunomodulatory, antibacterial, anti-mutagenic, radioprotective, anti-oxidative, anti-ulcer, antidepressant, anti-septicaemic or anti-inflammatory activities.

The data indicated that <b>skin</b> conductance response <b>conditioning</b> did not occur for the shock groups or for the no-shock group.

40|$|In {{the current}} review article it is {{suggested}} that fear is a central emotional state that can be activated by external threat cues. The subcortical defensive system cannot only be activated by intrinsically aversive events but shows also strong plasticity enabling previously innocuous stimuli to get access to the fear system after they were paired with painful outcomes. On the other hand, aversive conditioning does not only result in the acquisition of a defensive disposition, the organism also learns on a pure cognitive level that one stimulus predicts the occurrence of another stimulus. It is suggested here that potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex is a rather specific measure for fear acquisition, while skin conductance discrimination indexes contingency learning. It is shown that the acquisition of fear-potentiated startle does not require cortical processing of the conditioned stimulus. Moreover, data indicate that conditioned startle potentiation is abolished in patients with unilateral lesions of the amygdala. Finally, conditioned startle potentiation can be obtained without contingency awareness, which on the other hand is necessary for <b>skin</b> conductance <b>conditioning</b> to occur. It is suggested that the learning of stimulus relations is mediated by the hippocampus and that conditioned startle potentiation is also mediated by the hippocampus in trace conditioning...|$|R

In avocado, storage is a balance between low temperatures to minimise respiration rate, but not too low to cause black skin discoloration (discrete patches) from chilling injury.

To test this, ‘Hass’ fruit were either not conditioned or conditioned, held at 1 °C or 5 °C for up to 40 d, then assessed for skin damage soon after removal and ripe fruit quality.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the extensive evidence in animals, we previously showed that disrupting reconsolidation by noradrenergic blockade produced amnesia for the original fear response in humans. Interestingly, the declarative memory for the fear association remained intact. These results asked for a solid replication. Moreover, given the constructive nature of memories, the intact recollection of the fear association could eventually ‘rebuild’ the fear memory, resulting in the spontaneous recovery of the fear response. Yet, perseverance of the amnesic effects would have substantial clinical implications, as even the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders display high percentages of relapse. Using a differential fear conditioning procedure in humans, we replicated our previous findings by showing that administering propranolol (40 mg) prior to memory reactivation eliminated the startle fear response 24 h later. But most importantly, this effect persisted at one month follow-up. Notably, the propranolol manipulation not only left the declarative memory for the acquired contingency untouched, but also skin conductance discrimination. In addition, a close association between declarative knowledge and skin conductance responses was found. These findings {{are in line with}} the supposed double dissociation of fear conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the amygdala and hippocampus in humans. They support the view that <b>skin</b> conductance <b>conditioning</b> primarily reflects contingency learning, whereas the startle response is a rather specific measure of fear. Furthermore, the results indicate the absence of a causal link between the actual knowledge of a fear association and its fear response, even though they often operate in parallel. Interventions targeting the amygdalar fear memory may be essential in specifically and persistently dampening the emotional impact of fear. From a clinical and ethical perspective, disrupting reconsolidation points to promising interventions persistently erasing fear responses from trauma memory without affecting the actual recollection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{studies of the}} effect of {{temperature}} step-change (between a cool and a neutral environment) on human thermal sensation and skin temperature. Experiments with three temperature conditions were carried out in a climate chamber during the period in winter. Twelve subjects participated in the experiments simulating moving inside and outside of rooms or cabins with air <b>conditioning.</b> <b>Skin</b> temperatures and thermal sensation were recorded. Results showed overshoot and asymmetry of TSV due to the step-change. Skin temperature changed immediately when subjects entered a new environment. When moving into a neutral environment from cool, dynamic thermal sensation was in the thermal comfort zone and overshoot was not obvious. Air-conditioning in a transitional area should be considered to limit temperature difference to not more than 5 °C to decrease the unacceptability of temperature step-change. The linear relationship between thermal sensation and skin temperature or gradient of skin temperature does not apply in a step-change environment. There is a significant linear correlation between TSV and Qloss in the transient environment. Heat loss from the human skin surface can be used to predict dynamic thermal sensation instead of the heat transfer of the whole human body...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP) {{and long-term}} depression (LTD) of synaptic strength are ubiquitous mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, but their functional relevance in humans remains obscure. Here {{we report that}} a long-term increase in perceived pain to electrical test stimuli was induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) (5 � 1 sec at 100 Hz) of peptidergic cutaneous afferents (27 % above baseline, undiminished for � 3 hr). In contrast, a long-term decrease in perceived pain (27 % below baseline, undiminished for 1 hr) was induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) (17 min at 1 Hz). Pain testing with punctate mechanical probes (200 �m diameter) in skin adjacent to the HFS–LFS <b>conditioning</b> <b>skin</b> site revealed a marked twofold to threefold increase in pain sensitivity (secondary hyperalgesia, undiminished for � 3 hr) after HFS but also a moderate secondary hyperalgesia (30 % above baseline) after strong LFS. Additionally, HFS but not LFS caused pain to light tactile stimuli in adjacent skin (allodynia). In summary, HFS and LFS stimulus protocols that induce LTP or LTD in spinal nociceptive pathways in animal experiments led to similar LTP- and LTD-like changes in human pain perception (long-term hyperalgesia or hypoalgesia) mediated by the conditioned pathway. Additionally, secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia in adjacent skin induced by the HFS protocol and, to a minor extent, also by the LFS protocol, suggested that these perceptual changes encompassed an LTP-like heterosynaptic facilitation of adjacent nociceptive pathways by a hitherto unknown mechanism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPosttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is a frequent}} anxiety disorder with higher prevalence rates in female patients than in male patients (2. 5 : 1). Association with a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs 2267735) in the gene ADCYAP 1 R 1 encoding the type I receptor (PAC 1 -R) of the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide has been reported with PTSD in female patients. We sought to identify the neural correlates of the described PAC 1 -R effects on associative learning. MethodsIn a reverse genetic approach, we examined two independent healthy samples (N 1 = 112, N 2 = 73) using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} during cued and contextual fear <b>conditioning.</b> <b>Skin</b> conductance responses and verbal self-reports of arousal, valence, and contingency were recorded. ResultsWe found that PAC 1 -R modulates the blood oxygenation level–dependent response of the hippocampus. Specifically, we observed decreased hippocampal activity during contextual, but not during cued, fear conditioning in female participants carrying the PAC 1 -R risk allele. We observed no significant differences in conditionability for skin conductance responses, verbal reports, or activation in other brain regions between the genotype groups in female participants. ConclusionsOur results suggest that impaired contextual conditioning in the hippocampal formation may mediate the association between PAC 1 -R and PTSD symptoms. Our findings potentially identify a missing link between the involvement of PAC 1 -R in PTSD and the well-established structural and functional hippocampal deficits in these patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} fear generalization in humans is determined by the amount of fear intensity in nonconditioned stimuli relative to a perceptually similar conditioned stimulus. Stimuli consisted of graded emotionally expressive faces of the same identity morphed between neutral and fearful endpoints. Two experimental groups underwent discriminative fear conditioning between a face stimulus of 55 % fear intensity (conditioned stimulus, CS+), reinforced with an electric shock, and a second stimulus that was unreinforced (CS−). In Experiment 1 the CS− was a relatively neutral face stimulus, while in Experiment 2 the CS− was the most fear-intense stimulus. Before and following fear <b>conditioning,</b> <b>skin</b> conductance responses (SCR) were recorded to different morph values along the neutral-to-fear dimension. Both experimental groups showed gradients of generalization following fear conditioning that increased with the fear intensity of the stimulus. In Experiment 1 a peak shift in SCRs extended to the most fear-intense stimulus. In contrast, generalization to the most fear-intense stimulus was reduced in Experiment 2, suggesting that discriminative fear learning procedures can attenuate fear generalization. Together, the findings indicate that fear generalization is broadly tuned and sensitive to the amount of fear intensity in nonconditioned stimuli, but that fear generalization can come under stimulus control. These results reveal a novel form of fear generalization in humans that is not merely based on physical similarity to a conditioned exemplar, and may have implications for understanding generalization processes in anxiety disorders characterized by heightened sensitivity to nonthreatening stimuli...|$|R
