Conventional <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as the interest rate channel, focus on direct effects of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> actions. The interest rate channel, for example, suggests that <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> makers use their leverage over nominal, short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate, to influence the cost of capital, and subsequently, purchases of durable goods and firm investment.

Changes in the real interest rate influence firm investment and household spending decisions on durable goods.

First, it reviews the evolution of monetary policy in Namibia for the period 1980 to 2011. Second, it investigates the interest rate channel of the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> in Namibia. Third, it analyses the credit channel of the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> in Namibia.

Fifth, it studies the money effect model {{in the context of}} the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> in Namibia. Sixth, it examines the exchange rate pass–through (ERPT) to domestic prices in Namibia. In order to achieve the objectives of the relative importance of the different channels of monetary policy transmission, a structural vector autoregressive model of the Namibian economy is constructed. Specifically the responses of the output and prices to monetary policy shocks for Namibia over the quarterly period 1993 :Q 1 to 2011 :Q 4 are investigated using impulse response functions and forecast variance error decompositions obtained from a structural vector autoregressive model (SVAR). The thesis also examined the exchange rate pass-through from exchange rate to domestic prices using both SVAR and the single equation error correction model (ECM). Estimation results on the different channels of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> showed that the interest rate channel and the credit channel are effective in transmitting monetary policy actions. The exchange rate channel is also operative but not effective. The money effect model confirms that inflation in Namibia is not a monetary phenomenon.

Using the vector error correction model (VECM) approach, we find that the exchange rate pass-through to prices is very strong relative to credit, wage, and interest rate channels. The analysis suggests a relatively fast adjustment of prices to long-run disequilibria in the exchange rate market, albeit with initial overshooting of the price level. In addition, we find no evidence of prices responding to changes in money and wages in a statistically significant manner.

40|$|Implementing an {{inflation}} targeting regime {{requires a}} clear understanding of the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> and methods of projecting in-flation that are consistent with that understanding. This chapter deals with these two aspects of inflation targeting as they apply to the Canadian economy and the Bank of Canada’s monetary policy. The <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Transmission</b> <b>Mechanism</b> The <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> is complex and our under-standing of it imperfect. The Bank of Canada’s mainstream paradigm is quite explicit and well known and consists of three major sets of linkages. The first is from the instrument, the target band for the overnight (or one-day) interest rate, 2 to other financial variables: the term structure of market interest rates, rates on deposits and loans at financial institutions, and the exchange rate. The second linkage runs from these financial variables to ag-gregate demand and the output gap. The third set of linkages runs from the output gap, inflation expectations, and the exchange rate to inflation. The Bank of Canada considers it important to bear in mind that the suc-cess and credibility of the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks will condi-tion {{the way in which the}} transmission mechanism works in practice. The Bank of Canada also finds it useful to have a checklist of the exogenous shocks that typically hit the economy (bottom of Figure 1) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} {{the effects that}} external (or exogenous) factors, defined as economic factors that cannot be controlled or influenced by the central bank, have on monetary policy and the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Adopting a theoretical research position, we aim at identifying the main external factors to monetary policy and discuss {{the ways in which}} these factors alter the economic environment and implicitly the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This is done by changing the way in which monetary transmission channels work and deliver monetary policy decisions throughout the economy, with the final goal of producing central bank desired outcomes with regard to economic variables like inflation, employment, or the production level. We will begin this article with a brief introduction on the topic of monetary policy, the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the potential external factors that may influence the monetary policy and the functioning of its transmission mechanism. The main external factors are identified as linked to fiscal policy, commodity prices, financial market volatility or other globalization related processes. After this introduction, we will proceed with the analysis of the nature and influences of each of the above mentioned external factors on monetary policy and its transmission, indentifying the potential ways in which they can change the structure and internal processes of the transmission channels. As we will see in the study and highlight in our conclusion, the external factors cause decisive changes in the way monetary policy is transmitted, and thus will strongly influence the decisions that central banks take in order to alter key economic variables. The profound understanding of how these non-central bank controlled factors influence the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>mechanism</b> is a key requirement for central banks, as only by being able to predict, recognize and evaluate the effects of current or future external factors can they succeed in reaching their monetary policy objectives...|$|E
