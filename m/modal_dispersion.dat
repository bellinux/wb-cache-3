50|$|VCSEL power profiles, {{along with}} {{variations}} in fiber uniformity, can cause <b>modal</b> <b>dispersion</b> which {{is measured by}} differential modal delay (DMD). <b>Modal</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{is caused by the}} different speeds of the individual modes in a light pulse. The net effect causes the light pulse to spread over distance, introducing intersymbol interference. The greater the length, the greater the <b>modal</b> <b>dispersion.</b> To combat <b>modal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> LOMMF is manufactured in a way that eliminates variations in the fiber which could affect the speed that a light pulse can travel. The refractive index profile is enhanced for VCSEL transmission and to prevent pulse spreading. As a result, the fibers maintain signal integrity over longer distances, thereby maximizing the bandwidth.|$|E

The cylindrical structure is discretized with Chebyshev points in the radial direction, whereas differentiation matrices are used to approximate the differential operators. We express the problem of determining <b>modal</b> <b>dispersions</b> as a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved readily for all eigenvalues corresponding to various axial wavenumbers. <b>Modal</b> <b>dispersions</b> of guided modes can then be expressed in terms of axial wavenumbers as a function of frequency. The associated eigenvectors are related to the displacement potentials that {{can be used to}} calcu-late radial distributions of modal amplitudes as well as stress components at a given frequency. The workflow includes input parameters and the construction of differentiation matrices and boundary conditions that yield the generalized eigenvalue problem. Results from this algorithm for a fluid-filled borehole surrounded by an elastic formation agree very well with those from a root-finding search routine. Computational efficiency of the algorithm has been demonstrated on a four-layer completion model used in a hydrocarbon-producing well. Even though the algorithm is numerically unstable at very low frequencies, it produces reliable and accurate results for multilayered cylindrical structures at moderate frequencies that are of interest in estimating formation properties using <b>modal</b> <b>dispersions...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{have reduced}} the {{spectral}} width of high speed oxide confined 850 nm VCSELs using a shallow surface relief for suppression of higher order transverse modes.

With an appropriate choice of surface relief parameters, the RMS spectral width for a 5 jam oxide aperture VCSEL is reduced from 0. 6 to 0. 3 nm. The small signal modulation bandwidth is 19 GHz. Due to reduced effects of chromatic and <b>modal</b> fiber <b>dispersion,</b> the maximum error-free (bit-error-rate < 10 (- 12)) transmission distance at 25 Gb/s over OM 3 + fiber is increased from 100 to 500 m...|$|R
50|$|<b>Modal</b> <b>dispersion</b> is a {{distortion}} mechanism {{occurring in}} multimode fibers and other waveguides, {{in which the}} signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal {{is not the same}} for all modes.

50|$|Because {{parts of}} the core closer to the fiber axis have a higher {{refractive}} index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber.

40|$|Abstract—A {{class of}} linear {{time-varying}} {{systems can be}} char-acterized by dispersive signal transformations, such as nonlinear shifts in the phase of the propagating signal, causing different frequencies to be shifted in time by different amounts. In this paper, we propose a discrete time-frequency model to decompose the dispersive system output into discrete dispersive frequency shifts and generalized time shifts, weighted by a smoothed and sampled version of the dispersive spreading function. The dis-cretization formulation is obtained from the discrete narrowband system model through a unitary warping relation between the narrowband and dispersive spreading functions. This warping relation depends on the nonlinear phase transformations induced by the dispersive system. In order to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed discrete characterization, we investigate acoustic transmission over shallow water environments that suffers from severe degradations as a result of <b>modal</b> frequency <b>dispersions</b> and multipath fading. Using numerical results, we demonstrate that the discrete dispersive model can lead to a joint multi-path-dispersion diversity that we achieve by properly designing the transmitted waveform and the reception scheme to match the dispersive environment characteristics.
