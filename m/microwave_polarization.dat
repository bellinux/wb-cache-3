40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for mapping {{the distribution of}} new, young and first-year sea ice in seasonal sea ice zones that utilizes microwave spectral and polarization information from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (DMSP SSM/I). The motivation for this work stems from the need for accurate estimates of open water and thin ice within the Arctic ice pack. The technique utilizes the <b>microwave</b> <b>polarization</b> and spectral characteristics of these three ice types through two microwave radiance ratios: the 19. 4 GHz polarization and the spectral gradient ratio, which {{is a measure of}} the spectral difference between the 19. 4 -GHz and the 37. 0 -GHz vertically polarized radiance components. The combined use of the spectral gradient ratio and polarization reduces the low ice concentration bias generally associated with the presence of thin ice types.
