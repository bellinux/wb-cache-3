5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the Conservative Party's <b>main</b> <b>journal,</b> Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis used several public {{relations}} tactics {{to convince the}} general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk (Healthy People), Volksgesundheit (People's Health) and Gesundes Leben (Healthy Life) published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often {{with the help of the}} Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM). The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte (The Recreational Stimulants), Auf der Wacht (On the Guard) and Reine Luft (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, Reine Luft was the <b>main</b> <b>journal</b> of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft.|$|E

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft <b>journal</b> bearings (<b>main</b> bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> of the crankshaft.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the urgent}} {{problems}} {{in mechanical engineering}} is development of efficient inexpensive thick-layered coatings for repair worn-out large-sized parts. To solve these problems a comparatively new method of electro-plating with simultaneous mechanical impact of a tool upon coating under formation is promising enough. In this paper there are considered the peculiarities of plating through this method of thick-layer electro-mechanical iron plating on medium carbon steel 30 and 38 ChN 3 MA, and the composition, structure and properties of coatings obtained are analyzed. Coatings were applied upon crank <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> made of steel 38 ChN 3 MA and upon models imitating crank <b>main</b> <b>journals</b> made of steel 30. Micro-hardness of the coating obtained, roughness, a chemical composition and a structure were analyzed. The results of the investigations have shown that a more significant role in hardness increase is played not by a chemical composition of medium carbon steel upon which it is applied, but a preparation of the surface and the technology of coating and also an electrolyte composition. The structure of electro-mechanical plating is less defective, contains a value of detrimental impurities considerably lower of allowable values and has a satisfactory adhesion strength with a substrate...|$|R
