40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical {{polishing}} (ECP) is {{a promising}} approach to finishing surface to achieve {{high quality of}} surface. However, it cannot satisfy requirements of <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing</b> yet. In this paper, a <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing</b> method for cold rolling rollers is proposed. The whole process of the surface finishing {{can be divided into}} two phases: electrochemical polishing and mechanical grinding. An anodic film is formed exception for anodic dissolution during ECP. A small amount of the anodic film and metal material are removed by abrasive paper in mechanical grinding. Activated metal surface is exposed again and dissolved in electrochemical reaction after mechanical grinding. Residual of anodic film protects rollers. It is a cyclic process of <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing.</b> Experimental results showed that a <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing</b> surface of up to Ra 0. 02 - 0. 05 µm can be obtained by using this method and that it is effective and efficient...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effects of the {{roughness}} of the metal counterface (<b>mirror</b> <b>finished</b> or polished) on the coefficient of dry friction for some of the most common engineering plastics used in current bearing technology. The results show that an optimal roughness for minimum friction is likely to exist for any polymer, and it depends on the bulk properties of the polymer itself. ‘‘Soft” plastics characterized by a low modulus of elasticity exhibit better sliding behaviour on very smooth, <b>mirror</b> <b>finished</b> surfaces, whereas for high-modulus plastics lower friction is measured in combination with rougher, polished counterfaces. The influence of the contact pressure and sliding velocity are also investigated and found to depend on the layout of the tribological system...|$|R

25|$|Superfinishing, {{also known}} as micromachining, microfinishing, and short-stroke honing, is a {{metalworking}} process that improves surface finish and workpiece geometry. This is achieved by removing just the thin amorphous surface layer left by the last process with an abrasive stone or tape; this layer is usually about 1μm in magnitude. Superfinishing, unlike polishing which produces a <b>mirror</b> <b>finish,</b> creates a cross-hatch pattern on the workpiece.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a <b>mirror</b> <b>finish.</b> Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E

[...] Uncirculated coins are like those newly released into circulation; proof coins have a <b>mirror</b> <b>finish.</b> [...] Buyers were initially limited to five sets per person. [...] On January 19, 1975, Brooks announced that the silver proof set price was cut to $12, and the order limit was waived. [...] Buyers who had paid the higher price were sent refunds by check. [...] Brooks stated that the price reduction was because of production efficiencies, the benefit of which she wished to pass along to the public. [...] Numismatic columnist Ed Reiter noted, though, that the reduction came amidst protests from the numismatic community that the price was too high. Coin dealer Herby Skelton suggested in 1977 that the initial high price for the sets followed by the reduction, together with the large mintage of silver sets made the public suspicious and contributed to lagging sales. On August 20, 1975, the price for the uncirculated silver sets was reduced to $7 when bulk purchases of 50 or more were made. [...] A bank in Taiwan ordered 250,000sets at this price.|$|E

2500|$|Polishing and buffing are {{finishing}} {{processes for}} smoothing a workpiece's surface using an abrasive and a work wheel or a leather [...] strop. Technically polishing refers to processes that use an abrasive that is {{glued to the}} work wheel, while buffing uses a loose abrasive applied to the work wheel. Polishing is a more aggressive process while buffing is less harsh, {{which leads to a}} smoother, brighter finish. A common misconception is that a polished surface has a <b>mirror</b> bright <b>finish,</b> however most <b>mirror</b> bright <b>finishes</b> are actually buffed.|$|R
