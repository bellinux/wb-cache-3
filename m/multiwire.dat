25|$|Since it {{was quite}} easy to stack {{interconnections}} (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost never happens in <b>Multiwire),</b> though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.|$|E

50|$|GEMs {{have been}} used in many types of {{particle}} physics experiments. One notable early user was the COMPASS experiment at CERN. GEM-based gas detectors have been proposed for components of the International Linear Collider, the STAR experiment and PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and others. The advantages of GEMs, compared to <b>multiwire</b> proportional chambers, include: ease of manufacturing, since large-area GEMs can in principle be mass-produced, while wire chambers require labor-intensive and error-prone assembly; flexible geometry, both for the GEM and the readout pads; and suppression of positive ions, which was a source of field distortions in time-projection chambers operated at high rates. A number of manufacturing difficulties plagued early GEMs, including non-uniformity and short circuits, but these have to a large extent been resolved.|$|E
50|$|For {{a better}} {{identification}} of the observed reaction, DAPHNE is provided with three concentric and independent <b>multiwire</b> proportional chambers. By analysis of data of the chambers {{it is possible to}} safely identify up to five different tracks of charged particles for each identified event. A reconstruction uncertainty of 0.2 degrees (azimuthal) and 2 mm (along the beamline) is provided. The chambers are located around the target place, which is in {{the very center of the}} detector. The tracks from the chambers are used to calculate the kinematics of a photoproduction reaction. The main information extracted is the path of the proton and the path of charged pions. This information can also be used to reconstruct missing particles that failed getting identified due to detector angular or momentum acceptance or due to the efficiency of the calorimeter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multiwire</b> {{proportional}} counters or solid-state counters {{are often}} used as detection medium, because they provide signals with pulse heights proportional to the ionization strength. An avalanche effect {{in the vicinity of}} the anode wires strung in the readout chambers, gives the necessary signal amplification. The positive ions created in the avalanche induce a positive current signal on the pad plane. The readout is performed by the 557 568 pads that form the cathode plane of the multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) located at the end plates. This gives the radial distance to the beam and the azimuth. The last coordinate, z along the beam direction, is given by the drift time. Since energy-loss fluctuations can be considerable, in general many pulse-height measurements are performed along the particle track in order to optimize the resolution of the ionization measurement.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{portion of}} the CLEO {{detector}} was divided into independent octants that were primarily dedicated to charged particle identification. No clear consensus was reached on the choice of technology for particle identification, therefore two octants were equipped with dE/dx ionization chambers, two octants were equipped with high pressure gas Cerenkov detectors, and four octants were equipped with low pressure gas Cerenkov detectors. The dE/dx system demonstrated superior particle identification performance and aided in tracking, therefore in September 1981 all eight octants were equipped with dE/dx chambers. The dE/dx chambers measured the ionization of charged particles as they passed through a <b>multiwire</b> proportional chamber (MWPC). Each dE/dx octant was made with 124 separate modules, and each module contained 117 wires. Groups of ten modules were ganged together to minimize the number of readout channels. The first two and last two modules were not instrumented, therefore each octant had twelve cells.|$|E
50|$|In {{split-phase}} wiring, {{for example}} a duplex receptacle in a North American kitchen, devices may {{be connected with}} a cable that has three conductors, in addition to ground. The three conductors are usually coloured red, black, and white. The white serves as a common neutral, while the red and black each feed, separately, {{the top and bottom}} hot sides of the receptacle. Typically such receptacles are supplied from two circuit breakers in which the handles of two poles are tied together for a common trip. If two large appliances are used at once, current passes through both and the neutral only carries the difference in current. The advantage is that only three wires are required to serve these loads, instead of four. If one kitchen appliance overloads the circuit, {{the other side of the}} duplex receptacle will be shut off as well. This is called a <b>multiwire</b> branch circuit. Common trip is required when the connected load uses more than one phase simultaneously. The common trip prevents overloading of the shared neutral if one device draws more than rated current.|$|E
