50|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> (Geothlypis aequinoctialis) is a New World warbler. It has {{a number}} of {{separate}} resident breeding populations in Central and South America, some of which may be considered to form separate species.|$|E
50|$|The yellowthroats are New World warblers in {{the genus}} Geothlypis. Most {{members of the}} group have {{localised}} ranges in Mexico and Central America, but the <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> has an extensive South American distribution, and common yellowthroat, the only migratory species in the group, breeds over much of North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} marshes and other wet areas with dense low vegetation. The <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> {{may also be}} found in other areas with dense shrub, but is less common in drier habitats. Two white eggs with reddish-brown markings are laid in a lined cup nest low in grass or rank vegetation.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} habitats {{of these}} birds are marshes and other wet areas with dense low vegetation, {{and may also}} be found in other areas with dense shrub. However, these birds are less common in dry areas. Females appear to prefer males with larger <b>masks.</b> Common <b>yellowthroats</b> nest in low areas of the vegetation, laying 3-5 eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Both parents feed the young.|$|R
50|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> {{is usually}} seen in pairs, {{and does not}} {{associate}} with other species. It is often skulking, but may pop up occasionally, especially to sing. It feeds on insects, including caterpillars, which are usually captured in dense vegetation. The call is a fast chattering, quite unlike that of other yellowthroat species, and a more typical sharp chip.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are five}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> differing in size, male head pattern and song. The Central American subspecies is sometimes considered a separate species, {{and the two}} Pacific subspecies together are also often treated as a species. Recent genetic {{evidence suggests that the}} southern South American subspecies may also merit specific status. The populations are as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of these {{closely related species}} is complicated, and it is sometimes difficult to define which forms merit species status. For example common yellowthroat, Belding's yellowthroat, Altamira yellowthroat, and Bahama yellowthroat are sometimes considered conspecific. Conversely <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> can be split to three or even four species. The name 'yellowthroat' is sometimes used as an alternate name for the yellow-throated leaflove.|$|E
50|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> is 13.2 cm {{long and}} weighs 13 g. It has yellow-green upperparts, bright yellow underparts, and a mainly black bill. The adult male has a black facemask, bordered above with a gray band. The female is similar, but lacks the black mask. She is {{slightly}} duller, has variable amounts of gray {{to the head}} (often virtually none), a yellowish eye ring and a yellowish stripe from the bill to the eye. There are significant racial variations in the male plumage (see Taxonomy).|$|E
50|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation of}} the various populations of this mainly sedentary group has led to its genetic divergence and speciation. This process {{can be seen in}} action in the case of <b>masked</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> where the subspecies are separated by rainforest or the Andes, leading to the development of distinctive forms, such as the Central American race Geothlypis aequinoctialis chiriquensis. This form is found in the highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama, and is separated by 1000 km from its South American cousins, from which it differs in size, appearance and vocalisations.|$|E
