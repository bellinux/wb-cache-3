5|$|The African river <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> a chee chee or cheer-cheer-cheer {{call when}} it is flying in flocks. It is very vocal during migration, giving harsh gull-like calls, and {{appears to have a}} {{jingling}} courtship song. No calls have been described for the white-eyed river martin.|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest {{of the gray}} characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E

5|$|During his career, <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> {{also served}} as a major {{influence}} {{in the development of the}} sport of curling, establishing the competitive tier in the sport and setting the groundwork for the management of curling teams and the creation of high-level competitive curling events. He is also known for contributing to the growth of curling, long known as a recreational and participant-based sport, as a spectator sport. Martin retired from competitive curling in 2014.|$|E
5|$|<b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> {{a degree}} in {{petroleum}} engineering technology from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT), which he earned upon graduating in 1987. He also curled at NAIT {{under the tutelage of}} coach Jules Owchar, who has coached Martin since they met at NAIT. Martin also received an honorary bachelor's degree in technology management in 2010, and received the Alumni Award of Distinction in 2011 for his achievements in curling.|$|E
5|$|The African river <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> a {{restricted}} distribution; {{it appears to}} be locally numerous, although its true status has not been fully investigated. The white-eyed river martin was discovered as recently as 1969 and is only known from specimens and anecdotal evidence – no modern ornithologists have seen the species in the wild, and its breeding grounds are unknown. It may be extinct, although a possible sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The traditionalist Catholic website Daily Catholic said in 2004 that Father Vincent O'Keefe S.J., former Vicar General of the Society of Jesus and a past President of Fordham University, {{stated that}} <b>Martin</b> <b>had</b> never been laicized.

5|$|The Mascarene <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> a heavy flight {{with slow}} wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This martin is often seen perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} breeds in {{suitable}} habitats throughout northern Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. In addition, there is some short-range movement, including martins from southern Arabia crossing the Red Sea and wintering alongside the local breeding birds in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, and non-breeding P. f. spatzi and P. f. presaharica joining rock martins in Mali and Mauritania. In Pakistan, the breeding range of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta overlaps {{with that of the}} dusky crag martin, although that species breeds at much lower levels, and in North Africa P. f. obsoleta occupies desert habitats whilst the Eurasian crag martin is found in the mountains. The pale crag <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> been recorded as a vagrant in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Sri Lanka, although its occurrence in the last country is treated as unproven in a 2011 field guide. The <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> been claimed to visit Turkey, but this is also disputed.|$|E
5|$|The pale crag <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> a {{very large}} range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|The urban common house <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> {{to compete}} with house sparrows, which {{frequently}} attempt {{to take over the}} nest during construction, with the house martins rebuilding elsewhere if the sparrows are successful.

5|$|Mac {{decides to}} move to Sheffield {{to get a better}} job, taking Emily with him. Before he leaves, Mac bets Guy that he cannot sleep with Joanna. Guy accepts the bet and takes her home. However, <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> {{discovered}} some shocking news and tries his best to stop them having sex, but is distracted by Karen's affections. Caroline does her best to break up the relationship between Mac and Emily, but it is Emily who breaks up with Mac. Caroline accused Emily of being a fake but was proved wrong. Mac found this amusing and so Emily dumps him. Mac then tells Caroline that he felt three things when she had accused his then girlfriend: he was impressed and amused, but instead of saying the third thing he kisses her.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} the two Asian species are unknown, but both can be locally common or abundant, and the Asian house martin is {{extending}} its range in southern Siberia. The lowland breeding common house <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> greatly benefited from forest clearance, creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites, although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. This is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites. Despite this, the huge geographical range and large {{numbers of the}} common house martin mean that its global status is secure.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} written to follow {{principal}} landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story. By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes {{than ever before}} {{to keep track of}} the many subplots, which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy. Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes, although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} of the dusky crag <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> not been quantified, but it is suspected to be increasing owing to the availability of artificial nest sites. This martin is locally common in India, Thailand, and southern China, and {{there appear to be}} range extensions to the northeast into Guangxi, southwards into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Its large range and presumed high numbers mean that the dusky crag martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Martin {{released}} his fourth studio album, Vuelve, which became his first record to chart on the US Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 40; {{it became the}} highest-selling Latin album of 1999 in the country. Additionally, it peaked at {{number one on the}} US Latin Albums chart and in Spain, where it was certified six-times platinum by Promusicae. He {{released his}} fifth studio and second eponymous album in 1999; it was a commercial success reaching number one in Australia, Finland, Spain and in the United States, and number two in the United Kingdom. It was certified seven-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over seven million copies in the United States. As of April 2011, Ricky <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> sold over 15 million copies worldwide, making it his best selling-album.|$|E

5|$|One {{factor that}} reduces the chances of re-discovering the white-eyed martin is the drastic decline {{in the numbers of}} {{swallows}} wintering at Bueng Boraphet, its only known site, from the hundreds of thousands reported around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980–1981. It is not certain whether this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to persecution. Other potential causes for the species' decline include the disturbance of riverine sand bars, the construction of dams which flood the area upstream and alter the downstream hydrology, deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture. Very few swallows now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. Bueng Boraphet has been declared a non-hunting area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. Past surveys include several at Bueng Boraphet, a 1969 survey of the Nan Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos. A possible unverified sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a small swallow that has grey-brown underparts {{becoming}} white on the throat and lower abdomen, dark grey-brown upperparts and a slightly forked tail. The underparts are heavily streaked with black. It nests in small colonies anywhere with suitably sheltered sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and other plant material, and the normal clutch is two or three brown-spotted white eggs. The incubation and fledging times are unknown. The Mascarene <b>martin</b> <b>has</b> a heavy flight with slow wingbeats interspersed with glides, and frequently perches on wires. It feeds on insects in flight, often hunting low over the ground or vegetation. In eastern Africa, open habitats such as deforested areas are frequently used for hunting. A number of internal and external parasites have been detected in this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir for Uriel Septim {{has broken}} an old covenant—the barrier to Oblivion: a {{dangerous}} realm that is in another dimension. Multiple gates to Oblivion open, and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra, killing and destroying anything in their path. Jauffre tells the player {{that the only way}} to close the gates permanently is to find someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the Dragonfires—with the Amulet of Kings—in the Imperial City. Fortunately, there is an illegitimate son named Martin, who is a priest in the city of Kvatch. Upon arriving at Kvatch, the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain. A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing the main city entrance, and the player must venture through the gate into the Deadlands—one of the planes of Oblivion—in order to close it from the inside and allow access to the city. After closing the gate, the player enters Kvatch and takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen. Fortunately, <b>Martin</b> <b>has</b> survived and the player persuades him to come to Weynon Priory.|$|E
