50|$|The {{simultaneous}} use of two equally-tuned pipes, of {{which one is}} blown with atmospheric air and the second with another gas, results in two only slightly different tones, called a beat. The function of the methane whistle {{is based on the}} fact that the sound when blowing a whistle depends on the speed of sound in the gas. The sound velocities of methane and air differ by about 31%. For a 1% <b>methane-air</b> <b>mixture,</b> the speed of sound is about 1.0031 times as high as in air. If the pipes are tuned to 440 Hz in air, the air-methane pipe has a frequency of 440 Hz × 1.0031 = 441.4 Hz. If two identically tuned pipes are blown by air and an air-methane mixture, the only slightly different tones produce a clearly audible beat. If the gas mixture changes in the resonator, then its resonance spectrum changes. By means of an absorber, interfering constituents of air such as humidity and carbon dioxide are removed. The methane whistle indicated methane levels in the mine air from 1 vol% and above.|$|E

The experimental results suggested {{diameter of the}} spherical vessel, the length of connection pipes of single vessel {{and the length of}} connection pipes between two spherical vessels {{played a significant role in}} explosion intensity of <b>methane-air</b> <b>mixture</b> in spherical vessels and pipes. The maximum explosion pressure was almost constant, while the maximum rate of pressure rise decreased with an increasing diameter of the vessel. The maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise in single vessel with connection pipes both decreased due to the increase of the length of connection pipes. There was a linear relationship between explosion intensity and the length. And the maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise appeared at the end of connection pipes. For linked vessels, the explosion intensity in secondary vessel increased with an increasing length of connection pipes with linear relationships.

40|$|This study investigates {{peculiarities of}} the {{filtration}} combustion (FC) of the gaseous fuel-air mixtures in a porous inertia media (PIM). Combustion wave velocities and temperatures were measured for hydrogen-air, propane-air and <b>methane-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> in the PIM at different mixture filtration velocities. It is {{shown that the}} dependences of the combustion wave velocities on the equivalence ratio are V-shaped, It was further confirmed that the FC in the PIM has more contrasts than similarities with the normal homogeneous combustion. One of the interesting observations in the present study, which is not common in normal homogenous combustion, is the shifting of the fuel-air equivalent ratio at the minimum combustion wave velocity from the stoichiometric condition (¢ = 1). For a hydrogen-air mixture, the fuel-air equivalence ratio at the minimum combustion velocity shifts from the stoichiometric condition to the rich region, while for the propane-air and <b>methane-air</b> <b>mixtures</b> the fuel-air equivalence ratio at the minimum combustion velocity shifts toward fuel-leaner conditions.
