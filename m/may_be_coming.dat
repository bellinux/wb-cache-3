500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{described}} the episode as [...] "kind of cute tonight, {{and kind of}} flat in places, and kind of sad." [...] Pastorek {{said one of the}} most interesting aspects of [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was the relationship between Michael and Dwight: [...] "After their respective failed romances with Holly and Angela, Michael and Dwight <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to the awkward realization that the most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another, and that may be causing a little tension." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was a [...] "solid offering", but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into. Fickett said it was [...] "fun to watch Michael squirm" [...] both when he thought he was in trouble, and when he was robbed credit for his good idea; he also liked when Jim encouraged Dwight not to take the fall for Michael, and when the others in the office rallied around Dwight when David Wallace gave Dwight credit for the success.|$|E
2500|$|Seacrest {{has been}} criticized by The Wrap and MSNBC Entertainment {{contributors}} for [...] "critiquing the judges’ comments" [...] and becoming more aggressive. Ratings for this season have dropped significantly compared to the prior two seasons leading to speculation that its run as the number one show on television <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to a close. Reasons for the decline have ranged from the smaller role and pending departure of Simon Cowell to the more unpredictable behavior of Ryan Seacrest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author has}} stated that she enjoys writing Dumbledore because he [...] "is the epitome of goodness." [...] Rowling said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he [...] "knows pretty much everything" [...] about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling {{mentioned}} that Dumbledore regrets [...] "that he has always {{had to be the}} one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know." [...] As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, [...] "Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." [...] In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore [...] "more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and– and quite stately." [...] During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about 150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or 116 when he died.|$|E

2500|$|Recent archaeological data {{suggests}} that the essential elements {{of the kind of}} material culture typical of contemporary San hunter-gatherers was already present at least 40,000 years ago, including digging sticks of similar materials used today, ostrich egg shell beads, bone arrow heads with individual maker's marks etched and embedded with red ochre, and poison applicators. There is also a suggestion that [...] "pressure flaking best explains the morphology of lithic artifacts recovered from the c. 75-ka Middle Stone Age levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa. The technique was used during the final shaping of Still Bay bifacial points made on heat‐treated silcrete." [...] Both pressure flaking and heat treatment of materials was previously thought to have occurred much later in prehistory, and both indicate a behaviourally modern sophistication in the use of natural materials. Further reports of research on caves sites along the southern African coast indicate that [...] "the debate as to when cultural and cognitive characteristics typical of modern humans first appeared" [...] <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to an end, as [...] "advanced technologies with elaborate chains of production" [...] which [...] "often demand high-fidelity transmission and thus language" [...] have been found at Pinnacle Point Site 5–6. [...] These have been dated to approximately 71,000 years ago. [...] The researchers suggest that their research [...] "shows that microlithic technology originated early in South Africa, evolved over a vast time span (c. 11,000 years), and was typically coupled to complex heat treatment that persisted for nearly 100,000 years. Advanced technologies in Africa were early and enduring; a small sample of excavated sites in Africa is the best explanation for any perceived 'flickering' pattern." ...|$|E

50|$|Financial {{domination}} is a paraphilia {{stemming from}} a devotion of financial slavery or to be dominated in a financial way. Many pro-dommes and femdommes found {{this to be a}} natural extension for any professional dominatrix who is already being paid for fetish services, and began to exploit it with clients who shared her fetish. Some domme clients were aroused as much by giving money to a dominant woman, as they were by any fetishes they <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to see her for. The dominatrix <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> aroused from being financially worshiped.|$|R
50|$|This {{frequency}} modulation method {{revealed that the}} point from which waves were being reflected was approximately 56 miles (90 km). However, it did not establish that the waves were reflected from above, indeed they <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> from hills somewhere between Oxford and Bournemouth. The second method, which involved finding the angle of incidence of the reflected waves at the receiver, showed for sure that they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from above. Triangulations from this angle gave results for the height of reflection compatible with the {{frequency modulation}} method. We will not go into this method in detail because it involves fairly complex calculations using Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory.|$|R

50|$|A market {{participant}} <b>may</b> either <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from the Supply Side, hence supplying excess money (in {{the form of}} investments) {{in favor of the}} demand side; or coming from the Demand Side, hence demanding excess money (in the form of borrowed equity) in favor of the Supply Side. This equation originated from Keynesian Advocates. The theory explains that a given market may have excess cash; hence the supplier of funds may lend it; and those in need of cash may borrow the funds supplied. Hence, the equation: aggregate savings equals aggregate investments.|$|R
