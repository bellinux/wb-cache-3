25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> is a {{large bore}} tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E

50|$|A Quantitative {{method to}} {{determine}} the amount of phosphate present in samples such as boiler feedwater is as follows. A measured amount of boiler water is poured into a <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> and ammonium heptamolybdate reagent is added. The tube is then stoppered and vigorously shaken. The next step is to add dilute stannous chloride reagent, which has been freshly prepared from concentrated stannous chloride reagent and distilled water, to the mixture in the tube. This will produce a blue color (due to the formation of molybdenum blue) and the depth of the blue color indicates the amount of phosphate in the boiler water. The absorbance of the blue solution can be measured with a colorimeter and the concentration of phosphate in the original solution can be calculated. Alternatively, a direct (but approximate) reading of phosphate concentration can be obtained by using a Lovibond comparator. This method for phosphate determination is known as Deniges' method.|$|E
50|$|The {{permeate}} is {{a concentrated}} mixture {{that must be}} diluted with additional air prior to entering the nitrox compressor. It exits the membrane at ambient to slightly negative pressure and travels into the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube,</b> where it mixes homogeneously with filtered outside air. The amount of dilution, and thus the final percentage of O2, is obtained by adjusting the Input Pressure Regulator. As pressure is increased, permeate flow increases, air flow decreases, and {{a higher percentage of}} O2 nitrox is produced. As pressure is decreased, permeate flow decreases, air flow increases, and a lower percentage of O2 nitrox is produced. This relationship between permeate flow and air flow exists because the total of these two flow rates will always equal the intake flow rate demanded by the nitrox compressor. The resulting nitrox mixture is analyzed for its approximate percentage of O2 before entering the nitrox compressor and again prior to usage to determine the precise percentage of O2.|$|E

50|$|All waterjets {{follow the}} same {{principle}} of using high pressure water focused into a beam by a nozzle. Most machines accomplish this by first running the water through a high pressure pump. There {{are two types of}} pumps used to create this high pressure; an intensifier pump and a direct drive or crankshaft pump. A direct drive pump works much like a car engine, forcing water through high pressure tubing using plungers attached to a crankshaft. An intensifier pump creates pressure by using hydraulic oil to move a piston forcing the water through a tiny hole. The water then travels along the high pressure tubing to the nozzle of the waterjet. In the nozzle, the water is focused into a thin beam by a jewel orifice. This beam of water is ejected from the nozzle, cutting through the material by spraying it with the jet of high-speed water. The process is the same for abrasive waterjets until the water reaches the nozzle. Here abrasives such as garnet and aluminium oxide, are fed into the nozzle via an abrasive inlet. The abrasive then mixes with the water in a <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> and is forced out the end at high pressure.|$|E

The March 1984 issue of the Mechanical Engineering magazine showed more details and materials cut with AWJ such as titanium, aluminum, glass, and stone. Dr. Mohamed Hashish, was awarded a patent on forming AWJ in 1987. Dr. Hashish, who also coined the new term Abrasive Waterjet (AWJ), and his team continued to develop and improve the AWJ technology and its hardware for many applications which is now in over 50 industries worldwide.

40|$|Increase in land costs due to {{urbanization}} has {{led many}} coastal communities towards marine outfalls as a convenient means of disposing of domestic and non toxic wastes. It has been common practice to use submerged outfalls for small discharges {{to take advantage of}} the immediate dilution available as the effluent rises to the surface. The prime objective of the marine outfall installation is to maximize the total dilution of the waste and to minimize impact on the marine environment. Jet pumps or mixing tubes may be used to improve the initial dilution and to promote plume submergence in small outfalls. Theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out but field trials have been very limited. [...] Studies have shown that very limited improvement in dilution is obtained with conventional mixing tubes. The basic reason for this is that the combination of increased flow and increased diameter of the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> modify the values of density difference, relative depth and densimetric Froude number. Due to these changes less mixing takes place between the end of the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> and the surface than would have taken place in the original jet discharged without a <b>mixing</b> <b>tube.</b> The combination of increased dilution within the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> and decreased dilution in the buoyant jet has been found to limit the improvement factor of overall dilution to a factor of about two. [...] In this thesis experiments on a novel shape or <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> are described. This was designed to overcome the problems discussed above and used a transition from a square section at entry to a two dimensional slot at the exit.

40|$|Present work {{represents}} {{the second part}} of a two parts paper. The complex aerodynamic phenomena, which take place both inside and downstream the swirler - <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> assembly, have been studied with different and complementary techniques {{in order to have a}} complete characterization of the effect of the geometrical parameters variation on many aspects of the flow. The first part was focused on the aerodynamic analysis of the flow in the swirler exit plane, while this second part is focused on the experimental investigation on the flow inside and downstream the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube.</b> Measurements have been performed on three axial stations. One is placed inside the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube,</b> in order to characterize the flow arriving from the swirler. The other two are placed downstream the <b>mixing</b> <b>tube</b> discharge section in order to identify the main flow features, such as the presence of flow recirculation and consequently the radial extension of the separation bubble. A four beams two colours Laser Doppler Velocimeter (Dantec Fiber Flow), in backward scatter configuration mounted on a three-axis computer-controlled traversing mechanism, was employed for the present study. Results indicate a strong influence of the geometrical parameters on the flowfield in terms of velocity component distributions, turbulence intensity and separation bubble extension.

The formulated finite elements allow any (n,m) chiral nanotube, or <b>mixed</b> <b>tubes</b> formed by periodically-repeating heterojunctions, {{to be examined}} quickly and accurately using only three input parameters (radius, chiral angle, and unit cell length) and a trivial structured mesh, thus avoiding the tedious geometry generation and energy minimization tasks associated with ab initio and lattice dynamics-based techniques. A critical assessment of the technique is pursued to determine the validity range of the resulting dispersion calculations, and to identify any dispersion anomalies. Two small anomalies in the dispersion curves are documented, which can be easily identified and therefore rectified. They include difficulty in achieving a zero energy point for the acoustic twisting phonon, and a branch veering in nanotubes with nonzero chiral angle. The twisting mode quickly restores its correct group velocity as wavenumber increases, while the branch veering {{is associated with a}} rapid exchange of eigenvectors at the veering point, which also lessens its impact.
