40|$|The Companies Act, 71 of 2008 {{repealed}} the Companies Act, of 61 of 1973, {{the former}} Act came into operation on the 1 st May 2011. The repealing of the 1973 Act meant {{that a new}} legal dispensation was ushered in, these changes obviously affected {{the manner in which}} the law worked prior to the 1 st May 2011. The repurchase of shares by the company is just but one of the many aspects which were affected by the new act. In order to understand the thought process of the legislature when enacting the current law, the history and evolution of section 48 is imperative. Section 80 - 90 and 46 together with 48 of the old and the new act respectively are the legislative framework behind the South African share repurchases rule. This research investigates the genesis of share repurchases in South Africa and thereafter observes the exodus from the original principle to the status quo. Prior to 1999, share repurchases were governed through the capital <b>maintenance</b> <b>rule</b> which was imported from England and other foreign jurisdictions. In terms of the capital <b>maintenance</b> <b>rule</b> the reduction of contributed share capital in any manner was prohibited. The issued share capital of the company was perceived as a guarantee fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of the company in the event that the company defaults on its payments or is liquidated. In 1999, the Companies Amendment Act introduced sections 85 to 90 which was a paradigm shift from the out dated and superfluous share capital <b>maintenance</b> <b>rule,</b> this paradigm shift spared no sub rule within the capital <b>maintenance</b> <b>rule</b> and it is from these legal developments where we saw share repurchase rules including other sub-rules (which are beyond the scope this work) emerging. Section 48 of the new companies act read with other relevant sections the Act thereof prescribes the procedure and requirements for share repurchases, these sections further prescribe the consequences and remedies for non-compliance with the prescribed procedure and requirements. It is against this background that section 48 effects, impact as well as the interpretation thereof are investigated. In terms of section 48, the company may purchase shares issued by it under certain circumstances provided that it complies with the requirements laid down in the Act, furthermore section 48 transactions may under certain circumstances trigger tax liability for the parties involved.

The use of an expert panel was an appropriate and practical method of determining which SSCs are risk significant.

Although required to do so, licensees were not monitoring at the system or train level the performance or condition for some systems used in standby service but not significant to risk. Most licensees had not established adequate monitoring of structures under the rule.

30|$|Let us {{discuss the}} {{solution}} evaluation at t = T. That is, let us examine whether our archive <b>maintenance</b> <b>rule</b> is valid {{for the last}} evaluation at t = T. When x_T- 1 ∈ S_T- 1, there are two possibilities: |S_T- 1 | = 1 and |S_T- 1 | = 2. If |S_T- 1 | = 1 [i.e., when (a) is satisfied in the archive maintenance rule], a new solution x_T can be evaluated and compared with x_T- 1. The final solution is the better one between x_T- 1 and x_T. Thus |S_T| = 1 is satisfied. If |S_T- 1 | = 2 (i.e., when (a) is not satisfied), one candidate solution in S_T- 1 is x_T- 1. The other candidate solution in S_T- 1 is re-evaluated and compared with x_T- 1 at t = T. The final solution is the better one in this comparison. Thus |S_T| = 1 is satisfied. When x_T- 1 ∉ S_T- 1, |S_T- 1 | = 1 always holds from our archive <b>maintenance</b> <b>rule.</b> In this case, (b) is never satisfied since |S_T- 1 | = 1 and t = T. Thus a new solution is not examined. Since we have only a single candidate in S_T- 1, its re-evaluation is meaningless. Thus no solution is evaluated at t = T. As a result, |S_T| = 1 holds after the termination of the algorithm.|$|R

According to the AWBI report, between January 2014 and April 2014, out of a total of 120 festival days, 38 out of the 59 elephants were leased out. In the four-month span, 52-year-old elephant Gopikrishnan worked for 77 days. In the case of a celebrity elephant like the 74-year-old Padmanabhan, he was made to toil for 18-20 hours, earning up to Rs.7 lakh for the temple in a day, even though his retirement age is 65. The revenue that festival elephants generate annually adds up to Rs.3.7 crore. The revenue for 2014-15, including donations by devotees, sponsorships and elephant camps, is estimated to touch Rs.7 crore. The report concludes by saying “No institution, however prestigious and powerful, can hope to insulate itself when it is on the wrong side of public opinion on a long-standing issue of humane concern.
