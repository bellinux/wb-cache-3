In his early days with Rush, much of his lyrical output was influenced by fantasy, science fiction, mythology and philosophy. However, nearly as <b>much</b> <b>would</b> deal with real world or personal issues such as life on the road and parts of his adolescence.|$|E
5|$|While the {{political}} situation was becoming increasingly untenable, Playford himself continued with his job of building the state. Plans for Adelaide's future development, including a road transport plan, were commissioned. Playford saw a modern road transport system as crucial to continuing the industrialisation of the state, and motor vehicle registrations, which had increased {{by a factor of}} 50 {{since the end of the}} war, required road expansion. The Metropolitan Plan, a 1962 publication of the Town Planning Committee called for the construction of 56km of freeways and speculated that three times as <b>much</b> <b>would</b> be needed in future. However, most of this never materialised; only the South Eastern Freeway was approved during Playford's term, and construction just after he left office. A more ambitious plan for a freeway system was commissioned, but the study was not completed until after Playford's departure and was scrapped by later governments due to widespread public objections to the proposed demolition of entire suburbs for interchanges. Playford was criticised for seeing roads only from an engineering and utilitarian standpoint and neglecting the social and community effects of such building. The state's population hit in the one million mark in 1963 and the Port Stanvac oil refinery was completed. Adelaide's water supply was increased and the pipeline from Morgan to Whyalla was duplicated.|$|E

Levinson said Meyer was getting the New Jersey money. Torres said he thought Meyer only handled the Florida area.|$|E
25|$|As Geldof {{began to}} learn more about the situation, he {{discovered}} that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was because of repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks.

25|$|By 1952, as {{the funding}} ended, {{the economy of}} every {{participant}} state had surpassed pre-war levels; for all Marshall Plan recipients, output in 1951 was at least 35% higher than in 1938.

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that Mexico would not stand for this kind of an agreement, some critics from the labor {{movement}} would not settle for any viable alternatives. In response, part of the labor movement wanted to declare their open opposition to the agreement, and to push for NAFTA's rejection in Congress. Ultimately, the ambivalence of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too <b>much</b> <b>would</b> cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In early 1989, {{he made a}} {{programme}} (broadcast in July) on {{his visit}} to Russia and his impressions on that country. The BBC originally {{wanted him to do}} a programme on India but the Indian high commission in London, England refused him a visa. When he visited Russia, Powell went to the graves of 600,000 people who died during the siege of Leningrad and saying that he could not believe a people who had suffered so <b>much</b> <b>would</b> willingly start another war. He also went to a veterans' parade (wearing his own medals) and talked with Russian soldiers with the aid of an interpreter. However, the programme was criticised by those who believed that Powell had dismissed the Soviet Union's threat to the West since 1945 and that he had been too impressed with Russia's sense of national identity. When German reunification was on the agenda in mid-1989, Powell claimed that Britain urgently needed to create an alliance with the Soviet Union in view of Germany's effect on {{the balance of power in}} Europe.|$|E
25|$|After {{attempting}} {{to develop his}} own version of the proposed show called House of Mystery, Barbera, who handled the development and sale of Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna handled production, passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their original treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, Linda's brother W.W. and their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who were all members of the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too <b>Much</b> <b>would</b> be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty dog. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.|$|E

He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How <b>much</b> <b>would</b> you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And {{that was the first}} time I ever heard the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
500|$|Monetary values after 1830 are {{inflated}} {{to contemporary}} values using {{changes in the}} British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost of construction or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. As GDP measures are not available prior to 1830, pre-1830 dates are inflated using changes in British (predominantly southern English) average wage labour earnings, this measures the social cost of dedicating labour to a particular project. [...] Both of these measures allow a reader to consider the equivalent social impact in current terms: how <b>much</b> <b>would</b> contemporary Britons need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of January 2017, the latest year for which contemporary figures are available is 2015.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the general}} feeling {{around the league}} was that the {{punishment}} {{could have been more}} severe. Detroit Red Wings general manager Jack Adams said that Campbell [...] "could do no less" [...] and [...] "I thought he would be suspended until January 1 of next season." [...] Red Wings forward Ted Lindsay, whom the league had disciplined earlier the same season for an incident in Toronto in which he attacked a Maple Leafs fan who had been threatening teammate Gordie Howe, expressed the stronger opinion that Richard was lucky not to get a life suspension: [...] "In baseball, football or almost anything else that <b>much</b> <b>would</b> be almost automatic. I say they should have suspended him for life." [...] Bruins president Walter A. Brown agreed with Adams, saying [...] "That's the least they could do"; Bruins player Fleming Mackell said, [...] "If they had thrown the book at Richard in [...] when he cut Bill Ezinicki and Vic Lynn, it might have stopped him and made him an even greater hockey player because of it." [...] Interest was high in the hockey world; the Detroit Free Press reported its switchboard was swamped with calls.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too <b>much</b> <b>would</b> have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E
500|$|A major issue, {{going into}} the 1896 {{election}} cycle, was {{the question of the}} currency. [...] The United States, since 1873, had effectively been on the gold standard—the metal, if presented to the government, would be assayed and struck into coin for a slight charge to cover expenses. [...] Silver, on the other hand, though widely mined, could not be presented for conversion into coin, but had to be sold as a commodity. [...] The gold standard was unpopular in many agricultural and mining areas, as the quantity of gold available limited the money supply, making it difficult for farmers to obtain loans and pay debts. [...] Advocates of the free and unlimited coinage of silver believed that doing so would cure the country's economic malaise by increasing the money supply. [...] Advocates of the gold standard argued that a [...] "free silver" [...] policy (sometimes called [...] "bimetallism") would inflate the currency, and lead to difficulties in international trade with nations on the gold standard. [...] At the time, the precious metal in a silver dollar was worth about $0.53, and under such proposals, silver worth that <b>much</b> <b>would</b> be returned to depositors as a one-dollar coin, [...] "free"—that is, without a charge for the Mint's costs for assaying and coining.|$|E
500|$|Gateshead Council {{subsequently}} considered {{other sites}} {{for a second}} park, but it was discouraged by the high prices being asked by the estate owners at Redheugh and Shipcote. The Shipcote estate was owned by Sir Walter James, who was approached by a council park committee in 1874 and asked how <b>much</b> <b>would</b> be required to purchase {{at least part of}} his estate. Whilst negotiations were ongoing, James' offer to sell part of his estate at £650 per acre was met by fierce criticism from members of the public and the council began to seek an alternative to the Shipcote proposal. The town clerk wrote to William Wailes to ask if {{he would be willing to}} sell his [...] Saltwellside estate. On 11November1874, Wailes replied that the council could have his entire estate for £32,000, and in March 1875 James told the park committee that he did not wish to compete with Wailes but that he would offer a subscription if the council went ahead at Saltwellgate. Later that month the park committee formally opened talks with Wailes and, after various proposals were considered and rejected, in September 1875 the council decided to buy the entire Saltwellgate estate for an increased total price of £35,000 after securing a loan for the full amount from the Local Government Board. The agreement was formalised two months later and included a provision to lease Saltwell Towers back to Wailes for the remainder of his life.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} rituals and beliefs {{associated}} with basil.

In Portugal, dwarf bush basil is traditionally presented in a pot, together with a poem and a paper carnation, to a sweetheart, on the religious holidays of Saint John and Saint Anthony.
