40|$|R. Lee Lyman has {{challenged}} our assertion that prehistoric hunting of marine mammals {{along the west}} coast of North America approximated a prehistoric tragedy of the commons in which highly ranked migratory sea lions and fur seals were reduced by overexploitation, necessitating pursuit of smaller, more elusive harbor seals and sea otters late in time. In response, we review alternative theoretical perspectives, rebut Lyman 2 ̆ 7 s characterization of marine mammal reproductive behaviors, reanalyze seal and sea lion NISP data from the California and Oregon coasts, and reinterpret three regional prehistories. Because migratory pinnipeds need to breed on land, are vulnerable to terrestrial predation when congregated in breeding colonies, and employ migration corridors thousands of kilometers in length, they were susceptible to overexploitation. In areas where rookeries persisted on remote islands and offshore rocks, sophisticated weaponry and watercraft were developed to facilitate pursuit of dwindling populations and more elusive taxa as part of intensive, socially complex <b>maritime</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R
25|$|Throughout the war, American privateers {{devastated the}} <b>maritime</b> <b>economy</b> by raiding {{many of the}} coastal communities. There were {{constant}} attacks by American and French privateers, such as the Raid on Lunenburg (1782), numerous raids on Liverpool, Nova Scotia (October 1776, March 1777, September 1777, May 1778, September 1780) and a raid on Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia (1781). Privateers also raided Canso in 1775, returning in 1779 to destroy the fisheries. To guard against such attacks, the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants) was garrisoned at forts around Atlantic Canada. Fort Edward (Nova Scotia) in Windsor became the headquarters to prevent a possible American land assault on Halifax from the Bay of Fundy. There was an American attack on Nova Scotia by land, the Battle of Fort Cumberland followed by the Siege of Saint John (1777).|$|E
25|$|Montreal and Toronto {{were well}} suited {{to benefit from the}} {{development}} of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in Quebec and Ontario, these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very different. Today New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding Halifax, but a contracting population in industrial Cape Breton, and several smaller centres in Bridgewater, Kentville, Yarmouth, and Pictou County. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and Summerside. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no population concentration in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent <b>Maritime</b> <b>economy</b> continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.|$|E
2500|$|The Port Jew {{describes}} Jews {{who were}} involved in the seafaring and <b>maritime</b> <b>economy</b> of Europe, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they could be considered to have been [...] "the earliest modern Jews". According to Fry, Port Jews often arrived as [...] "refugees from the Inquisition" [...] and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia. They were allowed to settle in port cities as merchants granted permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg. Fry notes that their connections with the Jewish Diaspora and their expertise in maritime trade made them of particular interest to the mercantilist governments of Europe. Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were [...] "valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived". Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a [...] "reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and 'enlightened' Jewish identities".|$|E

2500|$|While the {{economic}} underperformance of the <b>Maritime</b> <b>economy</b> has been long lasting, {{it has not}} always been present. The mid-19th century, especially the 1850s and 1860s, has long been seen as a [...] "Golden Age" [...] in the Maritimes. Growth was strong, and the region had one of British North America's most extensive manufacturing sectors as well as a large international shipping industry. The question of why the Maritimes fell from being a centre of Canadian manufacturing to being an economic hinterland is thus a central one {{to the study of the}} region's pecuniary difficulties. The period in which the decline occurred had a great many potential culprits. In 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick merged with the Canadas in Confederation, with Prince Edward Island joining them six years later in 1873. Canada was formed only a year after free trade with the United States (in the form of the Reciprocity Agreement) had ended. In the 1870s John A. Macdonald's National Policy was implemented, creating a system of protective tariffs around the new nation. Throughout the period there was also significant technological change both in the production and transportation of goods.|$|E
2500|$|The American Revolution (1775–1783) had a {{significant}} impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia—"the 14th American Colony" [...] as some called it—displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776) and at the Siege of Saint John (1777). Throughout the war, American privateers devastated the <b>maritime</b> <b>economy</b> by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping. [...] British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the Naval battle off Halifax (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the Naval battle off Cape Breton (1781).|$|E

50|$|Coincident {{with the}} {{construction}} of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster steel steam ships. The Maritimes had long been a centre for shipbuilding, and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like New York and Montreal. Even the Cunard Line, founded by Maritime-born Samuel Cunard, stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.More controversial than the role of technology is the argument over the role of politics in the origins of the region's decline.

25|$|Given {{the small}} {{population}} of the region (compared with the Central Canadian provinces or the New England states), the regional economy is a net exporter of natural resources, manufactured goods, and services. The regional economy has long been tied to natural resources such as fishing, logging, farming, and mining activities. Significant industrialization {{in the second half}} of the 19th century brought steel to Trenton, Nova Scotia, and subsequent creation of a widespread industrial base to take advantage of the region's large underground coal deposits. After Confederation, however, this industrial base withered with technological change, and trading links to Europe and the U.S. were reduced in favour of those with Ontario and Quebec. In recent years, however, the <b>Maritime</b> regional <b>economy</b> has begun increased contributions from manufacturing again and the steady transition to a service economy.|$|R

Though these archaeological features increasingly figure in broad constructions of past coastal hunter-gatherer economies, few have been analysed in any detail. This paper describes the excavation and analysis of three Anadara-dominated shell mounds situated in adjacent microenvironments at Hope Inlet, Shoal Bay near Darwin on the Northern Territory coast. These stratified deposits, formed over some 15 centuries between about 2000 and 500 years B. P., provide a relatively finegrained record of subsistence and settlement strategies of hunter-gatherer peoples during this Late Holocene period.

What is largely ignored is that these APS provide services to firms operating in a range of different sectors.

This paper investigates these theoretical questions by empirically focusing on those advanced producer services related to the port and maritime sector. The empirical results show that the location of AMPS is correlated with <b>maritime</b> localisation <b>economies,</b> expressed in the presence of shipowners and port-related industry as well as APS in general, but not by throughput flows of ports.
