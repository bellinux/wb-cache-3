When he performed with Kiyoshi Mizutani in 1988 at the Jazz-on-Amur festival in Khabarovsk, the Far East of USSR, his improvised, experimental electroacoustic set was praised by fellow musicians {{as well as}} the festival's producer. The number of the - jazz-oriented (and - even just curious) - crowd, however, had been expecting a more traditional (and much-much more quiet) performance, and started walking out. Prior to his second performance at the festival — which was to be made to an even more conservative audience— Akita was asked to play [...] "more musically." [...] On that first stage, Merzbow used the finest example of [...] "classical analogue live noisemaiking technologies" [...] to display: untuned guitar, a drumset, various <b>micro-objects,</b> small springs centered in its shell baffles, large aluminium boxes with strings inside to be attacked with a fiddlestick, etc. along with multi- piezo-pickuping and close-miking techniques, live processing through vintage US fuzz, ring modulator etc. boxes, and quite vivid and spontaneous approach, backed by domestically supplied slide and light shows. These live recordings were post-processed/re-mixed and released as Live in Khabarovsk, CCCP (I'm Proud by Rank of the Workers) LP – and as the (once more re-mixed comparing to the LP) CD 26 of the Merzbox later on.|$|E

The <b>micro-object</b> was transported along various trajectories (Fig.  7 e) and at various speeds up to approximately 90  μm/s (Additional file 4 : Video S 3). A graph of the planned trajectory and completed trajectory during the <b>micro-object</b> manipulation is included in Additional file 1 : Figure S 5.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a holographic microscope for the inspection of the 3 -dimensional structure of opaque objects. It {{is based on the}} phase-shifting digital holography. Digital holography has several characteristics such as free focusing, flexible magnification, and variable viewing angle that can not be shared by other methods. Phase-shifting technique is employed to contour the surface of an opaque <b>micro-object</b> quantitatively. A Michelson-type interferometer is configured {{as a part of the}} microscope in such a way that high numerical aperture and compactness can be obtained.

Due to equal intensities of the interfering waves, the holographic phase-contrast method allows obtaining maximal contrast of images. The sizes of the <b>micro-object</b> do not restrict {{the application of the}} method, though F. Zernike phase contrast method works the more successfully, the smaller the <b>micro-object</b> in thick and sizes. The image in the holographic phase-contrast method is the result of interaction of two identical waves, and it is free of aberrations.|$|R

They help avoid any infection and damage that can occur due to external contact. In this context, a smart micro-conveyor is devised. It is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based system that employs a smart surface for conveyance along with an OmniVision complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) HD camera for <b>micro-object</b> position detection and tracking. A specific FPGA-based hardware design and VHSIC (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit) Hardware Description Language (VHDL) implementation are realized.

In this way, an automated closed-loop system is employed to convey the <b>micro-object</b> towards a desired location. The devised system architecture and implementation principle is described.

40|$|Understanding {{the rolling}} {{behavior}} of a <b>micro-object</b> is essential to establish the techniques of micro-manipulation and micro-assembly by mechanical means. Using a combined theoretical/computational approach, we studied the critical conditions of rolling resistance of an elastic cylindrical <b>micro-object</b> in adhesional contact with a rigid surface. Closed-form dimensionless expressions for the critical rolling moment, the initial rolling contact area, and the initial rolling angle were extracted after a systematic parametric study using finite element method (FEM) simulations. The total energy of this system {{is defined as the}} sum of three terms: the elastic energy stored in the deformed micro-cylinder, the interfacial energy within the contact area, and the mechanical potential energy that depends on the external moment applied to the cylindrical <b>micro-object.</b> A careful examination of the energy balance of the system surprisingly revealed that the rolling resistance per unit cylindrical length can be simply expressed by “work of adhesion times cylindrical radius” independent of the Young’s modulus. In addition, extending a linear elastic fracture mechanics based approach in the literature, we obtained the exact closed-form asymptotic solutions for the critical conditions for initial rolling; these asymptotic solutions were found in excellent agreement with the full-field FEM results.

30|$|A hybrid {{closed-loop}} vision-assisted {{control system}} {{was developed in}} MATLAB and LabVIEW to control multiple OFB microrobots automatically. The control system was used to demonstrate open-loop actuation of a single microrobot and simultaneous actuation of multiple microrobots along with closed-loop position updates. A grasp-planning algorithm was also developed in MATLAB and utilized to calculate the precise locations for grasping a <b>micro-object</b> using a team of four microrobots. The position of each microrobot and the <b>micro-object</b> under manipulation was detected by the closed-loop feedback module to minimize the error between the physical location calculated by the image-processing algorithm and the intended destination. This closed-loop actuation allows automatic and simultaneous actuation of multiple microrobots for micromanipulation with precise positioning, beyond the capacity of a human operator. However, this hybrid control scheme requires certain human operators to switch between the applications (MATLAB and LabVIEW). In the future, this system can be upgraded to use image processing based on the seamless integration of LabVIEW and MATLAB, allowing minimum user interaction.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{qualitative}} approach to study the dynamics and stability of micro-machined inductive contactless suspensions (MIS). In the framework of this approach, the induced eddy current into a levitated <b>micro-object</b> is considered {{as a collection of}} m-eddy current circuits.

The linear model allows us to investigate the general stability properties of the MIS as a dynamic system, and these properties are synthesized in three major theorems. In particular, we prove that the stable levitation in the MIS without damping is impossible. Based on the approach presented herewith, we give general guidelines for MIS designing. In addition to we demonstrate the successful application of this technique to study the dynamics and stability of the symmetric and axially symmetric MIS designs both based on 3 D micro-coil technology.

40|$|Abstract — The {{development}} of new hybrid microsystems needs new technologies which are able to perform assembly of small <b>micro-objects.</b> Now, the current micromanipulation technologies are still unreliable for <b>micro-objects</b> which typical size is down to hundred micrometers. Consequently, the study and the {{development of}} innovative artificial micro-object manipulation strategies in these dimensions are particularly relevant. As presented in the literature, micromanipulations are perturbed by the adhesion and surface forces which depend on surrounding mediums. We propose to perform micro-assembly tasks in liquid medium, because adhesion and surface forces applied on submerged microobjects are less important than in air. An overview of the microforces in air and in liquid is presented in this paper. This paper focuses on the architecture of a submerged assembly cell including the definition of stocks, conveyance systems and workstations. Defining the architecture of the submerged assembly cell is indeed a keypoint of the cell design. The stocks and workstations could be for example place in a large unique liquid medium or in a collection of droplets. Transfers of <b>micro-objects</b> in the submerged assembly cell may be obtained by: (i) moving the <b>micro-objects</b> in an unique liquid medium; (ii) moving the <b>micro-objects</b> through the air from one to another liquid medium; (iii) transfert of <b>micro-objects</b> by movement of the liquid bowl.

Cellular {{microbiology}} {{requires a}} tool that can efficiently transport biological <b>micro-objects,</b> including single cells, cell clusters, microbeads and microscale hydrogels (microgels) laden with cells or chemicals. The transportation of these <b>micro-objects</b> is useful in many areas such as single-cell research {{and the construction of}} in vitro artificial tissue. In this dissertation, opto-thermocapillary flow-addressed bubbles (OFB) are evaluated for transporting biological <b>micro-objects.</b> Control over the OFB was accomplished by developing an engineered free-space optical addressing system. The OFB provides a new micro-transportation tool for cellular microbiology. It complements other cell-manipulation technologies such as optical tweezers and dielectrophoresis (DEP), as it is less dependent upon the optical and electrical properties of the working environment, enabling functionality in cell culture media. OFB also distinguishes itself by the capability for on-demand creation of micro-transporters, eliminating the need for microfabricated micro-transporters that need to be introduced into the working space. Further, the straightforward actuation mechanism of OFB enables parallel and cooperative micro-transportation using commercial beam-forming devices.
