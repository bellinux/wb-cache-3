Its path is largely {{followed by the}} modern Queen Elizabeth II walk, though the former road was slightly to the south. This walk links the conservation park's visitor centre to the fort gates; {{some of the old}} road can still be seen close to the gates. What was the muster ground is partly taken up by the caravan and camping park and a car park. It was levelled and filled in the 1950s for this use. What remains of this ground, north of the caravan park, was returned to its 1880s profile in 1993 funded by a Federal Government grant. In the 19th century, the muster ground was used for training of the Volunteer Military Force including artillery, who camped on the site. As designed the fort's rear was protected with a wooden palisade or stockade. In 1881 a <b>masonry</b> <b>wall</b> was added, greatly strengthening defence. Most of the stockade was reconstructed in the 1970s; some of the original wooden structure is visible in the fort's north.|$|E

25|$|The building's {{lower level}} has been {{historically}} used for commercial purposes. As a corner lot, {{the first floor}} L-elevation has one square-shaped volume facing west towards Paseo Atocha, while the other two commercial spaces occupy the longitudinal axis that runs east-to-west along Castillo Street. The commercial spaces are of different sizes. In all three sections, the original floors were replaced with native tiles, product of an early 20th century intervention. The 12-foot high ceiling in the square-shaped section is covered with pressed tin panels, a decorative addition very frequently used during the 1920s among the upper class' residences and social/civic buildings in different cities in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the 17-foot high ceiling {{in the other two}} commercial areas have kept the original exposed ausubo (manilkara bidentata tree) beams, sustaining the pichipen rafters, which support three layers of thin bricks that make-up the foundation for the upper level floor. Throughout the entire first floor's interior, the stucco has been removed, leaving the brick walls completely exposed. Each commercial section has its own service room. The 110 feet 5 inches long longitudinal elevation that faces Castillo Street has a very public exposure with four large clear glass windows and an equal number of clear-glass-metal-framed doors. The axis that faces Paseo Atocha has an additional glass door and two large glass windows. All three spaces at the first floor have access to a narrow backyard limited by a seven-foot high brick and <b>masonry</b> <b>wall,</b> which runs east-to-west, and separates the commercial space, physically and visually, from a large open garden-like interior patio only accessible to the upper-level residents. The Castillo Street axis has, on its eastern end, an arched wooden gate, that provide access to the cochera (carport), which by the time Casa Vives was built in the 1860s, served to properly house the family's horse stagecoach, and later, during the early twentieth century, housed the Ford's model T's and Model A's.|$|E

500|$|Yoram Tsafrir has {{attempted}} to place the Acra underneath the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount enclosure. Tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosure's eastern <b>masonry</b> <b>wall</b> as evidence of different periods of construction. North of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large ashlar blocks. These blocks have faces with drafted margins around a prominent boss and are laid in homogeneous header and stretcher courses, one above the other. This style of construction is Hellenistic and distinct from the Herodian construction apparent south of the seam. Although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain, Tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the Acra's foundations which were later incorporated into Herod the Great's extension of the Temple platform. As further proof, Tzafrir also points to significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam, {{including the use of}} trapezoid-shaped stones, with the methods employed in the Seleucid city of Perga in Asia Minor. 1 Macabees 1:30 attributes construction of the Acra to Apollonius, AntiochusIII's [...] "chief collector" [...] ( [...] , Sar Hamissim), which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief ( [...] , Sar) of the Mysians, a people of Asia Minor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Masonry</b> <b>walls</b> are {{commonly}} used {{in a range of}} different climates and there has emerged over the years a consensus amongst building practitioners that, if correctly installed and adequately maintained, <b>masonry</b> <b>walls</b> clearly achieve adequate long-term performance. Two key features of <b>masonry</b> <b>walls</b> contribute in providing acceptable performance by mitigating the effects of wind-driven rain: the evident capacity of the exterior masonry to absorb and store rainfall; an open cavity behind the exterior masonry cladding to drain infiltrated water. Recent European trends in respect to energy conservation have building practitioners considering applying spray-in-place insulation to fill the open cavity in walls. As well, there is an emerging interest in low energy wood frame construction for moderate climates such as those of North-western Europe. Such construction would incorporate brick veneer cladding with reduced space behind the cladding. Knowing the degree of water infiltration of brick <b>masonry</b> <b>walls</b> might help provide a useful estimate of moisture loads behind the cladding and hence improve HAM-simulations of these new concepts.

The dam was built {{at a cost of}} about $515,000 (roughly $12,335,000 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars) on the upstream brink of the falls (to create the deepest reservoir possible). Construction bids were opened on February 5, 1890, with the request for bids specifying that all work must be finished by December 1, 1890. All the bids were rejected, and mechanical engineer Maurice Parker was employed to design and construct the dam. Coffer dams were constructed in April 1890 to divert the river from the work areas.

2500|$|The {{camp was}} {{formally}} established prior to 22 June 1941, documented by {{a letter of}} that date from Turner to Aćimović. Responsibility for establishing the camp fell to Turner's deputy, SS-Sturmbannführer Georg Kiessel, {{who was responsible for}} overseeing Jovanović. In addition to his role as the administrator of Belgrade, Jovanović was also the chief of Serbian State Security for Aćimović's puppet regime. A three man committee was created to determine the site for the camp. The committee consisted of Jovanović's deputy city administrator, Miodrag Đorđević, the chief engineer of Belgrade, Milan Janjušević, and an unnamed representative of the Gestapo. The committee chose the former barracks of the Royal Yugoslav Army's 18th Infantry Regiment, located in the Belgrade suburb of Banjica. Once the site was identified, the buildings had to be prepared for receiving a large number of prisoners, and secured against escape. Jovanović had overall responsibility for this work, with Janjušević managing the work at the camp. The former chief of the anti-communist section of the interwar Belgrade General Police, Svetozar Vujković, was appointed as the administrator (...) of the camp, and he, his staff, and his German supervisors took over the camp on 5 July. The camp admitted its first inmates on 9 July, while building works were still ongoing. The first prisoners were held in one large basement room. For the first two months of its operation, the camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence. As this was considered inadequate to prevent escape, Jovanović ordered Janjušević to build a <b>masonry</b> <b>wall</b> around the camp. In early September, construction commenced on the wall and a guardhouse. The wall was completed within a month, and was [...] high, enclosing the camp {{in the form of a}} pentagon, with towers set at each corner in which machine guns and searchlights were mounted. The camp was divided into sections, with one part for Gestapo prisoners, another for those arrested by the SP UGB, and a third area which held a mixed group of prisoners when either or both of the other two sections were at capacity. After the war, while he was being interrogated, Jovanović explained that this division had come about when [...] "the Gestapo arrived one day without warning and decreed that one-third of the camp would belong to the Serbian authorities, and the rest they took for their prisoners".|$|E

Numerical results revealed that boundary conditions play a central role on the lateral behavior of <b>masonry</b> <b>walls</b> under in-plane loading and determine the influence of level of pre-compression as well as the reinforcement ratio on the wall strength. The lateral capacity of walls decreases with the increase of aspect ratio and with the decrease of pre-compression. Vertical steel bars appear to have almost no influence in the shear strength of <b>masonry</b> <b>walls</b> and horizontal reinforcement only increases the lateral strength of <b>masonry</b> <b>walls</b> if the shear response of the walls is determinant for failure, which {{is directly related to the}} boundary conditions.
