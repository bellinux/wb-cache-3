5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> of the violin string.|$|E

The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Feynman acceded {{to a request}} to [...] "spruce up" [...] the {{teaching}} of undergraduates at Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that eventually became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. He wanted {{a picture of a}} drumhead sprinkled with powder to show the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> {{at the beginning of the}} book. Concerned over the connections to drugs and rock and roll that could be made from the image, the publishers changed the cover to plain red, though they included a picture of him playing drums in the foreword. The Feynman Lectures on Physics occupied two physicists, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, as part-time co-authors for several years. Even though the books were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics. Many of his lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including The Character of Physical Law, , Statistical Mechanics, Lectures on Gravitation, and the Feynman Lectures on Computation.|$|E

2500|$|Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health uses a {{model for}} {{understanding}} health and disease that is fundamentally {{different from that of}} modern medicine. According to MVAH researcher Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence whereas he feels modern medicine views the body as a machine. He says that the world view of MVAH is closer to the reality described by 20th century physics, which challenged the reductionist materialist world view by finding that quantum mechanical phenomena contradict the idea of solid matter, that causality is less definite, that material existence is connected in unexpected and nonlocal ways, and that a reductionist view is untenable at the quantum level. Sharma says that [...] "Vedic thought discusses a unified field of pure, non-material intelligence and consciousness whose <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> manifest as the material universe." [...] Disease results from losing connection with this underlying field of intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|Material {{is ground}} away from {{underside}} of the bars in an arch shape to lower the pitch. [...] This allows the lower-pitched bars to be a manageable length. It is also {{the key to the}} [...] "mellow" [...] sound of the vibraphone (and marimba, which uses the same deep arch) compared with the xylophone, which uses a shallower arch, and the glockenspiel, which has no arch at all. [...] Vibrating rectangular bars have three primary <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> The deep arch causes these modes to align and create a consonant arrangement of intervals: a fundamental pitch, a pitch two octaves above that, and a third pitch an octave and a major third above the second. [...] For the F3 bar that usually forms the lowest note on a vibraphone, there would be F3 as the fundamental, F5 as the first overtone and A6 as the second overtone. As a side effect, the arch causes the nodal points of the fundamental vibration to shift closer towards the ends of the bar.|$|E
