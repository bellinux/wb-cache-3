A <b>major</b> <b>item</b> on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E

25|$|Copepods, {{the primary}} zooplankton, are a <b>major</b> <b>item</b> on the forage fish menu. They are {{a group of}} small {{crustaceans}} found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04in) to two millimetres (0.08in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimeters. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their mouth wide open and their opercula fully expanded.|$|E

25|$|In November 1982 David Hill Chief Executive of the State Rail Authority enquired {{about the}} {{suitability}} of restoring 3801. Hill had the 1988 Bicentenary of British settlement in Australia in mind, and saw a restored 3801 {{as a representative of}} Australia's railways. The boiler was the <b>major</b> <b>item</b> needing repair and an investigation needed to be carried out to ascertain if restoration was viable. A visit was made to the South Maitland Railways (who at the time still used steam engines) to learn about modern boiler techniques. It was discovered that many advances had been made and it was possible to return boilers to service which previously would have been scrapped. The next step was to examine the boilers of the other preserved 38 class members - 3820 and 3830 (though 3813 had survived, it was completely stripped and in two different locations) - and compare them with 3801's boiler. It was decided to use the boiler already in 3801, however the inner firebox had suffered thermal fractures and would need extensive repairs. Restoration was deemed possible and a fund-raising appeal began.|$|E

500|$|A {{church has}} {{stood on the}} site of the present {{structure}} for centuries. There is a tradition that the first church was founded in 915 by Ethelfleda when she built a castle nearby.

Runcorn is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, but there is evidence that Nigel, the first baron of Halton (died 1080), conferred the church with a priest [...] "in the days of the Conqueror". A medieval church was subsequently built on the site, during the 19th-century demolition of which Norman capitals were found in the masonry of its tower. Judging by its Early English style of architecture, the local historian H.F.Starkey estimates that the medieval church was probably built in about 1250. [...] The chancel was rebuilt in the 14thcentury with Decorated tracery in the east window. [...] During the same century an embattled tower was built at the west end of the church, and this was either rebuilt or increased in size in the following century. [...] A <b>major</b> <b>item</b> of the church furniture was a pre-Reformation rood screen. [...] It was destroyed when the church was rebuilt in the 19thcentury, although a few fragments were used in the construction of the present choir stalls.
