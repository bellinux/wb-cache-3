A significant source of impulsive underwater noise is marine piling where a pile is driven into the sea-bed using a hydraulic hammer. Such a technique is typically used to position piles in relatively shallow water for construction of offshore windfarms, bridge supports, and offshore structures associated with the off and gas industry. To mitigate the effects of the noise generated, the piling sequence is often begun with a gradually increasing energy level, this procedure being termed a "soft start"...|$|E
40|$|In a {{world of}} {{constant}} technological development and expansion into the marine environment, the marine soundscape is constantly changing. With the addition of anthropogenic sources from naval sonar to seismic survey vessels over the past century, the deficiency of knowledge {{on the impact of}} such acoustic disturbance leaves little guidance for effective regulation of anthropogenic <b>marine</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution.</b> To help address this, the U. S. Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) has teamed with multiple academic and scientific institutions to research and catalog the baseline behavioral ecology across a range of odontocete species, which can then serve as a baseline for additional research. This report examines a portion of that project, conducted to assess the response of Risso’s dolphin, Grampus griseus, to natural stimuli. During an August 2013 playback study off Southern California, acoustic data were collected via digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) to identify the vocal response of three Risso’s dolphins, Grampus griseus. The playbacks consisted of calls from three cetacean species: Megaptera novaeangliae, Orcinus orca, and Grampus griseus. To determine whether the vocal rate measurements could be reliably quantified, a repeatability experiment was conducted. Two playback studies (O. orca and G. griseus) were conducted on one animal, while three playbacks (O. orca, G. griseus, and M. novaeangliae) were presented to two animals. Only one of the tagged animals demonstrated a noteworthy response to the O. orca exposure, with more than a 500 % increase in vocalizations after the playback. Vocal rate did not vary considerably in the tag with O. orca and G. griseus playbacks and the other tag resulted in roughly zero vocalizations during pre- and post-playbacks. Based on the small sample size, it appears that G. griseus response varies {{in the presence of a}} predator – with one tag demonstrating a dramatic increase of vocal rate when exposed to O. orca calls. These results are a necessary early step in gathering baseline information on the behavioral ecology of cetaceans susceptible to anthropogenic acoustic impact. A continuation of this project and further research is necessary to fully understand how marine mammals perceive and are impacted by human expansion into the marine soundscape...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{anthropogenic}} noise {{has become}} recognised {{as a major}} pollutant worldwide {{and the study of}} its impacts has increased due to the potential for adverse consequences on wildlife. For marine environments, where sound is transmitted very efficiently through water, underwater noise has increased, mainly, at low and medium frequencies. Of all marine organisms, cetaceans may be the most affected, as they depend primarily on sound to communicate, navigate and find food. Accordingly, the general aims of this thesis are to identify the types of anthropogenic noise facing New Zealand’s cetaceans, the potential impacts, review current legislation, and to propose improvements to enhance current mitigation measures of impacts. My systematic review showed that 90 % of the information about impacts of noise pollution on cetacean comes from peer-review journals and, although available from 1975, studies of <b>marine</b> <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> substantially increased after 1997. In addition, I identified the limited information on this topic in important areas such as Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, as well as regions in the Arctic and Southern Ocean. I also found that most effort has been focused on the impact of vessels, and bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise are, by far, the most studied species, showing a disparity in research coverage of both sources of noise and species. For New Zealand, there is a striking lack of knowledge of the range of sources of noise on cetaceans (excluding vessels). The information I compiled on New Zealand’s cetacean distributions showed that three main groups are well represented: baleen whales, delphinids and beaked whales. Nonetheless, the information available for these species varies greatly. While there are some species very well studied, for others New Zealand species, the available information is scarce, {{as in the case of}} beaked whale. Current mitigation measures can only be effective if comprehensive data are used to inform them. For example, planning surveys at different spatiotemporal scales are crucial to increase the effectiveness of mitigation measures. In particular, spatial modelling techniques can support mitigation measures by helping managers to identify areas of conflicts between marine mammal conservation and the development of activities such as dredging, drilling and seismic surveys. I used opportunistic sighting data collected from different platforms, and several environmental variables biologically important for cetaceans and/or their prey, to create maps of habitat suitability for seven species of cetaceans in New Zealand. These maps were created using maximun entropy modelling (MaxEnt), a model system that does not require absence data and performs well with small sample size. Models validations were done using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. The models for all seven species had excellent discriminatory power (AUC > 0. 9). The environmental variables depth and sediment had the most explanatory power for the distribution of these species. Comparisons of the areas of current and designated areas for exploration activities with the marine mammal distributions generated using MaxEnt show significant and wide-ranging conflicts. Of particular concern is the designated area for exploration in the northern part of the North Island, this area overlaps with the distribution of the highly endangered Maui’s dolphin, and will add new pressures on this already diminished population. Expanding noise related research in this region (as elsewhere) will help stakeholders to support future decisions for planning when human activities enter into conflict with cetaceans. Finally, the development of effective laws that adequately regulate the anthropogenic noise impacts on marine mammals has been a task that has taken many years to advance. To assess the effectiveness of New Zealand’s legislation to mitigate impacts from seismic surveys and whale-watching activities, I described and compared methods prescribed by international associations. Strengths of The Code of New Zealand are that it presents a set of comprehensive guidelines with specific mention of biologically important aspects such as mother/calve pair priority. Nonetheless, improvements could be made regarding the enforcement of these guidelines. In addition, I suggest that New Zealand’s whale-watching guidelines, could be improved through the inclusion and implementation of an Impact Assessment, the creation of separate guidelines to protect specific species and/or areas and, as with seismic activities, ongoing enforcement of guidelines...|$|E

Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology is being studied. In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation. Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic {{sound is}} {{created in the}} ocean both purposefully and unintentionally. The result is <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> that is high-intensity and acute, as well as lower-level and chronic. The {{locations}} of <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> are along well-traveled paths in the sea and particularly encompass coastal and continental shelf waters. Increased use of the sea for commercial shipping, geophysical exploration, and advanced warfare {{has resulted in a}} higher level of <b>noise</b> <b>pollution</b> over the past few decades. Informed estimates suggest that noise levels are at least 10 times higher today than they were a few decades ago. A long-term monitoring program is needed to track future changes in ocean noise. Acoustic data should be included in global ocean observing systems now being planned by U. S. and international research foundations. Data from these monitoring systems should be openly available, and accessible to decision makers in industry, in the military, and in regulatory agencies. In tandem, a database should be developed to collect, organize and standardize data on ocean noise measurements and related anthropogenic activities. Currently, data regarding shipping, seismic exploration, oil and gas production, and other marine activities are either not collected or are difficult to obtain and analyze because they are maintained by separate organizations. <b>Marine</b> <b>noise</b> measurements and anthropogenic source data should be used to develop a global model of ocean noise. An important component of model development is better understanding of the characteristics for anthropogenic noise sources such as commercial shipping, arigun arrays, and military sonar.
