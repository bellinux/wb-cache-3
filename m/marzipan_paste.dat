50|$|Medieval aristocrats also {{desired to}} {{entertain}} and impress through food. Banquets were usually huge feasts with diverse choices of dishes. Social etiquette dictated that {{the wealthy and}} powerful be given beautiful and elaborate dishes while the poor be given simple food, usually scraps. Such banquets not only entertained guests, but also showed {{the wealth of the}} host. In particular, the patron sometimes commissioned artists to create complicated sculptures made from food items to awe and inspire. A popular sculpture was a pregnant woman modeled in <b>marzipan</b> or sugar <b>paste.</b> Other favorites were pies or cakes designed to expel live birds when cut open and multicolored jellies stacked together, dyed with spices and vegetable matter. Furthermore, since these foods often were not preserved properly and were somewhat rotted when stored, the mask of decaying food was covered with spices and other aromas. This indicates the medieval hosts concern with presentation as opposed to flavor.|$|R
