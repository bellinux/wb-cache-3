5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 <b>megawatt</b> photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 <b>megawatt</b> Mount Majura solar farm was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction is under way on a 13 <b>megawatt</b> solar farm at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 <b>megawatt</b> solar farm at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale solar farm was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 <b>megawatt</b> Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available {{for the establishment of a}} facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550MW {{power plant}} in Riverside County, California, that uses {{thin-film}} CdTe-modules made by First Solar. As of November 2014, the 550 <b>megawatt</b> Topaz Solar Farm was the largest photovoltaic {{power plant in}} the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW Solar Star complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Gonghe County, Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|The {{commercial}} energy supplier for {{electricity and gas}} is at the consumer's choice. Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure {{is the presence of}} a 2 <b>megawatt</b> (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, wired to the local sub-grid. It has the potential to produce 3.5million units of electricity a year, enough to power over a thousand homes.|$|E
5000|$|... {{about six}} {{operational}} mini-hydropower plants {{are connected to}} the national electricity grid, supplying about 65 <b>megawatts.</b> These include Nyagak I (3.5 <b>megawatts),</b> Kabalega (9 <b>megawatts),</b> Kanungu (6.6 <b>megawatts),</b> Bugoye (13 <b>megawatts),</b> Mubuku I (5 <b>megawatts),</b> Mubuku III (10 <b>megawatts),</b> and Mpanga (18 <b>megawatts).</b>|$|R
50|$|Five sugar {{manufacturers}} in Uganda have total cogeneration capacity of about 110 <b>megawatts,</b> of which about 50 percent {{is available for}} sale to the national grid. The cogeneration power plants and their generation capacities include Kakira Power Station (52 <b>megawatts),</b> Kinyara Power Station (40 <b>megawatts),</b> Lugazi Power Station (14 <b>megawatts),</b> Kaliro Power Station (12 <b>megawatts)</b> and Mayuge Thermal Power Station (1.6 <b>megawatts).</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2014, it was {{reported}} that the scope of the project had been increased to 44.7 <b>megawatts</b> from the original 26 <b>megawatts.</b> Two interconnected dams, Muzizi A (26 <b>megawatts)</b> and Muzizi B (18.7 <b>megawatts),</b> are now proposed.|$|R
5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a <b>megawatt</b> production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one <b>megawatt</b> of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 <b>megawatt</b> converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} phase of the project the Qattara 1 station was to {{generate}} 670 <b>megawatts.</b> The second phase was to generate an additional 1200 <b>megawatts.</b> A pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility would increase the peak production capacity with another 4000 <b>megawatts,</b> totaling about 6800 <b>megawatts.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 19 July 2010, the Irish Wind Energy Association {{reported}} an installed capacity of 1746 <b>megawatts,</b> enough to power 753,000 households. 2012 capacity {{is more than}} four times the total of 495.2 <b>megawatts</b> in 2005. In 2008 alone, the rate of growth was 54.6%, amongst the highest in the world. Average 2013 output to 21 September is 486 <b>Megawatts</b> and Median 2013 Output is 393 <b>Megawatts.</b> Output can be as low as 3 <b>Megawatts</b> on a still day such as 12 July 2013 when a low of 3 <b>Megawatts</b> was reached at 9:30 am which is 0.012% of the Rated Installed Capacity of over 2,200 <b>Megawatts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Olkaria III Power Station {{first started}} {{operation}} in 2000, running one Ormat ORC power plant with a generation capacity of 13MW. In January 2009 new infrastructure was installed, adding another 35 <b>megawatts</b> to the plant's capacity. Later 36 <b>Megawatts</b> production capacity was installed. The third generation unit at Olkaria III, with capacity of 26 <b>Megawatts</b> was commissioned in 2014, bringing total capacity {{at the plant}} to 110 <b>Megawatts.</b> The fourth generation unit, with capacity of 29 <b>Megawatts</b> was commissioned in 2016, bringing total capacity at the plant to 139 <b>Megawatts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Other {{characters}} include various schoolmates {{and staff}} members. Weenus (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a nerdy, psychopathic robot who is even {{lower on the}} social pyramid than the protagonists. Dreadnot (Dana Snyder) is a teacher at Harry S. Apocalypse who finds joy in torturing and invoking pain into his students. Their principal, Thunderbite (also voiced by Snyder), is an oversized, skull-shaped robot who, when not causing pain, acts sweet and motherly to the students. <b>Megawatt</b> (also voiced by Sinterniklaas) is a spoiled rich kid who is attractive to the female robots, most of whom he blows up; to Thrasher's disdain, he is dating Maimy. Tacklebot (Roger Craig Smith), Megawatt's friend and musclehead jock, acts violent and hostile toward the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Photovoltaic power {{stations}} occupy {{at least one}} hectare for each <b>megawatt</b> of rated output, so require a substantial land area; which is subject to planning approval. The chances of obtaining consent, and the related time, cost and conditions, varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and location to location. Many planning approvals will also apply conditions on {{the treatment of the}} site after the station has been decommissioned in the future. A professional health, safety and environment assessment is usually undertaken during the design of a PV power station in order to ensure the facility is designed and planned in accordance with all HSE regulations.|$|E
5|$|The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 <b>megawatt</b> (MW) solar {{photovoltaic}} {{power plant in}} Boulder City, Nevada. Sempra Generation began construction of the plant in January 2010 and the facility began generating electricity on December 1, 2010. At its construction peak more than 350 workers were installing the 775,000 First Solar panels on the 380 acre site. The power from Copper Mountain Solar Facility (and the adjacent 10 MW El Dorado Solar Power Plant) is being sold to Pacific Gas & Electric under separate 20-year contracts. Californian utilities were required to obtain 20 percent of their energy supply from renewable energy sources {{by the end of}} 2010, increasing to 33 percent by 2020.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Iran {{generated}} 45 <b>megawatts</b> {{of electricity}} from wind power (ranked 30th in the world). This was a 40% increase over 32 <b>megawatts</b> in 2005. Total wind generation in 2004 was 25 <b>megawatts</b> out of 33,000 <b>megawatts</b> total electrical generation capacity for the country. In 2008, Iran's wind {{power plants in}} Manjil (in Gilan province) and Binaloud (in Razavi Khorasan province) produce 128 <b>megawatts</b> of electricity. By 2009, Iran had wind power capacity of 130 MW.|$|R
25|$|After a {{pause in}} the 1990s, Hydro-Québec {{restarted}} its construction activities {{in the early years}} of the 21st century. Recent projects include the Sainte-Marguerite-3 (SM-3) station in 2004 (884 megawatts); Toulnustouc in 2005 (526 megawatts); Eastmain-1 in 2007 (480 megawatts); Peribonka (385 <b>megawatts)</b> and Mercier in 2008 (50.5 <b>megawatts),</b> Rapides-des-Cœurs (76 <b>megawatts)</b> and Chute-Allard (62 <b>megawatts)</b> in 2009.|$|R
50|$|In August 2012, Ugandan {{print media}} {{reported}} that the power station {{was in the process}} of upgrading the plant's capacity to 80 <b>megawatts,</b> at an estimated cost of US$60 million. The upgrade was expected to be complete by September 2012. The actual upgrade, however, was to 70 <b>megawatts.</b> The upgrade was completed in October 2012 and the plant's maximum rated capacity is 70 <b>megawatts</b> (16.4 <b>megawatts</b> from the old plant running Niigata engines and a further 53 <b>megawatts</b> from the new plant with Sulzer engines). Upon commissioning of the plant, Electro-Maxx became the first indigenous independent power producer in Africa for power plants with capacity greater than 20 <b>megawatts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and <b>megawatt</b> scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{state is}} a leader in {{renewable}} energy commercialization; it produces the most wind power in the nation. In 2014, 10.6% of the electricity consumed in Texas came from wind turbines. The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe, Texas, is one of the world's largest wind farms with a 781.5 <b>megawatt</b> (MW) capacity. The Energy Information Administration states that the state's large agriculture and forestry industries could give Texas an enormous amount biomass for use in biofuels. The state also has the highest solar power potential for development in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 <b>megawatt</b> (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5000|$|By 2007 IPC was {{involved}} with 2,500 <b>megawatts</b> of gas-fired development projects, 400 <b>megawatts</b> of coal-fired {{combined heat and power}} projects, and 150 <b>megawatts</b> of ‘combined cycle’ upgrade projects and managing a gas-powered plant on behalf of BP in Latin America.|$|R
50|$|In July 2011, {{media reports}} {{indicated}} that the maximum capacity of the project had been scaled back to 600 <b>megawatts</b> from 750 <b>megawatts.</b> Some international development partners wanted to scale back even further, to a maximum capacity of 400 to 450 <b>megawatts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{company expects}} to produce 20 <b>megawatts</b> {{of the films}} at the plant in 2008 before ramping up to 40 <b>megawatts</b> of {{capacity}} in 2009 and 140 <b>megawatts</b> by 2010. This makes Global Solar the largest full-scale manufacturer of CIGS thin-film photovoltaics.|$|R
5|$|The A Station {{generated}} electricity {{using three}} turbo alternators; two 69 <b>megawatt</b> (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243MW. At {{the time of}} its commissioning, the 105MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78MW and associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving these units a total rating of 100MW. The third unit consisted of a 66MW machine associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving the unit a rating of 72MW. Combined, these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260MW, making the site's generating capacity 503MW. All of the station's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox, fuelled by pulverised coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Metro has won {{awards for}} {{environmentally}} friendly practices from organisations including the United Nations, RINA, and the International Organization for Standardization, becoming the second metro in the world, after the New York City Subway, to be ISO 14001 certified for environmentally friendly construction. Most of the Metro stations on the Blue Line conduct rainwater harvesting {{as an environmental}} protection measure. It is also the first railway project {{in the world to}} earn carbon credits after being registered with the United Nations under the Clean Development Mechanism, and has so far earned 400,000 carbon credits by saving energy through the use of regenerative braking systems on its trains. To reduce its dependence on non-renewable sources of energy, DMRC is looking forward to harness solar energy and install solar panels at the Karkardooma, Noida Sector-21, Anand Vihar and Pragati Maidan Metro stations and DMRC's residential complex at Pushp Vihar. As of March 2017, the DMRC has commissioned 20 MWp (<b>megawatt</b> peak) of solar power plants across 21 locations on the metro network.
