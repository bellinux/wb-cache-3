50|$|TTL inputs are the {{emitters}} of a <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistor.</b> This IC {{structure is}} functionally equivalent to multiple transistors where the bases and collectors are tied together. The output is buffered {{by a common}} emitter amplifier.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistor</b> is a {{specialized}} bipolar transistor mostly {{used at the}} inputs of TTL NAND logic gates. Input signals are applied to the emitters. Collector current stops flowing only if all emitters are driven by the logical low voltage, thus performing a NAND logical operation using a single transistor. Multiple-emitter transistors replace diodes of DTL and allow reduction of switching time and power dissipation.|$|E
50|$|The NAND gate has the {{property}} of functional completeness. That is, any other logic function (AND, OR, etc.) can be implemented using only NAND gates. An entire processor can be created using NAND gates alone. In TTL ICs using <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistors,</b> it also requires fewer transistors than a NOR gate.|$|R
50|$|An input logical zero. Note {{that the}} base-collector {{junction}} of the <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistor</b> and the base-emitter junction of the output transistor are in series between {{the bottom of}} the resistor and ground. If one input voltage becomes zero, the corresponding base-emitter junction of the <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistor</b> is in parallel with these two junctions. A phenomenon called current steering means that when two voltage-stable elements with different threshold voltages are connected in parallel, the current flows through the path with the smaller threshold voltage. That is, current flows out of this input and into the zero (low) voltage source. As a result, no current flows through the base of the output transistor, causing it to stop conducting and the output voltage becomes high (logical one). During the transition the input transistor is briefly in its active region; so it draws a large current away {{from the base of the}} output transistor and thus quickly discharges its base. This is a critical advantage of TTL over DTL that speeds up the transition over a diode input structure.|$|E
50|$|Inputs both logical ones. When all the inputs {{are held}} at high voltage, the base-emitter {{junctions}} of the <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistor</b> are reverse-biased. Unlike DTL, a small “collector” current (approximately 10µA) is drawn {{by each of}} the inputs. This is because the transistor is in reverse-active mode. An approximately constant current flows from the positive rail, through the resistor and into {{the base of the}} multiple emitter transistor. This current passes through the base-emitter junction of the output transistor, allowing it to conduct and pulling the output voltage low (logical zero).|$|E
5000|$|The Computron {{design was}} an early attempt to produce not only a vacuum tube {{integrated}} circuit for both size and reliability (lifetime) issues, but to minimize external electrical connections between active elements. The goal of integration is not merely to reduce external signal connections {{into and out of}} a package by including multiple active devices in one package, as in the Loewe 3NF tube. It is to merge the functions of the active devices for a technical synergy. A modern example would be the <b>multiple-emitter</b> <b>transistor</b> of Transistor-transistor logic integrated circuits ...|$|E
