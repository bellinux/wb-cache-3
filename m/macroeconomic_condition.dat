It also seeks to explore the underlying other micro determinants of infant mortality applying survival analysis. The result indicates that <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>condition</b> has insignificant impact on child health in Ethiopia. Rather the micro level variables {{are found to be}} the most important determinants. Behavioral factors, maternal, environmental and socioeconomic factors play crucial role. Paternal education, access to safe drinking water, information access, and other utilities like electricity have positive impact on child survival. It has also been found that there is regional variation in mortality rate. The risk of dying is high in rural areas compared to urban areas indicating that modern health facilities are urban-biased...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of modern market economy, {{in order to}} safeguard the comprehensive competitiveness, enterprises adjust their capital structure based on the external and internal environment. In the selection of enterprises’ financing policies, especially the debt decisions, the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>condition</b> {{will be an important}} factor (Korajczyk and Leny). Studies suggest that <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>condition</b> has great impact on the pace and scale of the capital structure adjustment and the companies’ liabilities (Dirk Hackbarth ect. 2006; Douglas O, Cook and Tian Tang, 2009). The capital structure determines structures of long-term debts and equity capital. The analysis on debt structure and benefits and risks of enterprises is of great importance to maximize the value of enterprises. On the basis of introducing the development of the capital structure theory, this article investigate an important issue in the area of financial economics by analyzing the main factors affecting capital structure and focusing on system environment which has not been fully studied. This article employed empirical method to analyze data of private enterprises in different areas during 2007 - 2009 which had been listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange markets. The conclusion is that changes of the following five factors, government intervention degree, non-state-owned economic structure, market structure, financial structure of commercialization combine with legal system, have great impacts on the capital structure and the development of private enterprises...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} transparency in a benevolent monetary authority's policies. Each firm's payoff depends on unobservable <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> and firms may incur a cost to acquire private information about <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions.</b> The policy authority attempts to infer the underlying <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> from a noisy measure of aggregate actions and makes a public announcement to inform firms of this inference. High-quality announcements provide firms the incentive not to gather private information and base actions solely on information contained in policy announcements. However, this makes the observed actions of firms less informative to the policy authority. ...|$|R

Using survey data on the activities of Australian inventors who attempted to commercialise 3, 736 inventions over the period 1986 – 2005, we find evidence that <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> have a pro-cyclical effect on commercialisation activi-ties. Such a finding has important policy implications since it suggests that recessions have both short-term effects (on employment, income) and long-term effects (on productivity). However, the magnitude of the supply-side effects—the cost of finance and level of public sector research—are estimated to be larger than the growth in aggregate or industry demand...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> on the labour market outcomes of immigrants. It simultaneously identifies both the effects of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> {{at the time of}} entry into the labour market and {{at the time of the}} survey was taken, while allowing for cohort effects. Also, for the first time in the literature, the impacts on labour force participation along with employment outcomes are explored. The study uses 19 annual cross-sections of the Survey of Consumer Finances, covering the period from 1979 to 1997. The results suggest that the deterioration in the assimilation of recent immigrants is partly due to the adverse economic conditions they face in the year they enter the labour market and the subsequent years following. <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> at the time of labour market entry have adverse impacts on both labour force participation (LFP) and employment. With the inclusion of controls for <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions,</b> the significance and magnitude of the assimilation-measuring co-efficient increases. Therefore, not only are the estimated cohort effects sensitive to the inclusion of controls for business cycles, but so too are the assimilation profiles.

40|$|By {{examining}} the Fund's views about macroeconomic stability, {{the effectiveness of}} IMF-supported stabilization programs, and Turkey's macroeconomic policies, this paper demonstrates that both the IMF and Turkey share {{the responsibility for the}} outcome of stabilization programs. The main conclusion of the paper is that the primary targets of stabilization programs are not implemented during the program years. Even though program years are associated with improvements in balance of payments and reserves, such improvements disappear during the post-program years. The fact that Turkey has received subsequent programs from the IMF despite the overall lack of implementation of the Fund's conditionality may be consistent with the existence of moral hazard. In fact, the results suggest that, on average, Turkey enters the next program in worse <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>condition</b> than the previous program.

We estimate flexible duration models where the individual’s mortality rate depends on current conditions, conditions earlier in life (notably during childhood), calendar time, age, individual characteristics, including individual socio-economic indicators, and interaction terms. We use individual data records from Dutch registers of birth, marriage, and death certificates, covering an observation window of unprecedented size (1812 - 1999). These are merged with historical data on macroeconomic and health indicators. The results indicate a strong effect of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>conditions</b> during childhood on mortality at all ages.
