Few persuasions beyond his <b>mere</b> <b>license</b> would have been necessary to determine their retreat from the Court of France, upon the first hint {{that they might not}} be eventually protected against the Duke of Burgundy; but it was not so easy to induce them to choose Liege for the place of their retreat. They entreated and requested to be transferred to Bretagne or Calais, where, under protection of the Duke of Bretagne or King of England, they might remain in a state of safety, until the sovereign of Burgundy should relent in his rigorous purpose towards them. But neither of these places of safety at all suited the plans of Louis, and he was at last successful in inducing them to adopt that which did coincide with them.|$|E

A license is a mere authority; passes no estate or interest whatever; may be made by parol; is revocable at will; and, when revoked, the protection which it gave ceases to exist.|$|E

5000|$|Permitting encroachments {{and public}} and private non-University use of University {{property}} was intolerable because by allowing casual use {{public and private}} easements could accrue.

In 1885, the Regents resolved [...] "That this Board declares its intention to keep the University grounds intact for the sole use of the University, and that no public avenues or streets be permitted through the grounds" [...] and declared that [...] "the privilege of using any of the University grounds is a <b>mere</b> <b>license,</b> revocable {{at the pleasure of}} the Board of Regents." [...] When the University entered into an agreement with the City of Berkeley in 1894 to grant the City permission to use the University's Allston Way sewer, the [...] "mere license" [...] was [...] "revocable at any time at the will and the pleasure of the Regents of the University of California" [...] that will never [...] "ripen into any right to or interest in or easement in or to said Allston Way, or the sewer therein."

40|$|That a <b>mere</b> <b>license</b> {{purporting}} to create in the licensee a new right or privilege is revocable at {{law at the}} will of the licensor seems to have been definitely settled in England by Wood v. Leadbitter, 13 M. 2 ̆ 6 W. 838 (1845). It was there held that the plaintiff who had entered the close of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s master after the purchase of a proper ticket could be forcibly ousted, notice having been first given that he should leave. The only remedy open to the ousted ticket holder-in law at least-no excessive violence 1 having been used, is to sue for breach of the contract. The rule of Wood v. Leadbitter has been almost uniformly followed by the American courts. Homey v. Nixon, 213 Pa. St. 20, 110 Am. St. Rep. 520, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1184; Meisner v. Ferry Co., 154 Mich. 545; W. W. V. Co. v. Black, 113 Va. 728, 75 S. E. 82; Shubert v. Nixon Co., 83 N. J. L. 101, 83 Atl. 369; Taylor v. Cohn, 47 Ore. 538; Collister v. Hayman, 183 N. Y. 250; People v. Flynn, 189 N. Y. 180;, Buengle v. Amnus. Assoc., 29 R. I. 23, 14 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1242; Marrone v. Jockey Club, 227 U. S. 633. The tickets in Wood v. Leadbitter and the cases referred to above were mere licenses uncoupled with any interest whatever and did not serve to create in the purchasers any interest in land because not under seal, or {{because of the nature of}} the privilege conferred, or both. In equity the licensee 2 ̆ 7 s rights perhaps may be more secure, depending, it would seem, upon the nature of the privilege and the circumstances. Some licenses for instance, could in equity be specifically enforced by requiring the execution of a proper deed, as in Duke of Devonshire v. Eglin, 14 Beav. 530, or what in general effect would be the same thing, their revocation could be enjoined. But would equity specifically enforce all licenses or enjoin their revocation...|$|E
40|$|Virtual worlds, {{including}} massive multi-player on-line role-playing games (game worlds), such as City of Heroes, Everquest, and World of Warcraft, {{have become}} popular sources of entertainment. Game worlds provide scripted contexts for {{events such as}} quests. Other virtual worlds, such as Second Life, are unstructured virtual environments that lack specific goals but allow participants to socialize and engage virtually in such activities as shopping or attending a concert. Many of these worlds have become commodified, with {{millions of dollars of}} real-world trade in virtual items taking place every year. Most game worlds prohibit these real market transactions, but some worlds actually encourage it. Second Life, for example, grants participants intellectual property rights in their creations. Although it seems intuitively the case that someone who accepts real money for the transfer of a virtual item should be taxed, what about the player who only accumulates items or virtual currency within a virtual world? Is valuable 2 ̆ 2 loot 2 ̆ 2 acquired in a game taxable, as a prize or award is? And is the profit in a purely in-game trade or sale for virtual currency taxable? This is an important set of questions, given the tax revenues at stake. Although the Internal Revenue Service has not yet attempted to tax transactions within virtual worlds, it is aware of the issue, and there is pressure on the government to determine how to resolve it, given that the economies of some virtual worlds are comparable to those of small countries. The Joint Economic Committee has announced that it is studying the issue. Most people 2 ̆ 7 s intuition probably would be that accumulation of assets within a 2 ̆ 2 game 2 ̆ 2 should not be taxed even though the federal income tax applies even to non-cash accessions to wealth. This Article argues that federal income tax law and policy support that result. Loot 2 ̆ 2 drops 2 ̆ 2 in game worlds should not be treated as taxable prizes and awards, but rather should be treated like other property that requires effort to obtain, such as fish pulled from the ocean, which is taxed only upon sale. Moreover, in-game trades of virtual items should not be treated as taxable barter. If courts uphold game agreements that purport to provide players with a <b>mere</b> <b>license</b> to use the game, in-game trades do not constitute realization events and thus are not taxable. therwise, tax policy considerations suggest that Congress should provide nonrecognition for these exchanges. By contrast, in virtual worlds that are intentionally commodified, such as Second Life, tax doctrine and policy counsel taxation of even in-world sales for virtual currency, regardless of whether the participant cashes out. However, as in game worlds, participants should not be taxed on purely in-world trades of non-currency items. This approach would allow entertainment value to go untaxed without creating a new tax shelter for virtual commerce...|$|E
40|$|The Amazon Kindle is revolutionizing {{the way we}} buy {{and read}} books. But {{according}} to Amazon, Kindle books are not sold at all. Rather, they are licensed under surprisingly aggressive terms. This may surprise Kindle users. Amazon 2 ̆ 7 s promotional materials paint a very different picture of Kindle e-book transactions than its Terms of Service, which are buried online and purport to bind users automatically by a 2 ̆ 2 browsewrap 2 ̆ 2 agreement-meaning users are bound by its terms simply by visiting Amazon 2 ̆ 7 s Web site. It {{is not clear whether}} courts will uphold Amazon 2 ̆ 7 s characterization of Kindle e-book transactions as <b>mere</b> <b>licenses,</b> or instead reclassify them as sales. If the transaction is deemed a sale, Kindle e-books would trigger the protection of the copyright 2 ̆ 7 first sale 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, allowing e-book owners to lend, trade, and resell them. This Article surveys the legal landscape surrounding digital content transactions, including copyright law, case law, and the Uniform Commercial Code, and argues that Kindle e-book transactions should be characterized as sales. This Article also presents possible ways to make sales of e-books viable, using Digital Rights Management to enforce single-copy ownership. Books are important and lasting cultural contributions, a fundamental vehicle of free thought. While licensing may make sense for software or other short-lived digital content, courts should protect our ownership interest in books-which brings with it the right to share, sell, and pass on-whether digitally displayed or otherwise...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} {{in the area of}} open source software (“OSS”) as an alternative economic model. However, the success of the OSS mindshare and collaborative online experience has wider implications to many other fields of human endeavor than the <b>mere</b> <b>licensing</b> of computer programmes. There are a growing number of institutions interested in using OSS licensing schemes to distribute creative works and scientific research, and even to publish online journals through open access (“OA”) licenses. There appears to be growing concern in the scientific community about the trend to fence and protect scientific research through intellectual property, particularly by the abuse of patent applications for biotechnology research. The OSS experience represents a successful model which demonstrates that IP licenses could eventually be used to protect against the misuse and misappropriation of basic scientific research. This would be done by translating existing OSS licenses to protect scientific research. Some efforts are already paying dividends in areas such as scientific publishing, evidenced by the growing number of OA journals. However, the process of translating software licenses to areas other than publishing has been more difficult. OSS and OA licenses work best with works subject to copyright protection because copyright subsists in an original work as soon as it is created. However, it has been more difficult to generate a license that covers patented works because patents are only awarded through a lengthy application and registration process. If the open science experiment is to work, it needs the intervention of the legal community to draft new licenses that may apply to scientific research. This article will look at the issue of such OA licenses, paying special care as to how the system can best be exported to scientific research based on OSS and OA ideals...|$|R

40|$|Free software” is an {{increasingly}} used form to license computer programs, which {{on the one}} hand gives users the rights to use, modify and redistribute the program; and, on the other, forces any person redistributing an original or modified version of the program to license it with the same rights. Such a forced obligation is introduced through the so called “copyleft clause” and, basically, uses Copyright in a creative way to achieve freedom instead of control. This paper discusses the “free software” foundations and contractual issues. The discussion is structured in two main parts and Conclusion. In Part II, the emergence of “free software” and its implications in different fields will be exposed. I will seek to explain how the “copyleft clause” affects the ways in which software is developed and distributed. Moreover, I will explain the common points and differences between “free software” and “open source software”. In Part III, the contractual issues raised by the peculiarity of the “copyleft clause” will be addressed. I will argue that the license agreement which contains the “copyleft clause” is not a <b>mere</b> copyright non-contractual <b>license,</b> but a contract. This fact triggers a number of contract related questions, which I will seek to resolve from the U. S. perspective. In particular, I will address the concerns about lack of consideration; validity of clickwrap and shrinkwrap licenses; possible consequences of lack of privity between licensor and licensee; the enforceability of the warranty disclaimer included in most copyleft licenses; and the relation between Copyright and contractual provisions. Finally, the paper will end summarizing the main conclusions drawn in the two main parts mentioned above...|$|R
