5|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} phase was the sixth, which saw {{the restoration of}} the eastern and western external walls after they were severely damaged by Mongol besiegers. A northeastern salient bastion, <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> eastern and western bastions, was also built. Masonry from the fifth phase was reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum, limestone and other materials. The seventh and eighth phases both consisted of heightening al-Rahba's western external walls.|$|E
5|$|The second mode of {{speciation}} is peripatric speciation, {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become isolated {{in a new}} environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> parental population. Here, the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotherium was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and {{its body}} mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E

5|$|In early 1941 the 6th Division and ICorps {{headquarters}} {{took part}} in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion. The corps' commander, Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey, and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky, but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat. The Allied force deployed to Greece was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E

Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rest and did not {{make contact with the}} ground.|$|E

5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E
5|$|E. c. griseigularis {{is found}} in southwestern New Guinea and Cape York, and was {{described}} in 1909 by Dutch naturalist Eduard van Oort. It is <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other subspecies. The original name for this subspecies was harteri, but the type specimen, collected in Cooktown, {{was found to be}} an intergrade form. The new type was collected from Merauke. This subspecies intergrades with cyanotis {{at the base of the}} Cape York Peninsula, and the zone of intermediate forms is narrow. The white wing patch is larger than that of cyanotis and smaller than that of albipennis. Only one bird (from Cape York) of this subspecies was sampled in a molecular study, and it was shown to be genetically close to cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|Early fossil {{remains were}} fragmentary, {{which led to}} much {{speculation}} on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed {{with the discovery of}} the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is <b>much</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

In 1647, Saint Agatha's Tower was built in Mellieħa. This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint, and {{was built in the}} style of the Wignacourt towers. Two more towers were built at Dwejra and Xlendi on Gozo in 1650 and 1652. The ten towers built between 1637 and 1652 are collectively known as the Lascaris towers after the Grand Master who built them, and nine of them survive to this day.|$|E
