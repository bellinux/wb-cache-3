5|$|Stefani {{first came}} {{face to face}} with {{designing}} clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{we know about}} Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano {{or some combination of}} courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{around her and}} had an estimated vocabulary {{of at least a}} few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E

500|$|Ryan {{said that}} he was [...] "proud" [...] of the {{agreement}} because [...] "it reduces the deficit – without raising taxes". Some conservative Republicans objected to his budget proposal. Republican Raul Labrador criticized the [...] "terrible plan," [...] saying that [...] "it makes promises to the American people that are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that we would never hold the line on the sequester." [...] Other conservatives were more positive: [...] "It achieves <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{we would like to see}} when we have divided government," [...] said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).|$|E
500|$|Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then {{staying at}} the Gatehouse Prison, {{although}} still not charged with any crime. [...] Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. [...] Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. [...] She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that [...] "particular persons only" [...] were allowed to visit. [...] Hall was again questioned on 7March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. [...] When asked why she had lied to the court, she said [...] "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was told {{it was not the}} truth. [...] I was terrified and threatened to be sent to Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." [...] She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{times when he}} was a teenager, he {{attended}} several drawing classes titled [...] "Center for Character Animation" [...] where he studied under famous cartoonist Brian Mitchell. Mitchell taught him <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he never got at school. He graduated from Catskill High School in 1997 and in the Art Institute of Philadelphia in 1999.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll {{confess that}} I'm not {{satisfied}} yet, but I {{try to make}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good <b>things</b> that come along--and I'm glad I got up early. It's a glorious morning!" ...|$|R

2500|$|After a {{successful}} audition {{in the spring}} of 1937, Scourby was cast in a small part in a recording of Antony and Cleopatra. During the following summer he was, again, the player king in a production of Hamlet in Dennis, Massachusetts that featured Eva Le Gallienne. When he returned to audition for the American Foundation for the Blind later in the year he was told that the company of actors was [...] "filled" [...] but that he might record a novel if he wished. [...] "That was the beginning of it," [...] he recalled years later, adding, [...] "The recordings for the blind are perhaps my greatest achievement. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I look back at in the theater were either insignificant parts in great plays or good parts in terrible plays. So it really doesn't amount to anything. Whereas I have recorded some great books. The greatest one being the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|That night, Charlie Brown {{is still}} sad {{that he has}} not {{discovered}} {{what it means to be}} a [...] "good man", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that [...] "there are teeth-marks all over it [...] [...] [...] she nibbles her pencil [...] [...] [...] she's HUMAN!" [...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back. As he reaches out, she shakes his hand firmly, then tells him, [...] "You're a good man, Charlie Brown." ...|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> Ultima series <b>of</b> {{computer}} games employed several different artificial scripts. <b>The</b> people <b>of</b> Britannia, <b>the</b> fantasy {{world where the}} games are set, speak English, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day <b>things</b> are written in Latin alphabet.

60|$|Things {{began to}} happen in Kaskaskia. It would have been strange indeed if things had not happened.

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning.
