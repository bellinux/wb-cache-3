5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is caused}} by {{inadequate}} function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism).

5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> anticipated, but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{training}} goals {{pursued in}} conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training.

5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in {{water in the}} Black Creek watershed, with sodium being considerably <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> potassium. Potassium concentrations are around 20 milligrams per liter, while sodium concentrations are less than 10 milligrams per liter. Lithium and rubidium also have been observed in the watershed, with concentrations of 0.02 to 0.2 and 0.04 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G. Bekker {{implies that}} the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{species with}} a {{restricted}} range {{are especially vulnerable}} to human activities, and eight of the 26 bird species occurring only in the Northern Maluku Endemic Bird Area are threatened, including the invisible rail. Almost {{a quarter of all}} rail species have conservation concerns, and flightless island species are particularly at risk, at least 15 species having become extinct since 1600. The estimated population of the invisible rail is 3,500–15,000 birds, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although this rail is so poorly known that it may be <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> the estimates suggest.|$|E

5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild fish in West Creek. Brook trout and brown trout both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include johnny darter, white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E
5|$|With {{the average}} {{concentration}} of about 8 {{parts per million}} (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> elements such as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8parts per trillion. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{rates of}} either HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 are between 60 and 95% in adults. HSV-1 is <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> HSV-2, with rates of both {{increasing}} as people age. HSV-1 rates are between 70% and 80% in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40% to 60% in populations of improved socioeconomic status. An estimated 536 million people or 16% {{of the population}} worldwide were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and in those in the developing world.

5|$|Yttrium {{is found}} in most rare-earth minerals, it {{is found in}} some uranium ores, but is never found in the Earth's crust as a free element. About 31ppm of the Earth's crust is yttrium, making it the 28th most {{abundant}} element, 400 times <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> silver. Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150ppm (dry weight average of 23ppm) and in sea water at 9ppt. Lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project have a relatively high content of yttrium.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were <b>more</b> <b>common</b> <b>than</b> nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
