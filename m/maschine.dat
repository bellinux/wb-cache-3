Purpose of {{this document}} is to give beginners a first feeling for the language constructs and its usage in actual modelling. Allthough the language was not developed for these small tasks in general, it is well suited to cover all kind of modelling tasks with the existing semantic. The example consist of several finite state <b>maschines</b> connected and communicating with each other.

40|$|The {{importance}} of native legumes is rising in germany. The electron seed treatment {{is a physical}} treatment of seeds. By the cultivation of crops this method is praticable. This method is an alternative option in chemical and non-chemical crop-production. This paper investigates influences of electron treatment of legumes pea (pisum sativum) and yellow lupines (lupinus luteus L.). This influences are testing by germination, seed vigour and youth development. The investigation is acomplished by two different <b>maschines</b> (WESENITZ 2 and STELLA) and repetition of electron treatment. The different variants after electron treatment are compared with a chemical treatment and non-treament variant...|$|R

In 1918 {{the company went}} to Uhingen, five miles away. First bigger assignement of large-scale body panels went to France and Belgium in 1928. 1929 Allgaier started to produce press <b>maschines</b> for car industry. 1933-1945 the company produced plane parts and windmills, but also bombs. For many years, Ulrich W. Hütter was the chief of construction. A soviet employee, Unterleutnant Stepan was hanged on 27. Oktober 1943 by the Gestapo.Georg Allgaier died 1946. His heirs kept the company running, and in this year the company brought first tractor, model R 18, on the market. In 1953 production of wind energy systems for worldwide purpose was started. In 1955 production of motors and tractors was sold to Porsche-Diesel Motorenbau GmbH verkauft. Then production of screening machines started and also process technology. In the mid 60's the company had around 3000 employees. However, business with farming machines declined. The number of employees was less than 1000.|$|R
