50|$|About {{the origins}} of {{schooling}} in Sankt Julian little is known, since all the school journals went missing {{at the end of}} the Second World War. From old property registers, however, it can be seen that already in the 17th century, the municipality owned “school land”, and therefore, there must have been a school in the village even then. Going by the village’s size, a two-class village school must have been built quite early on. The ﬁrst schoolhouse stood on the branch of the path from Bergstraße (“Mountain Street”) at Haus Steige 1, near the rectory. It might have been built as early as the 17th century, but was torn down in 1850 and replaced with a bigger building, which served as the schoolhouse until about 1900. After 1945, the teachers’ dwellings and the <b>municipal</b> <b>secretariat</b> were built. The house is now under private ownership. A new schoolhouse was built about 1900 on Hauptstraße (“Main Street”). Housed here until 1973 were always two classes and the mayor’s ofﬁce. This house (Hauptstraße 38) was later sold by the municipality. Housed there now are the savings bank and a dental practice. In 1962, a Sankt Julian school association was founded under which all schoolchildren in Sankt Julian, Obereisenbach, Eschenau, Gumbsweiler, Hachenbach and Rathsweiler were banded together. From the villages of Horschbach, Elzweiler and Welchweiler, only the Hauptschule students were grouped into the school association, and of those from Ulmet and, beginning only in 1968, Niederalben, only grade levels 7 to 9 were incorporated. In 1966, this school association acquired the big schoolhouse on the Lenschbach as its central school. Owing to the school reforms that were being put through at that time, though, and at the same time the administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate with the merger of many municipalities in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz into the Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen-Pfalz, there were also new requirements for founding school associations. Thus, ﬁrst, in 1970, the provisional Hauptschule Offenbach-Hundheim/Sankt Julian, whose seat was in Offenbach-Hundheim, was opened. There were three grade levels there at the beginning, with grade levels 5 and 6 being taught at the new schoolhouse in Sankt Julian and levels 7 to 9 at the Offenbach-Hundheim schoolhouse. This Hauptschule was attended by students from Offenbach-Hundheim and Sankt Julian and those from Buborn, Kirrweiler, Homberg, Deimberg, Glanbrücken, Hachenbach and Wiesweiler, and in the beginning also those from a few villages in the Verbandsgemeinde of Altenglan, namely the three Hermannsberg municipalities of Horschbach, Elzweiler and Welchweiler, along with Ulmet, Niederalben and Rathsweiler. The students from the Verbandsgemeinde of Altenglan were grouped into their own Hauptschule in Altenglan in 1973. The Hauptschule in Offenbach-Hundheim was merged with the one in Lauterecken in 1975. Besides the Hauptschule, there was at ﬁrst also a primary school for the schoolchildren from all Sankt Julian’s centres and Hachenbach, Niederalben and Rathsweiler besides. In 1973, a new primary school named Sankt Julian Offenbach-Hundheim was opened for the schoolchildren from Buborn, Nerzweiler, Offenbach-Hundheim, Sankt Julian and Wiesweiler. This school still stands in Sankt Julian’s main centre, and is still open.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has identified and analyzed the formats of continuing teacher's {{training in the}} municipality of Ponta Porã, MS, analyzing the school role {{in relation to the}} pedagogical practice of the teachers. We initiated a survey about the programs of teachers' continuing education offered from 2001 to 2006 in the State and <b>Municipal</b> <b>Secretariats</b> and private schools. Six public and two private schools were chosen, having as criterion, the participation of the teachers in the analyzed courses. In each school the pedagogical team and three teachers were interviewed. The interviews intended to verify how the schools, by means of the pedagogical team, had stimulated or indicated the participation of the teachers in the teachers' education courses, had verified the practical pedagogical applications related to the contents dealt with in the courses and in which ways they had followed and/or evaluated the incorporation of the courses related content in the classroom. The results showed diversified courses taught in seminars and lectures, planned by external specialists. The pedagogical team controls the teachers work and compares the contents taught with the planning. In the schools, there is no collective discussions about the practices informed by the reflections included in the courses. The motivation for participation in the courses is intrinsic to the teacher. We can observe that the school is the great absentee in the process of teacher's training. The analysis of the question points to the necessity of thinking about teacher's training courses coordinated by the school and at the school, by means of which the teachers would reinvent their daily practices, participating actively as subjects and collaborators of the continuing education, which would be articulated by the pedagogical project of the school, with the commitment of teachers, directors and coordinators...|$|R
