5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with <b>machicolation</b> at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
5|$|Fort Senneville {{is one of}} the {{outlying}} forts of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, built by the Canadiens of New France near the Sainte-Anne rapids in 1671. The property was part of a fief ceded to Dugué de Boisbriant in 1672 by the Sulpicians. A large stone windmill, which doubled as a watch tower, was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring <b>machicolation</b> and other castle-like features. The fort was burned down by Iroquois in 1691, with only the mill itself left standing.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbol of}} the town is {{reproduced}} on the coat of arms – the large black tower on the right {{as well as the}} smaller toll tower on the left bank of the Aare linked by the bridge in between. It is worth noting that the <b>machicolation</b> mentioned in the blazon is really an oriel without any specified function, while the toll tower was removed in 1836.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of <b>machicolations</b> into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although <b>machicolations</b> performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. <b>Machicolations</b> were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|R

25|$|Some of the forts are now {{in varying}} stages of dereliction, the most ruined being Les Hommeaux Florains, perched on {{outlying}} rocks, its access causeway and bridge having been swept away long ago. Houmet Herbé resembles a Crusader castle with its squat round towers. Like many of the forts, it included such apparently anachronistic features as a drawbridge and <b>machicolation,</b> which were still common in military architecture of the period.|$|E
25|$|Machicolations {{are small}} drains that {{lead from the}} inside to the walls outside. They are built into the walls and are used by the {{soldiers}} on the inside to pour molten lead or other hot liquids on soldiers trying to scale the walls. The Rohtas Fort has hundreds of them and each one is beautifully decorated with geometric patterns. The pictures is of a <b>machicolation</b> near the Langar Khana (Mess Hall).|$|E
25|$|The {{top level}} {{was used as}} servants' {{quarters}} or, during times of trouble, as accommodation for the garrison. The battlements were accessed from this floor, and nine windows gave views in all directions. An outer door at this level allowed equipment to be hauled up from ground level. On three sides, holes in the external walls would have supported a timber gallery known as a bretèche, which allowed the defenders to drop objects on attackers at the walls, while a more permanent <b>machicolation</b> over the entrance served the same purpose.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the side}} churches are {{arranged}} in perfect symmetry, the cathedral {{as a whole is}} not. The larger central church was deliberately offset to the west from the geometric center of the side churches, to accommodate its larger apse on the eastern side. As a result of this subtle calculated asymmetry, viewing from {{the north and the south}} presents a complex multi-axial shape, while the western facade, facing the Kremlin, appears properly symmetrical and monolithic. The latter perception is reinforced by the fortress-style <b>machicolation</b> and corbeled cornice of the western Church of Entry into Jerusalem, mirroring the real fortifications of the Kremlin.|$|E

50|$|The origins {{are from}} Syria and the Crusaders brought their design to Europe. <b>Machicolations</b> were a common feature in many towers in Rhodes, which were {{built by the}} Knights Hospitallers. After the Knights were given rule over Malta, machilocations also became a common feature on rural buildings, until the 18th century. Buildings with <b>machicolations</b> include Cavalier Tower, Gauci Tower, the Captain's Tower, Birkirkara Tower and Tal-Wejter Tower.|$|R
500|$|There is {{no direct}} {{communication}} between the ground floor and the Lord's Hall above, which occupies the whole first floor. This is accessed via an enclosed and gated stair from the courtyard. The hall is vaulted, and has an unusual double fireplace. The floor tiles, timber panelling, and minstrels' gallery are additions of the 1880s. It was originally thought that the connecting door to the Great Hall was also of this date, but is now accepted as being original. Side rooms on the hall level include a chamber in the round tower, with a hatch above the well, and a small chamber within the south wall which overlooks both hall and courtyard. A <b>machicolation,</b> or [...] "murder hole", below the hall's north window, allows objects to be dropped onto attackers in the passage.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a double}} gate. The outer gate is [...] wide and [...] deep. It is {{accessible}} by only one gate and also had a very fine Baoli which suggests that it was meant for the Chief and his family.This gate has a bastion and a defensive wall on each side. On the bastions cannons could be deployed. The inner and outer gates are almost mirror images of each other. The top of the gate has five battlements. All of these have loopholes as well as <b>machicolation.</b> Unlike other gates of this Qila, the inner side of the gate has five battlements.|$|E
2500|$|Victoria Building is {{constructed}} in Ruabon brick and common brick with terracotta dressings under a slate roof. [...] It is an L-shaped building in three storeys with 13bays facing Brownlow Hill and five bays in Ashton Street. [...] The southerly eight bays have alternate gables and gabled dormers. [...] The ninth bay forms the tower. [...] It has an arched entrance over {{which is an}} oriel window and, above this a three-light window. [...] Over this are the royal coat of arms, a mosaic panel with an inscription and <b>machicolation.</b> [...] The top stage has a four-face clock. [...] At each angle of the tower are buttresses which rise to form pinnacles with lead spirelets. [...] Over all is a lead spire with two tiers of lucarnes. [...] The tenth bay has staircase windows with a gable above. [...] The end bays curve round behind an octagonal tower with a spire.|$|E
50|$|<b>Machicolations</b> {{were more}} common in French castles than English, where they were usually {{restricted}} to the gateway, as in the 13th-century Conwy Castle.|$|R
25|$|The battlements and <b>machicolations</b> {{are still}} {{visible on the}} walls, with the beams of another on the top floors. This part of the tower is covered in a barrel vault, while a terrace is located on its surface, with an {{external}} staircase to access the second floor (between the floor and roof), allowing communication between both by doorway. Small caliber artillery or <b>machicolations,</b> probably, supported the balcony and wall. A coat-of-arms {{is located on the}} lintel of the door, in the old military square, with the Portuguese heraldry.|$|R
50|$|A hoard or {{hoarding}} (also {{known as}} a brattice or , from the French bretèche) was a temporary wooden shed-like construction that {{was placed on the}} exterior of the ramparts of a castle during a siege to allow the defenders to improve their field of fire along the length of a wall and, most particularly, directly downwards to the wall base. The latter function was capably taken up by the invention of <b>machicolations,</b> which were an improvement on hoardings, not least because masonry {{does not need to be}} fire-proofed. <b>Machicolations</b> are also permanent and siege-ready.|$|R
6000|$|October 13th.--We {{arranged}} to begin our journey at six. [...] . It was a chill, lowering morning, {{and the rain}} blew a little in our faces before we had gone far, but did not continue long. The country soon lost the pleasant aspect which it wears immediately about Siena, and grew very barren and dreary. Then it changed again for the better, the road leading us through a fertility of vines and olives, after which the dreary and barren hills came back again, and formed our prospect {{throughout most of the}} day. We stopped for our dejeuner a la fourchette at a little old town called San Quirico, which we entered through a ruined gateway, the town being entirely surrounded by its ancient wall. This wall is far more picturesque than that of Siena, being lofty and built of stone, with a <b>machicolation</b> of arches running quite round its top, like a cornice. It has little more than a single street, perhaps {{a quarter of a mile}} long, narrow, paved with flag-stones in the Florentine fashion, and lined with two rows of tall, rusty stone houses, without a gap between them from end to end. The cafes were numerous in relation to the size of the town, and there were two taverns,--our own, the Eagle, being doubtless the best, and having three arched entrances in its front. Of these, the middle one led to the guests' apartments, the one on the right to the barn, and that on the left to the stable, so that, as is usual in Italian inns, the whole establishment was under one roof. We were shown into a brick-paved room on the first floor, adorned with a funny fresco of Aurora on the ceiling, and with some colored prints, both religious and profane. [...] .|$|E
50|$|The {{defensive}} {{character of}} the building is witnessed by <b>machicolation</b> holes which are found on all sides. Behind these {{there used to be}} a walkway which has now been removed, but <b>machicolation</b> holes can still be seen all round the building.|$|E
50|$|Defensive towers, crenellations and a <b>machicolation</b> {{were added}} in the 15th century.|$|E
