He attended the Hyde Park Academy. Like many jazz pianists, Hancock started with a classical music education. He studied from age seven, and his talent was recognized early. Considered a child prodigy, he played the first movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537 (Coronation) at a young people's concert on February 5, 1952, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (led by CSO assistant conductor George Schick) {{at the age of}} 11.|$|E
500|$|Spiro Agnew's {{father was}} born Theofrate Anagnostopoulos in about 1877, in the Greek town of Gargalianoi. The family {{may have been}} {{involved}} in olive growing and been impoverished during a crisis in the industry in the 1890s. Anagnostopoulos emigrated to the United States in 1897 (some accounts say 1902) and settled in Schenectady, New York, where he changed his name to Theodore Agnew and opened a diner. A passionate self-educator, Agnew maintained a lifelong interest in philosophy; one family member recalled that [...] "if he wasn't reading something to improve his mind, he wouldn't read." [...] Around 1908, he moved to Baltimore, where he purchased a restaurant. Here he met William Pollard, who was the city's federal <b>meat</b> <b>inspector.</b> The two became friends; Pollard and his wife Margaret were regular customers of the restaurant. After Pollard died in April 1917, Agnew and Margaret Pollard began a courtship which led to their marriage on December 12, 1917. Spiro Agnew was born eleven months later, on November 9, 1918.|$|E

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} has {{the ultimate}} objective of declaring {{the meat and}} offal obtained from carcasses of slaughtered animals fit or unfit for human consumption. This safeguards the health of consumers by ensuring that the food coming from these establishments poses no risk to public health. Concomitantly, it contributes to animal disease surveillance. The Catalan Public Health Protection Agency (Generalitat de Catalunya) identified {{the need to provide}} its <b>meat</b> <b>inspectors</b> with a support structure to improve diagnostic capacity: the Slaughterhouse Support Network (SESC). The main goal of the SESC was to offer continuing education to <b>meat</b> <b>inspectors</b> to improve the diagnostic capacity for lesions observed in slaughterhouses. With this aim, a web-based application was designed that allowed <b>meat</b> <b>inspectors</b> to submit their inquiries, images of the lesions, and samples for laboratory analysis. This commentary reviews the cases from the first 6 years of SESC operation (2008 – 2013). The program not only provides continuing education to inspectors but also contributes to the collection of useful information on animal health and welfare. Therefore, SESC complements animal disease surveillance programs, such as those for tuberculosis, bovine cysticercosis, and porcine trichinellosis, and is a powerful tool for early detection of emerging animal diseases and zoonoses...|$|R

50|$|The market {{building}} itself {{was divided into}} sections for farmers, gardeners, slaughterers, florists, hucksters, livestock dealers, etc. These sections were subdivided into stalls, which were leased annually by the vendors.

In 1909, another newspaper report indicated that Hahn had sought medical attention for the arm issue and that he would attempt a major league comeback.

50|$|In this light, {{the flow}} control {{ordinance}} {{is just one}} more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid....The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service.

Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource - be it meat, shrimp, or milk - for the benefit of local businesses that treat it. 511 U.S. at 392 - 393.|$|R
50|$|In the opinion, Arundell {{pointed out}} that Midland made the repairs in {{question}} in order that it might continue to operate its plant.
