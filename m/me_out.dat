5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|Dig <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album Call the Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. Call the Doctor confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of Call the Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock Stars, another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that Call the Doctor only took four days to record while Dig <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea behind}} the episode came from the {{financial}} crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the producers wanted {{to set up a}} story about a bank collapse so severe it could result in an economic collapse.

About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get <b>Me</b> <b>Out</b> of Here! on ITV1.
