5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in <b>midlatitudes,</b> as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (tropopause), between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the <b>midlatitudes.</b> The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{tracking}} of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds {{blowing in the}} upper troposphere of Uranus. At the equator winds are retrograde, {{which means that they}} blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −100 to −50m/s. Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located. Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with its rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles. Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from 150 to 200m/s. Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the south pole are impossible to measure. In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 240m/s are observed near +50 degrees of latitude. These speeds sometimes lead to incorrect assertions that winds are faster in the northern hemisphere. In fact, latitude per latitude, winds are slightly slower {{in the northern part of}} Uranus, especially at the <b>midlatitudes</b> from ±20 to ±40 degrees. There is currently no agreement about whether any changes in wind speed have occurred since 1986, and nothing is known about much slower meridional winds.|$|E

2500|$|Snow {{cover is}} an {{extremely}} important storage component in the water balance, especially seasonal snowpacks in mountainous areas of the world. Though limited in extent, seasonal snowpacks in the Earth’s mountain ranges account for {{the major source of}} the runoff for stream flow and groundwater recharge over wide areas of the <b>midlatitudes.</b> For example, over 85% of the annual runoff from the Colorado River basin originates as snowmelt. Snowmelt runoff from the Earth’s mountains fills the rivers and recharges the aquifers that over a billion people depend on for their water resources. Further, over 40% of the world’s protected areas are in mountains, attesting to their value both as unique ecosystems needing protection and as recreation areas for humans. Climate warming is expected to result in major changes to the partitioning of snow and rainfall, and to the timing of snowmelt, which will have important implications for water use and management. These changes also involve potentially important decadal and longer time-scale feedbacks to the climate system through temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture and runoff to the oceans.(Walsh 1995). Freshwater fluxes from the snow cover into the marine environment may be important, as the total flux is probably of the same magnitude as desalinated ridging and rubble areas of sea ice. In addition, there is an associated pulse of precipitated pollutants which accumulate over the Arctic winter in snowfall and are released into the ocean upon ablation of the sea-ice [...]|$|E

The cases compare varying ET and <b>midlatitude</b> flow characteristics. Each case was examined to determine the impacts of {{eddy kinetic energy}} generation and/or transfer on downstream development in the <b>midlatitude</b> circulation. Typhoon Tokage (October 2004) was a large TC that moved into a high-amplitude <b>midlatitude</b> circulation. Energetics analysis revealed that the ET of Tokage influenced {{the development of a}} deep trough over the central North Pacific before Tokage moved poleward and weakened transfer. Typhoon Banyan (July 2005) was a mid-summer case that influenced downstream development ultimately over the Aleutian Islands. Typhoon Guchol (August 2005) was a small TC that was dominated by <b>midlatitude</b> flow. However, the merger of Guchol with a <b>midlatitude</b> trough enabled development downstream of a separate trough.

The model is well suited to the question due to its ability to reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation, and its simplicity as it requires only four forcing components plus the zonal mean state from reanalysis.

40|$|Whether the {{tropical}} cyclone remnants {{will become a}} significant extratropical cyclone during the rein-tensification stage of extratropical transition is a complex problem because of the uncertainty in {{the tropical}} cyclone, the <b>midlatitude</b> circulation, the subtropical anticyclone, and the nonlinear interactions among these systems. In a previous study, the authors simulated {{the impact of the}} strength of the <b>midlatitude</b> circulation trough without changing its phasing with the tropical cyclone. In this study, the impact of phasing is simulated by fixing the initial position and amplitude of the <b>midlatitude</b> trough and varying the initial position of the tropical cyclone. The peak intensity of the extratropical cyclone following the extratropical transition is strongly dependent on the phasing, which leads to different degrees of interaction with the <b>midlatitude</b> baroclinic zone. Many aspects of the simulated circulation, temperature, and precipitation fields appear quite realistic for the reintensifying and dissipating cases. Threshold values of various parameters in quadrants near and far from the tropical cyclone are extracted that discriminate well between reintensifiers and dissipators. The selection and distribution of threshold parameters are consistent with the Petterssen type-B conceptual model for extratropical cyclone development.

The origin of substorm time can also be determined from <b>midlatitude</b> perturbations and is usually taken as the beginning of the positive bay near midnight. Use of these techniques has led to a phenomenological model of magnetospheric substorms that includes a growth phase.
