5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> was recorded.|$|E

5|$|After moving ashore, Sandy {{continued}} {{moving to}} the west, weakening below hurricane force {{by the time it}} reached Pennsylvania. Because the system was non-tropical, the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) – known at the time as the Hydrometeorogical Prediction Center (HPC) – took over the responsibility of issuing advisories on the low. The remnants of Sandy brought heavy snow and high winds to the central Appalachian Mountains, resulting in blizzard warnings being issued. The system continued to weaken as it moved across western Pennsylvania, and by 0300UTC on October31, the storm's movement had shifted to the northwest. Blizzard conditions continued in the Appalachians, bringing <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> to the region that had already seen high amounts the day before. By 0900UTC on October31, the circulation degenerated into a trough of low pressure, with no discernible center of low pressure. Later that day, the remnants of Sandy spread into the Great Lakes, and the WPC issued its last advisory. By the time the system had moved out of the region, nearly three feet of snow had fallen in some areas of West Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, with lesser amounts elsewhere in the region. During the next two days, Sandy's remnants drifted northward and then northeastward over Ontario, before merging with another low pressure area over Eastern Canada, on November 2.|$|E

25|$|Snowfall is {{variable}} {{from year}} to year, but the area gets much <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> on average than {{other parts of the}} country. Heavy falls are associated with northeasterly winds off the North Sea. Roads over the high moors are notoriously prone to drifting snow due to the exposed nature of the terrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate system}} is {{characterized}} by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect {{the state of the}} atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the ice-albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo), which in turn absorbs heat and causes <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> to melt.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} before Morgestraich 2006, about 50cm of snow fell within {{only a couple of}} hours and blocked the inner city of Basel.

25|$|Flooding {{can cover}} {{much of the}} Lower Mainland. Cloverdale, Barnston Island, low-lying areas of Maple Ridge, areas west of Hope, White Rock, Richmond, parts of Vancouver, and parts of Surrey are {{potentially}} at risk. In 2007, the Lower Mainland was largely spared, although northern regions of the province, along the Skeena and Nechako Rivers, experienced floods. Climate scientists predict that increasing temperatures will mean wetter winters and <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> at the high elevations. This will {{increase the likelihood of}} snowmelt floods.|$|E
25|$|An {{avalanche}} (also {{called a}} snowslide) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical {{failure in the}} snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain <b>more</b> <b>snow.</b> If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which {{is a type of}} gravity current.|$|E
25|$|The snowpack on slopes with sunny {{exposures}} {{is strongly}} influenced by sunshine. Diurnal cycles of thawing and refreezing can stabilize the snowpack by promoting settlement. Strong freeze-thaw cycles result {{in the formation of}} surface crusts during the night and of unstable surface snow during the day. Slopes in the lee of a ridge or of another wind obstacle accumulate <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> {{and are more likely to}} include pockets of deep snow, wind slabs, and cornices, all of which, when disturbed, may result in avalanche formation. Conversely, the snowpack on a windward slope is often much shallower than on a lee slope.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, a tug {{ground unit}} {{properly}} equipped with snow chains {{was used to}} push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not {{to return to the}} gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight's departure would be even further delayed. <b>More</b> <b>snow</b> and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact when they decided to make the takeoff. Heavy snow was falling during their takeoff roll at 3:59p.m. EST.|$|E
25|$|During snowfalls when {{temperatures}} hover {{close to}} freezing, northern {{parts of the}} city, such as around Derry Road away from warmer Lake Ontario usually get <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> that sticks to the ground because of the lower temperatures. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. The city usually experiences 6 months of snow free weather however there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May. The Port Credit and Lakeview areas have a micro-climate more affected by {{the proximity of the}} open lake, warming winter temperatures as a result but it can be sharply cooler on spring and summer afternoons, this can also be the case in Clarkson, but with much less consistency.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is <b>more</b> <b>snow</b> then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E
