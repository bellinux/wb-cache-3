We theoretically investigated the peculiar absorbing/emitting behaviour of pre-fractal Cantor multilayers, in order to design a polarization-insensitive multilayer stack absorbing over a wide angular lobe in the <b>mid</b> wavelength <b>infrared</b> range (8 - 10 μm).

40|$|Aiming at {{quantitative}} {{investigations of}} molecular combustion products released from high temperature events (HTE) such as forest fires, volcano eruptions, etc., HTE infrared emission spectra and multi-spectral images are measured from which combustion gas parameters like concentrations and temperatures {{are determined by}} solution of the inverse radiative transfer problem. The measurement approach permits air-borne or space-borne remote sensing. Airborne instrumentation includes a Fourier transform spectrometer providing high measurement rates and ruggedness by a rotary scan arrangement covering the <b>mid</b> and thermal <b>infrared</b> bands. The optically co-aligned camera system incorporates the visible/near <b>infrared,</b> <b>mid,</b> and thermal <b>infrared</b> bands. In order to extract high accuracy combustion gas concentrations and temperatures from the measured data the analysis procedures have {{to be applied to}} optimal spectral regions denoted micro windows. These are determined by simulations employing radiative transfer models and retrieval procedures along with appropriate molecular spectroscopic data bases such as HITRAN and HITEMP. Simulations and results are presented for the analysis of CO 2 and CO from a flaming forest fire (1000 K) scene.

50|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{is based}} on molecular overtone and combination vibrations. Such transitions are forbidden by the selection rules of quantum mechanics. As a result, the molar absorptivity in the near-IR region is typically quite small. One advantage is that NIR can typically penetrate much farther into a sample than <b>mid</b> <b>infrared</b> radiation. Near-infrared spectroscopy is, therefore, not a particularly sensitive technique, {{but it can be}} very useful in probing bulk material with little or no sample preparation.|$|E

The filters passed light of frequencies 12,810 nm (mapped to red in the image), 11,850 nm (mapped to green), and 8,590 nm (mapped to blue). The star is about 500,000 times the luminosity of the Sun. The photograph pictured {{is one of the}} best ever taken of a yellow hypergiant. The star is eventually expected to end its life in a supernova.|$|E
50|$|Coronagraphs {{in outer}} space are much more {{effective}} than the same instruments would be if located on the ground. This is because the complete absence of atmospheric scattering eliminates the largest source of glare present in a terrestrial coronagraph. Several space missions such as NASA-ESA's SOHO, and NASA's SPARTAN, Solar Maximum Mission, and Skylab have used coronagraphs to study the outer reaches of the solar corona. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is able to perform coronagraphy using the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), and there are plans to have this capability on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) using its Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and <b>Mid</b> <b>Infrared</b> Instrument (MIRI).|$|E

Its average absolute temperature prediction accuracy for an independent data set is 0. 8 K for long-wave infrared imagery and 1. 0 K for <b>mid</b> -wave <b>infrared</b> imagery, when error-free data are assumed. The benefit of robust, resistant regression estimators was studied using Monte Carlo simulations having real -world measurement errors and data outliers.

The signals are converted to radio frequencies through heterodyne circuits and then combined electronically using techniques copied from radio astronomy. The longest, 70-meter baseline provides a resolution of 0.003 arcsec at a wavelength of 11 micrometers.

5000|$|To make {{observations}} {{in the near}} and <b>mid</b> <b>infrared</b> spectrum, the JWST must be kept very cold (under 50 K), otherwise infrared radiation from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments.

40|$|An {{asymmetrical}} H-shaped resonator (ASH) {{has been}} designed using gold on a fused silica substrate. The aim is to obtain a high - quality factor at the reflectance resonance peaks in the <b>mid</b> - <b>infrared</b> wavelength of 2 μm to 8 μm. The structures were modelled using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Lumerical Solution simulation software by adjusting the parameter of periodic boundary condition on the X and Y-axis and perfectly matched layer (PML) on the Z- axis. The asymmetric structures give double resonance peaks that depend on the arm-length of the structure.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{scenario for}} massive stars {{is still under}} discussion. To further constrain current theories, {{it is vital to}} spatially resolve the structures from which material accretes onto massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). Due to the small angular extent of MYSOs, one needs to overcome the limitations of conventional thermal infrared imaging, regarding spatial resolution, in order to get observational access to the inner structure of these objects. We employed <b>mid</b> - <b>infrared</b> interferometry, using the MIDI instrument on the ESO /VLTI, to investigate the Kleinmann - Wright Object, a massive young stellar object previously identified as a Herbig Be star precursor. Dispersed visibility curves in the N- band (8 - 13 μm) have been obtained at 5 interferometric baselines. We show that the <b>mid</b> - <b>infrared</b> emission region is resolved. A qualitative analysis of the data indicates a non - rotationally symmetric structure, e. g. the projection of an inclined disk. We employed extensive radiative transfer simulations based on spectral energy distribution fitting. Since SED - only fitting usually yields degenerate results, we first employed a statistical analysis of the parameters provided by the radiative transfer models. In addition, we compared the ten best - fitting self - consistent models to the interferometric observations. Our analysis of the Kleinmann - Wright Object suggests the existence of a circumstellar disk of 0. 1 M at an intermediate inclination of 76 ∘, while an additional dusty envelope is not necessary for fitting the data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of IR interferometry with radiative transfer simulations has the potential to resolve ambiguities arising from the analysis of spectral energy distributions alone.

50|$|Infrared (IR) {{spectroscopy}} by ATR {{is applicable}} to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission method. One advantage of ATR-IR over transmission-IR, is the limited path length into the sample. This avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media, such as aqueous solutions. For ultraviolet or visible light (UV/Vis) the evanescent light path gets short so that interaction with the sample is decreased with wavelength. For optically dense samples, this may allow for measurements with UV. Also, as no light path has to be established single shaft probes are used for process monitoring and are applicable in both the near and <b>mid</b> <b>infrared</b> spectrum.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Whipple {{predicted}} that dust particles travelled at low speeds {{relative to the}} comet, Milos Plavec {{was the first to}} offer the idea of a dust trail, when he calculated how meteoroids, once freed from the comet, would drift mostly in front of or behind the comet after completing one orbit. The effect is simple orbital mechanics - the material drifts only a little laterally away from the comet while drifting ahead or behind the comet because some particles make a wider orbit than others. These dust trails are sometimes observed in comet images taken at <b>mid</b> <b>infrared</b> wavelengths (heat radiation), where dust particles from the previous return to the Sun are spread along the orbit of the comet (see figures).|$|E

50|$|The {{band gap}} of Pb1−xSnxTe is tuned by varying the composition(x) in the material. SnTe can be alloyed with Pb (or PbTe with Sn) {{in order to}} tune the band gap from 0.29 eV (PbTe) to 0.18 eV (SnTe). It is {{important}} to note that unlike II-VI chalcogenides, e.g. cadmium, mercury and zinc chalcogenides, the band gap in Pb1−xSnxTe does not changes linearly between the two extremes. In contrast, as the composition (x) is increased, the band gap decreases, approaches zero in the concentration regime (0.32-0.65 corresponding to temperature 4-300 K respectively) and further increases towards bulk band gap of SnTe. Therefore, the lead tin telluride alloys have narrower band gaps than their end point counterparts making lead tin telluride an ideal candidate for <b>mid</b> <b>infrared,</b> 3-14 μm opto-electronic application.|$|E
