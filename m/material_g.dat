50|$|The Grossglockneridae {{family of}} ciliates, {{including}} the species Grossglockneria acuta, feed exclusively on fungi. G. acuta first attaches {{themselves to a}} hyphae or sporangium via a feeding tube and then a ring-shaped structure, around 2 μm in diameter is observed {{to appear on the}} fungus, possibly consisting of degraded cell wall <b>material.</b> <b>G.</b> acuta then feeds {{through the hole in the}} cell wall for, on average, 10 minutes, before detaching itself and moving away. The precise mechanism of feeding is not known, but it conceivably involves enzymes including acid phosphatases, cellulases and chitinases. Microtubules are visible in the feeding tube, as are possible reserves of cell membrane, which may be used to form food vacuoles filled with the cytoplasm of the fungus, via endocytosis, which are then transported back into G. acuta. The holes made by G. acuta bear some similarities to those made by amoeba, but unlike amoeba G. acuta never engulfs the fungus.|$|E

40|$|The {{condition}} for obtaining the linear response of a calorimeter to hadronic showers and an energy resolution improving as the incident energy increases is the equalization between the electromagnetic and the hadronic signals.

In this way, the calorimeter response to the electromagnetic component of the hadronic shower is reduced.

The oxygen pressure limits to maintaining an oxide-free surface are higher than for vacuum processing due to mass transport of oxygen in the carrier gas. Surface oxidation is detrimental to processes such as epi-taxy, metallization, and silicidation. S tandard processing has included a high-temperature prebake to remove sur-face oxides.

Black ' has stated that adapatability to the walls of cavities and freedom from excessive shrinkage or ex-pansion are two important qualities desired in materials for permanent restorations. For perfect adaptation of a restorative material to cavity walls, the material should combine chemically with the tooth surfaces and should also expand and contract {{to the same degree}} as the tooth during temperature changes. Such a restoration would conceiv-ably seal a cavity so completely that neither chemical solutions nor particulate matter could pass between the margins of the restorative material and the adjacent tooth surface. None of the presently available ma-terials possess these qualities. Numerous techniques have been em-ployed as a means of assessing adaptation of restorative materials. The testing agents which have been most commonly employed are (1) dyes, stains, and other chemicals; (2) air pressure; (3) bacteria; and (4) radio-active isotopes. The margins to be tested for penetration have been the restorative ma-terial abutted against either glass or tooth structure.
