Laser marking, on the other hand, is a broader category of methods to leave marks on an object, which also includes color change due to chemical/molecular alteration, charring, foaming, melting, ablation, and more. The technique does not involve the use of inks, nor does it involve tool bits which contact the engraving surface and wear out, giving it an advantage over alternative engraving or <b>marking</b> <b>technologies</b> where inks or bit heads {{have to be replaced}} regularly.|$|E

Direct part marking with Data Matrix symbols could significantly {{improve the quality}} of inventory control and parts lifecycle management. This paper examines the feasibility of using direct part <b>marking</b> <b>technologies</b> for use in future NASA programs. A structural analysis is based on marked material type, operational environment (e. g., ground, suborbital, Low Earth Orbit), durability of marks, ease of operation, reliability, and affordability. A cost-benefits analysis considers marking technology (label printing, data plates, and direct part marking) and marking types (two-dimensional machine-readable, human-readable). Previous NASA parts marking efforts and historical cost data are accounted for, including inhouse vs. outsourced marking. Some marking methods are still under development.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the laser marking {{as one of the}} progressive and environment friendly technologies with utilisation in many branches of industry. Engraving and other types of laser marking of different types of materials are very actual technologies these days. Laser marking decreases the waste creation in comparison with the other classical <b>marking</b> <b>technologies,</b> which use paintings or created chips. In this experimental investigation the laser marking surface texturing of material AL 99, 7 according to STN 42 4003 : 1993 - 08 (STN EN 573) has been conducted. The laser marking machine TruMark 6020 and software TruTops Mark were used. Laser surface texturing after laser marking has been realised under different combinations of process parameters: pulse frequency, pulse energy and laser beam scanning speed. The morphological characterization of engraving or annealing surfaces has been performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The evaluation of roughness of engraved surfaces has been realized according to STN EN ISO 4287 by using Surftest SJ 301. The aim of the contribution was to show how different laser parameters affect the surface texture and colour change of metallic materials while creating minimal waste...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the performance of pavement markings in wet night conditions. The performance of a typical pavement marking will degrade when it gets wet. This {{is a result of the}} flooding of the marking optics, thereby reducing retroreflectivity. Several technologies are available to improve wet marking performance. In this project, six technologies were tested using both standard measurement methods and participant evaluations. The results show that two of the <b>marking</b> <b>technologies,</b> raised retroreflective markers and wet retroreflective tape, outperformed the group under all conditions. These markings were also highly accepted by the participants. The results also show that the standard paint and glass beads technology is the worst performing and the least desirable of those evaluated. A comparison of the ASTM retroreflectivity measurement methods and the measured luminance results also indicates that the methods are suitable for the conditions used in the evaluation; however, possible additions and corrections to the methods are outlined in this report. A follow-up study is underway to allow development of a performance-based specification for pavement markings for wet night visibility. 17 Key Words 18.

40|$|International audienceEcological {{barriers}} {{represent a}} challenging and potentially risky component of migratory flyways. Complex patterns involve large arrays of species and {{huge numbers of}} birds in crossing deserts, mountain chains and large stretches of sea. Despite the recent rapid developments of new <b>marking</b> <b>technologies,</b> standardised ringing applied to networks of stations widely distributed across the barriers still represents a unique tool to unravel {{different aspects of the}} progression of the waves of migration. The Italian Ringing Centre at ISPRA co-ordinates two major projects investigating, respectively, songbird migration across the Mediterranean in spring and over the Alps in autumn. Networks of ringing stations provide details on geographical distribution of flyways based on first-capture data and on species-specific seasonality of movements as also explained by ecological factors acting both on the wintering and breeding grounds. Physical conditions of migrants at different stages of barrier crossing provide details on the energetic cost of endurance flights, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} ecological needs of migrants. Conditions of staging migrants, stopover duration and habitat use by migrants significantly contribute to the understanding of time- versus risk-minimizing strategies, within the general framework of the energetic balance of migration. Also, networks represented by the national communities of ringers contribute to the understanding of the ecological role a given country plays within larger migratory flyways. Ringing still offers great potential to analyse existing large-scale and long-term datasets to provide a sound scientific basis for the conservation of migrants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{aerospace}} industry, {{in order to}} ensure the identification and the traceability of the products, high repeatability, non-invasive and durable marking processes are required. Laser marking {{is one of the most}} advanced <b>marking</b> <b>technologies.</b> Compared to traditional marking processes, like punches, microdot, scribing or electric discharge pencil etcher, laser marking offers several advantages, such us: non-contact working, high repeatability, high scanning speed, mark width comparable to the laser spot dimension, high flexibility and high automation of the process itself. In order to assure the mark visibility for the component lifetime, an appropriate depth of the mark is required. In this way, a stable behaviour is ensured also when the component operates in aggressive environments (i. e. in presence of oxidation, corrosion and wear phenomena). The mark depth is strongly affected by the laser source kind and by the process parameters, such us average power, pulse frequency and scanning speed. Moreover, an excessive mark penetration could cause stress concentrations and reduce the fatigue life of the component. Consequently, an appropriate selection of the process parameters is required in order to assure visibility and to avoid excessive damage. Cold Spray Deposition (CSD) is a relative new technology that allows to produce surface coatings without significant substrate temperature increasing. In aeronautics fields this technology is useful to coat materials sensible to temperature, such as solution tempered aluminum alloy, with a titanium layer. Aim of the work is to characterize the laser marking process on CSD Ti coating, in order to study the influence of the laser marking process parameters (pulse power and scanning speed), on the groove geometry of the marking. The experimental marking tests were carried out through a 30 W MOPA Q-Switched Yb:YAG fibre laser; under different process conditions. The groove geometry was measured through a HIROX HK 9700 optical microscope. The results showed the effectiveness of the laser process to produce high quality marks on the titanium layer. Moreover, a correlation between the process parameters and the mark's geometry was clearly observed...|$|E

Intellectual property rights arise from the legal protection accorded to certain inventions or creations. We begin with a review of studies of innovation and IPR incidence, including their relationship with market structure. Our second topic is the valuation of IPR, which has been attempted via cost-based methods and econometric studies of productivity and market value. The cost incurred in the enforcement of IPR is a growing practical concern, but the literature here is less rich than for valuation. Our fourth topic is the relationship between public science and industry, which has been evolving rapidly in recent years. We then examine policy for the promotion of IPR both in the domestic policy arena and in the international context of the TRIPS agreement. We conclude with a list of suggested questions for future research. intellectual property, R&D, patents, trade <b>marks,</b> <b>technology...</b>|$|R
