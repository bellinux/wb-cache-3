5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory,</b> so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E
25|$|That {{distinction}} {{goes to the}} Harwell CADET of 1955, {{built by}} the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The design featured a 64-kilobyte <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> store with multiple moving heads that had been designed at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. By 1953 this team had transistor circuits operating {{to read and write}} on a smaller magnetic drum from the Royal Radar Establishment. The machine used a low clock speed of only 58kHz to avoid having to use any valves to generate the clock waveforms.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Manchester, a team {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power. Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory,</b> so it was not the first completely transistorized computer.|$|E
50|$|In old computers, {{magnetic}} storage {{was also used}} for primary storage in a form of <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum,</b> or core <b>memory,</b> core rope memory, thin film memory, twistor memory or bubble memory. Unlike modern computers, magnetic tape was also often used for secondary storage.|$|R
5000|$|ILLIAC II had 8192 {{words of}} core memory, {{backed up by}} 65,536 words of storage on <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums.</b> The core <b>memory</b> access time was 1.8 to 2 µs. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> access time was 7 µs. A [...] "fast buffer" [...] was also {{provided}} for storage of short loops and intermediate results (similar in concept {{to what is now}} called cache). The [...] "fast buffer" [...] access time was 0.25 µs ...|$|R
5000|$|Like many [...] "firsts" [...] in history, {{the first}} modern {{programming}} language is hard to identify. From the start, the restrictions of the hardware defined the language. Punch cards allowed 80 columns, {{but some of the}} columns had to be used for a sorting number on each card. FORTRAN included some keywords which were the same as English words, such as [...] "IF", [...] "GOTO" [...] (go to) and [...] "CONTINUE". The use of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> for <b>memory</b> meant that computer programs also had to be interleaved with the rotations of the drum. Thus the programs were more hardware-dependent.|$|R
50|$|Along with Gilbert W. King, Edwin L. Hughes, and George W. Brown, Ridenour {{patented}} {{an information}} storage system which combined optical disk storage of large capacity and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> of low capacity. The write-once-read-many optical disk memory would be updated monthly, and recently changed data is {{held on the}} re-writable <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
50|$|Billing {{worked at}} the Aerodynamic Research Institute in Göttingen, where he {{developed}} an <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the {{development}} of the BESK <b>magnetic</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>memory</b> Olle Karlqvist discovered a magnetic phenomenon, which has been called the Karlqvist gap.|$|E
50|$|In June 1954 IBM patent {{attorney}} A.J. Etienne sought Atanasoff's help in breaking an Eckert-Mauchly patent on a revolving <b>magnetic</b> <b>memory</b> <b>drum,</b> having been alerted by Clifford Berry that the ABC's revolving capacitor <b>memory</b> <b>drum</b> may have constituted prior art. Atanasoff agreed {{to assist the}} attorney, but IBM ultimately entered a patent-sharing agreement with Sperry Rand, {{the owners of the}} Eckert-Mauchly memory patent, and the case was dropped.|$|R
50|$|The final ERM {{computer}} contained {{more than}} a million feet (304,800 metres) of wiring, 8,000 vacuum tubes, 34,000 diodes, 5 input consoles with MICR readers, 2 <b>magnetic</b> <b>memory</b> <b>drums,</b> the check sorter, a high-speed printer, a power control panel, a maintenance board, 24 racks holding 1,500 electrical packages and 500 relay packages, and 12 magnetic tape drives for 2,400-foot (731-metre) tape reels.|$|R
50|$|American Airlines {{had already}} {{attacked}} {{the problem to}} some degree, {{and was in the}} process of introducing their new Magnetronic Reservisor, an electromechanical computer, in 1952 to replace the card files. This computer consisted of a single <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum,</b> each <b>memory</b> location holding the number of seats left on a particular flight. Using this system, a large number of operators could look up information simultaneously, so the ticket agents could be told over the phone whether a seat was available. On the downside, a staff member was still needed at each end of the phone line, and actually handling the ticket still took considerable effort and filing. Something much more highly automated was needed if American Airlines was going to enter the jet age, booking many times more seats.|$|R
50|$|The EMI Electronic Business Machine, a valve and <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> computer, {{was built}} in the 1950s to process the British Motor Corporation payroll.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> {{units were}} used in the Minuteman ICBM launch control centers from the {{beginning}} in the early 1960s until the REACT upgrades in the mid-90's.|$|E
50|$|Lindquist's first optical mark {{recognition}} scanner used a mimeograph paper-transport mechanism directly {{coupled to}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory.</b> Although {{it was not}} a general purpose computer, it made extensive use of computer technology.|$|E
5000|$|When the National Security Agency (NSA) {{was formed}} in 1952, Rowlett became chief of cryptanalysis. The primary problem facing {{research}} and development in the post-war period was development of high-speed processing equipment. Kullback supervised a staff of about 60, including such innovative thinkers in automated data processing development as Leo Rosen and Sam Snyder. His staff pioneered new forms of input and memory, such as <b>magnetic</b> tape and <b>drum</b> <b>memory,</b> and compilers to make machines truly [...] "multi-purpose." [...] Kullback gave priority to using computers to generate communications security (COMSEC) materials.|$|R
50|$|In November 1953 Richard Grimsdale and Douglas Webb of Manchester University first {{demonstrated}} their prototype transistorized computer using 92 point-contact transistors and 550 diodes {{in order to}} test the suitability of transistors in improving the reliability of the Manchester Mark 1 computer. This machine was similar to the Mark I, except that it did not include Williams tubes and used only the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> for main <b>memory.</b> The machine was based on a 48-bit word, although 4 bits were used for timing and thus not available for program use. This machine used thermionic valves to generate a clock frequency of 125 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|Random-access memory (RAM [...] ) {{is a form}} of {{computer}} data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost {{the same amount of time}} irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older <b>magnetic</b> tapes and <b>drum</b> <b>memory,</b> the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.|$|R
50|$|Andrew Donald Booth (11 February 1918 - 29 November 2009) was a British {{electrical}} engineer, {{physicist and}} computer scientist {{who was an}} early developer of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> for computers and invented Booth's multiplication algorithm.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the MADDIDA {{began in}} 1946 {{with the goal}} of {{producing}} the first DIgital Data Analyzer (DIDA). When {{the decision was made to}} use <b>MAgnetic</b> <b>Drum</b> <b>memory</b> (MAD) for the DIDA, the name was lengthened to MADDIDA (pronounced [...] "Mad Ida").|$|E
50|$|The ZEBRA was a binary, two-address {{machine with}} a 33-bit word length. Storage was {{provided}} by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> holding 8K words; accumulators were also implemented as recirculating drum tracks {{in a manner similar}} to that used in the Bendix G-15. Peripherals included paper tape reader and punch, and teleprinter.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{designing}} of the 6600, CDC {{had set up}} Project SPIN {{to supply}} the system with a high speed hard disk memory system. At {{the time it was}} unclear if disks would replace <b>magnetic</b> <b>memory</b> <b>drums,</b> or whether fixed or removable disks would become the more prevalent. SPIN explored all of these approaches, and eventually delivered a 28" [...] diameter fixed disk and a smaller multi-platter 14" [...] removable disk-pack system. Over time, the hard disk business pioneered in SPIN became a major product line.|$|R
50|$|Computer systems {{generally}} {{consist of}} three main parts: the {{central processing unit}} (CPU) that processes data, memory that holds the programs and data to be processed, and I/O (input/output) devices as peripherals that communicate with the outside world. An early computer might contain a hand-wired CPU of vacuum tubes, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> for main <b>memory,</b> and a punch tape and printer for reading and writing data respectively. A modern system might have a multi-core CPU, DDR4 SDRAM for memory, a solid-state drive for secondary storage, a graphics card and LCD as a display system, a mouse and keyboard for interaction, and a Wi-Fi connection for networking. In both examples, computer buses of {{one form or another}} move data between all of these devices.|$|R
40|$|Transcript, 110 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] an Austrian computer scientist, begins by describing his early life in Vienna, Austria and experiences in Nazi-occupied Austria. He discusses his engineering education {{and work in}} radar technology during World War II. Zemanek then focuses {{on the development of}} computers in Austria. Topics include: <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> and <b>magnetic</b> <b>memory,</b> the MAILUFTERL computer (which Zemanek designed and built), the LOGALGOL and other compilers, the University of Vienna where Zemanek worked on his computer, the subsequent sponsorship of the project by International Business Machines Europe, and ALGOL and PL/I language standards development. The interview concludes with Zemanek offering a brief overview of the computer industry in Europe from the end of World War II to the 1980...|$|R
50|$|The ETL Mark III's successor, the ETL Mark IV, began {{development}} in 1956 and {{was completed in}} 1957. It was a stored-program transistor computer with high-speed <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory.</b> A {{modified version of the}} ETL Mark IV, the ETL Mark IV A, was introduced in 1958, as a fully transistorised computer with magnetic-core memory and an index register.|$|E
50|$|The Mark III's word {{consisted}} of 16 bits. It used 5,000 vacuum tubes and 1,500 crystal diodes. It used <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> of 4,350 words. Its addition time was 4,400 microseconds and the multiplication time was 13,200 microseconds (times include memory access time). Aiken boasted that the Mark III was the fastest electronic {{computer in the}} world.|$|E
50|$|The UNIVAC 1105 {{had either}} 8,192 or 12,288 words of 36-bit {{magnetic}} core memory, {{in two or}} three banks of 4,096 words each. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> provided either 16,384 or 32,768 words, in one or two drums with 16,384 words each. Sixteen to twenty-four UNISERVO II tape drives were connected, with a maximum capacity (not counting block overhead) of 1,200,000 words per tape.|$|E
5000|$|For {{mass storage}} {{there was a}} <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> {{available}} {{as well as a}} magnetic tape <b>memory.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> had a storage capacity of 17664 Z25 words. The transmission speed was 6900 words per second. The magnetic tape memory had a capacity of 1 million Z25 words and a transmission speed of approximately 33000 Z25 words per second. In- and output was through punched tape and punched cards; it was also possible to print to a teleprinter.|$|R
50|$|Porter {{suggested}} {{using the}} DATAR computer design {{as the basis}} for a sorting system. Following Lewis' suggestion, a new reader would sort the mail {{on the basis of the}} pattern of stripes on the letter provided by an operator who simply typed in the address without attempting to route it. Ferranti suggested a fluorescent ink instead of a conductive one. Routing information would be placed on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum,</b> which could store thousands of routes and could be easily changed on demand. Levy, however, was interested in using an optical memory system being developed at IBM by a team including Louis Ridenour (see Automatic Language Translator for details) for storage of the routing information. Turnbull overruled Levy, and on 10 August 1954 he signed a contract with Ferranti for the Electronic Information Handling System using a <b>drum</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For many early {{computers}}, <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> {{formed the}} main working {{memory of the}} computer. It was so common that these computers were {{often referred to as}} drum machines. [...] Some <b>drum</b> <b>memories</b> were also used as secondary storage.|$|R
50|$|Control Data {{started by}} selling <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> systems to other {{computer}} manufacturers, but introduced their own mainframe, the CDC 1604, in 1958. Designed primarily by Seymour Cray, the company soon followed the 1604 {{with a series}} of increasingly powerful machines. In 1965 they introduced the CDC 6600, the first supercomputer, and CDC was suddenly in the leadership position with a machine ten times faster than anything on the market.|$|E
50|$|The {{system used}} {{electrostatic}} storage, consisting of 36 Williams tubes with {{a capacity of}} 1024 bits each, giving a total random access memory of 1024 words of 36 bits each. Each of the 36 Williams tubes was five inches in diameter. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> provided 16,384 words. Both the electrostatic and drum memories were directly addressable: addresses 0 through 01777 (Octal) were in electrostatic memory and 040000 through 077777 (Octal) were on the drum.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} had {{an incremental}} compiler for a language, PAF (Programmation Automatique des Formules) similar to Fortran, designed by Dimitri Starynkevitch in 1957-1959. CAB 500's first model was delivered in February, 1961, {{and more than}} a hundred exemplars were built. It had a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>memory</b> of 16 K words (of 32 bits) rotating at 3000 rpm (50 rotations/s) and could invert a square matrix of order 25 in half an hour.|$|E
40|$|The {{fluctuations}} in the angular velocity of individual assemblies of a precision mechanical system were analyzed. The system was composed of an electric motor and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> which were connected by a flexible coupling. A dynamic model was constructed which took into account the absence of torsion in the rigid shafts of the electric motor drive rotor and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum.</b> The motion was described by Lagrange differential equations of the second kind. Curves are developed to show the nature of amplitude fluctuation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> angular velocity at a specific excitation frequency. Additional curves show the amplitudes of fluctuation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> angular velocity compared to the quantity of damping at specific frequencies...|$|R
5000|$|By June 1963 the Time-Sharing System (TSS) Model Zero was {{demonstrated}} after <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> {{were added to}} the time-sharing. Each user was given a priority-based time slice, measured in milliseconds, when the user's program was written from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> into much higher speed memory, processed, and then written back to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> with any computational changes that had occurred. It was influenced by early experiments at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, and the CTSS project at MIT. [...] Terminals included several Teletype Model 33 ASRs.|$|R
