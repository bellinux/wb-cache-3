40|$|The {{past two}} years have been {{challenging}} for the <b>multiservice</b> <b>switch</b> market. Switch sales have dropped 23 % from 2000 to 2002 (Cahners In-Stat/MDR- IN 020214 WN) due to service provider financial woes. During the late 1990 s and early 2000, service provider networks were built out to accommodate the insatiable future demand of bandwidth. With the economy slow-down over the {{past two years}}, service providers began curbing their capital expenditures and only purchasing limited equipment to handle growth in traffic and customers, usually adding line cards to the existing network platforms versus adding new shelves or platforms. Their strategy was to leverage the existing network infrastructure as much as possible to maximize return on investment (ROI). The dilemma that service providers face now is how to add revenue-generating services and continue to add customers while keeping costs under control. In addition to facing a challenging economic environment, the <b>multiservice</b> <b>switch</b> market has its own technological challenges. The market is diverse with single multiservice platforms accommodating a mixture of ATM, Frame Relay, IP, Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Packet over SONET (PoS), and Gigabit Ethernet. Interface speeds range from subT 1 /E 1 to OC- 3 to full-duplex OC- 48 c/STM- 16 links. The <b>multiservice</b> <b>switch</b> must also be able to adapt to emerging applications such as packetized voice (VoIP) an...|$|R

This is accomplished by the architecture of MSF, <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switching</b> Forum. The architecture is explained and different protocols for switch control are reviewed. Some experimental support for this architecture is mentioned, and performance issues are briefly discussed...|$|R
50|$|The MultiService Forum, MSF, {{originally}} <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switching</b> Forum, was {{a telecommunications}} industry association which promoted interoperability {{in the field}} of next generation networking products and services from 1998 to 2013. The open-member organization included equipment vendors such as AT&T, Alcatel-Lucent, and Cisco Systems, fixed and mobile network operators such as Verizon, NTT, BT and Vodafone, and others. MSF produced Implementation Agreements, which specify the implementation of communication technologies, or their configuration for achieving interoperation.|$|R
40|$|Platforms at {{the edge}} of the network, such as <b>MultiService</b> <b>Switches</b> (MSS) and edge routers, convert traffic from legacy {{networks}} to Internet Protocol (IP) traffic for transport across the network core. Line and service cards in these platforms will have to handle traffic in a wide range of protocols and line rates. Current silicon solutions for edge applications are limited in functionality and performance. These limitations increase both the installation and operational cost of edge systems...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of media types {{supported}} by the <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switch,</b> both modern and historical. For example, Nortel offers line cards that provide Packet over SONET and ATM at OC3 through OC192 speeds (depending on the fabric capacity). As well, Frame Relay and other historical TDM interfaces can be purchased. More recently, Ethernet has become a focus for these switches, and 10/100BASE-T and 1000BASE-T media types have been supported (again depending on the fabric capacity).|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Ericsson {{acquired}} {{manufacturing and}} research facilities, and staff from the Guangdong Nortel Telecommunication Equipment Company (GDNT) {{as well as}} Nortel’s <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switch</b> business. It also formed a strategic alliance with Akamai Technologies to develop and market mobile cloud acceleration services. Ericsson acquired U.S. company Telcordia Technologies in January 2012, an operations and business support systems (OSS/BSS) company. In March, Ericsson announced it was buying the broadcast-services division of Technicolor, a media broadcast technology company. In April 2012 Ericsson completed the acquisition of BelAir Networks a strong Wi-Fi network technology company.|$|R
40|$|To be {{competitive}} {{in a rapidly}} growing market requires rapid upgrades to the performance and functionality of the network. One way to manage rapid upgrades of the network with minimum risk is to deploy equipment using a modular system architecture. Modularity allows a network operator to mix and match best of breed components to achieve the desired system rather than rely on vendors to implement specific technology before making crucial business decisions. This article begins with {{an overview of the}} current global movement toward standards that support network elements with modular system architecture. The story begins with university initiatives and the forming of OpenSig and IEEE P 1520 more than five years ago, continuing with related and complementary initiatives by the Parlay Group, Softswitch Consortium, <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switching</b> Forum, and several IETF working groups. Next, special attention is given to the component-based architecture of the <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switching</b> Forum released in summer 2000. The trend of building network equipment from components with distinctly different functional specialties is described in three examples: media gateways, IP routers, and virtual IP routers. It is envisioned that component-based network infrastructure will spawn new markets for entrepreneurial developers, spurring competition and accelerating the creation of innovative solutions for all facets of global communications. The article concludes with a smorgasbord of new market opportunities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{analytical}} {{model of a}} <b>multiservice</b> <b>switching</b> network with overflow links {{in the first stage}} and resource reservation for selected call classes in output directions. The proposed model assumes that both the overflow mechanism and the resource reservation mechanism {{can be used in a}} number of selected, or all, classes of calls. A particular attention is given to the way the effective availability parameter for networks with overflow links in the point-to-point selection mode is determined. The proposed model makes it possible to determine dependencies between the internal blocking probability, capacity of overflow links, and the number of reserved resources for call classes to be analysed. Simulation experiments confirm high accuracy of the proposed method and potential applications of the model in engineering issues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer. While the main challenge, namely compositionality, is similar in standard concurrent <b>systems</b> and in <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> the problems and solutions are different. In the verification front, we suggest and study an assumeguarantee paradigm for <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> and study formalisms in which satisfaction of a specification in all components imply its satisfaction in the <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> In the synthesis front, we show that while compositional synthesis and design are undecidable, the problem of synthesizing a switching rule with which a given <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> satisfies an LTL specification is decidable. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} discuss the method of {{computing}} the viability kernel conveniently, we present some important features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> are dynamical systems that consist of {{a finite number of}} subsystems and a logical rule that orchestrates switching between these subsystems. Therefore, one of the features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> is multi-subsystem. In addition, <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> could not be guaranteed to be stable even if all subsystems are stable. Switching rule may be designed to stabilize <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> even if all subsystems are unstable. According to the discussion above, the computation of the viability kernel is affected by the switching rules and subsystems.|$|R
40|$|With {{knowledge}} of persistent data communication traffic patterns offered to an avionics data network, {{modifications to the}} routing through the network {{can be made to}} improve total throughput and bound the latency of packets. The <b>Multiservice</b> <b>Switch</b> (MSS) is such a route-optimizing switch for streaming sensor data. The MSS has two switching fabrics: packet switching and circuit switching. The packet-switching fabric routes small control and data packets between switch ports. The circuit-switching fabric uses a crossbar to physically connect ringlets, which reduces the workload on the packet-switching fabric for long data streams between the used ports. An implementation of the MSS is described which uses commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. A simulation model was developed to show the benefits of the MSS under standard avionics workloads. The results of the MSS indicate distinct advantages in terms of performance, price, and power consumption over other conventional switch and ne [...] ...|$|R

30|$|A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{a hybrid}} {{dynamical}} system {{consisting of a}} finite number of subsystems and a logical rule that manages switching between these subsystems. <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> have drawn {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years; see [1 – 37] and references therein. The motivation for studying <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> comes partly from the fact that <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>switched</b> multicontroller <b>systems</b> have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, process control, automotive industry, power systems, aircraft and traffic control, and many other fields. An important qualitative property of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is stability [1 – 3]. The challenge of analyzing the stability of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> lies partly in the fact that, even if the individual systems are stable, the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> might be unstable. Using a common quadratic Lyapunov function on all subsystems, the quadratic Lyapunov stability facilitates the analysis and synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the obtained results within this framework have been recognized to be conservative. In [10], various algorithms both for stability and performance analysis of discrete-time piece-wise affine systems were presented. Different classes of Lyapunov functions were considered, and how to compute them through linear matrix inequalities was also shown. Moreover, the tradeoff between the degree of conservativeness and computational requirements was discussed. The problem of stability analysis and control synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> in the discrete-time domain was addressed in [11]. The approach followed in [11] looked at the existence of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function to check asymptotic stability of the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Two different linear matrix inequality-based conditions allow to check the existence of such a Lyapunov function. These two conditions have been proved to be equivalent for stability analysis.|$|R
