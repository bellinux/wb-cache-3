30|$|In Section 4 we {{discussed}} the magnetic field line topology and cutoff latitudes of particle impacting on the Earth for different kind of <b>multipole</b> <b>configuration,</b> which can occur during reversals, turned dipoles as well as quadrupoles. Another interesting case is the quadrupole moment with neutral lines (Vogt et al., 2004). This configuration posses several poles, but the most interesting behavior is the existence of low field regimes in the polar regions and of neutral lines where the magnetic field is zero. Of course, several combinations of dipoles and quadrupoles are possible. In some dipole-quadrupole configurations the situation appears that field lines of the dipole and the quadrupole are antiparallel, so that the resulting field vanishes. These locations are called neutral points.|$|E

The process is demonstrated for optical transmission gratings in fused silica with {{a period of}} 800 nm (1250 lines/mm) {{to be used in}} laser pulse compression. The technology is based on an innovative advancement of i-line proximity photolithography performed in a mask aligner. The aerial image is encoded in a rigorously optimized electron-beam-written three-level phase mask which is illuminated by an adapted <b>multipole</b> <b>configuration</b> of incidence angles. In comparison to conventional proximity lithography, the process enables a significantly higher resolution while maintaining a good depth of focusâ€”in contrast to lithography based on direct Talbot-imaging. Details about the grating fabrication process and characterization of fabricated pulse compression grating wafers are presented.

30|$|Using the non-dimensional {{coordinates}} all magneto-spheres of {{the same}} <b>multipole</b> <b>configuration</b> but with different strength can be normalized: The topology of the field lines are {{the same for all}} values of the magnetic moments, but the normalized size of the Earth differs. For small moments it is larger than for large ones. Figure 3 shows an example of two magnetospheric situations. The left upper figure demonstrates the magnetic field lines of a magnetic dipole moment mz, 0 in a cylindrical magnetosphere, the right one shows the magnetic field of a moment mz, 1 = 0.1 mz, 0. The size of the magnetosphere, determined by Eq. (32), is about half that of the first case. Zooming the first magnetosphere by a factor of one and the second by a factor of two, as seen in the lower figure of Fig. 3, the field lines are the same, but the radius r 1 of the sphere, which describes the Earth with the lower dipole moment is twice as large as the radius r 0 for the case with the larger dipole moment.|$|E

Therefore, it is the aim to calculate the magnetic field distribution and the force density distribution, even if only the magnetic field outside the magnetic roller is available. Transforming the measured magnetic field values into a set of magnetic vector potentials and using them as the magnetic source in the finite element analysis, makes this method independent of the real excitation (permanent magnets or electromagnets). In this way it is possible to evaluate the force components acting on the particles. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Surface-electrode (SE) rf traps are a {{promising}} approach to manufacturing complex ion-trap networks suitable for large-scale quantum information processing. In this paper we present analytical methods for modeling SE traps in the gapless plane approximation, and apply these methods to two particular classes of SE traps. For the SE ring trap we derive analytical expressions for the trap geometry and strength, and also calculate the depth {{in the absence}} of control fields. For translationally symmetric <b>multipole</b> <b>configurations</b> (analogs of the linear Paul trap), we derive analytical expressions for electrode geometry and strength. Further, we provide arbitrarily good approximations of the trap depth {{in the absence of}} static fields and identify the requirements for obtaining maximal depth.

Then we derive an approximate expression which traces the exact shape of the CMB bispectrum {{in order to reduce the}} computation time with respect to a large number of the <b>multipole</b> <b>configurations,</b> and also show that the non-Gaussian structure coming from PMFs is classified as the local-type configuration. Computing the signal-to-noise ratio on the basis of the approximate formula with the information of the instrumental noises and resolutions, we find expected upper bounds on the magnetic field strength, when the magnetic spectrum is nearly scale invariant (n_B = - 2. 9), smoothed on 1 Mpc scale at 95...|$|R

The properties of monolithic high temperature superconductors have been well documented, and monolithic tubes, disks and rods of different cross section and sizes can presently be obtained from several commercial vendors. In this paper, design issues of quadrupole magnets using single crystal or highly textured YBCO monoliths are addressed. The excellent properties of YBCO operating at elevated temperatures (> 10 K) are also summarized. High field, cryo-stable, highly complex multipole magnets can be manufactured in the proposed manner. The charging schemes for the disks, based upon induction, are also addressed. High temperature superconducting (HTS) materials are ceramic and brittle in nature.

40|$|We {{propose a}} fast and {{efficient}} bispectrum statistic for {{cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) temperature anisotropies to constrain the amplitude of the primordial non-Gaussian signal {{measured in terms of}} the non-linear coupling parameter f_NL. We show how the method can achieve a remarkable computational advantage by focusing on subsets of the <b>multipole</b> <b>configurations,</b> where the non-Gaussian signal is more concentrated. The detection power of the test increases roughly linearly with the maximum multipole, as shown in the ideal case of an experiment without noise and gaps. The CPU-time scales as l^ 3 _max instead of l^ 5 _max for the full bispectrum, which for Planck resolution l_max 3000 means an improvement in speed of a factor of 10 ^ 7 compared with the full bispectrum analysis with minor loss in precision. This approach is complementary to the fast method introduced by Komatsu, Spergel Wandelt using a reconstruction of the primordial fluctuation field. We find that the introduction of a galactic cut partially destroys the optimality of the configuration, which will then need to be dealt with in the future. We find for an ideal experiment with l_max = 2000 that upper limits of f_NL 8 can be obtained at 1 Ïƒ. For the case of the WMAP experiment, {{we would be able to}} put limits of |f_NL| 40 if no galactic cut were present. Using the real data with a galactic cut, we obtain an estimate of - 80 f_NL 80 and - 160 f_NL 160 at 1 and 2 Ïƒ, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between detailed model calculations of Jupiter's synchrotron radiation and the radio data at wavelengths of 6, 21, and 50 cm. The calculations were performed for a Jovian longitude of 200 deg and {{were based on the}} <b>multipole</b> field <b>configurations</b> as derived from the Pioneer data. The electron distribution in the inner magnetosphere was derived as a function of energy, pitch angle, and spatial coordinates. In addition, the hot region or east-west asymmetry in the radiation belts is investigated. It is suggested that this asymmetry is due to the combined effect of an overabundance of electrons at jovicentric longitudes of 240 - 360 deg and the existence of a dusk-to-dawn directed electric field over the inner magnetosphere generated by the wind system in the upper atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{decoherence}} {{in charge}} qubits formed by multiple lateral quantum dots {{in the framework}} of the spin-boson model and the Born-Markov approximation. We consider the intrinsic decoherence caused by the coupling to bulk phonon modes. Two distinct quantum dot configurations are studied: (i) Three quantum dots in a ring geometry with one excess electron in total and (ii) arrays of quantum dots where the computational basis states form <b>multipole</b> charge <b>configurations.</b> For the three-dot qubit, we demonstrate the possibility of performing one- and two-qubit operations by solely tuning gate voltages. Compared to the proposal by DiVincenzo et al. involving a linear three-dot spin qubit, the three-dot charge qubit allows for less overhead on two-qubit operations. For small interdot tunnel amplitudes, the three-dot qubits have Q factors much higher than those obtained for double dot systems. The high-multipole dot configurations also show a substantial decrease in decoherence at low operation frequencies when compared to the double-dot qubit.

40|$|Redshift space distortions {{privilege}} {{the location}} of the observer in cosmological redshift surveys, breaking the translational symmetry of the underlying theory. This violation of statistical homogeneity has consequences for the modeling of clustering observables, leading to what are frequently called `wide angle effects'. We study these effects analytically, computing their signature in the clustering of the <b>multipoles</b> in <b>configuration</b> and Fourier space. We take into account both physical wide angle contributions as well as the terms generated by the galaxy selection function. Similar considerations also affect the way power spectrum estimators are constructed. We quantify, in an analytical way the biases which enter and clarify the relation between what we measure and the underlying theoretical modeling. The presence of an angular window function is also discussed. Motivated by this analysis we present new estimators for the three dimensional Cartesian power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles written in terms of spherical Fourier-Bessel coefficients. We show how the latter have several interesting properties, allowing in particular a clear separation between angular and radial modes. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|A 5 x 40 cm rectangular-beam {{ion source}} was {{designed}} and fabricated. A <b>multipole</b> field <b>configuration</b> was used to facilitate design of the modular rectangular chamber, while a three-grid ion optics system was used for increased ion current densities. For the multipole chamber, a magnetic integral of 0. 000056 Tesla-m was used to contain the primary electrons. This integral value was reduced from the initial design value, with the reduction found necessary for discharge stability. The final value of magnetic integral resulted in discharge losses at typical operating conditions which ranged from 600 to 1000 eV/ion, in good agreement with the design value of 800 eV/ion. The beam current density at the ion optics was limited to about 3. 2 mA/sq cm at 500 eV and to about 3. 5 mA/sq cm at 1000 ev. The effects of nonuniform ion current, dimension tolerance, and grid thermal warping were considered. The use of multiple rectangular-beam ion sources to process wider areas than would be possible with a single source (approx. 40 cm) was also studied. Beam profiles were surveyed {{at a variety of}} operating conditions and the results of various amounts of beam overlap calculated...|$|R
40|$|A {{rectangular}} {{ion source}} particularly {{suited for the}} continuous sputter processing of materials over a wide area is discussed. A <b>multipole</b> magnetic field <b>configuration</b> was used to design an ion source with a 5 x 40 cm beam area, while a three-grid ion optics system was used to maximize ion current density at the design ion energy of 500 eV. An average extracted current density of about 4 mA/sq cm could be obtained from 500 eV Ar ions. The difference between the experimental performance and the design value of 6 mA/sq cm is attributed to grid misalignment due to thermal expansion. The discharge losses at typical operating conditions ranged from about 600 to 1000 eV/ion, in reasonable agreement with the design value of 800 eV/ion.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of an X 2. 7 solar flare, {{that occurred in}} a complex Î²Î³Î´ magnetic configuration region on 2003 November 3, is discussed utilizing a multi-wavelength data set. The HÎ± images taken from the solar tower telescope at ARIES, Nainital, reveal well-defined footpoint (FP) and loop-top (LT) sources. As the flare evolves, the LT source moves upward and the separation between the two FP sources increases {{which is consistent with}} reconnection models of solar flares. The co-alignment of HÎ± with hard X-ray (HXR) images obtained from RHESSI shows spatial correlation between HÎ± and HXR footpoints, while the rising LT source in HXR is always located above the LT source seen in HÎ±. The EUV images of the flaring region at 195 Ã… taken from SOHO/EIT reveal intense emission from low-lying loops near the active region during the impulsive phase. On the other hand, two bright loops are seen well outside the active region which undergo large scale reorganization during the flare. In radio wavelengths, type III radio bursts are observed few minutes {{prior to the start of}} HXR emission at the LT indicating pre-flare coronal activity. Slow drifting type IV bursts, which are observed at lower coronal heights at two time intervals along the flare period, are likely to be associated with the reconnection processes at two different coronal heights. Further, the intense type II radio burst at time inbetween these type IV bursts, but at a relatively larger height indicates the onset of CME and its associated coronal shock wave. The results of this study support the `break-out' scenario observed in <b>multipole</b> magnetic <b>configuration</b> of a flaring region...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} role of complex multipolar {{magnetic}} fields in determining physical processes near the surface of rotation powered pulsars. We model the actual magnetic field as the sum of global dipolar and star-centered multipolar fields. In configurations involving axially symmetric and uniform multipolar fields, 'neutral points' and 'neutral lines' exist close to the stellar surface. Also, the curvature radii of magnetic field lines near the stellar surface can never be smaller than the stellar radius, even for very high order <b>multipoles.</b> Consequently, such <b>configurations</b> are unable to provide an efficient pair creation process above pulsar polar caps, necessary for plasma mechanisms of generation of pulsar radiation. In configurations involving axially symmetric and non-uniform multipoles, {{the periphery of the}} pulsar polar cap becomes fragmented into symmetrically distributed narrow sub-regions where curvature radii of complex magnetic field lines are less than the radius of the star. The pair production process is only possible just above these 'favourable' sub-regions. As a result, the pair plasma flow is confined within narrow filaments regularly distributed around the margin of the open magnetic flux tube. Such a magnetic topology allows us to model the system of twenty isolated sub-beams observed in PSR B 0943 + 10 by Deshpande & Rankin (1999, 2001). We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of pulsar radio emission in the ensemble of finite sub-beams, based on specific instabilities. We propose an explanation for the subpulse drift phenomenon observed in some long-period pulsars. Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures, MNRAS, in pres...|$|R
