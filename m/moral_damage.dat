In that tradition, the venerable Lusitania decision defined <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> as compensation “for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation,” thereby identifying those injuries remedied by <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> as mental or reputational injuries.

40|$|AbstractResearch objective: This {{study is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of the correction of the prejudice, in terms of <b>moral</b> <b>damages,</b> the topic that is proposed being currently controversial and extremely topical. Theoretical frame. The lack of criteria for assessing the <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> {{is just one of the}} factors that hamper the adjustment of <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> by the court. Not specifying the criteria for assessing the <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> in the legislation, has created for the judge called to solve a dispute, the possibility of imagining different criteria in order to determine the value of the <b>moral</b> <b>damages.</b> The novelty element. In this study we observe the current state of the national jurisprudence in terms of the indemnity of the <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> caused by committing an offense, starting with the presentation of the term “moral damages” and ending with the presentation of some relevant case studies. Methodology. The study is characterized by the combination of two plans, the theoretical and the practical, based on theoretical concepts and then presents relevant case studies from the practice of the Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice, using the deductive method by which we carried out the analysis of the legislation and the doctrine speech, and also the exemplification when we analyzed the case studies. Results. The study presents an original conception on the correction of the prejudice in terms of <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> caused by an offense, by highlighting the imperfections of the national legislation, through the presentation of the case studies. Finally, we present a synthesis of the conclusions to be drawn from the analysis...|$|R

60|$|Now, {{the idea}} of a divorce so easy and wilful as Mr. Shaw proposes arises {{naturally}} out of an exclusive consideration of what I may call the amorous sentimentalities of marriage. If you regard marriage as merely the union of two people in love, then, clearly, it is intolerable, an outrage upon human dignity, that they should remain intimately united when either ceases to love. And in that world of Mr. Shaw's dreams, in which everybody is to have an equal income and nobody is to have children, in that culminating conversazione of humanity, his marriage law will, no doubt, work with the most admirable results. But if we make a step towards reality and consider a world in which incomes are unequal, and economic difficulties abound--for the present we will ignore the complication of offspring--we at once find it necessary to modify the first fine simplicity of divorce at either partner's request. Marriage is almost always a serious economic disturbance for both man and woman: work has to be given up and rearranged, resources have to be pooled; only in the rarest cases does it escape becoming an indefinite business partnership. Accordingly, the withdrawal of one partner raises at once all sorts of questions of financial adjustment, compensation for physical, mental, and <b>moral</b> <b>damage,</b> division of furniture and effects and so forth. No doubt a very large part of this could be met if there existed some sort of marriage settlement providing for the dissolution of the partnership. Otherwise the petitioner for a Shaw-esque divorce must be prepared for the most exhaustive and penetrating examination before, say, a court of three assessors--representing severally the husband, the wife, and justice--to determine the distribution of the separation. This point, however, leads me to note in passing the need that does exist even to-day for a more precise business supplement to marriage as we know it in England and America. I think {{there ought to be a}} very definite and elaborate treaty of partnership drawn up by an impartial private tribunal for every couple that marries, providing for most of the eventualities of life, taking cognizance of the earning power, the property and prospects of either party, insisting upon due insurances, ensuring private incomes for each partner, securing the welfare of the children, and laying down equitable conditions in the event of a divorce or separation. Such a treaty ought to be a necessary prelude to the issue of a licence to marry. And given such a basis to go upon, then I see no reason why, in the case of couples who remain childless for five or six years, let us say, and seem likely to remain childless, the Shaw-esque divorce at the instance of either party, without reason assigned, should not be a very excellent thing indeed.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} a synhtetical discussion of the Romanian judicial practice regarding the <b>moral</b> <b>damages</b> in accident insurance(RCA insurance or civil liabilty for cars insurance), with a focus on the objective determination of the prejudice for the affected parts in Court decisions.

Judges’ interpretation of the same normative acts and laws in this domain are often different,as well as imprecise.
