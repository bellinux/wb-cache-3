Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times." [...] Mara Reinstein of US Weekly called the film [...] "joyless" [...] and wrote, [...] "Despite [...] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here — save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations." [...] Rex Reed of the New York Observer called Doctor Strange [...] "an awkwardly cliché-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality" [...] and said, [...] "None of it <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense...</b> For characterization, dialogue, narrative arc, acceptable acting and coherence, go elsewhere." [...] Adam Graham of The Detroit News said, [...] "Cumberbatch is wildly charismatic in the lead role... But that’s the thing: He’s a better party guest than he is a host. Doctor Strange is a fine introduction, but by the end, you’re not sad to be headed for the door." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{reviews of}} the film were mostly {{positive}} (receiving an 83% rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes), Mulholland Drive was not without its detractors. Rex Reed of The New York Observer {{said that it was}} the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it [...] "a load of moronic and incoherent garbage." [...] In New York, Peter Rainer observed, [...] "Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it's still a pretty moribund ride... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while." [...] In The Washington Post, Desson Howe called it [...] "an extended mood opera, if you want to put an arty label on incoherence." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety found much to praise—"Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best"—but also noted, [...] "the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland... for the final 45minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or logical connection to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from Twin Peaks and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement." [...] James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: [...] "Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us." [...] Film theorist Ray Carney notes, [...] "You wouldn't need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldn't need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Register's {{earliest}} years, {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPO were small, understaffed and underfunded.

During this time period, the SHPO had little time to devote to serious planning, even if it wanted to; the demands of saving historic properties and building the organizations {{from the ground up}} consumed most of the early state office's resources. As a result, neither the State Historic Preservation Offices nor OAHP really took planning seriously.
