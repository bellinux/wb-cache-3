Males in Burghead do not outnumber females nearly as <b>much</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> age of 25 as they do under 25, as the number of males per female is significantly lower over age 25 (1.05) than it is under 25 (1.45).|$|E
25|$|As the Mach number increases, so {{does the}} {{strength}} of the shock wave and the Mach cone becomes increasingly narrow. As the fluid flow crosses the shock wave, its speed is reduced and temperature, pressure, and density increase. The stronger the shock, the greater the changes. At high enough Mach numbers the temperature increases so <b>much</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shock that ionization and dissociation of gas molecules behind the shock wave begin. Such flows are called hypersonic.|$|E

25|$|The town {{is located}} on the Neva Lowland, on the left bank of the river Neva, in the valley of the Slavyanka River. The {{landscape}} is quite varied and contains hills, ridges and terraces intermixed with valleys, plains, forests and farmland. Numerous springs give rise to streams and feed ponds. In the Paleozoic era, 300–400 million years ago, the area was covered by a sea. Sediments of that time form a layer thicker than 200 meters on top of the Baltic Shield consisting of granite, gneiss and diabase. The modern topography was shaped by the glacier retreat some 12,000 years ago which created the Littorina Sea. About 4,000 years ago the sea receded and formed the valley of the Neva River which has not changed <b>much</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last 2,500 years.|$|E

While much of her first album revolved around the piano, most of the songs from On a Clear Night were guitar-based. This was because Higgins had easier access to a guitar than keyboards while touring. She said, [...] "I hadn't been playing guitar very long for the first album so I think I'm definitely a better guitar player, and probably a worse piano player because I haven't been able to play it <b>much</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last few years".|$|E

[...] Still, the rationale was to teach the fundamentals of life {{and work in the}} naval service, focusing on administrative procedures.

Leng writes of this performance of [...] "Dark Horse": [...] "Anyone wondering what Harrison's voice sounded like on the Dark Horse Tour need look no further: this track was cut only days before the first date in Vancouver. Although the band sounded good, his voice was in shreds..."

500|$|The {{rules of}} chess have evolved <b>much</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries {{from the early}} chess-like games played in India in the 6th century. For much of that time the rules have varied from area to area. The modern rules first took form in Italy during the 13th century, giving more {{mobility}} to pieces that previously had more restricted movement (such as the queen and bishop). Such modified rules entered into an accepted form during the late 15th century [...] or early 16th century [...] The basic moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. Pawns originally {{did not have the}} option of moving two squares on their first move and promoted only to a queen if they reached the eighth rank. The queen was originally the fers or farzin, which could move one square diagonally in any direction. In European chess it became able to leap two squares diagonally, forwards, backwards, or to left or right on its first move; some area also gave this right to a newly promoted pawn. In the Persian and Arabic game the bishop was a pīl (Persian) or fīl (Arabic) (meaning [...] "elephant") which moved two squares diagonally with jump [...] In the Middle Ages the pawn could only be promoted to the equivalent of a queen (which at that time was the weakest piece) if it reached its eighth rank [...] During the 12th century the squares on the board sometimes alternated colors, and this became the standard in the 13th century [...]|$|E
