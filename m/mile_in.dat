5|$|Motul de San José was {{occupied}} from the Middle Preclassic right {{through to the}} Early Postclassic. However, {{the height of the}} city's occupation was the Late Classic. Settlement density averages 250 structures per square kilometer (650 structures per square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> the site's monumental core, 125 structures per square kilometer (325 structures per square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> the city's suburban area and 79 structures per square kilometer (205 structures per square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> the site's periphery.|$|E
5|$|Although the Quiriguá elite {{were clearly}} Maya in ethnicity, the site {{lies on the}} {{southern}} periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, with ethnic Maya in a minority. The {{majority of the population}} belonged ethnically to the less complex Intermediate Area lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica. The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 12001600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km2 (3767 per square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> central Copán. The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.|$|E
5|$|More {{construction}} was funded {{in part by}} $1million from the Works Progress Administration; the airport expanded to fill the square <b>mile</b> <b>in</b> 1938–41 after a court ordered the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad to reroute tracks that had crossed the square along the northern edge of the older field.|$|E

5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, about a <b>mile</b> <b>in</b> breadth, and curving inland for {{a mile and}} a half, it is quite {{sheltered}} from all winds save the east, being flanked to the south and west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes.

5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 <b>mile</b> <b>in</b> 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.|$|E

5|$|Surveys have {{revealed}} {{an average of}} 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square <b>mile)</b> <b>in</b> the periphery. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion {{that appears to have}} occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 9001200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.|$|E

5|$|Before 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal <b>Mile</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh. The Treaty of Union, signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2009 a $2.5billion deal {{to privatize}} the airport via a 99-year lease fell through when the {{consortium}} could not put together financing.

The consortium operating {{under the name of}} Midway Investment and Development Company LLC consisted of Vancouver Airport Services, Citi Infrastructure Investors, and Boston's John Hancock Life Insurance. It was awarded the contract in October 2008 by the City Council, which voted 49–0 to approve it. The consortium would have operated the airport and collected airport parking, concession, and passenger facility charges. However, Chicago would have continued to provide fire and police services. Chicago privatized the Chicago Skyway in 2007. In 2010 a new slogan emerged calling the airport The busiest square <b>mile</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|E

While Foyt was uninjured, Franchitti's car left visible tire marks on Foyt's helmet. Foyt's crew was able to repair the car and get him back on the track where he completed enough laps to secure an 8th-place finish. The following week at the Meijer Indy 300, Foyt's crew gave him great pit stops which allowed him to take to lead with 10 laps remaining. Even though Foyt was passed a few laps later by Tony Kanaan and Scott Dixon, he managed to hold {{on the rest of the}} way and drive to a career-best 3rd-place finish, the first Top-5 finish of his career.

5|$|The decathlon was a {{relatively}} new event in modern athletics, although it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he could run the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the <b>mile</b> <b>in</b> 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds.

5|$|Up {{until the}} 1890s, the {{government}} had no presence in the far north-west of Canada. In 1894, the rise of gold mining and a growing population led to calls for Ottawa to intervene, both to control whiskey trading {{and to protect the}} local First Nations. In response, the mounted police carried out a survey along the Yukon River and gathered customs duties. Fears grew that the United States might try to seize the mineral-rich region, and a twenty-man police team was established at Forty <b>Mile</b> <b>in</b> 1895. Although there was very little actual crime, frictions soon rose between the police and the Miners' Committees, which had been created to provide informal justice during the previous few years. The police brought the issue to a head in June 1896, sending a team into one of the mining camps to overturn the decisions of the local committee.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived on}} the 8 <b>Mile,</b> <b>in</b> Royal Oak, in Rochester, and in the suburb Sterling Heights, Black grew up in {{and spent most of}} her life in various parts of Detroit, Michigan. Her mother is an accountant; her father was a hairstylist. He owned a hair salon and brought her along to fashion shows and photoshoots. Her parents {{separated}} when she was six years old. After her mother remarried, they moved from Royal Oak and settled in Rochester where she attended high school at Bishop Foley Catholic High School. At age fifteen, she was expelled for fighting and attended Rochester High School where she was also expelled, shortly after, for the same reason. Until the age of sixteen, when she was legally able to dropout, she feigned homeschooling. Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move, Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates, becoming an outcast. Her father died when she was sixteen. Black had taken part in national competitive dancing, taking jazz, hip-hop, tap, and ballet lessons, since she was young, and, at one point, was training to perform on Broadway. She also considered becoming a backup dancer. After being expelled from her last school, Black ran away from home. She started begging, doing drugs, and drinking while crashing at friends' houses at night. After going on tour with Armor for Sleep, she returned to Detroit and stopped taking drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second and}} third {{standards}} adjust the scale of distance and consider income to define a food desert.
