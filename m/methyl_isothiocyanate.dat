The anti-inflammatory activity of 1 a–h was investigated by acute carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice using the reference drug indomethacin.

This paper reports on a new fumigant formulation of 95 % ethyl formate plus 5 % <b>methyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> as an alternative fumigant for stored grains. Results: The formulation is stable for at least 4 months of storage at 45 °C.

40|$|Abstract—Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Ircinia contain high {{concentrations}} of linear furanosesterterpene tetronic acids (FTAs) and produce and exude low-molecular-weight volatile compounds (e. g., dimethyl sulfide, methyl isocyanide, <b>methyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate)</b> that give these sponges their characteristic unpleasant garlic odor. It has recently been suggested that FTAs are unlikely to function as antipredatory chemical defenses, and this function may instead be attributed to bioactive volatiles. We tested crude organic extracts and purified fractions isolated from Ircinia campana, I. felix, and I. strobilina at naturally occurring concentrations in laboratory and field feeding assays to determine their palata-bility to generalist fish predators. We also used a qualitative technique to test the crude volatile fraction from I. felix and I. strobilina and dimethylsulfide in labo-ratory feeding assays. Crude organic extracts of all three species deterred feeding of fishes in both aquarium and field experiments. Bioassay-directed fractiona-tion resulted in {{the isolation of the}} FTA fraction as the sole active fraction of the nonvolatile crude extract for each species, and further assays of subfractions sug...|$|E
40|$|Five {{field trials}} were {{conducted}} in Italy in 1983 and 1984 to test the efficacy of isazofos and benfuracarb in controlling Heterodera carotae on carrot, Ditylenchus dipsaci on onion, and Meloidogyne javanica on tomato. <b>Methyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (MIT) was tested against H. carotae and M. javanica. Single (10 kg a. i. /ha) and split (5 + 5 kg a. i. /ha) applications of isazofos gave yield increases of carrot and onion similar to those obtained with DD (300 liters/ha) and aldicarb (10 kg a. i. /ha). Population densities of H. carotae in carrot roots at harvest and of M. javanica in tomato roots 2 months after transplanting were also suppressed by isazofos. Benfuracarb (10 kg a. i. /ha increased onion yields in a field infested with D. dipsaci, {{but it was not}} effective against H. carotae or M. javanica. The efficacy of MIT at 400 and 600 liters/ha was similar to that of MIT + DD (Di-Trapex) at 300 liters/ha. Both nematicides inhibited hatch of H. carotae eggs and decreased the soil population density of M. javanica...|$|E
40|$|In this work, 5 -mercapto- 1 -methyltetrazole was {{studied by}} low {{temperature}} matrix-isolation and solid-state infrared spectroscopy, DFT(B 3 LYP) / 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) calculations and photochemical methods. In the low temperature neat solid phase and isolated in an argon matrix, the compound {{was found to}} exist in the 1 -methyl- 1, 4 -dihydro- 5 H-tetrazole- 5 -thione tautomeric form. The infrared spectra of the compound were fully assigned and correlated with structural properties. In situ UV-irradiation ([lambda]> 235  nm) of the matrix-isolated monomer is shown to induce different photochemical processes, all of them involving cleavage of the tetrazole ring: e. g. (1) molecular nitrogen expulsion, with production of 1 -methyl- 1 H-diazirene- 3 -thiol, which is produced in two different conformers; (2) ring cleavage leading to production of <b>methyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> and azide; (3) simultaneous elimination of nitrogen and sulphur with production of N-methylcarbodiimide. Following these photoprocesses, subsequent reactions occur, leading to production of methyl diazene, carbon monosulphide and nitrogen hydride. Spectroscopic evidence of the production of the above-mentioned chemical species is provided. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This {{memorandum}} supercedes {{an earlier}} memorandum evaluating the ground water contamination potential of fumigants (Dias and Clayton, 2007). Additional fumigants are analyzed in this memorandum and the irrigation amounts were increased from 0. 25 inches to 0. 4 inches. The Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) fumigant use regulations require post-application water treatments to reduce volatilization of the fumigants {{to the atmosphere}} (Title 3, California Code of Regulations [3 CCR], section 6447. 3, et seq.). An empirical model was developed to assess {{whether or not the}} proposed mitigation measures shifted potential contamination from the air to the ground water environment. The fate and transport of four registered fumigants–methyl bromide, chloropicrin, <b>methyl</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (MITC), and 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) –and three proposed fumigants–iodomethane, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and furfural–were evaluated in a leaching-vulnerable Fresno, California soil. To provide a worst-case scenario for potential ground water contamination, the model did not explicitly account for fumigant losses from sorption of the residues to the soil or by volatilization even though volatilization, especially, is well-known {{to be one of the}} primary routes of fumigan...|$|E
