50|$|Although Hefei was a {{quiet market}} town of only about 30,000 in the mid-1930s, its {{population}} grew more than tenfold in the following 20 years. The city's administrative role was strengthened by {{the transfer of the}} provincial government from Anqing in 1949, but much of its new growth derived from its development as an industrial city. A cotton mill was opened in 1958, and a thermal generating plant, using coal from Huainan, was established in the early 1950s. It also became the seat of an industry producing industrial chemicals and chemical fertilizers. In the late 1950s an iron and steel complex was built. In addition to a <b>machine-tool</b> <b>works</b> and engineering and agricultural machinery factories, the city has developed an aluminum industry and a variety of light industries.

The {{purpose is to}} develop the scientifically-methodological foundations of multifunctional monitoring of dynamical efficiency of machine tools {{at the expense of}} their certification, prediction and diagnostics of deviations of forming motions from the given ones and from the dimensional efficiency of parts. The mechanisms of dynamical interconnection of spatial elasto-dissipative subsystems of machine tool, cutting process and surface of part with regard to disturbances have been ascertained. The mathematical simulator of machine tool, the technique and the mathematical software of information-dynamical simulation and identification of spatial elasto-dissipative subsystems of machine tool, the analysis procedure of dynamic characteristics of machine tool in the contact point of tool and part with regard to its dimensions and to the non-uniformity of physicomechanical properties have been created. The simulator of cutting process as the dynamical connection has been refined. The construction technique of information simulators of diagnostics has been developed. The technique and the mathematical software of monitoring of dynamic properties of machine tool from the point of formation of dimensional efficiency of part have been created. The techniques and the algorithms of diagnostics of dimensional efficiency and kinematic disturbances have been developed. The study results as the monitoring systems of efficiency of machine tool functioning, state of cutting, dimensions of machined part and certification of machine tools have been introduced in practice. The application fields are the <b>machine-tool</b> <b>works,</b> the enterprises of common machine-building and instrument-making, the special design offices of metal-cutting machine tools.

While most regular <b>Work</b> Permit <b>holders</b> are relatively happy and healthy, our study finds that 62 per cent of injury and salary claim workers meet the screening conditions for a Serious Mental Illness. We find that the three main drivers of psychological distress are (1) the housing problems of injury and salary claim workers, (2) threats of repatriation against both injured and regular workers, and (3) agent fee debt. We recommend a range of policy options to address these problems, including alternative housing for injury and salary claim workers; delinking Work Permit holders’ visas and employment contracts; and regulation of offshore migration agents...|$|R

5000|$|The journal {{restarted}} on 10 May (23), 1917, {{its cover}} announcing {{that it was}} now {{a part of the}} central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party. Following the October 1917 Revolution, the magazine created a citywide awareness of the revolution. This was followed by the [...] "First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers" [...] in 1918 after which the tsarist government closed the magazine, and all members of the editorial board were jailed. Its publication was resumed in Moscow in January 1923. Ulyanova worked for the magazine at that time, but did not follow the instructions of her brother, Lenin, who by now was abroad, and she resisted efforts by Armand to make the magazine more theoretical. [...] "Ardent greetings to Rabotnitsa on the tenth anniversary of its existence. I wish it every success in training the masses of proletarian women {{in the spirit of the}} struggle for the complete triumph of socialism, in the spirit of carrying out the great behests of our teacher Lenin." [...] (Rabotnitsa, Joseph Stalin, 1933) [...] In 1926, the magazine published articles about a perceived male resistance to women entering metal and <b>machine-tool</b> <b>work</b> jobs, which were typically dominated by men. Within 10 years the magazine congratulated its readership, stating that women [...] "form more than one quarter of all metal workers and machine construction workers, and almost a quarter of all workers in the coal industry..." [...] In 1933, Joseph Stalin complemented the magazine with a personal greeting. A 1935 issue was on the topic of motherhood; in 1936, that was an article on narcotics easing labour pain; and in 1946, there was an article on new fabrics. For Rabotnitsa, the period between 1914 and 1944 has been described as [...] "the most dramatic and challenging years of its existence", when strong ties were maintained between the press and the political leadership of the country.|$|R

Economically, the country was up the creek. The miners had been on strike, along with the grave-diggers, the bakers and almost everybody else. I think people wanted something to cheer them up - and so did I. That's why I came up with the line 'Look to the future now, it's only just begun'.
