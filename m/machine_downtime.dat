40|$|The {{evolution}} in precision manufacturing {{has resulted in}} the requirement to produce and maintain more accurate machine tools. This new requirement coupled with desire to reduce <b>machine</b> tool <b>downtime</b> places emphasis on the calibration procedure during which the machine's capabilities are assessed. <b>Machine</b> tool <b>downtime</b> can be as much as 120 per hour and is significant for manufacturers because the machine will be unavailable for manufacturing use, therefore wasting the manufacturer's time and potentially increasing lead-times for clients. In addition to <b>machine</b> tool <b>downtime,</b> the uncertainty of measurement, due to the schedule of the calibration plan, has significant implications on tolerance conformance, resulting in an increased possibility of false acceptance and rejection of machined parts. Currently calibrations are planned based on expert knowledge and there are no intelligent tools aiding to produce optimal calibration plans. This thesis describes a method of intelligently constructing calibration plans, optimising to reduce <b>machine</b> tool <b>downtime</b> and the estimated uncertainty of measurement due to the plan schedule. This resulted in the production of a novel, extensible domain model that encodes the decision making capabilities of a subject expert. Encoding the knowledge in PDDL 2 requires the discretization of non-linear resources, such as continuous temperature change. Empirical analysis has shown that when this model is used alongside state-of-the-art automated planning tools, it is possible to achieve a reduction in <b>machine</b> tool <b>downtime</b> greater than 10...|$|R

50|$|The idea of cyber {{manufacturing}} mainly {{stems from}} the fact that Internet-enabled services have released great business values in economic sectors such as retail, music, consumer products, transportation, and healthcare. However, compared to existing Internet-enabled sectors, manufacturing assets are less connected and less accessible in real-time. Besides, current manufacturing enterprises make decisions following a top-down approach: from overall equipment effectiveness to assignment of production requirements, without considering the condition of machines. This will usually lead to inconsistency in operation management due to lack of linkage between factories, possible overstock in spare part inventory, as well as unexpected <b>machine</b> <b>downtime.</b> Such situation calls for connectivity between machines as a foundation, and analytics on top of that as a necessity to translate raw data into information that actually facilitates user decision making.

Each program of evaluation involved thorough test-ing of the raw cotton followed by the ring spin-ning of at least two yarns by the ring spinning route. The machinery used was of industrial size to emulate production conditions. The Small-Scale Spinning Test advocated by the USDA’s SRRC has been extended to include fabric manufacture, yet condensed by a need to conserve space that has required the elimi-nation of one drawframe from the sequence of machines employed.

In previous work, a method of intelligently constructing measurement plans demonstrated that it is feasible to optimise the plans either to reduce <b>machine</b> tool <b>downtime</b> or the estimated uncertainty of measurement due to the plan schedule.

The multi-objective search plans on average have a 3 % reduction in the time metric when compared to the downtime of the uncertainty optimised plan and a 23 % improvement in estimated uncertainty of measurement metric when compared to the uncertainty of the temporally optimised plan. Further experiments on a High Performance Computing (HPC) architecture demonstrated that there is on average a 3 % improvement in optimality when compared with the experiments performed on the PC architecture.
