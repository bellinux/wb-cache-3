5|$|Beads {{made from}} <b>meteoric</b> iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a {{signature}} of <b>meteoric</b> origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. <b>Meteoric</b> iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of <b>meteoric</b> iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E
5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of <b>meteoric</b> iron, though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in <b>meteoric</b> iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March Model was {{promoted}} to field marshal (Generalfeldmarschall). His <b>meteoric</b> rise from colonel to field marshal had taken just six years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Meteoric</b> nickel {{is found}} in {{combination}} with iron, {{a reflection of the}} origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's inner core.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt {{is found in}} the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural <b>meteoric</b> iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.|$|E
5|$|Earth has {{retained}} {{all of the}} noble gases that were present at its formation except helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from <b>meteoric</b> activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E
5|$|The {{story that}} the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's <b>meteoric</b> rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's {{sporting}} idol {{at the height of}} the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of nickel}} (as a natural <b>meteoric</b> nickel–iron alloy) has been traced {{as far back}} as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first {{isolated}} and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1–2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and pentlandite. Major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of <b>meteoric</b> origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk in Russia.|$|E
5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's <b>meteoric</b> rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.|$|E
5|$|Free cobalt (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of {{oxygen in the}} {{atmosphere}} and chlorine in the ocean. Oxygen and chlorine are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent the formation of native metal cobalt. Except as recently delivered in <b>meteoric</b> iron, pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on Earth (see below). Though the element is of medium abundance, natural compounds of cobalt are numerous. Small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.|$|E
5|$|While rejecting Danish authority, Olaf made it {{his mission}} to convert Norway and the Norse colonies in the west as quickly and as {{completely}} as possible. Proceeding with threats, torture and executions, Olaf broke down pagan resistance {{and within a few}} years Norway was, at least nominally, a Christian country. But King Olaf had acquired several enemies during his <b>meteoric</b> rise to power. The most prominent were Eirik Jarl, son of Haakon Jarl, and Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, both of whom felt that Olaf had deprived them of their share of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His <b>meteoric</b> rise over the {{previous}} years had made him some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E
5|$|Most helium on Earth is {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. in Natural Sources of Helium |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and <b>meteoric</b> iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The win {{continued}} Kiprop's <b>meteoric</b> rise of 2010 – a year {{in which}} he had gone from a low-profile circuit runner to the 10,000 metres Kenyan and African champion, with a sub-60 minute half marathon best after wins in Paris and Lille. Silver medallist Zersenay received some consolation as he was given the AIMS/Citizen World's Fastest Time Award days after the competition in respect of his position as world record holder, becoming only the second half marathon athlete to be selected for the accolade after Lornah Kiplagat. There were no surprise breakthroughs in the men's race as all the top performers were those predicted to make an impact before the race. However, there were some other achievements of note including: Kitwara's first individual medal for Kenya, personal bests for Birhanu Bekele and Tomoya Onishi in eighth and ninth place respectively, and (much further back in the field) a national record for Bhutanese racer Passang Passang.|$|E
5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the <b>meteoric</b> possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{increasingly}} {{became a}} significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the Republican National Committee. In 1884, {{he was elected}} a delegate to that year's Republican convention, where he served {{as chair of the}} Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a <b>meteoric</b> rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, {{as well as those of}} Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, Maine Senator James G. Blaine. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meteoric</b> iron, {{sometimes}} meteoritic iron, is {{a native}} metal found in meteorites and made from the elements iron and nickel mainly {{in the form of}} the mineral phases kamacite and taenite. <b>Meteoric</b> iron makes up the bulk of iron meteorites but is also found in other meteorites. Apart from minor amounts of telluric iron, <b>meteoric</b> iron is the only naturally occurring native metal of the element iron on the Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of iron smelting, <b>meteoric</b> iron was {{the only source of}} iron metal apart from minor amounts of telluric iron. <b>Meteoric</b> iron was already used before the {{beginning}} of the iron age to make cultural objects, tools and weapons.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of <b>meteoric</b> iron {{consists}} of taenite and kamacite. Taenite is a {{face centered cubic}} and kamacite a body centered cubic iron-nickel-alloy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meteoric</b> iron can be {{distinguished}} from telluric iron by its microstructure and perhaps by its chemical composition also, since meteoritic iron contains more nickel and less carbon.|$|E
25|$|The <b>meteoric</b> {{rise of the}} Kadava {{chieftain}} Kopperunchinga I {{also played}} a part in this war. Kopperunchinga imprisoned Rajaraja. Hoysalas again intervened and compelled Kopperunchinga to release the Chola king. Again the Cholas managed to survive with Hoysala help.|$|E
25|$|So, in {{a period}} just over 30 years, the early {{dramatic}} rise of nuclear power went into equally <b>meteoric</b> reverse. With no other energy technology {{has there been a}} conjunction of such rapid and revolutionary international emergence, followed so quickly by equally transformative demise.|$|E
25|$|Whitecourt crater in Alberta, Canada is {{estimated}} to be between 1,080 and 1,130 years old. The crater is approximately 36m (118ft) in diameter and 9m (30ft) deep, is heavily forested and was discovered in 2007 when a metal detector revealed fragments of <b>meteoric</b> iron scattered around the area.|$|E
25|$|Coals {{are from}} type III kerogen mostly derived from {{terrestrial}} plants, {{which should have}} a primary D/H signal sensitive to local <b>meteoric</b> water. Reddings et al. analyzed coals from various origins and found them randomly scatter across the range of -90‰ to -170‰. Rigby et al. found D contents decrease from -70‰ to -100‰ with increasing maturity in coal from Bass Basin and attributed this to latter exchange with low D water. Smith et al. studied H isotopes of coal samples from Antarctica and Australia. They found a strong negative correlation between δD and inferred paleolatitude. For coal samples originating from near equatorial regions, δD is around -50‰, while for those originating from polar regions, δD is around -150‰. This δD trend along latitude is consistent <b>meteoric</b> water trend and thus is an evidence that coals can preserve much of the original signals.|$|E
25|$|Aquifers {{that provide}} {{sustainable}} fresh groundwater to urban areas and for agricultural irrigation are typically {{close to the}} ground surface (within a couple of hundred metres) and have some recharge by fresh water. This recharge is typically from rivers or <b>meteoric</b> water (precipitation) that percolates into the aquifer through overlying unsaturated materials.|$|E
25|$|By the 10th century, the city's {{population}} was between 1.2million and 2million. Baghdad's early <b>meteoric</b> growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate, including relocations {{of the capital}} to Samarra (during 808–819 and 836–892), {{the loss of the}} western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids (945–1055) and Seljuk Turks (1055–1135).|$|E
25|$|Economic {{growth in}} the nineteenth century was not shared equally by the regions. Development and growth were {{concentrated}} in the Southeast. The South Region also achieved considerable development based on coffee and other agricultural products. The Amazon Basin experienced a <b>meteoric</b> rise and fall of incomes from rubber exports. The Northeast continued to stagnate, with its population living close to the subsistence level.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt to}} study at the Academy of Florence failed as the school was re-organizing at the time, so after {{returning}} to Paris from Florence, Sargent began his art studies with Carolus-Duran. The young French portrait artist, who had a <b>meteoric</b> rise, was noted for his bold technique and modern teaching methods, and his influence would be pivotal to Sargent {{during the period from}} 1874 to 1878.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{arriving}} at Mill Grove, {{he was one}} of those who witnessed the notable <b>meteoric</b> shower of November 13, 1833. With his father and other members of the family, Roswell was deeply interested in the message of William Miller, but did not identify himself with it, believing that when God would herald His second coming, the messengers would be observers of the seventh-day Sabbath.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} its early <b>meteoric</b> rise, church {{membership}} has declined {{over the past eight}} decades, according to the church's former treasurer, J. Edward Odegaard. Though the Church is prohibited by the Manual from publishing membership figures, the number of branch churches in the United States has fallen steadily since World War II. In 2009, {{for the first time in}} church history, more new members came from Africa than the United States.|$|E
25|$|Fresh-water aquifers, {{especially}} those with limited recharge by snow or rain, also known as <b>meteoric</b> water, can be over-exploited and depending on the local hydrogeology, may draw in non-potable water or saltwater intrusion from hydraulically connected aquifers or surface water bodies. This can be a serious problem, especially in coastal areas and other areas where aquifer pumping is excessive. In some areas, the ground water can become contaminated by arsenic and other mineral poisons.|$|E
25|$|King Narai's reign saw a major {{expansion}} of diplomatic missions {{to and from}} Western powers, most notably France, England, and the Vatican. Missions were also sent and received from Persia, India and China, {{as well as other}} neighbouring states. Another notable feature of Narai's reign was the unprecedented influence of foreigners at the Siamese court, embodied in the <b>meteoric</b> rise of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adventurer who would eventually hold the modern equivalent of the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} expedition {{arrived at the}} scene {{more than a decade}} after the event. In 1921, the Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik, visiting the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin as part of a survey for the Soviet Academy of Sciences, deduced from local accounts that the explosion had been caused by a giant meteorite impact. He persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the Tunguska region, based on the prospect of <b>meteoric</b> iron that could be salvaged to aid Soviet industry.|$|E
25|$|John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh PC (born 26 November 1937) is a British {{politician}} who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a <b>meteoric</b> rise {{through the ranks}} of government which culminated in him serving as Secretary of State for Social Services from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of the Conservative Party and a potential leadership contender.|$|E

25|$|Compared to {{the short}} {{appointments}} of his predecessors, Hu Zongxian remained in power until 1563. His longevity as supreme commander, and indeed his <b>meteoric</b> rise, were {{due in part to}} his association with Zhao Wenhua's clique. Zhao Wenhua was opposed to a strict enforcement of the maritime prohibitions like the ones carried out by Zhu Wan, and instead favoured opening trade as the means to solve the wokou problem. Hu Zongxian, in turn, carried out a policy of appeasement despite his subordinates' disapproval and the emperor's orders to capture Wang Zhi dead or alive.|$|E
