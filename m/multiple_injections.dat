The <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> ITC method of measuring OxOx activity involves continuous, real-time detection of the amount of heat generated (dQ) during catalysis, which is equal to the number of moles of product produced times the enthalpy of the reaction (ΔHapp).

40|$|A {{computational}} {{and experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> ports in a two-dimensional, convergentdivergent nozzle, for fluidic thrust vectoring. The concept of <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> ports was conceived to enhance the thrust vectoring capability of a convergentdivergent nozzle over that of a single injection port without increasing the secondary mass flow rate requirements. The experimental study was conducted at static conditions in the Jet Exit Test Facility of the 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex at NASA Langley Research Center. Internal nozzle performance was obtained at nozzle pressure ratios up to 10 with secondary nozzle pressure ratios up to 1 for five configurations. The computational study was conducted using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and linear Reynolds stress modeling. Internal nozzle performance was predicted for nozzle pressure ratios up to 10 with a secondary nozzle pressure ratio of 0. 7 for two configurations. Results from the experimental study indicate a benefit to <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> ports in a convergentdivergent nozzle. In general, increasing the number of injection ports from one to two increased the pitch thrust vectoring capability without any thrust performance penalties at nozzle pressure ratios less than 4 with high secondary pressure ratios.

40|$|Recent {{parallel}} systems use <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> {{ports and}} various injection policies, but {{little is known}} about their impact on network performance. This paper evaluates the influence that these injection interfaces have on maximum sustained throughput in adaptive cut-through torus networks by modeling the number of injection queues (1 or 4), and the allocation of new packets to those queues. Network evaluations for medium to large size 2 D tori show that designs with <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> ports do not improve performance under uniform traffic. On the contrary, they result in more pressure from the injection interface to acquire the scarce network resources of an already clogged system. Interestingly, for small networks, a single injection FIFO queue, with the HOLB it entails, indirectly provides the much needed injection control. For networks with thousands of nodes and <b>multiple</b> <b>injection</b> channels, as those being implemented in current massively parallel processors, this implicit form of congestion control is not enough. In such systems, restrictive injection policies are required to prevent routers from being flooded with new packets for loads beyond saturation. 1...|$|R

The combustion model takes into account: · transient evolution of fuel sprays, · interaction of sprays with swirl and walls, · evolution of near-wall flow formed after spray-wall impingement depending on impingement angle and swirl, fuel-air mixing, · interaction of near-wall flows formed by adjacent sprays, · evaporation conditions for different zones. In the model the fuel spray is divided {{into a number of}} zones with different evaporation conditions. The piston bowl is assumed to be a body of revolution of otherwise arbitrary shape. Submodels of soot and NOx formation are included. The model has been validated by experimental data obtained from high-speed and medium-speed engines over the whole operating range; a good agreement has been achieved without recalibration for different operating modes.
