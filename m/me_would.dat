5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked <b>me</b> <b>would</b> be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E

Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so that you might reign, ruling rather than serving others.|$|E

The challenge to <b>me</b> <b>would</b> be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write Oklahoma! for 2011?" [...] He has also said that, [...] "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was during}} one of Jackson's calls to Presley that he {{proposed}} marriage. [...] "If I asked you to marry <b>me,</b> <b>would</b> you do it?", the singer queried. Though still married to actor Danny Keough, whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with, Presley replied that she would. After a pause, Jackson exclaimed {{that he had to}} use the bathroom. Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{proposed}} to Presley {{over the telephone}} towards the fall of 1993, saying: [...] "If I asked you to marry <b>me,</b> <b>would</b> you do it?" [...] They married in the Dominican Republic in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards. The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active." [...] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image. The marriage ended {{less than two years}} later with an amicable divorce settlement. In a 2010 interview with Oprah, Presley said they had spent four more years after the divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up" [...] until she decided to stop.|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to <b>me</b> <b>would</b> be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E

500|$|On March 8, 2008, Bush vetoed H.R. 2082, a {{bill that}} would have {{expanded}} congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the United States Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations, saying that [...] "the bill Congress sent <b>me</b> <b>would</b> take away one of the most valuable tools in the War on Terror". In April 2009, the ACLU sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the Bush administration's interrogation tactics. One memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the CIA was far more intense than authorized by the Justice Department.|$|E
500|$|Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote [...] "The Way We Were" [...] while Marty Paich handled its production. In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light {{the corners of}} my mind / Misty watercolor memories {{of the way we}} were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise". In the beginning of {{what seems to be a}} bridge, she whispers, [...] "If we had the chance to do it all again / Tell <b>me</b> <b>would</b> we? Could we?".|$|E
500|$|Chappell's {{first book}} was {{an account of}} the 1972 Ashes tour, Tigers Among the Lions, {{followed}} by a series of books of cricketing humour and anecdotes published in the early 1980s. The more analytical The Cutting Edge, an appraisal of modern cricket, appeared in 1992. Ashley Mallett's biography, Chappelli Speaks Out (published in the UK as Hitting Out – the Ian Chappell Story) was written in collaboration with Chappell and released in 2005. It caused controversy due to Chappell's assessment of Steve Waugh, who he described as [...] "selfish" [...] and as a captain, [...] "ran out of ideas very quickly". Waugh responded by writing, [...] "to say Chappell's criticism irked <b>me</b> <b>would</b> be an understatement." [...] He categorised the criticisms as [...] "personal" [...] and noted that Chappell, [...] "always sweated on my blunders and reported them with an 'I told you so' mentality". In 2006, Chappell released an anthology of his cricket writings entitled A Golden Age. He is a regular contributor to Cricinfo.com.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If I asked you to marry <b>me,</b> <b>would</b> you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for <b>me</b> <b>would</b> be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|Critics mostly {{reacted with}} acclaim for the mash-up of [...] "I Feel Pretty / Unpretty". Gonzalez gave the {{performance}} an [...] "A" [...] and commented: [...] "While part of <b>me</b> <b>would</b> {{have said that}} pairing Rachel and Quinn for a duet would vocally be like putting a pit bull in a cage match with a Maltipoo, it actually worked! There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it was beautiful, and noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon {{felt that it was}} [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that reminds us of what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E

500|$|However, in his {{evaluation}} of The Secret Service as a whole, La Rivière {{argues that the}} premise of a secret agent masquerading as a priest while driving an antiquated car could not have appealed much to children, and that older viewers would have been disappointed with the series' unoriginal [...] "traditional espionage format". Ian Fryer concurs, writing in FAB magazine that [...] "very little about The Secret Service has obvious appeal to the traditionally young Supermarionation audience." [...] Discussing the opening theme music, he remarks that [...] "the younger <b>me</b> <b>would</b> have run a mile from any series which sounded like that." [...] He also notes that the opening credits [...] "broke with the tradition of having a thrilling or suspenseful promise {{of what was to}} come, and made the series look suspiciously like it might be about the life and work of an elderly vicar." [...] For La Rivière, the blending of puppetry and live action [...] "simply doesn't work. It requires more than the audience can give in terms of acceptance." [...] In the case of [...] "More Haste Less Speed", he points out that the character of Lady Hazlewell is portrayed in live-action distance shots by a stunt actor dressed in drag – an [...] "unintentionally hilarious moment that illustrates beautifully why the live-action inserts didn't work." [...] He further argues that the contrasting light levels of shots that alternate between one format and the other shatter the illusion of [...] "artificiality" [...] that previous series had been able to sustain in the absence of live action.|$|E

2500|$|Palin's {{status as}} a mother {{of a child with}} Down {{syndrome}} was initially a focus for some pundits and reporters during the 2008 elections.

The role of vice president, it seems to <b>me,</b> <b>would</b> take up an awful lot of her time, and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, a libel {{action was}} taken out by Shaw against a Jewish London {{newspaper}} which repeated the allegations made by Begin and the Irgun pamphlet.

About the allegation that he had {{said that he did}} not take orders from Jews, Shaw said: [...] "I would never have made a statement like that and I don't think that anyone who knows <b>me</b> <b>would</b> regard it as in character.
