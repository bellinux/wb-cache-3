25|$|Dimmers are devices used to {{vary the}} {{brightness}} of a light. By decreasing or increasing the RMS voltage and hence the <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> to the lamp {{it is possible to}} vary the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, a dimmer is specifically those devices intended to control lighting. Dimmers are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres, stages, dining rooms, restaurants, and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change. The dimmer was invented in 1892 by Granville Woods.|$|E
500|$|Mole crickets stridulate {{like other}} crickets by {{scraping}} the rear {{edge of the}} left forewing, which forms a plectrum, against the lower surface of the right forewing, which has a ratchet-like series of asymmetric teeth: the more acute edges face backwards, as do those of the plectrum. The plectrum can move forwards with little resistance; but moving it backwards makes it catch each tooth, setting up a vibration in both wings. The sound-producing stroke is the raising (levation) of the wings. The resulting song resembles the result of modulating a pure tone with a 66 Hertz wave to form regular chirps. In G. vineae, the wing levator muscle, which weighs 50 milligrams, can deliver 3.5 milliWatts of mechanical power; G. gryllotalpa can deliver about 1 milliWatt. G. vineae produces an exceptionally loud song from half an hour after sunset, continuing for an hour; it can be heard up to 600 metres away. At a distance of 1 metre from the burrow, the sound has a <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> over the stridulation cycle of up to 88 decibels; the loudest recorded peak power was about 92 decibels; at the mouths of the burrow, the sound reaches around 115 decibels. G. gryllotalpa can deliver a peak sound pressure of 72 decibels and a mean of about 66 decibels. [...] The throat of the horn appears to be tuned (offering low inductive reactance), making the burrow radiate sound efficiently; the efficiency increases when the burrow is wet and absorbs less sound. Mole crickets are the only insects that construct a sound-producing apparatus. Given the known sensitivity of a cricket's hearing (60 decibels), a night-flying G. vineae female {{should be able to}} detect the male's song at a range of 30 metres; this compares to about 5 metres for a typical Gryllus cricket that does not construct a burrow.|$|E

2500|$|The Tweedie {{convergence}} theorem {{provides a}} hypothetical {{explanation for the}} wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and 1/f noise.

[...] Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form.

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{scattering}} theory in water clouds has been studied. Alternative forms for Maxwell equations {{have been developed}} and discretized in order to calculate backscattered <b>mean</b> <b>powers</b> from cloud particles. With simplified discretized equations the backscattered electric field has been approximated for a single particle. This approximation of the electric field {{is the same as}} Rayleigh approximation used in meteorological literature. The discretized equations have been implemented in computer code to calculate backscattered power from particles inside a small box, located in the far field of radar. In current radar approach, incoherent Rayleigh approximation is used as the standard scattering theory to retrieve cloud properties. To validate this theory the correlation between particles has been studied. In order to study the influence of inter-particle displacement on correlation between particles, a new idea has been deployed to create turbulence among particles. For different turbulence settings the randomness of the medium has been quantified by the real part of the correlation matrix. In the last chapter both exact and incoherent Rayleigh backscattered <b>mean</b> <b>powers</b> from particles have been calculated. It has been shown that Rayleigh backscattered <b>mean</b> <b>powers</b> are good approximation for uncorrelated particles and both are distributed normally around the same mean value. In case of correlated particles the exact backscattered <b>mean</b> <b>powers</b> have shown to be distributed lognormally. Depending on the degree of correlation their distribution shifts from lognormal to normal, respectively for highly correlated and uncorrelated particles. With statistical results it has been concluded that for correlated water cloud particles, the exact backscattered <b>mean</b> <b>powers</b> will be smaller than the incoherent approximation.

This leads to characterise the eigenchannels of N × N MIMO channels with N larger than 14, showing that the smallest eigenchannel distributes as a Rayleigh channel, the next four eigenchannels closely distributes as Nakagami-m channels with m = 4, 9, 25 and 36, and the N – 5 remaining eigenchannels have statistics similar to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel within 1dB signal-to-noise ratio. It is also shown that 75% of the total <b>mean</b> <b>power</b> gain of the MIMO SVD channel goes to the top third of all the eigenchannels.|$|E
