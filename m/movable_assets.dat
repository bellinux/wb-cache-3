30|$|In the UK {{there is}} the {{so-called}} foreclosure, which could {{be defined as a}} debt enforcement procedure aimed at recovering money owed to secured creditors (Djankov et al. 2008). Derived from the above definition we must directly rule out a direct legal equivalence between foreclosure and ejecución oracción hipotecaria. That is, we must be very specific when using these terms. Therefore, we should “translate” ejecución de un bien mueble pignorado (acción pignoraticia) as a foreclose on a pledged <b>movable</b> <b>asset</b> under UK Law. Then, if the property is an immovable asset (e.g. a building, a plant, the entrepreneur’s home), we could use the term “mortgage over land and buildings” foreclosures {{in the case of an}} execution (acción hipotecaria in Spain). In the main text we simplify the terminology and, for brevity of exposition, we use the term mortgage foreclosure.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the uncertificated securities in the context of financial law. Proper and prudential legal regulation of the securities is considered to be key element of efficient financial markets of which the importance for the economics is systematically growing in past few decades. From the beginning, financial markets were dominated by certificated securities represented by legal fiction incorporating rights arising from the security into a certificate and considering this certificate as a tangible <b>movable</b> <b>asset.</b> In the consequence of the development of financial markets and securities trading uncertificated securities were developed to make transfers of the securities and asset management feasible. Uncertificated securities can be defined as substitutable physical securities incorporating private rights which are prerequisite for the exercise and transfer of those rights and which are replaced by a record entered in the central register of securities, mainly central securities depositories. The form of the uncertificated securities determines the necessity of their special legal regulation taking into account their legal nature and connected legal aspects of record keeping. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse relevant Czech legislation and highlight both [...] ...|$|R

Measurements {{of air pollution}} and climate inside and just outside of microclimate frames with and without paintings in 12 museum sites and 1 frame making company in Europe have been performed. It was shown that levels of volatile organic acids should also be considered, and this is currently being followed up in the new MEMORI project. The MEMORI project, “Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on <b>Movable</b> Cultural <b>Assets.</b> Innovative Research for Market Transfer”, is implemented within the EU 7 th Framework Programme. The project started on November 1, 2010 and has a duration of 36 month. The aim of the MEMORI project is to provide the conservation market with innovative, non destructive, early warning technology for easy assessment of environmental impact on indoor cultural heritage. In addition a preventive strategy to secure the conservation of <b>movable</b> cultural <b>assets</b> in protective enclosures has been developed. Also, the current pollution situation and management of perhaps materials emitting unsuitable or corrosive gases were explored. In addition, correlations between the expenses for collection care (preventive conservation; monitoring of the environmental conditions (T/RH/HV); pollutant measurement (airborne pollutants and dust/particles/soiling) and the possible influencing factors were analyzed. For this propose univariate and bivariate frequency distributions were used.
