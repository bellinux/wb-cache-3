5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree</b> with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{prominent}} {{position in}} the incense trade, Yemen attracted settlers from the fertile crescent.

5|$|The Incense Route {{served as}} a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods.

5|$|In his Fabulae, written around 1 A.D. Hyginus {{states that}} King Cinyras of Assyria had a {{daughter}} by his wife, Cenchreis. The daughter was named Smyrna and the mother boasted that her child excelled even Venus in beauty. Angered, Venus punished the mother by cursing Smyrna {{to fall in love}} with her father. After the nurse had prevented Smyrna from committing suicide, she helped her engage her father in sexual intercourse. When Smyrna became pregnant, she hid in the woods from shame. Venus pitied the girl's fate, changing her into a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree,</b> from which was born Adonis.|$|E

25|$|Hatshepsut's {{delegation}} {{returned from}} Punt bearing 31 live <b>myrrh</b> <b>trees,</b> {{the roots of}} which were carefully kept in baskets {{for the duration of}} the voyage. This was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her mortuary temple complex. Egyptians also returned with a number of other gifts from Punt, among which was frankincense. Hatshepsut would grind the charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first known}} voyage to Punt {{occurred}} in the 25th century BC under the reign of Pharaoh Sahure. The most famous expedition to Punt, however, comes {{during the reign of}} Queen Hatshepsut probably around 1495 BC, as the expedition was recorded in detailed reliefs on the temple of Deir el-Bahri at Thebes. The inscriptions depict a trading group bringing back <b>myrrh</b> <b>trees,</b> sacks of <b>myrrh,</b> elephant tusks, incense, gold, various fragmented wood, and exotic animals. Detailed information about these two nations is sparse, and there are many theories concerning their locations and the ethnic relationship of their peoples. The Egyptians sometimes called the Land of Punt, [...] "God's-Land", due to the [...] "large quantities of gold, ivory, and myrrh that could be easily obtained".|$|R
500|$|Myrrha (Greek: [...] ), {{also known}} as Smyrna (Greek: [...] ), {{is the mother of}} Adonis in Greek mythology.

Although the tale of Adonis has Semitic roots, it is uncertain from where the myth of Myrrha emerged, though it was likely from Cyprus.|$|E
500|$|That Myrrha is {{transformed}} into a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree</b> has also been interpreted to have influenced the character of Adonis.

500|$|In {{the poem}} Venus and Adonis, written by William Shakespeare in 1593 Venus refers to Adonis' mother. In the 34th stanza Venus is lamenting because Adonis is {{ignoring}} her approaches {{and in her}} heart-ache she says [...] "O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind, She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind." [...] Shakespeare makes a subtle reference to Myrrha later when Venus picks a flower: [...] "She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears, Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears." [...] It {{has been suggested that}} these plant juices being compared to tears are a parallel to Myrrha's tears being the drops of myrrh exuding from the <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hatshepsut's chancellor, royal {{architect}} Senenmut {{oversaw the}} construction of the temple. [...] Although the adjacent, earlier mortuary temple of Mentuhotep was used as a model, the two structures are nevertheless significantly different in many ways. Hatshepsut's temple employs a lengthy, colonnaded terrace that deviates from the centralised structure of Mentuhotep’s model - an anomaly that may be caused by the decentralized location of her burial chamber. There are three layered terraces reaching 29.5 metres (97 ft) tall. Each story is articulated by a double colonnade of square piers, {{with the exception of the}} northwest corner of the central terrace, which employs Proto Doric columns to house the chapel. These terraces are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens with foreign plants including frankincense and <b>myrrh</b> <b>trees.</b> [...] The layering of Hatshepsut's temple corresponds with the classical Theban form, employing pylons, courts, hypostyle hall, sun court, chapel and sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|Commiphora myrrha, called myrrh, African myrrh, herabol myrrh, Somali myrrhor, common myrrh, or gum <b>myrrh</b> is a <b>tree</b> in the Burseraceae family.

500|$|During Sahure's {{time on the}} throne, Egypt had {{important}} {{trade relations}} with the Levantine coast. Sahure launched several naval expeditions to modern day Lebanon to procure cedar trees, people (possibly slaves) and exotic items. He also ordered the earliest attested expedition {{to the land of}} Punt, which brought back large quantities of myrrh, malachite and electrum. Sahure is shown celebrating the success of this venture in a relief from his mortuary temple which shows him tending a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree</b> in the garden of his palace named [...] "Sahure's splendor soars up to heaven". This relief is the only one in Egyptian art depicting a king gardening. Sahure sent further expeditions to the mines of turquoise and copper in Sinai. He also possibly ordered military campaigns against Libyan chieftains in the Western Desert, bringing back livestock to Egypt.|$|E
500|$|Sahure's {{mortuary}} {{temple was}} extensively decorated {{with an estimated}} [...] of fine reliefs [...] Many surviving fragments of the reliefs which decorated the temple walls are of very high quality and much more elaborate than those from preceding mortuary temples. Several reliefs from the temple and causeway are unique in Egyptian art. These include a relief showing Sahure tending a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree</b> in his palace {{in front of his}} family, a relief depicting brown bears and a relief showing the [...] bringing of the pyramidion to the main pyramid and the ceremonies following the completion of the complex. The many reliefs of the mortuary and valley temples also depict, among other things, a counting of foreigners by or in front of the goddess Seshat and the return of an Egyptian fleet from Asia, perhaps Byblos. Some of the low relief-cuttings in red granite are still in place at the site. Decorated reliefs from {{the upper part of the}} causeway represent the procession of over 150 personified funerary domains created for the cult of Sahure, demonstrating the existence of a sophisticated economic system associated to the king's funerary cult.|$|E

50|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} version is recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, where Adonis {{is the son of}} Myrrha and her father Cinyras. Myrrha turned into a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree</b> and Lucina helped the tree to give birth to Adonis.|$|E

5000|$|Abrahams informs that “With {{regard to}} the Tabernacle incense, most {{scholars}} agree that the term 'stacte' is of Latin and Greek origin, and that stacte represents myrrh." [...] A.

5000|$|That Myrrha is {{transformed}} into a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree</b> has also been interpreted to have influenced the character of Adonis.

50|$|Alternatively {{the late}} source Bibliotheke calls him {{the son of}} Cinyras and Metharme.

50|$|The central myth in its Greek telling: Smyrna, {{daughter}} of Theias, king of Assyria, conceives a child by him through trickery. Theias finds out and {{is determined to}} kill her, when the gods intervene and turn her into a <b>myrrh</b> <b>tree.</b> Nine months later, the baby Adonis {{comes out of the}} tree.

Aphrodite sheltered Adonis as a new-born baby and entrusted him to Persephone, who was also taken by Adonis' beauty and refused to give him back to Aphrodite.
