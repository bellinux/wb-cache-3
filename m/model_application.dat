50|$|For {{input to}} the model, the spatial data is encoded {{primarily}} in two input files: {{the control and}} bathymetry files. These files are geo-referenced. The temporal data is encoded in many files, each file representing a set of time-varying boundary conditions, for example, meteorological data for surface heat exchange and wind shear, or inflow rates for a tributary stream. Each record in the boundary condition files is stamped with a year-month-day-hour-minute address. The data can be subjected to quality assurance procedures by using GEMSS to plot, then to visually inspect individual data points, trends and outliers. The set of input files and the GEMSS executable constitute the <b>model</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

Mutant properties that are generated from the initial properties (or test cases) and validated by the model checker should be considered as new properties that have been missed during the initial verification procedure. Therefore, adding these newly identified properties to the existing list of properties improves the coverage metric of the formal verification and consequently lead to a more reliable design.|$|E

Application firewalls work much like a packet filter but application filters apply filtering rules (allow/block) on a per process basis instead of filtering connections on a per port basis.

Many semiconductor vendors supply IBIS models and many EDA vendors sell IBIS-compliant software tools. In 1995 the IBIS Open Forum teamed with the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA). IBIS version 2.1 was the first version released by the new alliance. It added the ability to simulate ECL and PECL buffers as well as differential lines. IBIS 3.2 allows for a package model description along with an electrical board description. IBIS Version 5.0 was ratified by the IBIS Open Forum on August 29, 2008.
