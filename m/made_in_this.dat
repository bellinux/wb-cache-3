5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
5|$|Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime {{minister}} and provincial governor, wrote an encyclopaedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled Sivatattva Chintamani. This work is {{an account of the}} life of Basavanna, the progenitor of the faith, and hundreds of his followers, making it valuable material for students of the Lingayat movement. Numerous references are <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> work to the capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote Nurondusthala (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote vachana poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called shatsthala). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of King Saluva NarasimhaI, Adrisappa (Praudaraya Charitra), Bommarasa (Soundara Purana), Kallarasa (Janavasya), Chaturmukha Bommarasa (Revanasiddhesvara Purana), Suranga Kavi (Trisashti Puratanara Charitre), and Nilakanthacharya (Aradhya Charitra), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.|$|E
5|$|The design—effectively a {{frame for}} two scenes {{depicted}} through Rayner Hoff's marble reliefs and bronze statues—shows the prelude and the epilogue to war, depicting both {{the willingness of}} youth to answer {{the call of duty}} and the extent of the sacrifices which they <b>made.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this,</b> the work is not displaying a material victory, but instead a victory of the spirit. At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann, president of the Returned Soldiers' League, bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine, on which are listed the names of all South Australians who died during the Great War.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|To {{protect the}} UERL group's income, its {{chairman}} Lord Ashfield lobbied {{the government for}} regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> direction, with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor (later MP and Minister of Transport) Herbert Morrison {{at the forefront of}} debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC's tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area. The Board was a compromise– public ownership but not full nationalisation– and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were liquidated.|$|E
