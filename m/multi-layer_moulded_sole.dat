50|$|The British Army {{introduced}} the DMS (Direct <b>Moulded</b> <b>Sole)</b> ankle boot in 1958. This had a <b>moulded</b> plastic <b>sole</b> and was externally {{similar to the}} World War Two Ammo Boot. However, as the leather was of shoddy quality at best, the boots leaked {{and could not be}} made satisfactorily water-resistant. The low sideless tongue also allowed water to get in {{over the top of the}} foot. Once water had got into the boot, it would evaporate through the top of the boot but not through the plastic sole, thereby keeping the foot wet and accelerating trench-foot. Although mesh insoles were issued to combat this, they were themselves fragile and could lead to 'burning' of the sole of the foot, with the result that most soldiers used commercially available sports-shoe insoles instead. This type of boot continued in service until the mid-1980s, after its unsatisfactory characteristics became a matter of public concern owing to the severe cases of trench-foot incurred during the Falklands War. The DMS boot was worn with anklets or wind-around puttees.|$|R

40|$|One {{solution}} for attaching soles on footwear is to inject them {{directly into the}} upper part using moulds with unique cavities.

In the case of small manufacturers, injection moulds wear out morally long before they wear out physically. This paper will present some design solutions for moulds that have reusable parts that can be used from one sole design to another, without changing the entire mould. Using these <b>moulds,</b> <b>soles</b> design can be modified by interchanging some modules which are fitted into the main mould cavities.

40|$|Design {{methods of}} soles and <b>soles</b> {{injection}} <b>moulds</b> must be accurate, timely {{and at the}} same time, accessible to a wide category of <b>soles</b> and injection <b>moulds</b> designers and manufacturers. For designing <b>soles</b> and injection <b>moulds</b> for <b>soles,</b> various dedicated CAD/CAM systems have been developed, such as: Delcam Shoe Solution (3 D), Delcam PowerSHAPE-e (2 D and 3 D), Padsy II (2 D) and Padsy III (3 D), Shoemaster System (2 D and 3 D), Lectra System (2 D and 3 D), Parmel System (2 D) and ATOS II System (3 D). These systems are equipped with colour displays, plotters, digitizers, terminals and other equipment dedicated for computer aided design activities. Designing 3 D soles models using computer systems enables the prevention of ambiguities inherited from 2 D drawings, thus reducing errors and remanufacturing. Depending on the design complexity of soles, the technical means available for copying shoe soles and the technologies at the disposal of the soles manufacturers, <b>soles</b> and injection <b>moulds</b> designers adopt various design methods. Not all CAD/CAM systems are accessible for all users, because often their purchasing costs are high. Design method developed and presented in this paper, uses Delcam PowerSHAPE software program, which has the advantage that it can be accessed free of charge from the manufacturer's website.

30|$|PU soles are a {{combination}} of polyol with isocyanate, although, for production {{it may also be}} necessary to apply additives, in particular catalysts and pigments. After mixing these substances, a reaction occurs which enables synthesis of the polyurethane compound. This mixture is made and then immediately subjected to injection moulding, allowing to <b>mould</b> a <b>sole</b> in the desired shape. This type of sole is characterized by its durability, high resistance to wear, light weight, abrasion-resistance, ease to pigment, good thermal insulation, good flexibility at low temperatures and excellent resistance to oils. As a thermosetting material it does not soften when exposed to heat. All these ualities allow the manufacture of good quality shoes [3]. The PU soles have wide application in sports shoes, safety shoes, men’s and women footwear that require a boldest design, among others.|$|R

40|$|Soccer {{consists}} {{of many different}} types of sports specific movement. The present level of understanding of non-linear motion is negligible yet required if improvements are to be made in technique and performance of such actions. This thesis aimed to establish mechanisms for non-linear motion relevant to soccer performance. Preliminary analysis of curvilinear motion involved electromyographical analysis in selected muscles of the lower extremity at different grades of curvature. Results revealed adaptation of temporal muscle activity at the tightest grade of curvature. Adaptation occurred in both legs, but predominantly the outside leg, with increased duration of activity after footstrike (Smith et al., 1997). Stride kinematics were also altered, as increasing curve severity gave reduced stride length and increased stride frequency. Foot contact time was not changed as a function of curvilinear motion (P > 0. 05), giving an increased proportion of the stride cycle in the stance phase. Rear foot contact time increased as a function of curve severity (P $ 0. 05). To describe and quantify adaptation of lower limb movement in curvilinear motion, three-dimensional kinematics were used. Subjects (n = 8) wore soccer footwear on natural turf. Ranges of motion at the lower extremity were increased at the faster of the two velocities tested (4. 4 and 5. 4 ms·] ± 5 %), yet tended to reduce with curve severity. The inside leg displayed more differences in angular displacement with curve severity, and the ankle joint showed to be a key adaptive site. Ground reaction forces of two consecutive footfalls were performed on natural turf to assess relative contributions of the two limbs during straight and curvilinear motion at a 5 m radius. Total force over two footfalls was greater during straight motion. A mechanism of lowered centre of gravity during curvilinear motion was proposed. During curvilinear motion the outside leg was associated with greater force values in all three planes, displaying a greater contribution to curvilinear motion. Force measurements on natural turf were used to assess different sole configuration during three soccer specific moves. A modern <b>moulded</b> <b>sole</b> was found to be associated with greater maximum friction, also lower vertical ground reaction forces during a Cruyff turn and lower overall forces during the shot. This thesis established biomechanical adaptations and suggested mechanisms during non-linear motion in the soccer player. The research represented the first experimental investigations in this area and therefore recommendations for future study are considered...|$|R

Through the development of this solutions was aimed the increasing of the exploitation efficiency of the available moulds and decreasing of the time needed and costs of production for new sole models. Experiments have shown that the moulds with modular cavities can be manufactured faster and with smaller costs then the moulds with unique cavities.

30|$|Rather {{than being}} related to “contrived collegiality”, teacher leading can be {{generated}} through action research collaborations built from the ground up. It is based on, and develops through, genuine shared meaning-making and capacity building (Kemmis et al. 2014; Salo and Rönnerman 2013; Rönneman 2012) which facilitates a multidimensional culture of relational trust (Edwards-Groves et al. 2016). Relational trust between participants and facilitators is commonly argued as being a central condition for generating professional learning communities and making possible the kind of leading required for professional change and action (Bryk and Schneider 2003; Cranston 2011) in preschool settings (Thornton and Cherrington 2014). Building {{on the work of}} Bryk and Schneider, Cranston connects the success of learning communities with the notion of trust, which is articulated as ‘being relational in its orientation and developed around group norms of safety, risk-taking, and change orientation’ (2011, pp. 59). Grootenboer et al. (2015 b) go further to explain that relational trust is apparent in five realms: interpersonal, intersubjective, interactional, intellectual and pragmatic. These realms form critical conditions for site-based change of the nature described in this article. Although the middle leaders in this study were asked to lead their colleagues it was their primary position in the school as a teacher (e.g. 4  h was allocated for planning and leading the dialogues) that prefigured the more sustainable building of collective knowledge in teams.

40|$|My PhD work {{thesis is}} divided in two sections, {{the first one}} is an {{academic}} part and the second one is an industrial part. The first part of my thesis represents a contribution to the program of the research group of the Department of Organic Chemistry of the University of Camerino, that has for a long time been studying the cerium chemistry and has dedicated itself particularly to the study of new methodologies involving the use of system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O with NaI. In many trials good results have been achieved and the procedures developed are characterized not only by the efficiency of the reactions, but also by chemoselective processes, by a good stereochemical control, by reacting available and inexpensive reagents and in some cases, from the possibility of recovering the catalytic promoter system used through simple procedures of work-up. One of the objectives of the modern organic synthesis concern the substitution of the chemical processes that use substances dangerous for the environment with eco-friendly methodologies. The system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O-NaI is inexpensive, non-toxic, very stable when exposed to water and air, it is able to work under solvent-free conditions and it can be recycled. This means that it is an excellent catalyst in various reactions, contributing in this way to the development of green chemistry, in response to the problem of environmental pollution caused by the difficulty eliminating of the organic solvents. This also means the development of new strategies for the synthesis of natural substances and unnatural with important biological activities, it represents a field of remarkable interest and in continuing development in organic chemistry. In the academic part of this work, we are employed about the synthesis of (+) -Furanomycin, specifically we proposed a new short synthesis of a useful intermediate, a 1, 2 -diprotected 2 -amino-pent- 4 -ene- 1, 3 -diol, starting from the inexpensive natural amino acid L-serine, and via a Gamer-type aldehyde. In the last part, that is completely different, is performed in Goldenplast spa. This company is located in Potenza Picena (MC) and it works in the manufacturing of polymer blend for footwear market and grain as infill in artificial turf. Goldenplast spa was founded in 1993 by Germano Ercoli, the managing director, Gianni Perozzi, the technical manager and Massimo Vallesi, the sales manager, with the scope of thermoplastic, SBS compounds production. The production started in 1994. The scope of Goldenplast spa is to provide footwear industry with solutions for <b>moulding</b> applications of <b>soles.</b> During its activity, in fact, Goldenplast spa has periodically created and introduced on the market new materials which has opened to customers new work opportunities and new markets.
