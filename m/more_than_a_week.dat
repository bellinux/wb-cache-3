5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains {{impacted}} the same area for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E

5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E

Nor were any boats off ports of Japanese-held Formosa, despite <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week's</b> warning of impending hostilities.

5|$|The loop itself still exists, {{although}} it was penetrated by a bomb and flooded during the Blitz in the Second World War. Fortunately, the loop had been sealed off years before.

The blockage was removed after little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> once the crisis had passed.
