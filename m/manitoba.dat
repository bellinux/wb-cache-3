5|$|A {{native of}} {{what would become the}} {{province}} of Ontario, May moved to <b>Manitoba</b> soon after completing education in his hometown. In <b>Manitoba,</b> he would take to briefly farming, before entering into the construction industry, which he would establish prominence in. After doing work for the railway, he would move to Winnipeg where he would join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings. After moving west and living briefly in Carberry, <b>Manitoba,</b> May came to Edmonton in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal peoples have {{inhabited}} {{what is now}} <b>Manitoba</b> {{for thousands}} of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived in the area when {{it was part of}} Rupert's Land and owned by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1869, negotiations for the creation of the province of <b>Manitoba</b> led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The rebellion's resolution led to the Parliament of Canada passing the <b>Manitoba</b> Act in 1870 that created the province.|$|E
5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, <b>Manitoba</b> {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of <b>Manitoba</b> was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of <b>Manitoba</b> appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of <b>Manitoba</b> (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
50|$|Doer {{has often}} {{referred}} to hydroelectric power as playing {{a major role in}} <b>Manitoba's</b> long-term economic strategy, and has advocated a national east-west power grid to export <b>Manitoba's</b> plentiful hydroelectric power to Ontario and other provinces in Western Canada.|$|R
5000|$|In 1871, <b>Manitoba's</b> {{parliamentary}} opposition agitated for {{the removal}} of Provincial Secretary Alfred Boyd. When this opposition became impossible to ignore, he resigned. In withdrawing from office, Boyd suggested that someone from <b>Manitoba's</b> [...] "mixed-blood" [...] community be called to cabinet in his place (<b>Manitoba's</b> government was balanced along ethnic, religious and linguistic lines in this period, but British [...] "mixed-bloods" [...] had been left out of the first cabinet). Norquay was accordingly called to serve as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Agriculture.|$|R

5|$|English and French are the {{official}} languages {{of the legislature}} and courts of <b>Manitoba,</b> according to §23 of the <b>Manitoba</b> Act, 1870 (part of the Constitution of Canada). In April 1890, the <b>Manitoba</b> legislature attempted to abolish {{the official}} status of French, and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re <b>Manitoba</b> Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).|$|E
5|$|Like all Canadian provinces, <b>Manitoba</b> {{is governed}} by a unicameral {{legislative}} assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of <b>Manitoba,</b> {{the head of the}} executive branch. The head of state, Queen ElizabethII, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of <b>Manitoba,</b> who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that <b>Manitoba</b> has a duly constituted government.|$|E

5|$|Modern-day <b>Manitoba</b> was {{inhabited}} by the First Nations people {{shortly after the}} last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest about 10,000 years ago; the first exposed land was the Turtle Mountain area. The Ojibwe, Cree, Dene, Sioux, Mandan, and Assiniboine peoples founded settlements, and other tribes entered the area to trade. In Northern <b>Manitoba,</b> quartz was mined to make arrowheads. The first farming in <b>Manitoba</b> was along the Red River, where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Public {{schools in}} <b>Manitoba</b> {{fall under the}} {{regulation}} of one of thirty-seven school divisions within the provincial education system (except for the <b>Manitoba</b> Band Operated Schools, which are administered by the federal government). Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English. There are sixty-five funded independent schools in <b>Manitoba,</b> including three boarding schools. These schools must follow the Manitoban curriculum and meet other provincial requirements. There are forty-four non-funded independent schools, which {{are not required to}} meet those standards.|$|E

5|$|Southern <b>Manitoba</b> (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern <b>Manitoba,</b> though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern <b>Manitoba,</b> is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern <b>Manitoba.</b> This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} hard in Western Canada, including <b>Manitoba.</b> The {{collapse of the}} world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The <b>Manitoba</b> Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of <b>Manitoba</b> (NDP), was founded in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Manitoba</b> Schools Question {{showed the}} deep {{divergence}} of cultural {{values in the}} territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of <b>Manitoba,</b> but a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the <b>Manitoba</b> legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked {{the federal government for}} support; however, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{resulted in}} the creation of the Province of <b>Manitoba</b> (inclusive of Fort Garry) and a delay in establishing governance in the Territories. In 1870, the Northwest Territories and <b>Manitoba</b> formally entered the Canadian confederation. The two jurisdictions remained partially conjoined: under the Temporary Government Act, 1870. The Temporary North-West Council was appointed in 1872, mainly from members of the new <b>Manitoba</b> Legislative Assembly, with the Lieutenant Governor of <b>Manitoba</b> serving as the leader of the territorial government. The Governor and Council were mandated to govern the Territories through the <b>Manitoba</b> Act and did so from outside of the Northwest Territories. Fort Garry served as the first seat of government for both jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{universities}} in <b>Manitoba,</b> {{regulated by the}} Ministry of Advanced Education and Literacy.

The Université de Saint-Boniface, established in 1818 and now affiliated with the University of <b>Manitoba,</b> is the oldest university in Western Canada. Brandon University, formed in 1899 and located in Brandon, is the province's only university not in Winnipeg.|$|E
