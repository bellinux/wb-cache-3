40|$|Melon is an {{important}} agricultural and economic vegetable crop worldwide. The genetic male sterility mutant (ms- 5) has a recessive nuclear gene that controls the male sterility germplasm. Male sterility could {{reduce the cost of}} F 1 seed production in melon, but heterozygous fertile plants should be removed before pollination. In this study, bulked segregant analysis combined with specific length amplified fragment sequencing was applied to map the single nuclear male sterility recessive gene. A 30 -kb candidate region on chromosome 9 located on scaffold 000048 and spanning 2, 522, 791 to 2, 555, 104 bp was identified and further confirmed by cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence markers based on parental line resequencing data and classical mapping of 252 F 2 individuals. Gene prediction indicated that six annotated genes are present in the 30 -kb candidate region. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed significant differences in the expression level of the LOC 103498166 ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) gene in male-sterile lines (ms- 5) and male-fertile (HM 1 - 1) lines during the 2 -mm (tetrad) and 5 -mm (the first pollen <b>mitosis)</b> <b>periods,</b> and negative regulation of the AMS candidate gene transcription factor was also detected. Sequencing and cluster analysis of the AMS transcription factor revealed five single-nucleotide polymorphisms between the parental lines. The data presented herein suggest that the AMS transcription factor is a possible candidate gene for single nuclear male sterility in melon. The results of this study will help breeders to identify male-sterile and -fertile plants at seeding as marker-assisted selection methods, which would reduce the cost of seed production and improve the use of male-sterile lines in melon...|$|R

40|$|Cultured {{epidermal}} {{cells of}} albino guinea pigs were studied autoradiographically {{to determine the}} lengths of the G 1 (gap preceding DNA synthesis), S (DNA synthesis), G 2 (gap following DNA synthesis and immediately preceding cell division), and M (<b>mitosis)</b> <b>periods</b> of the cell cycle. The epidermal cells were grown in vitro using a chamber culture technique. Skin slices containing dermis and epidermis were surgically removed from the ear and then incubated for ten minutes in a trypsin solution to remove the underlying dermis. The cells were teased apart and cultured in Fischer's Medium supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum and a penicillin-streptomycin mixture. 3 H-thymidine was added at t = 0 to make a final concentration of 0. 21 μc/ml (s. a. 3. 0 c/m mole). Progress in the cycle was monitored hourly by stopping growth in {{a portion of the}} chambers. Coverglasses with cells attached were then prepared for autoradiography. Kodak AR- 10 Stripping Film was used. Development was performed seven days after exposure began. One thousand cells on each slide were scored to determine the percentage of cells labeled, labeled cells in mitosis, and the percentage of labeled and unlabeled cells in metaphase. From this data, the total length of the cell cycle was found to be approximately 15 hours; G 2 was minimally 3 hours; S lasted approximately 5. 4 hours; the duration of the M phase was. 4 hours; and G 1 was 6. 2 hours long. A marked increase in DNA synthetic activity was noted at 7 to 8 hours. Partial synchrony of the cell population was thought to be achieved upon removal of the ear tissue from the guinea pig. This apparent synchrony supports the proposal that cells in G 1 prior to injury are directed to synthesis when removal occurs and suggests that the real control of the cell cycle may lie in the G 1 period...|$|R

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of {{actively}} growing mammalian cells has been divided into four phases (I) which include the following: <b>mitosis</b> (M); the <b>period</b> between <b>mitosis</b> and DNA synthesis (GI); DNA synthesis (S); and the period from S to mitosis (G 2). While S and G 2 apparently bear a relatively constant relationship to each other, G is highly variable (2) and is undetectable in cells from some lower organisms (3 - 7). On the other hand, all cultured mammalian cells thus far studied have a detectable G 1 (2).

40|$|Cellular {{proliferation}} of newly hatched chickens was depressed by starving them for 2. 5 to 3. 5 days. Starvation may hold proliferative cells {{in different parts}} of the cell cycle. In order to find where in the cell cycle these cells are held, the animals were fed and the following events were measured as a function of time after the start of feeding: (1) the mitotic index, and (2) the DNA synthetic index (number of cells in DNA synthesis 1 hour after injection of H 3 -thymidine). The duration of the cell's DNA synthetic period (S) was measured, permitting a more exact description of the cell cycle. Analysis of the duodenal and esophageal epithelia shows that feeding initiates cell division by stimulating cells from the G 1 part of the mitotic cycle in the duodenum. In the esophagus some of the cells were either stopped or slowed down in G 1, and another group of cells in G 2. Feeding simultaneously stimulates both cell groups; the former moves into S, the latter into <b>mitosis.</b> The S <b>period</b> in starved animals is a little longer than that in normally fed animals but the extension can be attributed to a slightly decreased body temperature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Regulation of {{the major}} {{transitions}} in the cell cycle, such as G 1 /S, G 2 /M, and metaphase to anaphase, are increasingly well understood. However, we have a poor understanding of the timing of events within each phase of the cell cycle, such as S phase or early mitosis. Two extreme models of regulation are possible. A “regulator-controlled model” in which the order of events is governed by the activation {{of a series of}} cytoplasmic regulators, such as kinases, phosphatases, or proteases; or a “substrate-controlled model” in which temporal regulation is determined by the differential responses of the cellular machinery to a common set of activators. Results: We have tried to distinguish between these two models by examining the timing of both biochemical and morphological events in Xenopus egg extracts during mitosis. Several proteins respond with different delays to the activation of Cdc 2. We have found that the timing of phosphorylation is largely unchanged when these proteins are exposed to extracts that have been in <b>mitosis</b> for various <b>periods</b> of time. Similarly, when Xenopus interphase nuclei are added to extracts at different times after the G 2 /M transition, they undergo all the expected morphological changes in the proper sequence and with very similar kinetics. Conclusions: Our results suggest that during early mitosis (from prophase to metaphase) the timing of biochemical events (such as phosphorylation) and morphological events (such as structural changes in the nucleus) is at least partly controlled by the responses of the substrates themselves to a common set of signals...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{dynamics}} near grazing for {{a model of}} an atomic force microscope in tapping mode and a model of cell cycle <b>mitosis.</b> In particular, <b>period</b> one behavior is studied near grazing points corresponding to tangential contact with the discontinuity surface used to initiate capillary interactions in a tapping mode AFM model. Two different discontinuity mapping analysis methods are developed and applied to this AFM model. The discontinuity mapping analysis predicts {{the existence of a}} branch of period one solutions emanating from the grazing point. In addition, the analysis predicts that one eigenvalue of a suitable Poincaré map approaches minus infinity as the varied parameter approaches its grazing value. The second, more general, method is then applied to a model of cell cycle mitosis at two grazing points corresponding to trajectories that have tangential contact with the discontinuity surface used to trigger a halving of the cell mass. Again, the analysis predicts a branch of period one solutions emanating from the grazing point, and an eigenvalue whose magnitude grows without bounds as the grazing point is approached in parameter space. In the case of both the AFM model and the cell cycle model, predictions produced using the discontinuity mapping analysis are shown to agree with results produced using numerical continuation. In addition, we remark on the limitations of the discontinuity mapping analysis and provide suggestions for future work. Specifically, we identify a family of attractors that exist for the AFM model and that warrant further investigation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlow cytometry {{analysis}} of the cell-cycle progression was performed in Sf 9 cells infected withAutographa californicanucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) in the cultures partially synchronized by aphidicolin exposure and deprivation. Cells infected with AcNPV during the G 1 phase progressed and were arrested in the S phase in the 4 h following the infection, whereas cells infected during the S phase did not progress past the S phase. Cells infected during the G 2 /M phase remained in the G 2 /M phase without <b>mitosis</b> during a <b>period</b> of 10 h. Such cell-cycle arrest was also observed in the cells infected with ts 8, a temperature-sensitive mutant of AcNPV that is defective in both genomic DNA synthesis and late gene expression. Cells with > 4 N DNA content accumulated in the cultures infected with wild-type AcNPV, whereas no such cells appeared in the cultures infected with ts 8, suggesting that viral origin of the DNA overaccumulated in the cells with > 4 N DNA content. This was confirmed by the slot blot hybridization experiments, which showed that viral DNA, but not cellular DNA, increased strikingly in Sf 9 cells during the infection with AcNPV. These results indicate that AcNPV targets at least two different checkpoints to prevent normal cell-cycle progression of Sf 9 cells and that neither viral DNA replication nor expression of viral late genes is a necessary prerequisite for such AcNPV-induced cell-cycle arrest. It is suggested that the cell-cycle arrest in AcNPV-infected Sf 9 cells is an event triggered early in infection by specific interaction of viral gene products with cellular components that regulate cell-cycle progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{progress}} through the eukaryotic cell division cycle is driven by an underlying molecular regulatory network. Cell cycle progression {{can be considered as}} a series of irreversible transitions from one steady state to another in the correct order. Although this view has been put forward some time ago, it has not been quantitatively proven yet. Bifurcation analysis of a model for the budding yeast cell cycle has identified only two different steady states (one for G 1 and one for mitosis) using cell mass as a bifurcation parameter. By analyzing the same model, using different methods of dynamical systems theory, we provide evidence for transitions among several different steady states during the budding yeast cell cycle. Results By calculating the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of kinetic differential equations we have determined the stability of the cell cycle trajectories of the Chen model. Based on the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues, the cell cycle can be divided into excitation and relaxation periods. During an excitation period, the cell cycle control system leaves a formerly stable steady state and, accordingly, excitation periods can be associated with irreversible cell cycle transitions like START, entry into mitosis and exit from <b>mitosis.</b> During relaxation <b>periods,</b> the control system asymptotically approaches the new steady state. We also show that the dynamical dimension of the Chen's model fluctuates by increasing during excitation periods followed by decrease during relaxation periods. In each relaxation period the dynamical dimension of the model drops to one, indicating a period where kinetic processes are in steady state and all concentration changes are driven by the increase of cytoplasmic growth. Conclusion We apply two numerical methods, which have not been used to analyze biological control systems. These methods are more sensitive than the bifurcation analysis used before because they identify those transitions between steady states that are not controlled by a bifurcation parameter (e. g. cell mass). Therefore by applying these tools for a cell cycle control model, we provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} dynamical transitions in the underlying molecular network. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mitosis</b> is the <b>period</b> of {{the cell}} cycle during which the {{duplicated}} genome is equally partitioned into two daughter cells. This is accomplished by the alignment of paired sister chromatids in metaphase and the accurate segregation of sisters in anaphase. The faithful alignment and segregation of chromosomes relies on the assembly of cytoskeletal elements into the bipolar mitotic spindle, the productive attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores on each chromosome, and the focusing and anchoring of microtubule bundles at spindle poles. Errors in these various aspects of mitosis have severe consequences with regards to embryonic development, cellular viability, and tumorigenesis. Disruption of kinetochore function leading to reduced microtubule attachment and decreased checkpoint signaling results in the gain or loss of whole chromosomes (aneuploidy), which is a hallmark of cancer. However, whether aneuploidy is a cause or effect of tumorigenesis has remained untested since it was first suggested {{as an agent of}} carcinogenesis more than 100 years ago. Heterozygosity for the microtubule-binding, kinetochore localized, kinesin-like motor protein, CENP-E, results in the development of aneuploidy in cultured cells and in vivo in the absence of additional genomic instability. A variety of studies presented here, using CENP-E heterozygous animals, demonstrate that elevated rates of chromosome segregation errors act in a context dependent manner to either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis. At the opposite end of spindle microtubules, the poles, the requirement for microtubule associated cross-linking proteins in establishing and maintaining normal spindle structure has remained unclear. Construction and analysis of a conditional, loss-of- mitotic-function allele of the microtubule binding, coiled -coil protein NuMA, in mice and in cultured primary cells demonstrates that NuMA is an essential mitotic component. NuMA makes distinct contributions to the establishment and maintenance of focused spindle poles. When NuMA function is disrupted, centrosomes provide initial focusing activity, but continued centrosome attachment to bi-polar spindles under tension, and maintenance of focused kinetochore-fibers at spindle poles require NuMA's microtubule binding capacity. Without centrosomes and NuMA function, spindle microtubule focusing completely fails to become established. Thus, microtubule-tethers at kinetochores and spindle poles are essential components for normal progression through mitosi...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mitosis</b> is the <b>period</b> of {{the cell}} cycle during which the {{duplicated}} genome is equally partitioned into two daughter cells. Cells accomplish this feat by condensing their chromosomes into compact units that are aligned and segregated by the cytoskeleton. This process requires correct attachment of sister chromatids to the dynamic mitotic spindle. Attachment errors have severe consequences {{and can lead to}} developmental defects, cell death, and cancer. The molecular machine responsible for making attachments between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle is the kinetochore. Composed of over 60 proteins, the kinetochore serves as the attachment interface between chromosomes and microtubules and monitors its' own attachment status. The coupling of these two functions provides a mechanism to delay cell division until all sister chromatids are properly attached to the mitotic spindle, ensuring their correct segregation. While the functions of the kinetochore have long been appreciated, the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Studies presented here, which utilize the biochemical and genetic amenability of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reveal a specific attachment between the centromeric DNA and microtubules that is mediated by two conserved proteins Bir 1 /Survivin, and Sli 15 /INCENP. These proteins are of particular interest for their multiple roles in cell division and their potential use as cancer therapy targets since both are over-expressed in several types of cancer. The Bir 1 /Survivin-Sli 15 /INCENP mediated attachment is not responsible for making "core attachments" between kinetochores and microtubules, but instead functions to regulate the conserved kinase, Ipl 1 / Aurora B. Ipl 1 /Aurora B, Sli 15 /INCENP, and Bir 1 /Survivin are known collectively as the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) and over a decade of work has revealed that they are important for regulating kinetochore attachments, presumably by recognizing the amount of tension felt by sister chromatids when they are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. The discoveries described in Chapter 2 has led to the hypothesis that this Bir 1 /Survivin-Sli 15 / INCENP mediated attachment is sensing tension directly to regulate Ipl 1 /Aurora B, which in turn regulates attachments. This model forms the basis for work presented in Chapter 3, which explores the molecular mechanisms of how the Bir 1 /Survivin-Sli 15 /INCENP mediated CEN-DNA linkage regulates and is regulated by Ipl 1 /Aurora...|$|R

This period corresponds to the cell cycle length of neural stem cells at that age (Takahashi et al., 1995). In addition, we compared the number of cortical cells between adult N-syndecan knockout and wild-type mice {{and the number of}} BrdU-labeled cells at the age of E 18 (labeling age E 15). There was no difference in the average cell density or in the number of BrdU + cells in the cerebral cortex between N-syndecan knockout and wild-type mice at any observed age (Table S 1). Previously, we have shown that HB-GAM inhibits FGF- 2 activity on neural stem cells possibly by competing with its binding to HS (Hienola et al., 2004), but the current findings (Table S 1) indicate that N-syndecan is not the required HS carrier in neural stem cells. We collected BrdU-injected knockout and wild-type E 15 embryos 14 h after the BrdU injection and counted the number of BrdU/ β-III–tubulin double-positive cells in the area below subplate. In the wild types, 33. 8 ± 4. 0 % of the all BrdU-positive cells expressed β-III–tubulin as well. In knockouts, the amount of these cells was 31. 1 ± 5. 2 %. This result suggests that the N-syndecan knockout neurons obtain the neuronal phenotype around the same time and at the similar frequency as the wild-type neurons. At P 1, we observed the cells in the CP and estimated 92. 0 ± 2. 8 % of all BrdU-positive cells to be β-III–tubulin expressing as well.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU for CHECHAPTER 1 - POSTULATION OF PROBLEM, PURPOSE, METHOD AND PROGRAM OF STUDY: 1. Postulating {{the problem}} - The {{following}} problematical questions are investigated in this study:- a. Are there specific skills {{in which the}} trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome child is inferior to and/or more improved than other trainable mentally retarded groups? b. To what extent can the Down's Syndrome children participate in the same training program when grouped together? c. In which skills do Down's Syndrome children show the greatest train= ability? d. Is there a remarkable inferiority or progress in social competence, when compared with trainable Down's Syndrome and other trainable children in the training centre? 2. Aim of study - The following aims have been set for this study: a. to discover in which skills Down's Syndrome children have the great test inferiority and in which skills they show the greatest possibility of improvement. This means {{the question of the}} trainability of the Down's Syndrome child; b. to discover the grouping criteria which are used to classify the child with Down's Syndrome and all the other trainable children in the training centre; c. the criteria used by the different centres to promote a trainable child to the following class or group; d. to set a theoretical framework for a training program, which is based on the findings in this study, for trainable Down's Syndrome children; e. to find out what training facilities are available to the trainable Down's Syndrome child and to make some recommendations in this context. 3. Study method - In this study the descriptive method is used. The setting of a theoretical framework about the existing knowledge on the trainable Down's Syndrome child in the training centres is based on the following:- a. Study of literature: The most reliable sources of literature on the topic of this study are found in research results of American and British researchers; b. Empirical research: Questionnaires were sent to all the training centres in the Republic to collect information about the inferiority and/or progress in certain skills in Down's Syndrome children, grouping criteria and training programs for them. The program of study is set out in the last part of chapter 1. CHAPTER 2 - CONCEPTUALIZATION IN GENERAL: The following impediment categories were discussed {{in the first part of}} the chapter: motor, sensory, behaviouristic, mental and emotional impediments. The most important points of discussion are the concepts: educability and trainability of mentally retarded children. In the second part of this chapter the concepts: education ("opvoeding"); instruction ("onderwys”); training ("opleiding"); educability (“opvoedbaarheid”); trainability ("opleibaarheid") and untrainability (“onopleibaarheid") are discussed. 1. Educable and trainable mentally retarded - The Mentally Retarded Children's Act (Act No. 63 of 1974) refers to the child in the special class and special school as the educable mentally retarded and the child who is certified as uneducable as the trainable mentally retarded. The child in the institution is referred to as the untrainable mentally retarded. 2. Educability - Educability refers to the child's ability to gain from scholastic activities such as writing, reading and arithmetic and to transfer these skills with insight to practical situations. 3. Trainability - The trainable mentally retarded child's cognitive processes are concrete operational and cannot reach the abstract stage. Trainability therefore implies the possibility of making progress in the following skills: self-help, communication, socialization and occupation. 4. Untrainability - The child's inability to progress from the skills named in par. 3 and to succeed in adaptation to the social environment characterise the untrainable child who receives custodial care in an institution. CHAPTER 3 - DOWN 1 S SYNDROME OR MONGOLISM: In comparing a few terms: Mongolism, Unfinished child, Acromicria, G 1 -Trisomy and Downs’ Syndrome, the latter is preferable, because it prevents a stigma which is sometimes attached to the syndrome and it also gives the syndrome a scientific dignity. 1. Etiology of Down’s Syndrome: 1. 1 Endogenic factors - The possibility of studying chromosomal behaviour through the developments of new cytologic techniques leads to the study of the cell nucleus in the metaphase of <b>mitosis</b> during which <b>period</b> an exact counting of the chromosomes and observations on their structural patterns is possible. Through two methods: tissue and peripheral blood culture studies three subtypes of Down’s Syndrome are distinguishable:- a. Trisomy 21 : This condition is the result of a faulty division of the 21 -chromosome pair. The child with trisomy Down’s Syndrome has three, rather than the normal two chromosomes in pair 21. b. Translocation: Children with translocation Down’s Syndrome have an extra number 21 - chromosome which has broken and become attached to the same or another chromosome pair. A parent can carry a translocation without showing any symptoms of disease because the parent still carries the correct amount of genetic material, although some of it is out of place (translocated). c. Mosaicism: A child with mosaic Down's Syndrome has 46 chromosomes in some cells and 47 in other cells of his body. 1. 2 Exogenetic factors - Disfunctioning of the Pituitary and Thyroid glands causes a hormonal maladjustment in the mother during pregnancy, which can result in the birth of a Down's Syndrome child. Research has shown that a high percentage of Down's Syndrome children have been born from mothers between 30 and 45 years of age. Bad health and a shortage of vitamine A during pregnancy can also cause Down's Syndrome. 2. Clinical diagnosis at birth: Although Down's Syndrome cannot be diagnosed only by a few clinical features without a cytogenetic investigation, these features are especially visible in the first years of life of the Down's Syndrome child. The following physical stigmata are very prominent: hypotonia, disorders in the growth of the skull, a short nose with a flat bridge, anomalies of the palate, a small oral cavity with a protruding fissured tongue, abnormally small teeth, slanting eyes, speckling of the iris, anomalies of the external ears, one rather straight line crosses the palm of the hand instead of the two curved lines of the normal hand, an abnormal space between the first and second fingers and toes, a congenital heart defect and malformed sexual organs. In the last part of this chapter the typical developmental traits of the Down's Syndrome child from birth to approximately 6 years of age are discussed. CHAPTER 4 - CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DOWN'S SYNDROME CHILD'S PERSONALITY: Firstly in this chapter the mental development of the Down's Syndrome child is discussed. The conclusion is reached that the intellectual development is as characteristic as the slow motory development and that the quality of his intelligence is different in comparison with other trainable mentally retarded children. A significant connection between physical, stigmata and intelligence could not be found, The next discussion is devoted to the connection between subtype of Down's Syndrome and intelligence. Although several researchers found that the mosaic Down's Syndrome child has a higher intelligence than the other two subtypes, insufficient research has been done in this field. It has been found that 95 % of all Down's Syndrome children are cheerful, but about 5 % are stubborn. Social competence and mimicry lend themselves par excellence in training this child. Language development is discussed to show the Down's Syndrome child's inferiority in this characteristic. In the last part of this chapter it is pain= ted out that the Down’s Syndrome child is also backward in motory and sensory development. CHAPTER 5 - DIMENSIONS OF MENTAL RETARDATION IN DOWN'S SYNDROME: The differentiation between educable and trainable mentally retarded children is discussed in chapter 2. I. Q. -groups between 0 and 80 are discussed here to put the Down's Syndrome child in the mental hierarchy:- 1. Educable mentally retarded (I. Q. 50 - 80) - The educable mentally retarded child can't keep up the pace with the normal school program and has thus been placed in a special class or special school. Although there are Down's Syndrome children who are educable they still have great problems in mastering scholastic, motory and speech skills and non-visual tasks. 2. Trainable mentally retarded (I. Q. 30 - 50) - Although the child in the training centre is uneducable in scholastic skills, progress has been seen in the following skills: self-help, communication, socialization and occupation. 3. Untrainable mentally retarded (I. Q. 0 - 30) - The child who is retarded to such a degree that he can't see to his own needs and safety, must receive custodial care in an institution. CHAPTER 6 - THERAPY AND DOWN'S SYNDROME: This chapter deals with the following therapeutic programs:- 1. Medicinal therapy: a. Thyroid treatment has a positive effect in improving the dry skin, thick rippled tongue, coarse voice and sluggishness. b. Vitamine B 12 must be administered with other medicaments to stimulate growth in the Down's Syndrome child. c. Pituitary-hormone treatment stimulate this gland to release growth hormones. 2. Music therapy: An outstanding characteristic of the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome child is his receptivity for rhythm and music. This therapeutic medium must be used by parents and teachers to stimulate the gross motor co-ordination and auditory acuity of the Down's Syndrome child. 3. Speech therapy: language development is the trainable mentally retarded Down's Syndrome child's greatest inferiority. His ability for mimicry is the starting point for acquiring speech skills. The daily therapy sessions must include blowing•, sucking• and chewing exercises to better tongue and|$|R
