5|$|<b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the {{families}} of those lost in the Challenger disaster. The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E

500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Robin's {{death on}} 20 May 2012, Beyonc√© remarked: [...] "The Bee Gees were an early {{inspiration}} for me, Kelly Rowland and Michelle. We loved their songwriting and beautiful harmonies. Recording their classic song, 'Emotion' {{was a special}} time for Destiny's Child. Sadly we lost Robin Gibb this week. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> his brother Barry {{and the rest of}} his family.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Japan Today had {{reported}} that, by 2010, Japan {{would become a}} signatory of the convention. [...] However, this report later proved to be inaccurate. [...] The 2009 election saw the Democratic Party of Japan gain power. Yukio Hatoyama stated in an interview, <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the fathers and mothers. There are cases of mothers as well. We support ratifying and enforcing the Hague Convention, and involved in this is a sweeping change to allow divorced fathers visitation of their children. That issue affects not just foreign national fathers, but Japanese fathers as well. I believe in this change.|$|E
60|$|The sad little {{procession}} was now {{entering the}} old graveyard {{at the rear}} of the Mission. I could hear the sobs of the mourners, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the poor mother, garbed in faded mourning, bowed with both grief and labor.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to Nada as {{she stood}} in the moonlight, one forsaken, not having where to lay her head, Nada, who alone was left alive of all my children. I motioned to Umslopogaas to hide himself in the shadow, and stepped forward.|$|R

2500|$|In December 2007, Norwood's {{attorney}} Blair Berk {{stated that}} the Los Angeles City Attorney determined Norwood should not be charged with any [...] "crime relating to the accident back in 2006." [...] In May 2009, Norwood stated, [...] "The whole experience did completely change my life, and I can say that I think I'm a better person from it. You know, I still don't understand all of it and why all of it happened, but I definitely have a heart, and <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> everyone involved.

6000|$|... "Look at that {{pleasant}} person. There he is--Echt Deutsch--if anything ever was. Look at my son there! Do {{you see the}} two of them {{engaged in}} mortal combat? The thing's too ridiculous. The world grows sane. They may fight in the Balkans still; in many ways the Balkan States are in the very rear of civilisation; but to imagine decent countries like this or Germany going back to bloodshed! No.... When I see Rendezvous keeping it up and keeping it up, I begin to see just how poor Germany must be keeping it up. I begin to realise how sick Germany must be getting of the high road and the dust and heat and the everlasting drill and restraint.... <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the South Germans. Old Manning here always reminds me of Austria. Think of Germany coming like Rendezvous on a Sunday morning, and looking stiffly over Austria's fence. 'Come for a good hard walk, man. Keep Fit....'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to {{this young}} nobleman. Handsome he was, as a picture. And {{he knew better}} than most of your fine gentlemen how to put a check on his inclinations. As a friend he had few equals, his purse being ever at the command of those he loved. And his privations on Fox's account were already greater than many knew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} could not be {{expected}} to know anything of my feelings for you," [...] said Olive, [...] "and perhaps it is very well you did not, for business is business, and the feelings of girls {{should not be allowed to}} interfere with it. But <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to you all the same. You were my first love." ...|$|R
60|$|Abouthis, lost Abouthis! <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> toward thee! For the {{day comes}} when the desert sands shall fill thy secret places! Thy Gods are doomed, O Abouthis!

I weep--I weep tears of blood: for mine is the sin that brought about these evils and mine for ever is their shame.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not {{sufficiently}} democratic," [...] answered the policeman, [...] "but {{you were right}} when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business. I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate. But this new movement of ours {{is a very different}} affair. We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals. We remember the Roman Emperors. We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance. We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal. We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher. Compared to him, burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men; <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> them. They accept the essential ideal of man; they merely seek it wrongly. Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. But philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession. Bigamists respect marriage, or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy. But philosophers despise marriage as marriage. Murderers respect human life; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives. But philosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other people's." ...|$|E
6000|$|I can't {{tell you}} with what tender sympathy your rather disconcerting little news inspires me nor how <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you. Alack, alack, {{how we do}} have to pay for things--and for our virtues and grandeurs and beauties (even as you are now doing, overworked hero and model of {{distinguished}} valour,) as well as for our follies and mistakes. However, you have on your record exactly that mistake of too generous a sacrifice. Fortunately you have been pulled up before you have quite chucked away your all. It must be deuced dreary--yet if you ask me whether I think of you more willingly and endurably thus, or as your image of pale overstrain haunted me after you had left me at the New Year, I shall have no difficulty in replying. In fact, dearest Gaillard, and at the risk of aggravating you, I like to keep you a little before me in the passive, the recumbent, the luxurious and ministered-to posture, and my imagination rings all the possible changes on the forms of your noble surrender. Lie as flat as you can, and live and think and feel and talk (and keep silent!) as idly--and you will thereby be laying up the most precious treasure. It's a heaven-appointed interlude, and cela ne tient qu'√† vous (I mean to the wave of your white hand) to let it become a thing of beauty like the masque of Comus. Cultivate, horizontally the waving of that hand--and you will brush away, for the time, all responsibilities and superstitions, and the peace of the Lord will descend upon you, and you will become {{as one of the most}} promising little good boys that ever was. Apr√®s quoi the whole process and experience will grow interesting, amusing, tissue-making (history-making,) to you, and you will, after you get well, feel it to have been the time of your life which you'd have been most sorry to miss. Some five years ago--or more--a very interesting young friend of mine, Paul Harvey (then in the War Office as Private Sec. to Lord Lansdowne), was taken exactly as you are, and stopped off just as you are and consigned exactly to your place, I think--or rather no, to a pseudo-Nordrach in the Mendips. I remember how I sat on just such a morning as this at this very table and in this very seat and wrote him on this very paper in the very sense in which I am no less confidently writing to you--urging him to let himself utterly go and cultivate the day-to-day and the hand-to-mouth and the questions-be-damned, even as an exquisite fine art. Well, it absolutely and directly and beautifully worked: he recula--to the very limit--pour mieux sauter, and has since saut√©'d so well that his career has caught him up again.... Your case will have gone practically quite on all fours with this. I am drenching you with my fond eloquence--but what will you have when you have touched me so by writing me so charmingly out of your quiet--though ever so shining, I feel--little chamber in the great Temple of Simplification? I shall return to the charge--if it be allowed me--and perhaps some small sign from you I shall have after a while again. I came up from L.H. yesterday only--and shall be in town after this a good deal, D.V., through the rest of this month and April and May. At some stage of your mouvement ascensionnel I shall see you--for I hope they won't be sending you up quite to Alpine Heights. Take it from me, dear, dear G., that your cure will have a social iridescence, for your acute and ironic and genial observation, of the most beguiling kind. But you don't need to [...] "take" [...] that or any other wisdom that your beautiful intelligence now plays with from any other source but that intelligence; therefore be beholden to me almost only for the fresh reassurance that I am more affectionately than ever yours, ...|$|E
