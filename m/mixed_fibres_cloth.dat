The Co 3 O 4 hybrid structure on CFC showed interesting electrochemical performance in both alkaline and organic electrolytes when used as electrodes for symmetric supercapacitors. Compared to conventional alkaline electrolytes, the fabricated symmetric cell in organic electrolyte has delivered {{a high rate}} and cyclic performance. A supercapacitor made from this hierarchical hybrid architecture showed a maximum specific capacitance of 4. 8 mF cm- 2 at a constant density of 3 mA cm- 2 in organic electrolyte. In terms of energy and power, the symmetric supercapacitor conveyed an energy density of 4. 2 mW h cm- 3 with a power density of 1260 mW cm- 3. Also, the device exhibited reasonable tolerance for mechanical deformation under bended conditions demonstrating {{the flexibility of the}} materials. The impressive electrochemical activity is mainly attributed to their high surface area (60. 3 m 2 g- 1) resulting from their nano/mesoporous structure; reasonable electrical conductivity resulted from binder-free and intimate metal oxide/substrate integration and superior flexibility of the carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloth.</b> Thereby, it was concluded that the direct growth of the Co 3 O 4 nanostructure on CFC is a promising electrode for the advanced flexible energy storage devices regardless of the electrolyte...|$|R

Differences in ATPase characteristics distinguish Type I and Type II fibres histochemically. In this study, ATPase activity of myosin from muscles of several species with known histochemical and contractile properties has been determined {{to test the hypothesis}} that (1) myosin ATPase activity, (2) histochemical determination of fibre types and (3) maximum shortening velocity, all provide equivalent estimates of contractile properties in muscles of <b>mixed</b> <b>fibre</b> types. Maximum shortening velocity appears to be proportional to ATPase activity as expected from previous reports by Barany. However, both myosin ATPase and the maximum shortening velocity exhibit curvilinear relationships to the fraction of cross-sectional area occupied by Type II fibres.

Current engineering design is increasingly sophisticated, requiring more efficient material utilisation; sub-system mass and volume are crucial application determinants. This dissertation contributes to the fabrication of composites that can store electrical energy and are known as structural supercapacitors. The key in the fabrication of structural supercapacitors was not simply to bind two disparate components together, but to produce a single coherent material that inherently performed both roles of a structural composite and a supercapacitor. This design approach is at a relatively early stage, and faces significant design and material synthesis challenges. Disparate material requirements, such as structural and electrochemical properties, have to be engineered and optimised simultaneously. This study investigates on structural supercapacitors fabricated by using as-received as well as activated carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloths</b> as reinforcement and electrodes; multifunctional resin as electrolyte and matrix; and glass <b>fibre</b> <b>cloths,</b> filter papers or polymer membranes as insulators. Such a system should deliver electrical energy storage capacity as well as bear mechanical loads. Different liquid electrolytes, such as ionic liquids and salts based on Li+ and NH 4 +, were studied in order to optimise the multifunctionality of polymer electrolyte. Mesoporous silica particles were also introduced into polymer electrolytes in order to enhance the mechanical and electrochemical performance of polymer electrolytes. Nanostructured/ multifunctional resin blends were cured in cylindrical form and were examined by compression testing as well as impedance spectroscopy. An ionic conductivity of 0. 8 mS/cm and a compression modulus of 62 MPa have been synthesised for the polymer electrolyte in the current study. By varying the separators, multifunctional resins and the electrodes, different structural supercapacitor configurations were manufactured using a resin infusion under flexible tooling (RIFT) method and were characterised to study the electrochemical performance by using charge/discharge method and mechanical performance by using ± 45 ° laminate shear testing. The improved structural supercapacitors showed an energy density of 0. 1 Wh/kg, a power density of 36 W/kg and a shear modulus of 1. 7 GPa.

However, research to date has encountered {{a number of problems}} when utilising cohesive host soils. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a suitable site-applicable method of <b>mixing</b> <b>fibre</b> into cohesive host soils. Intermediate plasticity clay reinforced with monofilament polypropylene fibres was used in the laboratory investigations. In order to <b>mix</b> the <b>fibres</b> successfully, the initial moisture content of the host soil was increased prior to the introduction of fibres. By introducing quicklime, excess moisture was removed through the hydration process, and a portion of free water was effectively held within aggregations of flocculated clay particles, thereby having little influence on the dynamic boundaries. Fibrous inclusions within the clay clods resisted compactive effort, forming an interlocked structure. As a result, the optimum moisture content increased and the maximum dry density decreased. This trend was heavily dependent on the interfacial shear resistance along the fibre boundary, which consequently decreased as the water content increased or the compactive effort was increased. Results from strength tests confirmed that both peak and post-peak shear strength increased, creating a more ductile material capable of maintaining shear strength at high levels of strain. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved...|$|R

However,binder draindown is a problem for SMA mixtures, due to its intentional high binder content. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the volumetric properties, binder drainage, rutting and stripping performances in the SMA 14 mixture. Two different cellulose fibres were used in SMA 14 mix, which is synthetic fibre (Viatop 66) and natural fibre (Kenaf) to prevent binder drainage. In this study, 0. 3 percent cellulose fibres, by weight of mixture, were uniformly combined with the dried aggregate before the asphalt cement was added during mixing process. Laboratory specimens were prepared using 50 blows of the Marshall hammer per side. The optimum binder content (OBC) for SMA 14 mixtures was selected to produce 4 percent air voids and draindown of less than 0. 3 percent. The OBC for the SMA 14 <b>mix</b> with synthetic <b>fibre</b> (Viatop 66) was found to be 6. 1 percent at 4 percent air voids, while the OBC for the SMA 14 <b>mix</b> with natural <b>fibre</b> (Kenaf) was found to be 5. 9 percent at 4 percent air voids. The obtained OBC was used to prepare samples for rutting and stripping tests.

However, the sluggish kinetic rates of the ammonia electrooxidation reaction, and high cost and poisoning of Pt-based catalysts still remain challenges.

In this work, we directly grew hierarchical mixed NiCu layered hydroxides (LHs) nanowires on carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>cloth</b> electrodes by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method for efficient electro-oxidation of ammonia. This catalyst achieves a current density of 35 mA cm− 2 at 0. 55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which {{is much higher than}} that of bare Ni(OH) 2 catalyst (5 mA cm− 2). This is due to abundant active sites and a synergistic effect between Ni and Cu, possibly due to the formation of Ni 1 −xCuxOOH {{on the surface of the}} catalysts through the electrochemical activation of the mixture of Cu(OH) 2 and α-Ni(OH) 2. In the investigated first row transition elements, it is found that Cu is the sole first-row transition metal to effectively improve activity of Ni(OH) 2 for ammonia electrooxidation. This mixed NiCu LHs nano-wire catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/C catalyst in the aspects of ammonia oxidation current and stability, demonstrating it to be a promising low-cost and stable catalyst for efficient ammonia electrooxidation in alkaline condition, which is a potential electrode for ammonia fuel cells for power generation or electrolysis of ammonia for ammonia-containing wastewater treatment. ...|$|R
