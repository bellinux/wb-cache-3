Earlier studies used <b>methyl</b> <b>chloroformate</b> as a photolytic precursor for the CH 3 OCO, methoxy carbonyl (or methoxy formyl) radical, which is an intermediate in many reactions {{that are relevant to}} combustion and atmospheric chemistry. That work evidenced two competing C-Cl bond fission channels, tentatively assigning them as producing ground-and excited-state methoxy carbonyl radicals. In this study, we measure the photofragment angular distributions for each C-Cl bond fission channel and the spin-orbit state of the Cl atoms produced. The data shows bond fission leading to the production of ground-state methoxy carbonyl radicals with a high kinetic energy release and an angular distribution characterized by an anisotropy parameter, â, of between 0. 37 and 0. 64. The bond fission that leads to the production of excited-state radicals, with a low kinetic energy release, has an angular distribution best described by a negative anisotropy parameter.

Stable-isotope-labeled reference compounds were used as internal standards. RESULTS: The method quantified all carnitine biosynthesis metabolites except 4 -N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. Detection limits were 0. 05 - 0. 1 micromol/L. The interassay imprecision (CV) for urine samples with added compounds was 6 - 12 %. The intraassay imprecision (CV) was 1 - 5 % (3 - 10 micromol/L). Recoveries were 94 - 106 % at 10 - 20 micromol/L and 98 - 103 % at 100 - 200 micromol/L. The mean (SD) excretions of N(6) -trimethyllysine and 3 -hydroxy-N(6) -trimethyllysine were 2. 8 (0. 8) and 0. 45 (0. 15) mmol/mol creatinine, respectively. gamma-Butyrobetaine and carnitine excretions were more variable with values of 0. 27 (0. 21) and 15 (12) mmol/mol creatinine, respectively. After oral administration of deuterium-labeled N(6) -trimethyllysine, all urines of newborns contained deuterium-labeled N(6) -trimethyllysine, 3 -hydroxy-N(6) -trimethyllysine, gamma-butyrobetaine, and carnitine. CONCLUSIONS: HPLC in combination with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry allows rapid determination of urinary carnitine biosynthesis metabolites. Newborns can synthesize carnitine from exogenous N(6) -trimethyllysine, albeit at a low rat...|$|E
