5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} and <b>multicultural</b> <b>society</b> home {{to people}} of many different ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority of}} the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E
5|$|The LPF {{decided to}} {{maintain}} Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed naming {{a new leader}} until after the election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far {{a record number of}} seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains. CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the purple coalition and Holland's <b>multicultural</b> <b>society.</b> As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Ujjal Dosanjh {{was born}} in Dosanjh Kalan, a village in Jalandhar district, Punjab, India, in 1947. After moving to another village, {{he lived with his}} grandfather, Moola Singh Bains, who had {{established}} a primary school. Dosanjh gained an early interest in politics from listening to debates between his father, a follower of Jawaharlal Nehru and the populist Indian National Congress, and his grandfather, a former Indian freedom fighter and socialist. Dosanjh wanted to pursue an education in political science, but his father wanted him to be a doctor. So in 1964, at the age of 17, Dosanjh left India for the United Kingdom where he could pursue his own interests. In London he learned English and worked as an assistant editor for a Punjabi-language newspaper. He emigrated to Canada {{three and a half years}} later, arriving in British Columbia on May 12, 1968, to live with his aunt. majoring in political science. He went on to earn a law degree from the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in 1976 and was called to the bar the following year. During this time he taught English as a second language courses at Vancouver Community College and worked as an assistant editor of a local Punjabi newspaper. He established his own law practice in 1979, specializing in family and personal injury law. His involvement with community organizations included founding the Farm Workers’ Legal Information Service (later Canadian Farm Workers' Union), serving on the board of directors for BC Civil Liberties Association and the Vancouver <b>Multicultural</b> <b>Society,</b> and the Labour Advocacy Research Association, as well as volunteer work with MOSAIC Immigrant Services Centre, and the South Vancouver Neighbourhood House.|$|E

25|$|In 1912 on {{the islands}} lived 10 250 Greeks and 670 Turks. The islands have {{become more and more}} ethnically Turkish in {{character}} due to the influx of wealthy Turkish jetsetters, a process which began in the first days of the Turkish Republic when the British Yacht Club on Büyükada was appropriated as Anadolu Kulübü, for Turkish parliamentarians to enjoy Istanbul in the summer. The islands are an interesting anomaly because they allow for a very rare, albeit incomplete, insight into a <b>multicultural</b> <b>society</b> in modern Turkey, possibly akin to the <b>multicultural</b> <b>society</b> that once existed during the Ottoman Empire in places such as nearby Istanbul/Constantinople. Prior to the 1950s, each of the inhabited islands had significant communities of ethnic minorities of Turkey, which is now the case to a much smaller extent.

40|$|In {{the era of}} globalization, <b>multicultural</b> <b>societies</b> {{are common}} in most {{developed}} countries. As a consequence, new challenges at both national and international levels have become apparent, and successful adaptation to this new phenomenon of migration appears as a fundamental issue. Sport has traditionally been {{considered to be a}} vehicle for bringing people together (Eitzen, D. S., & Sage, G. H. (2003). Sociology of North American sport (7 th ed.). New York: McGraw Hill), and recently there has been an increasing policy interest to use sport as a tool to promote integration in <b>multicultural</b> <b>societies.</b> Regardless of its political significance, research on the integrative role sport plays in our society is limited and findings are equivocal (Hatzigeorgiadis, A., Morela, E., Elbe, A. -M., & Sanchez, X. (2013). The integrative role of sport in <b>multicultural</b> <b>societies.</b> European Psychologist, 18, 191 – 202). In this chapter, we address these findings within the ethnic-cultural identity approach (Berry, J. W. (1980). Acculturation as varieties of adaptation. In: A. Padilla (Ed.), Acculturation: Theory, models and some new findings (pp. 9 – 25). Boulder: Westview; Immigration, acculturation, and adaptation. Applied Psychology, 46, 5 – 34). In particular, we discuss a number of studies that (1) have used a sound ethnic-cultural identity framework and (2) have attempted to identify variables that may influence the effectiveness of sport participation toward the goal of social integration. Lastly, we address future research venues and provide practical implications that can contribute to the further understanding of the potential role of sport in the promotion of social integration in today’s <b>multicultural</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R

25|$|Company policy {{required}} land to {{be purchased}} from the indigenous peoples. The WIC would offer a land patent, {{the recipient of}} which would be responsible for negotiating a deal with representatives of the local population, usually the sachem or high chief. The Dutch (referred to by the natives as Swannekins, or salt water people) and the Wilden (as the Dutch called the natives) had vastly different conceptions of ownership and use of land—so much so that they did not understand each other at all. The Dutch thought that their proffer of gifts in the form of sewant or manufactured goods was a trade agreement and defense alliance, which gave them exclusive rights to farming, hunting, and fishing. Often, the Indians did not vacate the property, or reappeared seasonally, according to their migration patterns. They were willing to share the land with the Europeans, but the Indians did not intend to leave or give up access. This misunderstanding and other differences led to violent conflict later. At the same time, such differences marked the beginnings of a <b>multicultural</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the term}} Polish culture refers {{primarily}} to the Polish-language culture in Poland, the Second Polish Republic also had numerous vibrant national minorities, most notably Jewish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian and German. It was a <b>multicultural</b> <b>society</b> whose ethno-cultural makeup was shaped {{over a period of}} centuries. In 1921 according to the first-ever national census, the Catholic Poles constituted 69.2% of the population, the Ukrainians 14.3%, the Jews 7.8%, the Belarusians 3.9% and the Germans 3.9%. The minorities amounted to 30.8% of the total. The rise of new intelligentsia resulted {{in the development of a}} record number of political parties, lobbies and societies. In a dozen or so years the newspaper readership doubled. In 1919, new universities opened in Poznań, Wilno, and Lublin. Universities in Kraków and Lwów were polonized already five years earlier. The Elementary School Teachers Union was formed in 1919. In the first ten years of Poland's redevelopment, the total number of schools increased by almost 10,000 thanks to the official decree on public education. By the time of the Nazi-Soviet invasion of 1939, some 90% of children were in schools across the country, the number limited only by the shortage of qualified staff and lack of adequate locales especially in the villages.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Empire Windrush, {{which was}} en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick {{servicemen}} who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement {{was placed in a}} Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship for anybody who wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of rejoining the RAF, while others decided to make the journey just to see what England was like. The resulting group of 492 immigrants famously began a wave of migration from the Caribbean to the UK when the ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948, and the name Windrush has as a result come to be used as shorthand for that migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British <b>multicultural</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
40|$|In today's {{globalized world}} mono-cultural {{societies}} have been gradually disappearing. A trend towards {{the creation of}} <b>multicultural</b> <b>societies</b> began in 1960 s.

Therefore, people were purposefully trained for quality communication and peaceful coexistence with societies that possessed different cultural traits.

Therefore, the school systems began to work intensively on the promotion of intercultural values ​​among young people.

Yet nowadays many multicultural nations encounter with difficulties in holding together multicultural diversity and in establishing harmonious interpersonal relationships.
