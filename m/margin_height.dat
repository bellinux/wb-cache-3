40|$|Comparing {{esthetic}} smile perceptions among laypersons {{with and}} without orthodontic treatment experience and dentists Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether orthodontic treatment experience affects the individual’s perception of smile esthetics and to evaluate differences among orthodontically treated laypersons, non-treated laypersons, and dentists by using computerized image alterations. Methods: A photograph of a woman’s smile was digitally altered using a software image editing program. The alterations involved gingival <b>margin</b> <b>height,</b> crown width and length, incisal plane canting, and dental midline of the maxillary anterior teeth. Three groups of raters (orthodontically treated laypersons, non-treated laypersons, and dentists) evaluated the original and altered images using a visual analog scale. Results: The threshold for detecting changes in maxillary central incisor gingival <b>margin</b> <b>height</b> among laypersons was 1. 5 mm; the threshold of dentists, who were more perceptive, was 1. 0 mm.

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{assess the}} {{behavior}} of the peri-implant soft margin after immediate implant placement with immediate function, by (1) direct clinical measurements of peri-implant soft <b>margin</b> <b>height</b> and thickness, (2) measurements of peri-implant soft <b>margin</b> <b>height</b> on photographs and (3) the perception of dental professionals regarding the results considering esthetic parameters. Material and method The study included 8 patients with central or lateral incisors indicated to be extracted. Direct measurements of peri-implant soft <b>margin</b> <b>height</b> and thickness were done immediately before extraction (T 0) and 1 (T 1), 4 (T 2), 8 (T 3) and 12 (T 4) months after the flapless insertion of the implant. Photographs were taken at the same time intervals. A questionnaire was filled in by implantology professionals regarding their visual perception of color and peri-implant soft margin architecture and harmony in the implant region using the photographs obtained at T 4. Result The clinical results showed significant changes to the height of the peri-implant soft margin, but the photographic results did not show significant changes for this measurement. The thickness of the attached gingiva was maintained during all the observation period. Of the professionals interviewed, 35. 2 % noticed an altered peri-implant soft margin color of the implant region, 39. 8 % noticed a change in the peri-implant soft margin architecture and 12. 5 % noticed a change in the peri-implant soft margin harmony. Conclusion The soft tissues around immediate implants changed during this period, but did not affect the aesthetic outcome and in the opinion of professionals, the aesthetic results were satisfactory for these cases...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} gingival margin {{changes in}} the esthetic zone after immediate implant placement and provisionalization over 5 years with a custom anatomic provisional abutment. Materials and Methods: Single maxillary incisor immediate implant placement and provisionalization procedures, completed and followed between February 2006 and August 2006, were analyzed retrospectively. During clinical recalls at 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years, changes in gingival margins were recorded with clinical photographs and recorded in millimeters. Results: Forty-seven patients each received a single implant (19 central incisors, 28 lateral incisors) and were followed for 5 years. Implants and restorations had a 100 % survival rate during the study. The mean gingival margin changes (recession) were 0. 17 mm {{at the time of}} definitive restoration, 0. 27 mm at 3 months, 0. 30 mm at 1 year, and 0. 30 mm at 5 years. After 5 years, 24 of the 47 implant crowns had no significant gingival recession. All central incisor sites received 4. 3 -mm-diameter implants and had a mean change in tooth length of 0. 03 mm at 5 years. Lateral incisor sites (n = 28) received either a 3. 5 -mm-diameter implant (n = 20) or a 4. 3 -mm-diameter implant (n = 8). Lateral sites with the 3. 5 -mm implant had a mean change in gingival <b>margin</b> <b>height</b> of 0. 08 mm of tooth length at 5 years; lateral sites with a 4. 3 -mm platform displayed a mean change of 0. 82 mm of tooth length. Conclusion: This study suggests that implant diameter, gingival biotype, surgical technique, and/or the reason for tooth loss can influence the amount of gingival recession occurring over 5 years. Most recession occurred within the first 3 months, between implant placement/provisionalization and definitive restoration. The use of a customized anatomic provisional abutment can reduce the amount and frequency of recession...|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} of gingival recession {{during or after}} orthodontic treatment would be a significant clinical problem. This not only highlights the need to undertake a risk assessment before treatment is commenced, with appropriate consent, but also to be aware during treatment for signs of recession. In particular, a baseline line assessment of the gingival <b>margin</b> <b>heights</b> {{in addition to the}} patient's age, biotype, planned arch expansion and the width of the alveolus should be taken into account prior to commencing treatment. Gingival recession occurring after orthodontic treatment has the potential for causing aesthetic or psychological concerns and hypersensivity.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Gingival {{recession}} after {{soft tissue}} displacement for impression making in fixed prosthodontics may pose {{a problem for}} treatment success in the esthetic areas of the mouth. Knowledge about the soft tissue reaction of common gingival displacement methods is limited. PURPOSE: The purpose of this clinical randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate changes in the marginal soft tissue height with 3 different gingival tissue displacement techniques for definitive impression making of natural teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 67 individuals were randomized to 3 groups. In test group 1 (P; n= 22), only aluminum chloride paste was used to displace the gingiva. In test group 2 (CP; n= 23), a cord was inserted, and aluminum chloride paste was also used. In the control group (C; n= 22), 2 cords were used to displace the gingiva (double-cord technique). Clinical measurements of the gingival position were made before treatment began and at 30 ± 10 days after prosthesis delivery. Study casts were fabricated {{at different stages of}} the treatment, standardized photographs were made, and changes in the buccal gingival position were measured using graphics editing software. In addition, the participants' perception of the clinical procedure and the technicians' evaluation of the die preparation were recorded. One-way ANOVA models were applied to compare the response variables among the groups: (a) the position of the gingival margin (millimeters), (b) mean probing pocket depth (millimeters), (c) gingival thickness (millimeters), (d) amount of keratinized tissue (millimeters), and (e) mean changes in gingival <b>margin</b> <b>height</b> (millimeters). Unpaired t tests were also used to compare the mean values between groups. For comparisons between different categories, chi-square tests were performed (α=. 05 for all tests). RESULTS: In the period between impression and delivery, a minor gain in gingival height of 0. 058 mm (± 0. 13 SD) for P and 0. 013 mm (± 1. 19 SD) for CP. However, a minor gingival recession of 0. 049 mm (± 0. 13 SD) was reported for group C. The results for all groups showed that 21...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} two main topics are {{discussed}} for the Turgen-Kharkhiraa, the northernmost {{part of the}} Mongolian Altai. After a short presentation of the study areas and a statistical evaluation of the glaciers of the Turgen-Kharkhiraa (exposition, height of recent ice <b>margin,</b> <b>height</b> of GEI (= Glacier Elevation Index)) the first main topic is the modelling of climatic parameters for this area and the second main topic is the calculation of accumulation, ablation, and mass balance values of glaciers in the study area. The modelling of climatic parameters was necessary because {{in this part of}} the world not many meteorological stations exist. The few meteorological stations that do exist and which have recorded meteorological data over several years (about 30 years) are all located at relatively low heights compared with the heights of the Turgen-Kharkhiraa. So these stations have not been able to contribute meteorological data, such as temperature, precipitation, wind-velocity, and solar radiation at higher altitudes of this massif. As shown in chapter 5, such models for the above mentioned climatic parameters could be created with the help of a so-called “area of comparison” in the Swiss Alps. In this area of comparison the modelled values could be compared with real values because for this area meteorological data exist up to great heights. It could be shown that only through the knowledge of data of meteorological stations at low heights could good realistic climatic values for greater heights be modelled. This fact was used for the study area as well: Models could only be created with the help of data from meteorological stations which are located at lower heights compared with the heights of the Turgen-Kharkhiraa but these models were able to calculate realistic climatic values for greater heights of the Turgen-Kharkhiraa. It was therefore possible to develop guidelines for models for temperature, precipitation, wind-velocity, solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit, and the sum of (positive) degree-days. These models were able to define all of the above mentioned climatic parameters at all heights of the Turgen-Kharkhiraa. The other main topic of this study was with the help of the modeled climatic values, to calculate accumulation, ablation, and as a result of the difference between these two values, mass balance values for the glaciers of the Turgen-Kharkhiraa. For this purpose the model created by VUILLE (1996) and used by KULL (1999) was used. This model defines accumulation by using values for temperature and precipitation and ablation by using values for wind-velocity, vapour pressure deficit, solar radiation and the sum of (positive) degree-days. This model was originally created for glaciers in the arid Chilean Andes. Therefore it had to be modified to comply with the situation in the Turgen-Kharkhiraa. After modifying this model with a factor and an additional term (“term of correction”), modelling of realistic values for the study area was possible. Modelling of accumulation and ablation was done for the Little Ice Age and the Last Glacial Maximum as well. Modelled values for the Little Ice Age could be regarded as realistic. Modelled values for the Last Glacial Maximum, however, include considerable uncertainties. So the model for this period can only be regarded as a “working-hypothesis”...|$|E

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 14 th Rodens et Spatium: International Conference on Rodent Biology, celebrada en Lisboa del 28 de julio al 2 de agosto de 2014. The {{intensification}} of agricultural landscapes is {{usually associated with}} increases in field size and reduction of natural and semi-natural habitats, particularly field margins and fallows. These habitats are crucial for small mammals, as permanent, less-altered habitats, or as corridors for dispersion. In this study, we assessed seasonal abundance patterns of the small mammal community (Microtus arvalis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Mus spretus, and Crocidura russula) in three main habitats (alfalfa, cereal and fallows), with special emphasis on abundance at various distances from field margins. We also investigated abundance according to the field <b>margin</b> characteristics (topography, <b>height,</b> width, cover, greenness). We show that small mammal abundance typically decrease from field margins towards the core of crop fields, depending on crop type (with a more pronounced margin effect in cereals independently of season). Abundance of M. arvalis, however, was slightly constant in alfalfa at all seasons, representing an optimum habitat for its distribution. For all species, the seasonal abundances {{were higher in the}} more vegetated field <b>margins</b> (greater vegetation <b>height</b> and cover). Field margin characteristics also affected the abundance of most species, depending on season. Common vole abundance was positively associated with vegetation cover in July, and with greenness in March and November. Our results highlight the importance of field margins in agricultural landscapes, not only for biodiversity conservation but also for the management of outbreaking species such as M. arvalis.

The organic matter content of soil layers analyzed are low, not exceeding 1 g kg- 1, with the highest levels observed in the upper layers of the profiles analyzed. The high contents of aluminum and the saturation of this element may be associated with river dynamics, which contributes to the leaching of the soil bases.

Therefore, the risk of injury from Veress needles is 1 / 10, 000 and from primary trocars is 3 / 10, 000. Although safety is not established, for which at least 10, 000 laparoscopic procedures should be studied, this surgical landmark provides several advantages over other entry points and was feasible in 442 laparoscopies, irrespective of the patient characteristics.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the spatial {{correlation}} among pair of maps related to submerged macrophytes growth in Taquaruçu reservoir, between São Paulo and Paraná states. The study of submerged vegetation is mainly important due to its excessive proliferation, which causes ecological unbalance and economical losses to hydroelectric power plants. Three survey fields were carried out between March and April of 2010, in order to map the submerged canopy height and depth, with the hydro-acoustic technique. With these data, other spatial variables related to macrophytes growth were derived: slope, water column <b>height,</b> <b>margin</b> distance, thalweg distance, colonized neighborhood cells count and colonized neighborhood height sum. The correlation analysis was divided in two sets of pairs of maps.

The spatial correlation was evaluated using Cramers index, based on chi-square statistic, and Joint Information Uncertainty, based on entropy concept.

40|$|Repeated {{sediment}} delivery {{across the}} shelf and onto the shelf margin, whether by accommodation- or supply-driven forcing of river deltas to the shelf edge, causes shelf-edge migration and large-scale accretion of margin sedimentary prisms. For <b>margins</b> of similar <b>height,</b> this accretion rate can be modest (few km/my) or fast (10 s of km/my) depending mainly on the width of {{the shelf and}} the sediment flux across the shelf edge. Greenhouse margins, despite a likely weak accommodation drive, nevertheless can partition great volumes of sediment into deepwater areas likely favored by high rates of sediment yield during warmer climate and a tendency for deltas to remain near the shelf edge for long periods without floodback. In this setting there can occur both lowstand and highstand delivery of sand into deepwater areas. On icehouse margins we predict longer and higher frequency transgressive-regressive delta transits across the growing shelf-margin prism driven by glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations, with punctuated deepwater sand delivery at sea-level lowstands and thus the creation of conventional stratigraphic sequences. The shelf-edge trajectory during the longer-term growth of many margins is commonly irregular, with alternating rising and flat segments that have a time scale of 0. 5 - 2 my. These segments themselves, always consisting of stacked basic sequences, are useful predictors of alternating strong sediment storage on the shelf (for segments of rising trajectory) and strong bypass of sediment to deepwater areas (for segments of flat trajectory). The possible causes of shelf-edge trajectory segmentation are discussed wit...|$|R

A neutronic evaluation of the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor (TAMU NSCR) using the General Atomic Company (GA) low enrichment uranium (LEU 30 - 20 fuel was performed to determine the feasibility of this type of fuel. To perform this evaluation, the WIMSD 4 m transport code and DIF 3 D diffusion code were utilized. These codes were provided by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). WIMSD 4 m was used to calculate macroscopic cross-sections for the various core materials and DIF 3 D was used to calculate the effective multiplication factor and thermal neutron flux for various core configurations. In order to benchmark these codes and the core model used to evaluate the proposed LEU 30 - 20 core, the current FLIP core was first modeled. Various neutronic parameters, such as excess reactivity, shutdown <b>margin,</b> critical rod <b>height</b> and control rod worths were calculated using the core model and codes, and the results compared with actual experimental results for the FLIP core. Once the core model and codes were validated, the core model was modified using LEU 30 - 20 fuel and an optimum core configuration obtained which satisfied certain design criteria, including values for excess reactivity, shutdown margin and thermal neutron flux. In addition to modeling the LEU 30 - 20 core, a control rod model was developed to generate effective macroscopic cross-sections for the control rod materials in the core, based on previous work in this area performed at ANL.

The papyrus measures (roughly) 12 cm. (width) by 25 cm. (<b>height).</b> <b>Margins</b> are small at top (0. 8 cm.) and (until line 19) at left (0. 5 cm., discounting the vertical strip whose partial remains appear opposite lines 8 - 13). The prayer (lines 20 - 24) below the letter 2 ̆ 7 s body is indented at the left ca. 2. 5 cm. inward from the mu of mhd°no!, the first word in line 19 (therefore ca. 3. 0 cm. from the papyrus 2 ̆ 7 left edge; cf. similarly P. Ross. -Georg. III 9. 21 - 24). Righthand margin is virtually non-existent. At line ends (cf. 5, 7, 11, 12, 14) sigmas are sometimes finished off as filler strokes brought out to the very right edge of the papyrus. The bottom margin (there is seemingly no more writing after line 25 on the front) is also, {{where it can be}} measured, small, 0. 3 - 0. 5 cm. In antiquity, on completion of the front-side text, written along the papyrus 2 ̆ 7 fibers, the papyrus was apparently folded inward, lengthwise in thirds, from right to left. One indication of this is that the righthand third is considerably narrower than the middle and lefthand thirds. The result was a long (25 cm.), narrow (4. 4 cm.) strip. The strip was then turned over and sideways, and inscribed, again along the fibers, {{on the back of the}} lefthand third of the front-side text–another indication that the original folding went from right to left. The long, narrow strip was then itself folded in two, slightly off-center, resulting in a packet ca. 4. 4 cm. x 13. 7 cm. On the packet 2 ̆ 7 s inside was preserved (rather well) the text of P. Mich. inv. 3999. Ironically, yet quite naturally, it is along the creases that created the protective packet that the principal losses to the text have occurred. The two lines of writing on the outside of the packet are badly abraded. Though many details in these lines are clear, equally much is obscure. The sum has resisted satisfactory decipherment and connected sense has not been recovered. The lines appear not to be an address, but rather an addendum to the text of the front, possibly, but not assuredly, in a different hand...|$|R
40|$|Large {{areas of}} the worlds oceans are still unexplored. Previously unknown {{structures}} and ecosystems are discovered due to the increasing exploration of the oceans, in particular at the continental margin and the continental shelf. Research is essential to understand these structures and to analyze their potential and importance for human society and the ecosystem. This PhD thesis is one part of multidisciplinary research at the European continental margin. Hydroacustic methods were applied {{in order to identify}} and distinguish different seabed structures and facies. Hydroacustic techniques are an established approach to analyze the seafloor. Echo intensity was used in this study for interpretation in addition to the travel time of the acoustic signal. The ship-borne multibeam system Hydrosweep DS- 2 and the sub-bottom profiler Parasound were used for data recording. The investigation areas of this study comprise the Håkon Mosby mud volcano situated at the Norwegian-Barents-Svalbard continental margin and the carbonate mounds in the Belgica mound province together with adjacent channels situated in the Porcupine Seabight at the Irish continental margin. Mud volcanoes and carbonate mounds are characterized by active sediment and transport processes and are related to the existence of subsurface hydrocarbon, mainly methane. Seafloor channels indicate sediment transport in lateral and vertical direction. These structures are focus of recent research due to the contribution of methane to the carbon cycle. A terrain model of the Håkon Mosby mud volcano was created providing the basis for detailed studies which require precise positioning for sampling and observation devices. The fine structure of the mud volcano was mapped by dense survey lines and overlapping swathes. The Håkon Mosby mud volcano is located at a water depth of about 1270 m and can be separated into three morphological segments: weak, crater-like center (950 m diameter, 12 m height), circular embankment (1350 m diameter, 100 m breadth, 2 m height) and the area influenced by mud volcanism which is characterized by a reduced surface slope compared to the general margin (2500 m diameter). Investigations of the Belgica mound province show that the carbonate mounds occur in a depth range between 1000 m and 700 m. They are aligned along the <b>margin</b> and show <b>heights</b> of about 50 m up to 100 m maximum. Their morphology resembles ellipses with axes ranging from 0. 5 km to 1. 0 km and from 1. 0 km to 1. 5 km, respectively, ridge-like mounds or terrace-like structures. Other morphological properties comprise steep surface slopes of about 20 ° and depressions at the foot of some mounds having variable depths up to 50 m. This morphology is different from other mound provinces in the Porcupine Seabight. Carbonate mounds proposed south of the Belgica province in the Gollum Channel System were not evidenced by this study. In addition to the morphology of the seabed structures, acoustic backscatter data were analyzed in the study areas. The Håkon Mosby mud volcano shows strong backscatter at the central area in contrast to reduced backscatter at the surrounding, circular depression. This might be due to gas occurrence in the sediment and high surface roughness at the central crater. Soft and homogeneous sediments with low surface roughness are expected at the surrounding moat. The eastern part of the mud volcano, however, shows spatially different variability of morphology and backscatter data. Angular backscatter data of the individual depth measurements were analyzed in the Porcupine Seabight area. Segments of the seafloor of different acoustical properties were separated based on morphology and angular backscatter data. These segments were studied with respect to the parameters mean angular response, slope and variation of the angular backscatter data. Seabed facies like surface mounds, buried mounds, channels and inter-channel areas were characterized and distinguished. First information on the seabed variability is now available to select specific sample locations. The maps showing the spatial distribution of the backscatter data indicate sediment transport at the seabed by lineated structures. These structures occur {{in the vicinity of the}} carbonate mounds in the Porcupine Seabight and point to seabed currents with an oblique direction to the continental slope. Backscatter data at the Håkon Mosby mud volcano show that the outflowing material is transported down slope, probably by bottom currents or gravity...|$|R
