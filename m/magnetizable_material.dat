Applying a dynamic sinusoidal magnetization in the frequency range 50 mHz ≦ f ≦ 110 Hz with field strength maxima up to 150 A/cm irreversible (magnetic Barkhausen noise) and reversible (incremental permeability) micromagnetic processes (Bloch-wall-jumps, rotations) give independent nd-quantities together with a derived coercivity.

50|$|Color {{changing}} inks colored magnetizable inks {{are prepared}} by including chromatic pigments of high color strength. The magnetic pigments’ strong inherent color generally reduces {{the spectrum of}} achievable shades. Generally, pigments should be used at high concentrations to ensure that sufficient <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> is applied even in thin offset coats. Some magnetic pigment are best suited for colored magnetizable inks due to their lower blackness.Homogenous magnetization (no preferred orientation) is easily obtained on pigment made of spherical particles. Best results are achieved when remanence and coercive field strength are very low and the saturating magnetization is high.|$|E
50|$|The heads {{themselves}} {{started out}} {{similar to the}} heads in tape recorders—simple devices made out of a tiny C-shaped piece of highly <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> called ferrite wrapped in a fine wire coil. When writing, the coil is energized, a strong magnetic field forms in the gap of the C, and the recording surface adjacent to the gap is magnetized. When reading, the magnetized material rotates past the heads, the ferrite core concentrates the field, and a current is generated in the coil. In the gap the field is very strong and quite narrow. That gap is roughly equal to {{the thickness of the}} magnetic media on the recording surface. The gap determines the minimum size of a recorded area on the disk. Ferrite heads are large, and write fairly large features. They must also be flown fairly far from the surface thus requiring stronger fields and larger heads.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{control of}} door motion in {{automotive}} applications often requires a bias torque to retain an actuator mechanism {{in a certain}} position without supplying power. Therefore, two magnetorheological actuators based on magnetorheological fluids with differ-ent kinds of magnetic excitation are developed. For the currentless bias torque generation, the first approach uses permanent magnets and offers an almost linear torque characteristic, while the second actuator design utilizes hysteresis properties of <b>magnetizable</b> <b>materials</b> resulting in an ambiguous control characteristic. The main advantage of the hysteresis-based magnetor-heological actuator is an optimized design with respect to space and weight. But the hysteresis phenomenon has to be compensated by appropriate control algorithms, {{in order to obtain}} a linearized torque characteristic as investigated for actuated car doors with haptic capabilities (door assistant), such as for assisted egress or obstacle avoidance.

40|$|The {{yield stress}} of a magnetorheological {{suspension}} is calculated {{from two different}} approaches. The first one {{is based on a}} mesoscopic description of the structure taking only into account the shape anisotropy of the strained aggregates. The second one is based on a microscopic approach where the interparticle forces, due to the application of the field, are calculated numerically by taking into account the magnetostatics between the particles inside the aggregates. We show that the macroscopic description well applies to suspensions of nonmagnetic particles in a ferrofluid and that a layered structure, consisting of parallel slabs of <b>magnetizable</b> <b>materials</b> should have a yield stress much higher than a structure made of cylindrical aggregates. On the other hand the microscopic approach is appropriated for the description of suspensions of particles of high permeability. In this case, the yield stress is mainly determined by the rupture between pairs of particles and, consequently, it strongly increases with the angle between the line of centers of the pair undergoing the rupture and the field...|$|R

The dynamic 2 D model of a thin rod with viscoelastic <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> is used. Numerical calcula-tions of the rod motion in a vertical plane under the action of alternating magnetic field, gravity and friction are performed using this model.

A particle (16) made of <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> is connected with an elastic material (12) of the seal. A magnetizable work partner (50) interrupts a magnetic force of a magnetic field that is produced by the particle.

40|$|The Lorentz force law of {{classical}} electrodynamics {{states that the}} force F exerted by the magnetic induction B on a particle of charge q moving with velocity V is given by F=qVxB. Since this force is orthogonal to the direction of motion, the magnetic field {{is said to be}} incapable of performing mechanical work. Yet there is no denying that a permanent magnet can readily perform mechanical work by pushing/pulling on another permanent magnet [...] or by attracting pieces of <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> such as scrap iron or iron filings. We explain this apparent contradiction by examining the magnetic Lorentz force acting on an Amperian current loop, which is the model for a magnetic dipole. We then extend the discussion by analyzing the Einstein-Laub model of magnetic dipoles in the presence of external magnetic fields. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures, 20 equations, 6 reference...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{relativity}} was created in 1905 {{to solve a problem}} concerning electromagnetic fields. That solution was reached by means of profound changes in fundamental concepts and ideas that considerably affected the whole of physics. Moreover, when Einstein took gravitation into account, he was forced to develop radical changes also in our space-time concepts (1916). Relativistic works on heat, thermodynamics, and elasticity appeared as early as 1911. However, general theories having a thermodynamic basis, including heat conduction and constitutive equations, did not appear in general relativity until about 1955 for fluids and appeared only after 1960 for elastic or more general finitely deformed materials. These theories dealt with materials with memory, and in this connection some relativistic versions of the principle of material indifference were considered. Even more recently, relativistic theories incorporating finite deformations for polarizable and <b>magnetizable</b> <b>materials</b> and those in which couple stresses are considered have been formulated. A broader description of the development of these relativistic topics is contained in § 13. The purpose of this book is to describe the foundations of the general relativistic theories that include constitutive equations, and to present some applications, mainly to elastic waves, of these theories. This tract is divided into two parts. In the first part only the Eulerian point of view is considered; basic equations of general relativity, other than constitutive equations, are stated in full generality (except for couple stresses which are considered in part 2). Part 1 also thoroughly covers fluids, including constitutive equations...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} of radiation pressure and photon {{momentum in the}} past 150 years have focused almost exclusively on classical and/or quantum theories of electrodynamics. In these analyses, Maxwell's equations, the properties of polarizable and/or <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> media, and the stress tensors of Maxwell, Abraham, Minkowski, Chu, and Einstein-Laub have typically played prominent roles. Each stress tensor has subsequently been manipulated to yield its own expressions for the electromagnetic (EM) force, torque, energy, and linear as well as angular momentum densities of the EM field. This paper presents an alternative view of radiation pressure {{from the perspective of}} thermal physics, invoking the properties of blackbody radiation in conjunction with empty as well as gas-filled cavities that contain EM energy in thermal equilibrium with the container's walls. In this type of analysis, Planck's quantum hypothesis, the spectral distribution of the trapped radiation, the entropy of the photon gas, and Einstein's A and B coefficients play central roles.

30|$|Magnetic {{solid phase}} {{extraction}} (MSPE) {{is a kind}} of magnetic or <b>magnetizable</b> <b>material</b> as absorbent matrix solid phase extraction technique (Giakisikli and Anthemidis 2013), which has many advantages including simple operation, short extraction time, low organic solvent consumption, and easy automation. It has a broad application prospect in detection analysis (Jiang et al. 2013). To date, MSPE extraction agent is mainly Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (NPs) with specific chemical functional group modified on the surface to achieve concentration of the targeted analytes. Numerous organic polymers and inorganic polymers have been used to modify Fe 3 O 4 NPs. The unique structures of cyclodextrins (CDs), which have a cavity possessing a hydrophilic external surface and a hydrophobic internal surface, make them useful in separation processes. β-CDCP by polymerizing cyclodextrin with epichlorohydrin was a spherical or grainy solid subject and insoluble in water, which still retained the inclusion property of β-CD, was synthesized by the reaction of β-CD and cross-linked agent. β-CDCP as a solid phase extraction material had been applied to selectively separation/preconcentration the similar size of materials (Zhu and Ping 2014). Yu et al. modified the Fe 3 O 4 NPs with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and polyethyleneglycol 400 (PEG 400) for the removal of congo red from aqueous solutions (Yu et al. 2014). The related research by our group indicated (1) Fe 3 O 4 @cyclodextrin polymer NPs (Fe 3 O 4 @β-CDCP) as adsorbents for preconcentration/extraction of rutin from lotus plumule (Gong et al. 2014) and (2) self-assembly Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @ILs as adsorbents for preconcentration/extraction of linuron (Chen and Zhu 2015). But, there was no report to separation/analysis linuron with Fe 3 O 4 @IL-CM-HP-β-CDCP magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs).|$|E
