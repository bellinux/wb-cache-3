50|$|Non-replicated {{experiments}} {{are used by}} knowledgeable experimentalists when replications have prohibitive costs. When the block-design lacks replicates, interactions have been modeled. For example, Tukey's F-test for interaction (non-additivity) has been motivated by the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>model</b> of Mandel (1961); this model assumes that all treatment-block interactions are proportion to {{the product of the}} mean treatment-effect and the mean block-effect, where the proportionality constant is identical for all treatment-block combinations.

40|$|We {{define a}} (chaotic) {{deterministic}} variant of random <b>multiplicative</b> cascade <b>models</b> of turbulence.

The zero-noise limit can be handled by Perron-Frobenius theory, just as the zero-diffusivity limit for the fast dynamo problem. Random <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models</b> do not possess Kolmogorov 1941 (K 41) scaling because of a large-deviations effect.

40|$|Additive {{regression}} models are preferred over <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models</b> in analy-sis of relative survival data. Such preferences are mainly grounded in practi-cal experience with mostly cancer registries data, where the basic {{assumption of the}} additivity of hazards {{is more likely to}} be met. Also, the interpretation of coefficients is more meaningful in additive than in <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models.</b> Nonetheless, the question of goodness of fit of the assumed model must still be addressed, and while there is an abundance of methods to check the good-ness of fit of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models,</b> the respective arsenal for additive models is almost empty. We propose here a variety of procedures for testing the null hypothesis of a good fit. These are based on partial residuals defined sim-ilarly to Schoenfeld residuals familiar for Cox model diagnostics. The tests have appropriate sizes under the null hypothesis, and good power under dif-ferent alternatives. We investigate their performance through simulations and apply the methods to data from a study into survival of colon cancer patients. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{property}} of unit treatment additivity is not invariant under {{a change of}} scale, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit treatment additivity.

In many cases, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms {{be applied to the}} responses, which are believed to follow a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a generalization for known probabilistic models such as log-linear and graphical <b>models,</b> called here <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models.</b> These models, that express probabilities via product of parameters are shown to capture multiple forms of contextual independence between variables, including decision graphs and noisy-OR functions. An inference algorithm for <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models</b> is provided and its correctness is proved.

5000|$|Statistical (econometric, {{technical}} analysis) methods {{forecast the}} current price {{by using a}} mathematical combination of the previous prices and/or previous or current values of exogenous factors, typically consumption and production figures, or weather variables. The two most important categories are additive and multiplicative models. They differ in whether the predicted price is the sum (additive) {{of a number of}} components or the product (multiplicative) of a number of factors. The former are far more popular, but the two are closely related - a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>model</b> for prices can be transformed into an additive model for log-prices. Statistical models are attractive because some physical interpretation may be attached to their components, thus allowing engineers and system operators to understand their behavior. They are often criticized for their limited ability to model the (usually) nonlinear behavior of electricity prices and related fundamental variables. However, in practical applications, their performances are not worse than those of the non-linear computational intelligence methods (see below).

40|$|Traditionally, {{extended}} pedigrees {{with many}} affected individuals {{have been studied}} {{for the purpose of}} detection of linkage. For traits caused by a rare susceptibility allele, this is a productive strategy. However, this sampling strategy may not work well for traits determined by multiple loci in which one or more have common susceptibility alleles. We simulated three single-additive-locus models of inheritance and two-locus models with additive or multiplicative interactions, all with rare or common susceptibility alleles. A trait locus was linked, with no recombination, to a marker locus with four equally frequent alleles. Family structure varied, but the total number of affected individuals was held constant. Two generations of individuals were genotyped. We used three nonparametric affected-sib-pair programs and two nonparametric pedigree-analysis programs to perform linkage analysis. For single-locus, additive, and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models,</b> we found that, when the susceptibility allele was rare, (frequency. 0025), extended pedigrees with first or second cousins had the most power for detection of linkage. However, when the susceptibility allele was common in the single-locus, additive, and <b>multiplicative</b> two-locus <b>models</b> (frequency. 25), extended pedigrees were no more powerful than nuclear families. There was also a decrease in power when the pedigrees had a greater number of affected individuals, more so for the single-locus and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models</b> than for the additive model. We conclude that for single-locus, additive, and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models</b> of qualitative traits with common alleles, there is no benefit to the collection of extended pedigrees, and there may be a loss of power in the collection of pedigrees with many affected individuals...|$|R

The soil types in Changling, Qianâan and Daâan are chernozem, quaternary unconsolidated rock and alluvial sand, respectively.

For each model, we generate composite vectors {{for a set of}} AN combinations unattested in the source corpus and which have been deemed either acceptable or semantically deviant. We then compute measures that might cue semantic anomaly, and compare each modelâs results for the two classes of ANs. Our study shows that simple, unsupervised cues can indeed significantly tell unattested but acceptable ANs apart from impossible, or deviant, ANs, and that the simple additive and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>models</b> are the most effective in this task. ...|$|R
