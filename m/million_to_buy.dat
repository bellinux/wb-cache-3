On March 14, 1998, hours before the deadline to keep the team in Edmonton, the Edmonton Investors Group agreed to pay $70 <b>million</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the club. The EIG were spearheaded by Cal Nichols, who had a commitment to retain NHL hockey in Edmonton. The deal was finalized, on May 5. and thus prevented them from being the third Canadian team to move in the 1990s and the fourth former WHA team to move in successive years (Quebec had moved in 1995, Winnipeg in 1996, and Hartford in 1997). The Oilers received support from the NHL for this very reason.|$|E
25|$|A {{new report}} in January 2002 {{revealed}} that Few had ordered no new firefighting or emergency services {{vehicles in the}} past 18 months, and that the city's fleet was quickly approaching decrepitude. A third of all pumper trucks were out of service due to ill-repair and age, and the city was patching up 15-year-old vehicles (which were due to have been scrapped four years ago) to fight fires. Not a single pumper could be held in reserve to fight major fires {{due to the lack}} of vehicles. In one case, the city pressed a fire academy training vehicle into service because it ran out of pumpers. (Reserve pumpers had fallen to 11 in 2002 from 13 in July 2000, five fewer than required.) The department was also short three of the eight ladder trucks required for reserves. Few blamed city officials for not releasing $1.8 <b>million</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> six new pumpers, even though he spent $32,000 to purchase a new command vehicle and an undisclosed sum to buy himself and other commanders 14 new cars. The report also showed that fire truck drivers were inadequately trained and poorly supervised, and were having too many accidents. Because of the lack of reserve vehicles, drivers also continued to operate vehicles even though they should have turned them in for repair. This worsened the repair issues when the vehicle finally failed. Although Few ordered the six pumpers by June 2002, there were still too few trucks in reserve.|$|E

Then sometime in the next couple years it planned to sell the site for at least $85 million to a developer or developers, who in turn were expected to build a complex big enough to house about 15,000 Olympians.

[...] In {{the course of}} the war, North suffered damage to his waterworks, and one of his ships was sunk. [...] However he also befriended the Chilean Admiral Patricio Lynch who later supported him in his business ventures. [...] During the war, North was assisted by two British men: Robert Harvey, who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates (saltpetre) industry, and John Dawson, a banker. [...] North was able to use Harvey's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru's poor military performance during the war. [...] After the war, the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields, perhaps influenced by appeals from North's friends. [...] North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds. [...] The reason that the Chilean government allowed this is that it would have cost them GBP£4 <b>million</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators. [...] By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates.|$|E
