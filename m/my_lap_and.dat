500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E

Additionally, Rivers' relationship with her daughter had been strained at the time; according to Rivers, the confluence of events resulted in her contemplating suicide in her California home. [...] "I got the gun out, the whole thing," [...] she recalled in a 2008 interview. [...] "And [...] my dog came and sat in <b>my</b> <b>lap...</b> <b>and</b> {{that was a big}} turning point in my life. My little, stupid dog, a Yorkie, who I adored, literally came and sat on my lap....and literally, he saved my life. Truly saved my life." [...] Rivers eventually recovered with counseling and the support of her family.|$|E

5000|$|Going {{into the}} 2014 Winter Olympics Maltais {{was no longer}} a rookie Olympic competitor, though she still found herself as the {{youngest}} member of the women's short track team at those games. At the previous games she had not been invited to skate on the relay team and says that she was paralyzed with nerves, whereas going into these games she now found strength in her favour 1,000 and 1,500 m metre events where she liked leading from the front. Maltais talked about her strategy saying that [...] "Last year, I spent more time at the front and I think that it’s a strategy that works well for me. I have to learn to change <b>my</b> <b>laps</b> <b>and</b> to better control my speed, but I think that this could be a good strategy." [...] This strategy helped her at the national trials and Maltais competed in all three individual events as well as the relay in Sochi.|$|R

I remembered on <b>my</b> victory <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> I had {{to come down and}} throw a 3 out the window to pay respects to the man.

5000|$|Judging by his letters, {{the king}} had a great ability to whine {{whenever}} he felt insulted; shortly after Shamshi-Adad's death, tension between Išḫi-Addu and the Assyrian king's eldest son Ishme-Dagan I occurred. The king of Assyria asked for two horses from Qatna, {{and it seems that}} Išḫi-Addu asked for something in return, but Ishme-Dagan sent a small amount of the horses real value and seems to not have met Išḫi-Addu's request causing the latter to write an angry message, which was apparently intercepted in Mari by Yasmah-Adad who had interest in keeping his brother and father in law at peace. His letters concerning his daughter also reveal a man capable of compassion; he wrote Yasmah-Adad: [...] "I am placing in your <b>lap</b> <b>my</b> flesh <b>and</b> my future. Your maid i have given you, may god prove her attractive to you. I am placing in your <b>lap</b> <b>my</b> flesh <b>and</b> my future, for this throne ('house') has now become yours and Mari's has now become mine".|$|R
5000|$|Despite being six laps down, Brad Keselowski {{pulled the}} middle line {{up to the front}} to help another driver {{challenge}} Dale for the lead. Unfortunately, coming through turn 4, Keselowski got loose and spun {{out in front of the}} field and collected eleven other cars, including points leader Jeff Gordon, defending race winner David Ragan and pole sitter Brian Scott, in the Big One on lap 137. “I was trying to get to the front and trying to stay up there and trying ot get <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> back,’’ Keselowski said. “For some reason, the car took off on me and spun out. I feel bad that we tore up a bunch of cars. Certainly I wanted to get <b>my</b> <b>laps</b> back <b>and</b> have a shot to win at the end. The only way I was going to do that was by being really aggressive at the front of the field.’’ “He was driving really, really, really aggressively to get back up there,’’ Kenseth said of Keselowski. “I didn’t realize he was that many laps down. I don’t know what his strategy was but just lost control of his car in front of the field and when that happens it always collects a bunch of them." [...] Asked if he was bitter with the way Keselowski was racing, Kenseth said, “If it was the other way around and it was anybody else except for him, we’d all be getting lectured.’’ “I don’t know what he was doing,’’ Gordon said. “Obviously thinking that was going to be the way to get his lap back. All that it did was get a bunch of other cars wrecked.’’ Marcos Ambrose took over the lead by beating Dale off pit road.|$|R
60|$|When I {{had done}} so, {{he made me}} put them into <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> took my little drawer, and poured out all my money among his, and bade me get me gone, and carry it all home into my own chamber.|$|E
6000|$|We did put {{him down}} on the floor--there was no other place--with his head on <b>my</b> <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> I found strange voices asking him what Perrault had done to him. [...] "Oh! nothing! 'twasn't that. Yes, he's gone, out by the window." ...|$|E

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 126. This run {{was much}} like the second run in which the field settled into a rhythm of green flag racing. During this run, Harvick came up and hit the 78 car. Truex said after the race in his media availability that [...] "nothing led up to it. We hadn't been around each other all day, really. I passed him once earlier. I had fresh tires, he was <b>lapped</b> <b>and</b> that was after I had my flat (so) I was racing to get <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> back." [...] The next round of green flag stops began on lap 172. Johnson pitted from the lead the same <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> handed the lead to Keselowski. He pitted on <b>lap</b> 174 <b>and</b> the lead cycled back to Johnson. Busch was issued a pass through penalty for speeding on pit road.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} finance their plans to make {{wildlife}} documentaries, the couple travelled to Africa in 1950 {{to work on the}} feature film, King Solomon's Mines, in which Michaela acted as Deborah Kerr's double. In 1953 they made a new film together, Below The Sahara, and appeared on BBC radio to promote it. The BBC saw the couple's potential for television work, and in 1954 they produced a pioneering and successful TV programme, Filming Wild Animals. The quality of Armand Denis' film-making, combined with his heavy accent and Michaela's enthusiasm and glamorous appeal, made them fixtures on BBC TV screens in Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s. Accompanied by Armand's commentary, the two would be filmed getting as close to animals as possible, in a style later much parodied. Typically, there would be a trademark moment for Michaela to apply lipstick or comb her hair; she once commented that she could not possibly get into the water with crocodiles until she had put on her eyebrow pencil. The couple made several series for both BBC and ITV, including Filming In Africa (1955), Armand and Michaela Denis (1955-58), On Safari (1957-59), and Safari to Asia (1959-61), which were repeated until well into the 1960s. [...] Michaela Denis also wrote books, including Leopard in <b>My</b> <b>Lap</b> (1955) <b>and</b> Ride on a Rhino (1960).|$|R
40|$|As I {{was flying}} to San Francisco in late May {{to attend the}} annual meetingof the International Communication Association (ICA), the captain on my flight issued the {{following}} directive: “At this time, I would ask our lovely stewardesses {{to go ahead and}} restrain themselves for landing. ” My feminist sirens went off—did he really just say lovely and stewardesses (and restrain yourself) ? What were the implications of constructing that particular message versus “Flight attendants, please prepare for landing”? What sort of masculine posturing (whether intentional or not) had I just been witness to (and had the flight attendants been subjected to) ? At the time I (literally) had in <b>my</b> <b>lap</b> Karen Ashcraft <b>and</b> Dennis Mumby’s (2004) book Reworking Gender: A Feminist Communicology of Organization, which I was rereading for this review. I {{was on my way to}} an ICA precon-ference where, along with myself and other scholars, Karen and Dennis were talking with doctoral students about “differences that make a differ-ence. ” The experience was weirdly coincidental, because in applying their feminist communicology of organization, Ashcraft and Mumby analyze th...|$|R

She used to whip me with a twisted whip—a rawhide. The whip always left a black and blue mark on my body. I have now the black and blue marks on my head which were made by mamma, and also a cut {{on the left side of}} my forehead which was made by a pair of scissors. She struck me with the scissors and cut me; I have no recollection of ever having been kissed by any one—have never been kissed by mamma.
