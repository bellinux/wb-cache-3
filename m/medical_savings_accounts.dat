2500|$|In 2013, Smith {{introduced}} into the 113th Congress a similar but more expanded bill, H.R. 7, also titled the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, which, beyond its title prohibition, disallows as a medical income tax deduction any personal funds used for an abortion or expenses paid out of tax-exempt [...] "cafeteria" [...] health plans, or personally-funded Archer <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> (MSAs) or health savings accounts (HSAs). The bill also excludes from {{the definition of a}} “qualified health plan” any insurance coverage that includes abortions, rendering such plans ineligible for a tax credit to individuals or employers.

2500|$|HSAs {{are seen}} by proponents {{as a way}} to make {{healthcare}} more affordable and accessible in the U.S. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, which included provisions designed to stimulate the popularity of these plans, was passed by Congress in November 2003 and signed into law by President Bush in December 2003. The law expanded <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts,</b> renaming them Health Savings Accounts and created tax incentives to encourage adoption of high-deductible health plans. Banks were empowered to create HSAs, which deliver tax-free interest to the holders, who can then withdraw money tax free to pay for qualified expenditures. To qualify for an HSA, the purchaser must also have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance plan. Over time, participants are allowed to contribute more (cumulatively) to the savings account than would be required to fulfill their annual deductible for a given year (although annual limits on pre-tax contributions [...] are well below the annual deductible), and any unused portions of the account accrue without tax penalty so long as the funds are used only for qualified medical expenses.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, a <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> (MSA) {{refers to}} a <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> program, {{generally}} associated with self-employed individuals, in which tax-deferred deposits {{can be made for}} medical expenses. Withdrawals from the MSA are tax-free if used to pay for qualified medical expenses. The MSA must be coupled with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Withdrawals from MSA go toward paying the deductible expenses in a given year. MSA account funds can cover expenses related to most forms of health care, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care, whether the expenses were billed through the qualifying insurance or otherwise.|$|R

50|$|HSAs are {{one form}} of tax-preferenced health care {{spending}} accounts. Others include Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), Archer <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> (MSAs), which have been superseded by the new HSAs (although existing MSAs are grandfathered), and Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs). These accounts are most commonly used {{as part of an}} employee health benefit package. While there are currently no government-imposed limits to FSAs, legislation currently being reconciled between the House of Representatives and Senate would impose a cap of $2,500. While both the House and Senate bills would adjust the cap to inflation, approximately 7 million Americans who use their FSAs to cover out-of-pocket health care expenses greater than $2,500 would be forced to pay higher taxes and health care costs.|$|E

50|$|Independent Institute {{scholars}} {{have criticized the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on economic, legal, ethical, and privacy grounds. Senior Fellow John C. Goodman {{has argued that the}} ACA’s architects could not have foreseen all of its negative consequences because healthcare is a complex system. For this reason he claimed the ACA exemplifies what Nobel laureate economist F. A. Hayek called “the fatal conceit.” Independent Institute scholars were critical of the pre-ACA system as well for problems they attributed to government policies that promoted third-party payment systems and removed market pricing from healthcare delivery. Goodman has proposed reforms replacing the ACA, most notably the adoption of a fixed-sum, refundable tax credit for the purchase of health insurance, a credit equal to the cost of new enrollees in Medicaid. Other major proposals include converting all <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> into Roth-style Health Savings Accounts that feature after-tax deposits and tax-free withdrawals; allowing anyone to buy into or exit from Medicaid; and denationalizing and deregulating health insurance exchanges but requiring exchanges to offer health-status insurance.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, an FSA {{debit card}} only allow medical expenses. It {{is used by}} some banks for {{withdrawals}} from their FSAs, <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> (MSA), and health savings accounts (HSA) as well. They have Visa or MasterCard logos, but cannot be used as [...] "debit cards", only as [...] "credit cards". Furthermore, they are not accepted by all merchants that accept debit and credit cards, but only by those that specifically accept FSA debit cards. Merchant codes and product codes are used {{at the point of}} sale (required by law by certain merchants by certain states in the US) to restrict sales if they do not qualify. Because of the extra checking and documenting that goes on, later, the statement can be used to substantiate these purchases for tax deductions. In the occasional instance that a qualifying purchase is rejected, another form of payment must be used (a check or payment from another account and a claim for reimbursement later). In the more likely case that non-qualifying items are accepted, the consumer is technically still responsible, and the discrepancy could be revealed during an audit. A small but growing segment of the debit card business in the U.S. involves access to tax-favored spending accounts such as FSAs, HRAs, and HSAs. Most of these debit cards are for medical expenses, though a few are also issued for dependent care and transportation expenses.|$|E

40|$|In {{times of}} ever-rising health {{expenditures}} {{it is becoming}} more and more obvious that conventional models for funding health care are increasingly experiencing difficulties in meeting up this challenge. The concept of <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> (MSAs) represents an innovative and so far rarely analysed alternative for the funding of health care systems. In this concept an anticipated amount of money needed is saved up ex ante by each individual in a special account set aside to cover health care expenses. Since, however, health care expenses for certain kinds of treatment frequently exceed the financial capacity of the individual, <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> are normally introduced in combination with health insurance covering defined services with higher financial risk. From a theoretical point of view the MSA concept helps counteracting the phenomenon of moral hazard in health insurance systems and at the same time coping with the future challenges posed by demographic development. This paper also examines first experiences gained so far with the implementation and use of <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> in different countries. It draws a mixed but rather positive picture of the results. Therefore it could be feasible to integrate certain elements of this concept into health care systems of European countries. [...] Das Konzept der <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> als Instrument zur Finanzierung von Gesundheitssystemen hat in den letzten Jahren international Aufmerksamkeit erregt. Länder wie Singapur, Südafrika, China und die USA haben diese neue Form der Finanzierung bereits eingeführt oder in Pilotprojekten erprobt. Dieser Beitrag gibt zunächst einen Überblick über Erfahrungen, die einzelne Länder bisher mit der Konzeption der <b>Medical</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Accounts</b> gemacht haben. Er geht auf aktuelle Entwicklungen in diesen Ländern ein. Außerdem wird anhand erster Ergebnisse aufgezeigt, dass sich das Modell der Gesundheitssparkonten sowohl als Tarifmodell für private Krankenversicherung sowie als konstitutiver Bestandteil eines gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungssystems bewährt hat. Abschließend wird vorgeschlagen, bestimmte Elemente dieses Systems in die Krankenversicherungssysteme Europas zu integrieren. ...|$|E
50|$|A health <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> (HSA) is a tax-advantaged <b>medical</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> {{available}} to taxpayers in the United States who {{are enrolled in}} a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The funds contributed to an account {{are not subject to}} federal income tax at the time of deposit. Unlike a flexible spending account (FSA), HSA funds roll over and accumulate year to year if they are not spent. HSAs are owned by the individual, which differentiates them from company-owned Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA) that are an alternate tax-deductible source of funds paired with either HDHPs or standard health plans.|$|R
