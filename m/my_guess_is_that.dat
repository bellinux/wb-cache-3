The Economist noted that the [...] "publishing model is fascinating in its own right". A hardback version, which Cowen dubbed [...] "the retrogression", was published in June 2011.

2500|$|The film's opening {{scenes are}} not great filmmaking. They're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation, murky and heavy on theory.

It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the 2006 NFL season, rumors {{circulated}} that Ferentz {{may have}} been in consideration for the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coaching job after Bill Cowher stepped down. However, before Cowher's departure, Ferentz was asked about his possible interest in the position, and stated: [...] "I know that staff pretty well and they've got some good guys in <b>that</b> building. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that's</b> where they would go. But I’m not interested, and I doubt they are, either. I’ve got a great job right here." [...] The Steelers job eventually went to Mike Tomlin.|$|R
5000|$|Democrats {{were also}} {{critical}} of the negotiating process. House Minority Leader Frank Dermody lividly complained that Republicans didn't share their proposed plan until Monday. [...] "And <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>my</b> colleague had a significant more amount time to review the plan. Frankly, I look at is as a classic bait and switch," [...] Dermody said.|$|R
5000|$|However, Michael Oliver of Gramophone {{described}} it as [...] "a disappointing piece." [...] Despite noting its [...] "vivid, subtle or mysterious sonorities," [...] Oliver wrote, [...] "Its six [...] mostly brief movements are spasmodic rather than cumulative, the overall effect being of unrelated events that {{might just as well}} be played in a different order; <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Ginastera simply got bogged down in the piece." ...|$|R

40|$|PHYSICAL THERAPY. This was an excel-lent article {{describing}} a common prob-lem <b>that</b> has rarely <b>been</b> evaluated closely. Like the author, I am a former ballet dancer and teacher. Everything in ballet {{is done with}} the feet plantar flexed, which promotes stretching of the tibialis anterior muscle. There are no dance moves or warm-up exercises, however, routinely given to strengthen the mus-cle. The tibialis anterior muscle {{may in fact be}} weak. This factor needs further investigation and study, but <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> this combination of fac-tors causes the many cases of shin splints in ballet dancers...|$|R

60|$|Guess again. Perhaps it {{was there}} always, from the {{beginning}} of the world? My dear child, you have no proof of that either. Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done. Besides, I told you not that Madam How had made the glen, but <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> making it, and as yet has only half finished. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> my first guess; and <b>my</b> next <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> water <b>is</b> making the glen--water, and nothing else.|$|R

40|$|A symbol {{is unique}} {{as a form}} of {{communication}} in that it holds no meaning standing alone, but rather gains meaning by people. As such a symbol can sometimes lead one astray for its meaning is liquid. A symbol that once represented something beautiful can be used by a sinister group, and through that become an icon of evil. Such a symbol can be found here at Gettysburg College: the Swastika. I found this symbol decorating the floor tiles of the second floor entrance to Breidenbaugh Hall. What the symbol represents may not be as ambiguous as it may seem, as the Swastika has been around almost as long as man has, its significance ever changing. I had a hunch as to its meaning but in order to uncover what indeed was behind this symbol when it was first laid down I must examine multiple the conditions under which the building was constructed, and the times in which it was completed. I had an idea as to the meaning of the symbol in Breidenbaugh Hall before I started my research. The swastika <b>is</b> a symbol <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> around for a very long time, its common use beginning as early as 1000 B. C. 1 Needless to say, the symbol’s meaning changed over the years granting it volumes of uses. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the swastika on the floor of Breidenbaugh meant good luck. I had first heard about that meaning behind the swastika when I saw the nose cone of Charles Lindbergh’s airplane at the Air and Space museum: the nose cone has a swastika in its center. Mind you that Lindberg flew in 19272 which was a good seven years after Hitler made the swastika the Nazi part...|$|R
40|$|Sitting at the LSE IDEAS ‘Lessons of Northern Ireland’ event, it was fanciful {{to think}} of ‘who was bugging who’ during the peace process. Around {{the table at the}} seminar we had Jonathan Powell (Tony Blair’s chief of staff for the Northern Ireland talks), Martin Mansergh (the Irish Taoiseach’s special {{representative}} on the Northern Ireland talks), Tim Dalton (from the Irish Ministry of Justice who collated Irish government intelligence files), David Trimble (the former leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and a leading player in the peace process), and Barbara de Bruin (a member of Sinn Féin’s negotiating team). Is it beyond the bounds of possibility that Jonathan Powell, or Tim Dalton, were privy to the transcripts of telephone calls and other surreptitiously recorded conversations of the people with whom they now shared a seminar room? <b>My</b> educated <b>guess</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Jonathan, Tim and many others know a lot more than they are prepared, or allowed, to tell us...|$|R
5000|$|By having Fritz and Clerval with Frankenstein, {{there is}} a {{diffusion}} {{of responsibility for the}} creation of the Hobgoblin. Fritz states to Clerval, [...] "Now <b>my</b> shrewd <b>guess,</b> sir, <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> like Dr. Faustus, my master is raising the devil," [...] sharing that he has a good idea of what Frankenstein is up to (Presumption, Act 1, Scene 1). Neither Clerval nor Fritz try to stop Frankenstein {{in the midst of his}} work, even though they show concern for his welfare. The creation of the Creature happens off stage, during which the audience hears Victor Frankenstein cry 'it lives!', and then run on stage as his creation breaks out of the laboratory and reveals itself to the audience. Frankenstein draws a sword and points it at the Creature, who promptly snatches it and breaks it in two. Throwing Victor Frankenstein to the floor, the Creature runs up the staircase and exits the building through a window.|$|R

5000|$|On January 12, 1975, Agee {{testified before}} the second Bertrand Russell Tribunal in Brussels that in 1960 he had {{conducted}} personal name-checks of Venezuelan employees for a Venezuelan subsidiary {{of what is now}} Exxon. Exxon was [...] "letting the CIA assist in employment decisions, and <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those name checks...are continuing to this day". Agee stated that the CIA customarily performed this service for subsidiaries of large U.S. corporations throughout Latin America. An Exxon spokesman denied Agee's accusations.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, {{computer}} scientist Ivar Jacobson (a {{major contributor to}} UML and pioneer in OO software development) gave his assessment of enterprise architecture: [...] "Around the world introducing an Enterprise Architecture EA has been an initiative for most financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, government, etc.) {{for the last five}} years or so, and it is not over. I have been working with such companies and helped some of them to avoid making the worst mistakes. Most EA initiatives failed. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> more than 90% never really resulted in anything useful." ...|$|E
60|$|But while Emily Brontë was as unsociable as a storm at midnight, {{and while}} Charlotte Brontë was at best like that warmer and more {{domestic}} thing, {{a house on}} fire--they do connect themselves with the calm of George Eliot, as the forerunners of many later developments of the feminine advance. Many forerunners (if it comes to that) would have felt rather ill if they had seen the things they foreran. This notion of a hazy anticipation of after history has been absurdly overdone: as when men connect Chaucer with the Reformation; which is like connecting Homer with the Syracusan Expedition. But it is to some extent true that all these great Victorian women {{had a sort of}} unrest in their souls. And the proof of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> (after what I will claim to call the healthier time of Dickens and Thackeray) it began to be admitted by the great Victorian men. If there had not <b>been</b> something in <b>that</b> irritation, we should hardly have had to speak in these pages of Diana of the Crossways or of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. To what this strange and very local sex war has been due I shall not ask, because I have no answer. <b>That</b> it <b>was</b> due to votes or even little legal inequalities about marriage, I feel myself here too close to realities even to discuss. <b>My</b> own <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it has <b>been</b> due to the great neglect of the military spirit by the male Victorians. The woman felt obscurely <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> still running her mortal risk, while the man was not still running his. But I know nothing about it; nor does anybody else.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{press release}} via The Salvation Army, Mr Dunn stated, [...] "When our whanau arrive at rehab, we {{discover}} how {{some of them have}} been living—and the effects of this on their kids. Many onlookers could say that we do things to excess, and maybe <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true. Our journey so far has been about learning. We still do and get things wrong because we don’t necessarily know how to do things differently. I ask my leaders all the time to consider changing what they know for a different way. I haven’t always had total acceptance of this journey. It continues to be one step at a time.....As our rehabs have progressed—we have just had our fifth rehab programme—I ask myself, has this journey been worth it? I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> every time I bury another one of my bros, my gut turns, and so I keep going on this journey. I remind myself of where we have come from and our vision to see our children free. Our vision to know and understand values that see us embrace <b>that</b> which we <b>are</b> good at: being whanau, looking out for each other, and having a good future for our kids." ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the term}} of School Improvement has been often used by many people in search of better schools in Japan. This concept does not {{separate}} functions of school external conditions from internal ones. And it insists {{on the importance of}} doing on school 2 ̆ 7 s own initiative. Now many people are searching for making internal and external conditions of an individual school function syntheticaly based on the school 2 ̆ 7 s own will and need. For the past years, many studies have explained what conditions can promote improving school. Nevertheless we cannot find many schools improved in our country. Why can 2 ̆ 7 t we do it? It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> there <b>is</b> anything <b>that</b> prevents the promoting conditions from functioning well enough. And I wonder if some obstacles exist in the structure of consciousness of teachers, principals, and school boards. The purpose of this paper <b>is</b> to explain <b>that</b> structure. In order to do it, I try to find teachers 2 ̆ 7, principals 2 ̆ 7, and school boards 2 ̆ 7 opinions about obstacles to improve their school. After that I try to find some discrepancies among them.

5000|$|... p.90: <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it has to}} do {{with the}} fact that Einstein made the {{physical}} interpretation of the Lorentz transformation the basis for a remarkably clear and simple discussion of the electrodynamics of moving bodies, whereas Poincaré's remarks on the physical interpretation of Lorentz transformed quantities may have struck Lorentz as inconsequential philosophical asides in expositions that otherwise closely followed his own. I also have a sense that Lorentz found Einstein's physically very intuitive approach more appealing than Poincaré's rather abstract but mathematically more elegant approach.|$|E
50|$|<b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> writing centers {{will more}} and more define {{themselves}} as multiliteracy centers. Many are already doing so - tutoring oral presentations, adding online tutorials, offering workshops in evaluating web sources, being more conscious of document design. To my mind, the new digital literacies will increasingly be incorporated into writing centers not just as sources of information or delivery systems for tutoring but as productive arts in their own right, and writing center work will, if anything, become more rhetorical in {{paying attention to the}} practices and effects of design in written and visual communication— more product oriented and perhaps less like the composing conferences of the process movement.|$|E
5000|$|No law {{of physics}} or biology forbids cheap travel and {{settlement}} {{all over the}} solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take.

40|$|In this Project, I {{examine the}} {{classical}} organization life cycle {{in a critical}} realistic perspective, {{on the basis of}} the observation and realization that modern organizations today, react and organize differently, than suggested by the classic life cycle model – The question <b>is,</b> why? <b>My</b> <b>guess,</b> or hypothesis, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a need for innovation and creativity, has radically changed the way organizations organize, which this project illustrate through a case study of the Danish shopping-outlet Designers & Friends. Through interviews and observations, I have been able to draw a picture of the cultural and structural aspects of the organization Designers & Friends, structuring my analyses according to Mintzberg and Shein, which I have compared to the comprehensive theory existing within the topic of innovation and characteristics of innovative business structures and cultures. I find <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> highly plausible, <b>that</b> a focus on innovation and creativity is the reason organizations act and organize differently than suggested by the classical lifecycle theory, provided by many, but in this project, exemplified in the work of Larry Greiner. Furthermore, I suggest that a focus on innovation, and organizing businesses in a way so that structures and cultures supports innovation is crucial to the success of any business, with reference to a change in the market dynamics due to a shift from industrialization to a knowledge based society, globalization, and hence an intensive competitive marked structure. With this project, I therefore suggest that research in this area should be done more extensively, so that stakeholders and small business owners do not make the critical mistake of making big organizational decisions based on lifecycle-theory that does not take into consideration the growing necessity of innovation in doing successful business...|$|R
