5|$|DST {{inherits}} and can <b>magnify</b> {{the disadvantages}} of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for {{it along with}} time zone and natural discrepancies. Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.|$|E

50|$|An {{ordinary}} <b>magnifying</b> {{glass is}} a kind of spherical lens. In a simple spherical lens, each surface is a portion of a sphere. When a spherical lens acts as a magnifier, it <b>magnifies</b> equally in all meridians. Here, note that the <b>magnified</b> letters are <b>magnified</b> both in height and in width.|$|R
5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help <b>magnify</b> his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and <b>magnify</b> to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E
5|$|By {{the events}} of Drakengard 3, Zero had forged a {{partnership}} with the dragon Michael: as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help Zero kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower. Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with Zero losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually: after killing one, Zero takes on their disciple, a servant created to <b>magnify</b> the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude. During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail-safe in the event of Zero's victory.|$|E

5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably <b>magnify</b> harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{depletion}} would <b>magnify</b> all of {{the effects}} of UV on human health, both positive (including production of Vitamin D) and negative (including sunburn, skin cancer, and cataracts). In addition, increased surface UV leads to increased tropospheric ozone, which is a health risk to humans.|$|E
25|$|True {{leg length}} {{inequality}} may sometimes {{be caused by}} improper implant selection. The femoral component may be too large and stick out of the femur farther than needed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we tackle {{the problem of}} <b>magnifying</b> an image without {{incurring}} blurring, ringing or other artifacts common to classical schemes. The proposed iterative scheme starts with an initial <b>magnified</b> image generated by a process of selective interpolation. By placing suitable constraints on the final <b>magnified</b> image, which are convex in nature, we show that magnification can be posed as a problem of finding a solution which lies {{at the intersection of}} convez sets. By avoiding explicit high frequency enhancing assumptions in the iterative process, we avoid edge enhancement artifacts in the <b>magnified</b> image. ...|$|R
40|$|Students {{will learn}} about {{magnification}} {{and how a}} <b>magnifying</b> lens works.

The purpose of this activity is for students to learn about observation skills and how tools can help people make observations, what "magnification" means, and to learn that scientists use tools, such as <b>magnifying</b> lenses, to examine objects. Students will be able to identify a <b>magnifying</b> glass and its purposes. They will be able to describe how the same object looks different when using the unaided eye versus a <b>magnifying</b> lens. Educational levels: Primary elementary, Intermediate elementary...|$|R
40|$|The {{cross grid}} encoder is a {{diffraction}} grating type encoder to measure two-dimensional {{position of a}} optical head by using a grid plate, and is widely used in the industry to evaluate the two-dimensional contouring performance of a machine tool. In the graphical display of measured contouring error profiles, the error is often <b>magnified</b> to some given scale {{with respect to the}} reference trajectory. The conventional algorithm to compute the <b>magnified</b> contouring error profile, adopted in a commercial software to analyze an error profile measured by the cross grid encoder, makes the <b>magnified</b> trajectory discontinuous when the given reference trajectory is unsmooth, which makes it difficult to understand the <b>magnified</b> trajectory especially at corners. This paper proposes a new algorithm to compute the <b>magnified</b> trajectory of two-dimensional contouring error profiles such that the <b>magnified</b> trajectory becomes continuous even when the reference trajectory is unsmooth. Application examples are presented with error profiles obtained by using a cross grid encoder applied to a commercial machining center...|$|R

50|$|Some {{kinds of}} <b>magnifying</b> glasses, made {{specifically}} for reading wide columns of print, are cylindrical lenses. For a simple cylindrical lens, {{the surfaces of}} the lens are portions of a cylinder's surface. Consider how this would refract light. When a cylindrical lens acts as a magnifier, it <b>magnifies</b> only in one direction. For example, the magnifier shown <b>magnifies</b> letters only in height, not in width.|$|R
25|$|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek {{made more}} than 500 optical lenses. He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of {{magnification}} up to 275 times. It is suspected that van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could <b>magnify</b> up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.|$|E
25|$|The aim of any {{microscope}} is to <b>magnify</b> images or {{photos of}} a small object and to see fine details. In forensic; the type of specimen, the information one wishes to obtain from it {{and the type of}} microscope chosen for the task will determine if the sample preparation is required. For example, ink lines, blood stains or bullets, no treatment is required and the evidence shows directly from appropriate microscope without any form of sample preparation, but for traces of particular matter, the sample preparation must be done before microscopical examination occurs.|$|E
