40|$|ABSTRACT−This paper {{proposes a}} stereo vision-based forward {{obstacle}} detection and distance <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> In <b>general,</b> stereo vision-based obstacle detection methods in automotive applications {{can be classified}} into two categories: IPM (Inverse Perspective Mapping) -based and disparity histogram-based. The existing disparity histogram-based method was developed for stop-and-go applications. The proposed method extends {{the scope of the}} disparity histogram-based method to highway applications by 1) replacing the fixed rectangular ROI (Region Of Interest) with the traveling lanebased ROI, and 2) replacing the peak detection with a constant threshold with peak detection using the threshold-line and peakness evaluation. In order to increase the true positive rate while decreasing the false positive rate, multiple candidate peaks were generated and then verified by the edge feature correlation method. By testing the proposed method with images captured on the highway, it was shown that the proposed method was able to overcome problems in previous implementations while being applied successfully to highway collision warning/avoidance conditions. In addition, comparisons with laser radar showed that vision sensors with a wider FOV (Field Of View) provided faster responses to cutting-in vehicles. Finally, we integrated the proposed method into a longitudinal collision avoidance system. Experimental results showed that activated braking by risk assessment using the state of the ego-vehicle and measuring the distance to upcoming obstacles could successfully prevent collisions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} effect of maxillary {{expansion}} on orthodontics. MethodsEight beagle dogs were randomly divided into two groups, with 4 dogs in each group. Dogs in group 1 were executed immediately and received the direct physical measurement. The magnetic expansion appliance was used in group 2 for the maxillary expansion. After the expansion, the model was taken again and they were executed after cone beam CT (CBCT) scanning. The model <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> was adopted in group 1 to measure the dental measurement indicators and width of base bone arch. The CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> was employed to measure the above dental indicators and bone indicators. The difference in the indicators measured by different methods was compared and analyzed. ResultsBefore the expansion, {{there was no significant}} difference in the bone measurement indicators between the CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and direct physical <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> After the expansion, {{there was no significant difference}} in indicators between the CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and direct physical measurement. But there was significant difference among the model <b>measurement</b> <b>method,</b> CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and direct physical <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> There was the significant difference in the dental indicators between the CBCT <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and model <b>measurement,</b> as well as the bone indicators of posterior marginal spacing of greater palatine foramen, posterior marginal spacing of incisive foramen, width of base bone arch and spacing of implant anchorage.

40|$|An in situ {{aberration}} <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> using a {{two dimensional}} (2 D) phase-shift ring mask {{has been proposed}} for lithographic projection lenses, which is more accurate and faster than AMAI-PCA method.

Assessing body {{composition}} {{is important to}} provide information about nutritional status and health risks. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if there is a significant difference in {{body composition}} depending on <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and if the discrepancy in <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> is greater for amputees than for non-amputees. Methods: 23 subjects (12 lower limb amputees and 11 non-amputees) were matched based on sex, age, height, weight, ethnicity, and self-reported activity level. Subject’s body composition was assessed through Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) using a Lunar Prodigy whole body scanner (GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI), Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA) using an OMRON (Bannockburn, IL) hand-held body fat analyzer, and the Skinfold Technique with calipers from Cambridge Scientific Industries, Inc. (Cambridge, Maryland). Results: 2 -way ANOVA for % body fat by <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and percent body fatness showed a main effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> (p= 0. 02). Post hoc showed significant difference between BIA & DEXA (p= 0. 01). There was no interaction effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and body fatness (average vs. above average) p= 0. 77. 2 way ANOVA for % body fat by <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and type of individual (amputee vs. non-amputee) showed a main effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> (p= 0. 03). Post hoc showed significant difference between BIA & DEXA (p= 0. 04). There was no interaction effect for <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> and type of individual (p= 0. 70). Conclusions: There is a significant difference in body composition depending on <b>measurement</b> <b>method.</b> There is a trend for body composition to differ more by method for subjects with above average % body fat than for subjects with average % body fat. Likewise, there is a trend for body composition to differ more by method for amputees than for non-amputees...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the feasibility of the time domain electromagnetic interference (TDEMI) <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> in MIL-STD- 461 F compliance measurements. In the TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>method,</b> the <b>measurement</b> in time domain is performed with digital oscilloscope. After time domain measurement, comparable frequency domain amplitude spectrum is produced by Discrete Fourier Transform and by other signal processing with PC. The pros and cons of TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> compared to frequency domain <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> are also evaluated in {{this research}} as well as statistical properties of TDEMI measurement results. The research is divided in three major parts. The first part of the research is a literature review of the most essential publications related to TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>methods</b> and the introduction to the CE 102 test method which was studied as an example. The second and {{the most important part of}} the research is the building up the TDEMI measurement system and EMI measurements with built system. Improvements for the TDEMI measurement system are also introduced in the second part. The third part is the evaluation of the built TDEMI measurement system. This is done by statistical analysis of measurement results and by comparative measurements with standard frequency domain measurement system. The conclusion of the research is that the TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> is a feasible low-cost alternative for the frequency domain measurements in MIL-STD- 461 F CE 102 measurements. In most of the practical cases the TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> is more time consuming than the CE 102 frequency domain measurement, but if the interference signal contains infrequent phenomena, TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> may save time. The building up a TDEMI measurement system requires deep knowledge in measurement technology and in signal processing. The TDEMI <b>measurement</b> <b>method</b> has also many benefits and it seems to be developable method. Possible further research areas are related to application of different window functions in the algorithm for narrowband interference and to measurements of transient interference signals with TDEMI measurement system...|$|R
