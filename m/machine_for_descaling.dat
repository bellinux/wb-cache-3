40|$|The {{conversion}} of geothermal energy into usable electrical power {{has become increasingly}} important to the overall national energy needs. A major area of technical interest which has resulted from the initial development of geothermal power plants is the scale formation developed in the facility pipes and related components. This scale formation {{is due to the}} concentration of minerals in the geothermal water and steam. The current state-of-technology utilized <b>for</b> <b>descaling</b> consists of a combination of sandblasting, water blasting, acid soaking and scraping. These cleaning methods, used individually or collectively, do not provide an acceptable descaling operation due to excessive facility downtime and cost...|$|R
50|$|A {{shower head}} is a {{perforated}} nozzle that distributes water over solid angle {{a focal point}} of use, generally overhead the bather. A shower uses less water than a full immersion in a bath. Some shower heads can be adjusted to spray different patterns of water, such as massage, gentle spray, strong spray, and intermittent pulse or combination modes. Hard water may result in calcium and magnesium deposits clogging the head, reducing the flow and changing the spray pattern. <b>For</b> <b>descaling,</b> various acidic chemicals or brushes can be used or some heads have rubber-like jets that can be manually descaled. A homemade remedy is to immerse it in a solution of water and vinegar for a while, since the vinegar is able to dissolve limescale.|$|R

A parameter study is conducted which identifies regions of good hydrodynamic efficiency. In the limit of very large acceleration the model is seen to become planar {{and can be used}} to treat some large aspect ratio shells. A model of charged particle beam driven ablation is presented. The ablation resulting from this form of energy deposition can resemble laser driven albation in some cases, but qualitatively different behavior occurs in certain regimes of the beam power and range. Laser energy deposition by inverse bremsstrahlung is also included. A procedure <b>for</b> <b>descaling</b> the dimensionless results of the steady flow model is presented.

40|$|Scale is {{probably}} a more severe problem in the minerals industry than other process industries.

Gibbsite scale formation in Bayer process equipment is a natural consequence of supersaturated solutions that are generated throughout theprocess. The article describes one example applications: the fluid flow characteristics on scale deposition in a concentric reducer using Reynolds stress model are analysed. Reynolds stress simulation method to analyse the fluid dynamics behaviour of water as it flows through a concentric reducer commonly used in the Bayer plant is presented. The simulation results show a significant variation of the stream-wise and cross-stream components of the fluctuating velocity as flow passes through the concentric reducer...|$|R
40|$|In this study, two silicon-containing steels with {{different}} P contents were used, and reheating {{tests were conducted}} in an industrial furnace in a hot strip plant. The effect of P on the microstructure and melting temperature of Fe 2 SiO 4 in silicon-containing steels was investigated using a backscattered electron (BSE) detector and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The melting process of Fe 2 SiO 4 was also observed in situ for the two steels {{with different}} P contents. The {{results show that the}} addition of P could lower the melting point of the eutectic compound Fe 2 SiO 4 /FeO, which is helpful <b>for</b> <b>descaling</b> the oxide scale. The melting point decreases with the increasing P content, and the melting point of Fe 2 SiO 4 /FeO can reduce up to 954. 2 °C when the content of P reaches 0. 115 wt %. Furthermore, P-compounds form in the dispersive particles located in the iron matrix near the interface between the matrix and inner oxide scale when the P content is relatively high. In addition, a method of in situ observation was proposed to study the effect of P on the melting point of Fe 2 SiO 4 /FeO in silicon-containing steel. The results are of more practical significance <b>for</b> the <b>descaling</b> of oxide scale in silicon-containing steel...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} more {{efficient}} technique <b>for</b> <b>descaling</b> hard silica scales is urgently {{needed in order to}} exploit geothermal energy resources economically. With this objective in mind, DAEDALEAN ASSOCIATES, Incorporated is engaged in a research and development program utilizing the phenomenon of cavitation <b>for</b> cleaning and <b>descaling</b> under the sponsorship of ERDA, Division of Geothermal Research. The highlights of the research carried out so far under this program is reviewed in this presentation. Various effects of the phenomenon of cavitation erosion are presented. The intensity of cavitation erosion and its use in descaling applications are explained. The parameters governing the intensity of erosion are discussed. The overall objectives of the program are to demonstrate the engineering feasibility of utilizing cavitation and to generate engineering design data for its application in geothermal technology. The test facility used for this research consists of flow equipment, test chamber, and associated instrumentation. The performance of cavitating nozzles have been evaluated over a range of sizes. The intensity of erosion for one specific nozzle has been measured. The cleaning rates, the quality of cleaned surface and the intensity margin available so as not to damage the pipe wall have been determined for this specific design.

The system is designed to remove coatings from steel, concrete, brick, and wood. The Scaler uses 3 M ROTO-PEEN tungsten carbide cutters, while the CORNER-CUTTER(R) uses solid needles <b>for</b> <b>descaling</b> activities. These are used with the VAC-PAC(R) vacuum system to capture dust and debris as removal of the coating takes place. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on two main areas of exposure: dust and noise. Dust exposure was minimal, but noise exposure was significant. Further testing for each exposure is recommended, since the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may skew the results. It is feasible that dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other areas of concern found were arm-hand vibration, whole-body vibration, ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, electrical hazards, machine guarding, and lockout/tagout...|$|R

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. Fluid flow phenomenon in a concentric reducer is modelled by computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach to examine the role of fluid velocity in scale formation. Scale formation in alumina refineries is a common phenomenon and it occurs where supersaturated solutions are in contact with solid surfaces. It often leads to serious on-going technical problems and is {{a major cause of}} production loss due to equipment downtime required <b>for</b> <b>descaling</b> and cleaning operations. The scale formation mechanism in Bayer process equipment is complex and is not yet fully understood. Numerous researchers indicate that scale growth is strongly affected by fluid velocity while also influenced by a number of other factors such as the quality of bauxite ore, rheological properties of fluid, turbulence and inertia of suspended particles and adhesive property of particles. A numerical study using the Finite Volume Method to analyse the fluid dynamics behaviour of water as it flows through a concentric reducer commonly used in the Bayer plant is presented. The simulation results show a significant variation of the stream-wise (u′) and crossstream (u′) components of the fluctuating velocity as flow passes through the concentric reducer. am 201...|$|R
