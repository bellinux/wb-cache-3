The co-precipitation approach has been used extensively to produce ferrite nanoparticles of controlled sizes and magnetic properties.

50|$|Another {{shortcoming}} of Sverdrup's {{model was}} that he did not consider the role of active turbulence in the mixed layer. Upper ocean turbulence can result from many sources, including thermal convection, wind, waves, and Langmuir circulation. It mixes the upper layer by overturning fluid and particles, reducing the stratification in which spring blooms thrive. Huisman et al. (1999) proposed a critical turbulence mechanism in addition to critical depth that explains how spring blooms can be initiated {{even in the absence of}} surface-warming stratification. This mechanism relies on a critical turbulence level over which vertical <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> due to turbulence is higher than phytoplankton growth rate. When the atmospheric cooling becomes weak in the spring, turbulence subsides rapidly, but the mixed layer takes a longer time to react; restratification of the mixed layer occurs on timescales of weeks to months, while reduction of turbulence takes effect almost immediately after forcing stops (i.e. after atmospheric cooling shifts to warming). This could explain why the onset of the bloom can occur prior to the time when the mixed layer restratifies above the critical depth; reduced turbulence ceases overturning, allowing phytoplankton to have a longer residence time in the photic zone to bloom.|$|E

40|$|A steady, laminar {{stagnation}} flow configuration {{is adopted}} to investigate numerically {{the interaction between}} condensing aerosol particles and gas-phase transport across a canonical mixing layer. The <b>mixing</b> <b>rates</b> are varied by adjusting the velocity and length scales of the stagnation flow parametrically. The effect of <b>mixing</b> <b>rates</b> on particle concentration, polydispersity, and mean droplet diameter is explored and discussed. This numerical study reveals a complex response of the aerosol to varying flow times. Depending on the flow time, the variation of the particle concentration in response to varying <b>mixing</b> <b>rates</b> falls {{into one of the}} two regimes. For fast <b>mixing</b> <b>rates,</b> the number density and volume fraction of the condensing particles increase with residence time (nucleation regime). On the contrary, for low <b>mixing</b> <b>rates,</b> number density decreases with residence time and volume fraction reaches a plateau (condensation regime). It is shown that vapor scavenging by the aerosol phase is key to explaining the transition between these two regimes. The results reported here are general and illustrate genuine features of the evolution of aerosols forming by condensation of supersaturated vapor from heat and mass transport across mixing layers...|$|R

The <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> was controlled using three small crucibles with a hole of different diameters in their bottom. The effect of <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> and temperature on the microstructure of the primary Si-phase during the mixing of molten Al and Al- 30 %Si was studied. The results showed that when the diameter of the small crucible bottom hole is 16 mm, a higher mass <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 217 kg·s- 1 would results in a lower stream velocity 0. 414 m·s- 1. Conversely a lower mass <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 114 kg·s- 1 (the diameter of the small crucible bottom hole is 8 mm) would result in a higher fluid stream velocity 0. 879 m·s- 1. A lower mass <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> would be better to refine the primary Si than a higher mass <b>mixing</b> <b>rate.</b> Meanwhile, the morphology and distribution of primary Si could also be improved.

While this transport {{plays an important}} role in the climate system, especially in the Southern Ocean, we lack a, comprehensive understanding of what sets <b>mixing</b> <b>rates.</b> This thesis seeks to advance this understanding through three related studies. First, <b>mixing</b> <b>rates</b> are diagnosed from an eddy-resolving state estimate of the Southern Ocean, revealing a meridional cross-section of effective diffusivity shaped by the interplay between eddy propagation and mean flow. Effective diffusivity diagnostics are then applied to quantify surface <b>mixing</b> <b>rates</b> globally, using a, kinematic model with velocities derived from satellite observations; the diagnosed <b>mixing</b> <b>rates</b> show a rich spatial structure, with especially strong mixing in the tropics and western-boundary-current regions. Finally, an idealized numerical model of the Southern Ocean is analyzed, focusing on the response to changes in win(stress.

The <b>mixing</b> <b>rate</b> is independent of the numerical parameters and can relate to the rate of reduction of the scale of segregation.
