25|$|The British Rallycross Circuit at Brands Hatch was {{designed}} and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins. It is approx. 0.9 <b>miles</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> completed around 1981.

Through the left-right Esses at the bottom, the circuit rejoins the Indy Circuit to travel up and round Druids hairpin, before a 90-degree left through Langley's Gap and across the knife-edge, rejoining the Indy Circuit, but travelling anti-clockwise. From Cooper Straight, the cars swoop up the old link road and back to Paddock.|$|E

The North Aral Sea Project’s main initiative is {{the construction of a}} dam across the Berg Strait, a deep channel which connects the North Aral Sea to the South Aral Sea.

25|$|Even {{though the}} base of the salient was nearly broken, Lucas was able to bolster the British 1st Division's {{defenses}} with the newly arrived 168th Brigade (from the 56th Division, containing 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles, 1st Battalion, London Scottish, 10th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment). The 3rd Brigade had been tasked with holding the tip of the salient 2 <b>miles</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> 1,000 yards wide on the road going north of Campoleone, but after the German attacks {{in the early hours of}} 4 February, the 2nd Battalion, Sherwood Foresters, 1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry and 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment (all of 3rd Brigade) had been cut off and were surrounded in the pocket. They held the line all day, taking heavy casualties, but were eventually ordered to pull back and made a fighting retreat at 5pm to the Factory with the aid of artillery, and a successful assault launched by the London Scottish, of 168th Brigade, supported by the 46th Royal Tank Regiment (46 RTR). From February5 to February7 both sides employed heavy artillery concentrations and bombers to disrupt the other side and at 21:00 on February7 the Germans renewed their attack. Once more the fighting was fierce and they managed to infiltrate between the 5th Battalion, Grenadier Guards (24th Guards Brigade) and the 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment (2nd Brigade) and nearly surrounded them and it was during this period that Major William Sidney, a company commander in the 5th Grenadier Guards, was awarded the Victoria Cross and drove the Germans out of a nearby gully. Slowly the Allies were forced to give ground and by February10 they had been pushed out of the salient. Lucas ordered attacks on February11 to regain the lost ground but the Germans, forewarned by a radio intercept, repelled the Allies' poorly coordinated attack.|$|E
