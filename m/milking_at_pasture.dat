40|$|The {{dairy farming}} systems of Western Europe {{are based on}} a simple feeding system {{composed}} of grazed and preserved grass, maize silage and concentrates in variable proportions. There is, nevertheless, a great diversity of feeding strategies between dairy farms. Over 5 years, we studied the direct and delayed effects of four feeding strategies on the lactation and reproduction performances of Holstein and Normande dairy cows. The four feeding strategies (denoted Hh, Hl, Lh and Ll) correspond to two total mixed rations applied in winter from calving to turnout (maize silage with 30 % concentrate or grass silage with 15 % concentrate), which were subsequently crossed with two levels of concentrate supplementation at grazing to 210 days. Each year, 72 dairy cows managed in grouped winter calving were assigned to the four strategies. Finally, the results of 325 lactations and 295 inseminated cows were analysed. The four strategies resulted in considerable variation in nutrient intake and, in particular, in differences in concentrates consumed, with values of 1407, 1026, 773 and 392 kg dry matter per cow for strategies Hh, Lh, Hl and Ll, respectively. Total milk production (7567, 7015, 6720 and 6238 kg per cow for treatments Hh, Lh, Hl and Ll, respectively), milk fat content (39. 0, 37. 1, 40. 3 and 38. 5 g/kg, respectively), milk protein content (33. 0, 31. 8, 33. 1 and 31. 6 g/kg, respectively), and the character of the lactation and body condition curves were all highly sensitive to the strategies applied. While no significant interaction was detected on total lactation yield, the Holstein cows reacted more dramatically to each dietary change at each period, compared with the Normande cows. Winter feeding did not affect the production of <b>milk</b> <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> whereas, <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> the <b>milk</b> from the cows of the H groups in winter was higher in milk fat and protein content. Reproduction performance was unaffected by feeding strategy. The Holstein cows, well fed and producing the most milk (Hh and Hb), had the lowest rate of success at first artificial inseminations (21. 5 %). The dual-purpose Normande cows had a pregnancy rate 10 points higher than Holstein cows. This comparison of strongly contrasting feeding strategies confirms the immediate reactivity of dairy cows (in terms of milk performance and body condition) to variations of nutritive intake throughout lactation, with a weak carryover effect from feeding levels early in lactation. In contrast, reproduction performance was less sensitive to variation in nutrient supply...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the performances of cross breed Saanen dairy goats submitted to two strategies of supplementation with concentrate 30 % of daily requirements in net energy (NRC, 1981) supplied by concentrate, from third week {{until the end of}} lactation (ESC. 1) or 60 % of requirements from the 3 rd to the 13 th week of lactation and 15 % from 14 th until the end of lactation (ESC. 2); and evaluate the animal response to these strategies of supplementation with concentrate in a semi-confined or pasture systems. Thirty one animals were used in a completely randomized design. The system of production affected the total intake of concentrate and total <b>milk</b> production; <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> system the values for these two variables were higher. The supplementation with concentrate affected the total intake of concentrate and total production of milk and the relation of milk/consumption of concentrate. The highest value for relation of milk/consumption of concentrate and the least for the total consumption of concentrate were obtained at ESC. 1. Body weight affected of the system of production, resulting in a higher value to the system of pasture. Weight and body condition had different responses to he supplementation with concentrate according to the system of production. The semi-confined system ESC. 2 resulted in a higher value to the body condition; the body weight was no affected. <b>At</b> <b>pasture</b> system the highest values for weight and body condition were obtained in the supplementation with concentrate ESC. 1. Reproductive parameters did not affect supplementation with concentrate and system of production...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the use of fatty acid (FA) profiling in combination with chemometric modelling to verify claims for cow milk in terms of fresh grass feeding, pasture grazing and organic/biodynamic farming. The FA profile was determined for 113 tank milk samples collected in the Netherlands from 30 farms over four different months, and used to develop classification models based on the PLS-DA algorithm. Milk from cows with daily rations of fresh grass could be successfully distinguished from milk from cows with no fresh grass in their diet. <b>Milk</b> from cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> could easily be distinguished from milk from stabled cows without fresh grass in the diet, but the correct prediction of milk from stabled cows fed fresh grass indoors proved difficult. The FA profile of organic/biodynamic milk was different compared to conventional milk but an unequivocal discrimination was not possible either in summer or in winter...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the effect of {{pasturing}} time (4 versus 9 hours) combined with restricted indoor feeding on fat content, fatty acid composition, concentration of ¿-tocopherol, ß-carotene, uric acid and ß-hydroxybutyrate in milk from Holstein Friesian dairy cows. Morning and afternoon milk samples were collected three times {{at the end of}} week 2, 4 and 6 of the experiment. Morning and afternoon <b>milk</b> from cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> for 4 h varied significantly in medium and long chain fatty acids (C 6 -C 14), C 18 : 1 n- 9, C 18 : 2 n- 6, C 18 : 3 n- 6 and cis 9, trans 11 CLA concentration for all the 3 weeks. Fat percentage, ¿-tocopherol, ß-carotene, milk uric acid and ß-hydroxybutyrate showed significant differences between morning and afternoon milk from 4 -h pasture. In the contrary, {{there was no significant difference}} observed between morning and afternoon milk for most parameters studied in the 9 -h pasture group. Similarly the difference between morning milk from 4 - and 9 -h was also non-significant for most parameters. Therefore, in general 4 -h morning, 9 -h morning and 9 -h afternoon milk were very similar in their compositions for the parameters studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} two feeding systems (indoors and <b>at</b> <b>pasture)</b> on intake and {{digestion}} of fresh grass was studied at {{two stages of}} regrowth (21 and 35 days of regrowth) in two parallel experiments. In Experiment 1, 10 adult Martinik rams weighing, on average, 50. 5 (60. 9) kg, including four fitted with rumen cannula, were randomly allocated to two groups according to a 232 Latin Square design. These rams consumed a 21 -day regrowth of Digitaria decumbens grass diet during two successive 28 -day periods, indoors (five rams) or <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (five tethered rams). In Experiment 2, 10 other Martinik rams weighing, on average, 45. 5 (60. 9) kg, including four fitted with rumen cannula, were randomly allocated to two groups according to a 232 Latin Square design. These rams consumed a 35 -day regrowth of D. decumbens grass diet during two successive 28 -day periods, either indoors (five rams) or <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (five tethered rams). For the indoors groups, in vivo organic matter digestibility (OMD) was measured by total collection of feces. In addition, OMD was estimated indoors and <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> using the fecal CP (CPf) method (OMDCPf). Organic matter intake (OMI) was then estimated using OMDCPf and fecal organic matter output (OMICPf). Correlations of 0. 49 and 0. 77 were found between in vivo OMD and OMDCPf (P, 0. 05) and between OMI and OMICPf (P, 0. 001), respectively. OMDCPf was 1. 8 % (P, 0. 05) and 2. 7 % (P, 0. 01) lower indoors than <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>at</b> 21 and 35 days of regrowth, respectively, whereas OMICPf indoors was 1. 1 and 1. 16 times that registered <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>at</b> 21 and 35 days of regrowth, respectively. The higher OMDCPf <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> {{was linked to the}} higher selective behavior of rams <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> whereas the differences in OMICPf between the two feeding systems were linked to differences in the total bulk density of the grass. These studies show that differences in OMDCPf and OMICPf exist between animals fed indoors and <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> with the same forage and that these differences may vary according to the stage of regrowth of the grass offered...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe high {{nutritional}} and health-promoting {{properties of}} kymyz, a traditional drink of nomads produced from mare's milk, are well-known and reported in literature. The composition of mare's milk is {{significantly different from}} that of cow and other ruminants. Fatty acid composition and amino acid profile of mare's <b>milk</b> produced <b>at</b> Suusamyr <b>pastures</b> of Kyrgyzstan were studied during four lactation months (May, June, July and August). The amino acid composition was determined by precolumn derivatization with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate (DEEMM) in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 18 amino acids were determined in mare's milk. Most abundant amino acids were glutamic acid (16. 8 - 21. 2 %), leucine (8. 2 - 10. 1 %), lysine (8. 9 - 10. 1 %) and ornithine (0. 1 - 0. 7 %) was in a small amount. The percentages of essential AA in protein of mare milk were 46 %, 46 %, 51 %, 48 % for May, June, July and August months respectively, which demonstrate the high biological value of milk during all milking season. The fatty acid contents of the milk fat were determined in the form of fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatograph after methylation with potassium hydroxide in methanol. The concentrations of capric (10 : 0), lauric (12 : 0) and myristic acid (14 : 0) were similar during four lactation months and the concentration of linoleic acid (18 : 2) was higher in July month. The results of the study have shown that the highest contents of the nutritive compounds were found in the mare's milk obtained in July...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the behaviour of finishing bulls raised in an uninsulated barn (UB) and <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (PAS). In experiment 1, dairy bulls were housed in an uninsulated barn (two groups of five bulls, 32 m 2 /pen) or <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (groups {{of four and}} five bulls, 5000 m 2 /paddock). In experiment 2, Hereford bulls were housed in an uninsulated barn (three groups {{of four or five}} bulls, 32 m 2 /pen) or <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> (three groups of five bulls, 5000 m 2 /paddock). There were no differences in drinking, social licking, butting, other social behaviour, self-licking or idling between the UB and PAS bulls. The UB bulls spent more time in lying, ruminating, oral explorative and manipulative behaviour and rubbing and less time foraging and walking than the PAS bulls. The UB bulls performed more social licking and oral manipulation of objects and less mounting than the PAS bulls. These differences resulted most probably from the different feeding regimes and different space allowances...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of lameness and specific causes of lameness on standing time, number of lying bouts and test day yield (TDY) in cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and cows which were housed. Data were collected from 200 cows from 10 farms where cows were <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and 200 cows from 10 farms where they were housed. Each farm was visited twice over 3 days between May and August (autumn and winter) of 2009. At the first visit, 10 lame cows, all with locomotion score (LS) 3, and 10 non-lame cows, all with LS 1, were selected per farm. Electronic data loggers were positioned on one hind leg of each cow to record standing time and transitions. These were removed 3 days later at the second visit. There was no significant difference in standing time between housed and pasture-based cows but lame cows stood for a mean 1. 75 (SE 0. 36) h/day less than non-lame cows in both systems. Cows with sole damage, wall damage, misshapen feet and infectious lameness all stood for less time than non-lame cows. Housed cows had a mean 1. 4 more lying bouts per day than cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> Lame cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> had 1. 2 more lying bouts per day than non-lame cows but housed lame cattle had 0. 8 fewer lying bouts than non-lame housed cattle, so overall the number of lying bouts in lame cows, housed or <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> was similar. The only lesion associated with a change in the number of lying bouts was sole damage with a mean 1. 1 more lying bouts per day across systems than non-lame cows. Lame cows had lower TDY than non-lame cows and TDY was reduced more in lame cows when TDY was greater. In conclusion, standing times were similar in cows <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> and in housed cows, but lying bouts were different. However, given the associations between standing time, lying bouts and TDY the results might be most strongly influenced by TDY, rather than system. Future studies investigating the impact of lameness on cow behaviour by system in cows with similar and a range of TDY would be informative. ...|$|R

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematode}} (GIN) infections have {{an important}} negative impact on small ruminant production. The selection of genotypes resistant to these parasitic infections is a promising alternative control strategy. Thus, resistance against GIN {{is an important component}} of small ruminant breeding schemes, based on phenotypic measurements of resistance in immune mature infected animals. In this study we evaluated both the impact of the post-weaning parasitism history on the response to an experimental Haemonchus contortus infection of resistant and susceptible Creole kids chosen {{on the basis of their}} estimated breeding value, and the interaction with the kid’s genetic status. During the post-weaning period (from 3 months until 7 months of age) Creole kids were reared <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> according to four different levels of a mixed rotational stocking system with Creole cattle: 100 % (control), 75 % (GG 75), 50 % (GG 50), and 25 % (GG 25) of the total stocking rate of the pasture. The level of infection of the kids decreased significantly at 50 % and 25 % of the total stocking rate. After the post-weaning period <b>at</b> <b>pasture,</b> <b>at</b> 11 months of age kids were experimentally infected with H. contortus. The faecal egg counts (FEC) were significantly lower in the groups showing the highest FEC <b>at</b> <b>pasture.</b> This result suggests that a degree of protection against an experimental H. contortus infection occurred during the post-weaning period and was dependant on the level of parasitism. Interestingly, no interaction was observed between this level of protection and the genetic status. In conclusion, the level of post-weaning natural parasitism history <b>at</b> <b>pasture</b> would not influence the genetic status evaluation. More generally our results suggest that it would be better to expose kids to a high level of gastrointestinal parasitism during the post-weaning period in order to increase the basal level of resistance thereafter...|$|R
