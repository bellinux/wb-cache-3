That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for <b>me</b> <b>since</b> I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E

I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from her}} work with Clue and Jay-Z, Carey's {{longtime}} friend and background singer Trey Lorenz also {{took part in the}} song's production. He provided the back-up vocals in the song, and took part in several small areas of the development of Rainbow. When interviewed by Bronson, Carey spoke highly of Lorenz, [...] "He's an amazing writer and singer, he's so influenced by the old school stuff, yet he's so current. He's known <b>me</b> <b>since</b> before my first album, and he's a great, loyal friend." [...] Aside from the use of the sample and Jay-Z's verses, [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] contains strong female-empowering lyrics, which Carey wrote as a sort of anthem, especially because she felt that she personally has been in a similar predicament in the past.|$|E
500|$|After {{being called}} to the Bar on 20 April 1578 Coke {{immediately}} began practising as a barrister. His first case was in the Court of King's Bench in 1581, and was known as Lord Cromwell's Case after the claimant, Lord Henry Cromwell, a landlord in Coke's home county of Norfolk. The case was a charge of slander against a Mr Denny, the Vicar of Northlinham and Coke's client. In a dispute with Denny, Cromwell had hired two unlicensed preachers to harass him, denounce the Book of Common Prayer and preach the gospel in his area. Denny retorted by telling Cromwell [...] "you like not of <b>me,</b> <b>since</b> you like those that maintain sedition". Cromwell argued that Denny was guilty of scandalum magnatum, slander against a peer of the realm, because his statement implied that Cromwell himself was seditious or had seditious tendencies.|$|E

500|$|After selling 12 {{million copies}} of his albums and {{composing}} for various artists, including Ricky Martin and Chayanne, Franco De Vita recorded En Primera Fila {{as a part of}} the concert series promoted by the label Sony Music entitled Primera Fila, which has a concept of record live performances by Latin American performers before a small audience in an intimate setting, resemblant to MTV Unplugged. About Primera Fila De Vita said, [...] "The project was good for <b>me,</b> <b>since</b> I wanted to refresh many songs, some of them composed and recorded 25 years ago to incorporate a current sound and change some things. But the songs remains the same." [...] De Vita became the fourth performer to record under this format, following Vicente Fernández, Thalía, and OV7. The album is De Vita's third live album, following En Vivo Marzo 16 (1992) and Mil y Una Historias en Vivo (2006).|$|E

500|$|Pope Clement V {{continued}} the papal policy of supporting monarchs (who ruled by divine grace) against any claims in Magna Carta which challenged the King's rights, and annulled the Confirmatio Cartarum in 1305. Edward I interpreted Clement V's papal bull annulling the Confirmatio Cartarum as effectively applying to the Articuli super Cartas, although {{the latter was}} not specifically mentioned. In 1306 Edward I took the opportunity given by the Pope's backing to reassert forest law over large areas which had been [...] "disafforested". Both Edward and the Pope were accused by some contemporary chroniclers of [...] "perjury", and it was suggested by Robert McNair Scott that Robert the Bruce refused {{to make peace with}} Edward I's son, Edward II, in 1312 with the justification: [...] "How shall the king of England keep faith with <b>me,</b> <b>since</b> he does not observe the sworn promises made to his liege men..." ...|$|E

I was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.|$|E

500|$|Caxias {{tried to}} secure {{support from the}} {{traditional}} saquarema leadership. They attempted, however, to use him as a figurehead and to further their own agendas. He commented to Paranhos: [...] "I see what you meant, {{with respect to the}} bizarre behavior of these gentlemen, who do not wish to govern the country, when they are invited to do so, because they prefer to govern the Government. They are completely mistaken about <b>me,</b> <b>since</b> I am not disposed to serve them as a hobbyhorse." [...] Lacking support in parliament, Caxias' cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). PedroII asked members of the Liga Progressista (Progressive League)—a new party consisting of moderate Conservatives and Liberals—to form a new cabinet. Barely a month later, Caxias' only son died at age 14 of unknown causes. There was a small consolation at the end of 1862 when, on 2 December, he was made brevet marechal de exército (army marshal), the highest rank in the Brazilian army.|$|E
500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to <b>me</b> <b>since</b> my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E
