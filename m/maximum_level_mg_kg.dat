The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the uptake of heavy metals by chilies (Capsicum annum) and long beans (Vigna sinensis) from the soil. Heavy metals studied were Pb, Cd and Zn. Wet digestion method was used for heavy metals analysis in the vegetables. Heavy metals from soil samples were extracted by sequential extraction method, which extract heavy metals from easily and freely leachable fraction (EFLE), acid reduction (AR), organic oxidation (OO) and resistant fraction (RR). The results of the study showed that the level of Zn content in long beans (Vigna sinensis) was higher than in chilies (Capsicum annum). However the concentrations of heavy metals studied in these vegetables were still below the <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> allowed by the Malaysian Food Act (1983) and Food Regulations (1985) for Pb (2. 00 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1), Cd (1. 00 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) and Zn (30. 00 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Proanthocyanidin (PAC) {{consumption}} {{has been}} linked to better colonic health, but PACs are poorly absorbed, making them a target for colonic metabolism. The resulting metabolites are low molecular weight and could pot entially be absorbed. To understand the effects of dietary PACs it would be important to resolve the metabolic issue and link these changes to microbial population changes in a suitable model for human digestion. Here, six crossbred female pigs were fed a diet containing 1 % (w/w) of MegaNatural® Gold grape seed extract (GSE) daily for 6 days. Fecal samples were analyzed by normal phase LC coupled to fluorescence detection and LC-MS/ToF. DNA was extracted from pig fecal samples and the V 3 /V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. Intact parent PACs (dimer-pentamer) were observed in the feces on days 3 and 6 at similar high <b>levels</b> (∼ 400 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 total) during ingestion of GSE but were absent 48 h post-feeding. The major phenolic metabolites were 4 -hydroxyphenylvaleric acid and 3 -hydroxybenzoic acid which increased by ∼ 30 and 3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 respectively. The GSE diet also caused an ecological shift in the microbiome, dramatically increasing Lachnospiraceae, Clostridales, Lactobacillus and Ruminococcacceae. The relationship between dietary PACs and colon health may be attributable to the altered bacterial populations or phenolic compounds in the colon. © the Partner Organisations 2014...|$|R

Tolerance was assessed using hot plate after administration of a test dose of morphine (9 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. p.) on fifth day. Withdrawal zsymptoms (Jumping and Rearing) were assessed by administration of naloxone (5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. p.) 2 h after the last dose of morphine in fourth day. It was found that administration of lamotrigine or magnesium sulfate or their combination decreased the morphine induced tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. From these results it is concluded that lamotrigine and magnesium sulfate alone or in combination could prevent the development of morphine tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Glutamate release inhibitory effect of lamotrigine and its possible mechanism and property of magnesium, blocking the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor calcium channel, is probably its mechanism on preventing morphine induced tolerance and dependence...|$|R

Tolerance was assessed by administration of morphine (9 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. p.) on fifth day. Withdrawal symptoms (markers for dependence) was assessed by administration of naloxone (4 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1, i. p.) 2 h after co-administration of morphine with either Dextromethorphan or midazolam or their combination. Results showed that pretreatment with Dextromethorphan or midazolam decreased the degree of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms significantly. Additionally co-administration of Dextromethorphan and midazolam couldn`t decreased the tolerance and dependence significantly. From these results it may concluded that Dextromethorphan and midazolam alone or in combination could prevent the development of morphine induced tolerance and dependence. These effects can be related to the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist behavior of Dextromethorphan and GABA-receptor agonist property of midazolam...|$|R

Propofol is unique in having property to suppress airway reflexes {{better than any other}} agent. Therefore study was undertaken to evaluate clinically acceptable intubating conditions with different doses of propofol without muscle relaxants. Patients and Methods: 90 ASA grade I and II patients posted for elective surgery requiring general anesthesia divided randomly into group I (propofol 2 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1); group II (2. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1); groupIII (3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1). Premedication with inj. Glycopyrollate, inj. Ranitidine, Inj. Ondensetron; inj. Midazolam and inj. fentanyl was done. After waiting for 5 minutes, induction dose of propofol was given followed by inj. lignocaine 90 seconds prior to intubation. Intubating conditions were assessed and hemodynamic changes were recorded at various levels. Results: Ideal intubating conditions were obtained in 96. 7 %of patients in group II (2. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 propofol) and 100 % in group III (3 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 propofol).
