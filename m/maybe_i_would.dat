500|$|After {{winning the}} 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez. The club won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th {{official}} trophy. During {{the last week}} of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key in the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision from the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, [...] "If I was in charge, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have done things differently," [...] while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, [...] "We must start again from zero." ...|$|E

Perhaps then the women in Parliament would be taken more seriously as professional politicians doing a job, not as fat or thin women in grey or pink suits. <b>Maybe</b> then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have been described by some witty journalist as having 'a good face for radio' or be told by the late Auberon Waugh that I was 'too fat to be an MP'." ...|$|R

Yet she has done so without recognition for her commitment to social justice and her dedication to helping those in need. Ana remarked: I figure I am in [social justice work] for life. This is not something that I chose. This is my life purpose and I cannot get away. Believe me I tried [laughter]. I love it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have loved to go to school and obtain some sort of formal education for this, <b>maybe</b> then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have more credibility….

5000|$|Harrison {{wrote the}} song while ill {{in bed at}} a hotel room in Bournemouth, England, where the Beatles were playing some shows {{during the summer of}} 1963. He {{considered}} it an exercise in whether he could write a song, later saying, [...] "at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing, and then <b>maybe</b> eventually <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write something good." [...] Harrison received a writing credit for two earlier songs, [...] "In Spite of All the Danger" [...] (McCartney/Harrison) and [...] "Cry for a Shadow" [...] (Harrison/Lennon). Both were recorded by The Beatles but neither was released officially by the band until 1995's Anthology 1 compilation. Because the former was largely a McCartney composition (Harrison received a credit simply for playing the guitar solo) and the latter was an instrumental pastiche of the Shadows, [...] "Don't Bother Me" [...] is considered Harrison's first song by most (including the composer himself). Harrison did not think highly of the song, not mentioning it in an otherwise comprehensive overview of his Beatles compositions in his autobiography I Me Mine. The Beatles never performed it live or at any of their BBC sessions.|$|R

6000|$|Suddenly {{there were}} screams from {{the girls and}} cries of [...] "Fight!" [...] There was a rush. Men hurled {{themselves}} out of the kitchen. Two giants, flush-faced, with greying hair, were locked in each other's arms. One was Black Matt, who, everybody said, had killed two men in his time. The women screamed softly, crossed themselves, or prayed brokenly, hiding their eyes and peeping through their fingers. But not I. It is a fair presumption that I was the most interested spectator. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> see that wonderful thing, a man killed. Anyway, I would see a man-fight. Great was my disappointment. Black Matt and Tom Morrisey merely held on {{to each other and}} lifted their clumsy-booted feet in what seemed a grotesque, elephantine dance.

5000|$|Counterfactuals {{refer to}} things that are {{contrary}} to the actual situation. In English, counterfactuals can be expressed implicitly in [...] "if"-clauses by using a tense form that normally refers to a time prior to the time actually semantically {{referred to in the}} if-clause. For example, If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask contains the counterfactual If I knew, which refers to the present tense despite the form of the verb, and which denies the proposition [...] "I know that". This contrasts with the construction If I know that,..., which is not a counterfactual because it means that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> know it and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> don't (or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> will know it, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> will not). Likewise, If I had known that, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have gone there contains the counterfactual If I had known, denying the proposition that I had known; a note of caution on the above: the pluperfect verbal construction is sometimes mistakenly confused with the simple past, this is because {{most of the time the}} distinction has a very small effect on the semantic interpretation, and the incorrect logic that, through inertia, prior knowledge of X implies present knowledge of X, however this is not universal, (e.g. memory loss), a correct modal statement would look like [...] "prior knowledge of X usually implies present knowledge of X". as with any subtlety, caution is prescribed.|$|R
