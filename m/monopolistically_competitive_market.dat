50|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} kink {{is the idea}} that in an oligopolistic or <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market,</b> firms will not raise their prices because even a small price increase will lose many customers. This is because competitors will generally ignore price increases, with the hope of gaining a larger market share as a result of now having comparatively lower prices. However, even a large price decrease will gain only a few customers because such an action will begin a price war with other firms. The curve is therefore more price-elastic for price increases and less so for price decreases. Theory predicts that firms will enter the industry in the long run.|$|E

We consider a <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> in which firms can invest in cost-cutting R&D by paying a fixed cost first. For an intermediate level of fixed cost, there is a unique equilibrium in which the market segments into investing and non-investing firms. Using this equilibrium, we study how the distribution and level of R&D expenditure changes as industry size increases. In particular, we show that, as the market size increases, R&D spending can become more concentrated. Data motivating these results are drawn from the Taiwanese and Korean semiconductor industries...|$|E

This variation in fares is substantial: the expected absolute difference in fares between two passengers on a route is 36 percent of the airline's average ticket price. The pattern of observed price dispersion cannot easily be explained by cost differences alone. Dispersion increases on routes with more competition or lower flight density, consistent with discrimination based on customers' willingness to switch to alternative airlines or flights.

This paper investigates one source of the incentive for collective contracting: the failure of <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>markets</b> to achieve the optimal trade-off between lower costs and greater variety or availability of products. A collective contract benefits buyers inside the coalition but imposes a negative externality on buyers outside the coalition, who face higher prices and lower availability when the contract is allowed.

The new trend finds most acute manifestations in rapidly enlarging revenue gaps between newspapers relying on political power and those relying on market popularity. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a three-stage game of a differentiated oligopoly: firms first make their entry decisions, then they choose production technologies {{and in the}} third {{stage of the game}} they decide product prices. The technology choice can be understood as selecting one from a pool of those recently available as well as developing a new technology through innovative activities. The resulting market equilibrium is then compared with the social optimum. The main conclusions are that a <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> will typically undersupply both product variety and production scale. R&D competition in a free entry differentiated oligopoly will lead to insufficient R&D investment at firm and industry levels.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} pricing {{behaviour}} of {{firms in the}} euro area {{on the basis of}} surveys conducted by nine Eurosystem national central banks, covering more than 11, 000 firms. The results, robust across countries, show that firms operate in <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>markets,</b> where prices are mostly set following markup rules and where price discrimination is common. Around one-third of firms follow mainly time-dependent pricing rules while twothirds allow for elements of state-dependence. The majority of firms take into account past and expected economic developments in their pricing decisions. Price stickiness is mainly driven by customer relationships – explicit and implicit contracts – and coordination failure. Firms adjust prices asymmetrically in response to shocks: while cost shocks have a greater impact when prices have to be raised than when they have to be reduced, reductions in demand are more likely to induce a price change than increases in demand.

Households decide about asset accumulation, consumption and sets wages in a <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> labour <b>market.</b> Households trade bonds internationally {{and there is a}} risk premium determined by the degree of foreign indebtedness. Firms are owned by domestic households. Consistent with the household objective function they determine labour demand, capacity, investment and they set prices in a <b>monopolistically</b> <b>competitive</b> goods <b>market</b> by maximising the market value of the corporate sector. Apart from technological constraints, decisions are subject to convex adjustment costs. Monetary policy is modelled via a Taylor rule. A Bayesian estimation approach is applied, using the Dynare code, by Michel Juillard, via the log-linearisation of the model around the steady state, solution of the forward looking log-linear model and computation of the likelihood via Kalman filter. After estimating the posterior mode via standard optimisation routines, the posterior distribution of model parameters is estimated with a Metropolis Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. Unobserved components are also derived, such as technology, target inflation, capital utilisation. A full Bayesian impulse response analysis is then performed, comprising a detailed sensitivity analysis of the main dynamical features of the model simulations versus changes in model parameters. ...|$|R
