40|$|Abstract. Systematic {{analysis}} is made on meaning and current research of Holonic <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Execution</b> <b>Systems</b> (HMES). Characteristics of HMES are pointed out. It {{lies in the}} distributed structure and distributed decision-making mechanism come from holon, {{as well as the}} essence of being a shopfloor management information system. Papers on HMES are analyzed from three aspects: control framework construction, development framework and implementation. Control framework construction is the main research direction. Most of the frameworks are built on PROSA, and concentrated with emphasis on real-time scheduling on the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>execution</b> process to gain an optimized solution when faced random disturbance. As opposed to traditional legacy <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Execution</b> <b>Systems</b> (MES) and framework MES, HMES has certain superiority, implementation and application of HMES also have good prospect. But because of the limitation of distributed decision-making mechanism, practical application has certain difficulty, which leads to the research work relatively slow...|$|R

Achievement of the integration-in-manufacturing paradigm based on centralized/distributed hardware/software automation architectures is evolving using the intelligence-in-manufacturing paradigm addressed by IMS industry-led R&D initiatives. The remaining goal is to define and experiment with {{the next generation of}} manufacturing systems, which should be able to cope with the high degree of complexity required to implement agility, flexibility and reactivity in customized manufacturing. This introductory paper summarizes some key problems, trends and accomplishments in manufacturing plant control before emphasizing for practical purposes some rationales and forecasts in deploying automation over networks, holonic <b>manufacturing</b> <b>execution</b> <b>systems</b> and their related agent-based technology, and applying formal methods to ensure dependable control of these manufacturing systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} the PROSA reference architecture and its delegate multi-agent system coordination mechanism or D-MAS to robotic applications, particularly to the coordination of multiple mobile robots. Originally, PROSA and D-MAS have been developed for the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>executions</b> <b>system</b> of MES domain. The application of PROSA to robotics is a generalization: PROSA has been elaborated but was never in need of modification. This reference architecture is applied to multiple application domains and differences are confined to its elaboration, specialization and instantiation. Likewise, the delegate MAS mechanism was reused across application domains. As a side effect, this facilitates the seamless integration of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>execution</b> <b>systems</b> and the coordination of mobile robots if they are PROSA and D-MAS implementations. This paper first presents the mapping of PROSA onto robotics. Next, it discusses how this technology from the MES domain enhances performance in mobile robot applications. status: publishe...|$|R
