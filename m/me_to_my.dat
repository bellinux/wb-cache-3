500|$|The British fleet {{was soon}} heavily engaged, passing down the French line and {{engaging}} their ships one by one. Nelson on Vanguard personally engaged Spartiate, also coming {{under fire from}} Aquilon. At about eight o'clock, he was with Berry on the quarter-deck when a piece of French shot struck him in his forehead. He fell to the deck, a flap of torn skin obscuring his good eye. Blinded and half stunned, he felt sure he would die and cried out [...] "I am killed. Remember <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife." [...] He was taken below {{to be seen by}} the surgeon. After examining Nelson, the surgeon pronounced the wound non-threatening and applied a temporary bandage.|$|E
500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and she took his [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord'." [...] Ayesha declares this to be the [...] "first most holy hour of completed womanhood".|$|E
500|$|The {{steamboat}} Harold {{spotted the}} ship and rescued all of its crew except Captain E. E. Walls, who opted to stay behind with the order [...] "Report <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> owners". At the time, the Holliswood was badly damaged, with her house destroyed and her rudder torn away. The crew apparently advised the captain that the ship would not stay afloat for another five hours, although he dismissed their concerns. After the crew was rescued, Captain Walls struggled against the storm for days without food or fresh water. On October20, the Parkwood rescued Walls unconscious, but initially feared to be dead. Once aboard, he regained consciousness and, reportedly amidst an episode of delirium, asked {{to be returned to}} the Holliswood. Ultimately, the captain of the Parkwood agreed to tow the battered ship to shore.|$|E

Misha Zilberman, who debuted at the London 2012 Olympic Games as Israel's first badminton Olympian, claimed his Olympic spot {{as one of}} the top 34 individual shuttlers in the BWF World Rankings as of 5 May 2016. According to Zilberman, his ambition is [...] "to win a medal at the European or World Championships or the Olympic Games." [...] When it comes to his Olympic training regimen, he said [...] "training under my parents is hard because on the court, they are always trying to push <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> limit."

500|$|In Knolles's work, the Sultan Mahomet conquers Constantinople in 1453 and captures a Greek Christian named Irene. He {{decides to}} take her as his mistress, and while {{pursuing}} her romantically he ignores his duties as a monarch. Soon, the kingdom is falling apart from neglect and the subjects begin to riot, so Mahomet kills Irene to prove his dedication to his people.

His Mahomet offers Irene a deal: if she becomes a Muslim, he will preserve her life and give her power at his court.IRENE:Forbear — O do not urge <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> ruin!MAHOMET:To state and pow'r I court thee, not to ruin:Smile on my wishes, and command the globe.Security shall spread her shield before thee,And Love infold thee with his downy wings.(Irene II. vii ll. 79–83) ...|$|E

500|$|The opening {{number for}} the episode, [...] "Hot for Teacher", was commended by most critics. Futterman {{described}} it as a [...] "high-energy performance with the right amount of absurdity". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the musical number a four out of five stars, and cited the choreography as the highlight of the performance. West gave it a grade of [...] "A–", and wrote, [...] "This was such big fun and the backup guys ... really helped amp it up." [...] Slezak was less enthusiastic about the sequence. He was critical of Salling's vocals, and felt that a heavy metal song was not suited to his stylings; he ultimately gave it a [...] "C+" [...] grade. He also criticized the choreography, and stated that he had to [...] "downgrade a little for Blaine and Mike Chang's grotesque 'whoopsie, I'm hiding an erection!' dance move that will probably haunt <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> grave." ...|$|E

Rolling Stone's Lyndsey Parker described Raja's vocal performance as a [...] "whole lot of groaning", and Bustle's Anneliese Cooper classified it {{as an example of}} [...] "crazy shit shouted to a beat". In the chorus, Raja sings [...] "Follow me, follow me, I’m a diamond crowned queen.

Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> corner."

500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
500|$|The {{transfer}} of Audaciouss broadside to Spartiate meant that Captain Maurice-Julien Emeriau now faced three opponents. Within minutes {{all three of}} his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around Spartiate continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although Spartiate was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, Aquilon, which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, Minotaur. Captain Antoine René Thévenard used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a langrage shot from Spartiate struck Nelson over his blinded right eye. The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind. Nelson collapsed {{into the arms of}} Captain Edward Berry and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out [...] "I am killed, remember <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife", and called for his chaplain, Stephen Comyn. The wound was immediately inspected by Vanguards surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together. Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on Orient to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Thévenard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under Minotaurs guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender. With his opponent defeated, Captain Thomas Louis then took Minotaur south to join the attack on Franklin.|$|E

2500|$|In 1924, he sat for his baccalaureate which {{consisted}} in three examinations: a two coefficient philosophical one, a natural scientific {{one and a}} physical-chemical one, each of them of one coefficient and a half. He obtained sixteen to twenty in philosophy thanks to a [...] "formidable dissertation", which ranked him first of his class with honors. He recounted that day in those words: [...] "At {{the announcement of the}} results I felt worried. I wanted first rank, at any coast. Being second did not satisfy <b>me.</b> <b>To</b> <b>my</b> grand relief I happened to be first with honors. The second was Auguste Barbe". He stated at the announcement of the results: [...] "I will be a lawyer and I shall {{put an end to the}} protectorate. Therefore, Bourguiba left the country to pursue his studies in Paris.

2500|$|It is {{possible}} her change in political leanings {{was the result}} of the social upheavals occurring in American society at the same time. Beginning in the late 1950s and continuing into the 1970s, the struggle of African-Americans for social and legal equality could not have escaped the notice of a woman always known for approaching everyone she first met with respect, without regard for station in life. As an example of her attitudes on race, in 1965 her black chauffeur Richard Turner, who was also one of her best friends, was driving Alice to an appointment. During the trip, Turner pulled out in front of a taxi, and the driver got out and demanded to know of Turner, [...] "What do you think you're doing, you black bastard?" [...] Turner took the insult calmly, but Alice did not and told the taxi driver, [...] "He's taking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> destination, you white son of a bitch!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, he {{appeared}} again in opera as Don José in Carmen and as Lohengrin for Carl Rosa at Covent Garden, but thereafter devoted {{most of his}} efforts to concert performance. In 1921 he sang Gerontius at the memorial meeting for Gervase Elwes at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society. (He sang wonderfully, according to the Sunday Times, a courageous thing to do since {{in his own words}} he found the sudden death of Elwes in a train accident 'too shocking, too staggering to contemplate. It has affected me to the very depths of my nature ... it brought <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> knees.') From 1920 he began to specialise in song-recitals, of which he gave several each year, favouring all-English performances and championing English composers, but drawing from the repertoire of German and French songs also. In 1922 Roger Quilter, who had written much for Elwes and worked closely with him, dedicated his 'Morning song' (Thomas Heywood) to Coates, one of his most vibrant and characteristic miniatures, though Coates did not give the first performance of it.|$|E

Tu di un úmile preghiera il suono odi / [...] "Ah! May Thou hear the sound of our humble prayer") and, together, she and the crowd pray for God's mercy. When Cecil arrives to tell her that the time for her execution has come, he informs her that Elizabeth has granted her final wishes, including allowing Anna to accompany her to the scaffold. Then Mary offers a pardon to the queen (Mary, Anna, Talbot, Cecil, chorus: Di un cor che more reca il perdóno / [...] "From a heart that is dying, may pardon be granted"). Leicester comes to bid her farewell. Both are distraught and he expresses outrage. Mary asks him to support her at the hour of her death and protests her innocence once again (Aria: Ah! se un giorno da queste ritorte / [...] "Ah! Though one day from this prison your arm wanted to abduct me, now you lead <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> death"). She is then led to the scaffold.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Springfield {{released}} two albums on United Artists Records. The first was 1978's It Begins Again, produced by Roy Thomas Baker. The album peaked in the UK top 50 and was well received by critics. Her 1979 album, Living Without Your Love, {{did not reach}} the top50. In early 1979, Springfield played club dates in New York City. In London, she recorded two singles with David Mackay for her UK label, Mercury Records (formerly Philips Records). The first was the disco-influenced [...] "Baby Blue", co-written by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes which reached No. 61 in the UK. The second, [...] "Your Love Still Brings <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Knees", released in January 1980, was Springfield's final single for Mercury Records; she had been with them for nearly 20 years. On 3 December 1979, she performed a charity concert for a full house at the Royal Albert Hall, {{in the presence of}} Princess Margaret. In 1980 Springfield sang [...] "Bits and Pieces", the theme song from the movie The Stunt Man. She signed a US deal with 20th Century Records, which resulted in the single [...] "It Goes Like It Goes", a cover of the Oscar-winning song from the film, Norma Rae. Springfield was uncharacteristically proud of her 1982 album White Heat, which was influenced by new wave music. She tried to revive her career in 1985 by returning to the UK and signing to Peter Stringfellow's Hippodrome Records label. This resulted in the single [...] "Sometimes Like Butterflies" [...] and an appearance on Terry Wogan's TV chat show, Wogan. None of Springfield's recordings from 1971 to 1986 charted on the UK Top40 or Billboard Hot100.|$|E
