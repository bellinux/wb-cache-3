50|$|The {{magazine}} {{was first published}} as Flying Saucers from Other Worlds in 1957, before evolving into Flying Saucers in 1958. The initial title was designed to create confusion with a science fiction magazine Other Worlds, which Palmer also published and which overlapped for two issues. Such confusion may {{have been designed to}} overcome the difficulty that a new magazine in a new category would have in finding space on news stands, to help attract readership, or more likely both. The confusion continues to tax collectors of science fiction <b>magazines</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R

He began writing for Dublin's Hot Press <b>magazine</b> in 1991; <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> he holds the position of their ‘Writer-At-Large’.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{litigation}} {{case against}} the magazine was initiated by James Goldsmith, who managed to arrange for criminal libel charges to be brought, meaning that, if found guilty, those behind the Eye could be imprisoned. He sued over allegations {{that members of the}} Clermont Set, including Goldsmith, had conspired to shelter Lord Lucan after Lucan had murdered his family nanny, Sandra Rivett. Goldsmith won a partial victory and eventually reached a settlement with the magazine. The case threatened to bankrupt Private Eye, which turned to its readers for financial support {{in the form of a}} [...] "Goldenballs Fund". Goldsmith himself was referred to as [...] "Jaws". The solicitor involved in many litigation cases against Private Eye, including the Goldsmith case, was Peter Carter-Ruck, whose firm the <b>magazine</b> refers <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> as [...] "Carter-Fuck".|$|R
50|$|Burridge {{was born}} in Poole in Dorset, England. In his youth he was a reader and writer with an {{interest}} in music, which continued throughout his life. In 1977, Burridge became interested in heavy rock band Motörhead, and in January 1980, started the Motorhead Magazine fanzine. The magazine featured gig reviews and news whilst inviting the readership to become involved by writing their experiences of seeing the band live. Motorheadbangers, the official Motörhead fan club originally managed by drummer Phil Taylor's sister, Helen, ceased operations in 1983, Burridge, then working as a warehouseman, was asked by the band to roll it into his fan <b>magazine,</b> which continues <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> under the Motorheadbangers banner.|$|R
50|$|Jazz Hot, the {{official}} mouthpiece of the Hot Club, started in 1935; {{the first issue}} was a one page edition printed {{on the back of}} a program for a concert given at the Salle Pleyel by Coleman Hawkins on 21 February 1935 and was distributed during admission. Hugues Panassie edited the journal from 1935 to 1946.The writings of Panassie in Jazz Hot, along with other critics and writers, served to help define the new music according to old European traditions but also to place the music geographically and socio-culturally in the United States, in New Orleans, beginning with the African-American minority; this made it the first publication to acknowledge not only the contribution of African-Americans to the music, but their role as its progenitors. The second world war forced the Club to halt publication of Jazz Hot until the mid-40s. The <b>magazine</b> runs <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> but after 1946 was no longer under the purview of the Club; this was in part due to the ideological split that forced Charles Delaunay to resign and leave the Club. Delaunay retained control of the magazine and was its main financial backer until 1980.|$|R
