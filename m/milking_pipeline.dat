40|$|The {{trend in}} {{development}} of new technologies and machinery {{in the area of}} agriculture and animal husbandry shows an increasing number of robotized operations. Such trend mostly appears in dairy cattle breeding, which has its logical explanation {{due to the fact that}} high ratio of human labour in milk production is more than obvious. The basic prerequisite for a successful utilization of milking robotic systems is to provide dairy cattle with sufficient quantity of top quality food and water as well as to ensure their welfare. The aim of the bachelor?s work was to compare the influence of both stanchion housing using a <b>milking</b> <b>pipeline</b> method and loose housing with robotic milking system on basic categories of dairy cattle behaviour, milk efficiency and reproduction. The observation itself was executed in each housing system for the period of 24 hours, during which an interval method with a ten-minute interval mode was used. Basic life activity of dairy cattle such as: feed intake, standing, lying and movement were monitored. All data were collected and assessed under running conditions on a private dairy farm owned by Václav Dub in Boubín near Horažďovice. The task was carried out in a reconstructed housing, where both systems are in operation. During the day, the dairy cattle remained mostly in a lying position, from which 50, 33 % were kept in stanchion housing and 49, 54 % in loose housing. When being housed in a standing position, 23, 78 % of the dairy cattle paid attention to feeding and 27, 05 % of dairy cattle were robotically milked. Standing position represented 25, 89 % in stanchion housing and 19, 31 % in loose housing. The movement was only monitored with dairy cattle housed in free housing representing 4, 1 %. After the milk efficiency was assessed, there were some statistically significant differences (P? 0, 001) found in milked milk as well as in a kilogram of protein. With respect to reproduction, the length of the insemination interval was recorded showing 129 days when being stanchion housed and 95 days when loose housed. The length of the service period of dairy cattle in stanchion housing was 144 days while dairy cattle milked robotically showed the length of 109 days. All in all, it was proved that a free movement has a positive influence on the milk efficiency, fertility as well as the welfare of dairy cattle...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of vacuum {{applied to the}} teat end can have a major effect on milking characteristics. While milking vacuum is usually measured in the <b>milk</b> <b>pipeline,</b> the teat-end vacuum during milk flow depends on {{the configuration of the}} milking unit. The objective was to establish the effect of teat-end vacuum, recorded during flow simulation, on actual milking time, milk yield, and both mean and peak milk-flow rates. Four configurations of milking units were set up to give vacuum levels of 35, 38, 40 and 42 kPa at the apex of an artificial teat during simulated milking. The experiment involved a latin square design with four groups of Friesian cows (14 /group), four 2 -day periods and four treatments (vacuum level). Altering the vacuum level had no significant effect on milk yield. There were no differences in milking characteristics between vacuum levels of 38 and 40 kPa. A vacuum level of 42 kPa gave a shorter milking time (P < 0. 001), higher average milk-flow rate (P < 0. 01) and higher peak milk-flow rate (P < 0. 001) than the three lower vacuum levels.

Ail camels were milked twice a day (06 : 00 and 16 : 00) by a portable milking machine with medium <b>milk</b> <b>pipeline</b> and electronic pulsator. The milking machine was set at 50 kPa, 60 pulses/min, and 60 : 40 pulsation ratio. At the start of experiment ail camels were diagnosed free of mastitis. Individual milk yield was measured during a. m. and p. m. milking using an electronic milk f 10 w meter (lactocorder®). Front and rear teat length was measured before and after each milking. Teat condition was c 1 assified for teat texture (soft and firm) by manual palpation and for teat color (normal and red) by visual assessment before and after milking. Milk samples (100 ml) were collected weekly from udder at each milking and analysed for major milk constitutes. Udder health were performed by california mastitis test (CMT) and bacteriology during the experimental period. No subclinical mastitis was detected {{in any of the}} udders quarters during the experimental period as indicated by the CMT " 1) and bacteriology (coliform=O and total flora= 32097 ± 396 ufc/mL) test. On average, daily milk yield (Kg/day) and fal, protein, lactose and total solids contents were 6. 25 ± 1. 05, 3. 87 ± 0. 62; 3. 14 ± 0. 45; 4. 10 ± 0. 65 and 11. 10 ± 1. 15, respectively. The observed high fat and protein ratio (> 1) indicated a complete milk let-down during machine milking. On average, front and rear teat length before milking were 6. 3 ± 1. 7 cm and 5. 6 ± 1. 8 cm, respectively. Teats length increased (P< 0. 05) by 10. 3 % and 14. 7 % after a. m. and p. m. milking, respectively. There was no difference in teat texture or color before and after milking.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Abstract: A high milk production, time limited milking {{and healthy}} udders are priority tasks at milking farms. The aim {{of our research}} was to study how different ways of keeping (free rang and tying) and milking (milking parlour, bucket machine and <b>pipeline</b> <b>milking)</b> influence on the mentioned cattle characteristics. Investigation was conducted at four milking farms and 382 Holstein cows in eastern Croatia. The variance analysis has shown significant difference (P< 0, 05) among researched farms for the milk yield per milking (MYM), the somatic cell count (LSCC) and the maximum milk flowing rate (MFR). Farms at which cows were kept and milked bound up in stables had more problems with udder health than farms at which milking was conducted at milking places. Also at these farms (at which cows were kept and milked bound up in stables) the maximum milk flowing rate was uneven, what was caused by uneven vacuum and obsoletes milking equipment. Keeping cows free at the stable and milking at a milking place have appeared to be more appropriate for cow’s udder health, what finally influences a higher milking production. Such farms should be the future of modern milking production in Croatia. Key words: milk yield, somatic cell count, milk flowing rate, milking metho...|$|R

40|$|Reliability {{of quality}} of milk {{produced}} by smallholder farmers was assessed {{by means of a}} comparative analysis of the microbiological quality and somatic cell counts (SCC) of the raw milk obtained from dairy goats. Information regarding dairy goat farming and goat milk production in and around Pretoria was initially determined by means of a questionnaire. With this information, dairy goat herds were selected for the study, {{based on the fact that}} these farms produced milk for both domestic and commercial consumption. The study was conducted on three commercial dairy goat farms each under a different production system, the extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems. The method of milking varied with the type of production system; hand milking, bucket system and <b>pipeline</b> <b>milking</b> respectively. Udder health under the respective production systems was assessed by means of bacterial analysis of udder half milk samples. Bacteriology of bulk milk samples was also determined in order to assess the level of hygiene in the milking environment. In addition, water samples from the different farms were analysed for their microbial quality. Results of these parameters were compared between the different production systems using the analysis of variance. Capability of safe raw milk production by smallholder dairy goat farmers was then evaluated from the results obtained. Reliability of the SCC as a reflection of goat udder health was also evaluated. Further assessment was carried out to determine the relationship between udder conformation and presence of intra-mammary infection and SCC of the raw milk. Bacteria potentially capable of producing either food poisoning or enhanced spoilage of raw milk were cultured from the goat milk samples. These included pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus faecalis, found associated with use of milking machines as was the case in the intensive and semi-intensive production systems compared to the extensive production system. The prevalence of intramammary infection was 33. 3 %. Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common cause of intramammary infection with a prevalence of 86. 6 % of the infected udder halves. They includedStaphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus intermedius. The remaining 13. 4 % of the infection was due to Staphylococcus aureus. Somatic Cell Counts were not a reflection of udder health status, hence, not reliable in the prediction of goat udder health (p = 0. 2 Fisher’s exact test of association). No significant relationship was proved to exist between the udder conformation and presence of intra-mammary infection or SCC of the milk produced. Raw milk obtained by the bucket system milking machine had the lowest total bacterial count (TBC) (16 450 Colony Forming Units per millilitre [CFU/ml]) as compared to that by <b>pipeline</b> <b>milking</b> machine (36 300 CFU/ml) or hand milking (48 000 CFU/ml). In comparison to the other two production systems, it was shown that dairy goat farming under the extensive production system, where hand milking was practised, was adequate for production of safe raw goat milk. Coliforms were found to be the most predominantly isolated organisms from the raw milk obtained under the extensive production system. However, these can be eliminated by pasteurisation of the milk. The extensive production system, therefore, could be a means to promote dairy farming in developing communities through smallholder farmers. This could be facilitated by extension services aimed at monitoring management on the farms. This would, consequently, help alleviate the problem of food security and low income in these communities.

The method of milking varied with the type of production system, i. e. machine milking; bucket system machine milking and hand-milking, respectively. Udder half milk samples (n= 270) were analysed, of which 31. 1 % were infected with bacteria. The lowest intra-mammary infection was found amongst goats in the herd under the extensive system (13. 3 %), compared with 43. 3 % and 36. 7 % infection rates under the intensive and semi-intensive production systems, respectively. Staphylococcus intermedius (coagulase positive), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus simulans (both coagulase negative), were {{the most common cause of}} intramammary infection with a prevalence of 85. 7 % of the infected udder halves.

The aim {{of this paper was}} to evaluate the possible effects of corn replacement in cow feeding rations on milk composition and properties. The expressively different variants of corn were selected for experiment in comparison to maize (reference). Dairy cows were fed by total mixed ration on the basis of maize and clover silage and hay. Otherwise the identical day feeding rations among cow groups differed only in concentrate portions ((K, control group) maize 1. 5 kg, wheat (P 1) 2. 0 kg and triticale (P 2) 2. 0 kg (experimental groups)). Group feeding rations 1 (K), 2 (P 1) and 3 (P 2) had: NEL/kg dry (DM) matter (6. 524, 6. 512 and 6. 491); NL % in DM (17. 9, 18. 2 and 17. 9); fibre % in DM (15. 96, 15. 74 and 15. 72); PDIN/PDIE (1. 189, 1. 189 and 1. 191). The experiment took six weeks, there were included 8, 9 and 9 cows (n = 26) of Czech Fleckvieh breed. Feed groups were well balanced in terms of milk yield, days in milk and number of lactation. The tie stable and <b>pipeline</b> <b>milking</b> equipment were used in experiment. Animals were milked twice a day and sampled at morning milking in intervals about seven days approximately. Cows were relatively healthy in terms of occurrence of milk secretion disorders.

The differences in milk yield were significantly advantageous for K group (15. 32 > 14. 07 (wheat) or 13. 86 kg (triticale) at morning milking), while fat (3. 27 0. 05). Milk specific weight was lowest in P 1 (P 76 (K) or 72 103 /ml (P 1). Because of quite typical high SCC variability in tri­ti­ca­le P 2 group (in opposite to this low variability in K and P 1 groups) it could be caused by chance in animal selection for groups and all values met the standard demand for extra quality of milk. Therefore, {{it is not necessary to}} over estimate this result. Milk urea as metabolical indicator was higher in wheat group, significantly (P 20. 80 (K) and 20. 50 mg /  100 ml (P 2), but all values lay in respected physiological range (from 20 to 30 mg /  100 ml). In the Ca case it was significantly higher (P 1231 (K) or 1253 (P 1) mg / kg). This increase could be interested in terms of milk nutritive value, but not for routine milk payment. The levels of P and Fe in milk were higher in K versus experimental groups (P < 0. 05). It is less interesting in terms of economy or nutrition. In general milk was a little different according to differences in corn portions of cow feeding rations and corn variant replacement. In terms of experiment the concrete corn replacement in concentrate portion of feeding ration could not have an essential impact on milk quality and it si possible to agree with such conception. However, the milk quality and yield were not overcome by replacement of maize by wheat (Sulamit) or triticale (Kitaro). At triticale the lower milk yield was compensated by higher levels of DM, fat, CP, CAS, Ca and also SCC as compared to maize and wheat. The used corn replacement variants were not expressively worse than maize...|$|R
