5|$|<b>Metalloproteinase</b> {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting <b>metalloproteinase</b> from digesting tissue.|$|E
5|$|The various {{subspecies}} of the rattlesnake genus Crotalus, produce venoms {{that carry}} out two conflicting functions. The venom immobilizes prey after a bite, and also helps digestion by breaking down tissues before the snake eats its prey. As {{with other members}} of the family Viperidae, the venoms of Crotalus disrupt the homeostatic processes of prey animals. However, there is a wide variety of venom compositions among the species of Crotalus. A 2010 study found a 100-fold difference in the amount of <b>metalloproteinase</b> activity among the various snakes, with Crotalus oreganus cerberus having the highest activity and Crotalus oreganus concolor having the lowest. There was also a 15-fold variation in the amount of protease activity, with C. o. concolor and C. o. cerberus having the highest and lowest activities, respectively.|$|E

We postulate an association between aberrant matrix <b>metalloproteinases</b> proteolytic activity and the intestinal tissue destruction, seen in patients with Crohn’s disease and/or ulcerative colitis. Methods. Surgically resected inflamed and non-inflamed ileum and colon with/without extensive fibrosis from 122 Crohn’s disease, 20 ulcerative colitis and 62 control patients were homogenized. Protein levels of matrix <b>metalloproteinases</b> and tissue inhibitor of <b>metalloproteinases</b> were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), while matrix <b>metalloproteinases</b> and myeloperoxidase activity were measured by specific activity assays. Results. Expression of total levels of matrix metalloproteinases- 1,- 2,- 3 and- 9 relative to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases- 1 and- 2 was increased in inflamed inflammatory bowel disease compared to non-inflamed inflammatory bowel disease and control intestinal mucosa. Also, net matrix metalloproteinases- 1,- 2,- 3 and- 9 activity in inflamed inflammatory bowel disease was increased, with similar expression profiles in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

25|$|Proteins of {{the matrix}} <b>metalloproteinase</b> (MMP) family are {{involved}} in the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins and during tissue remodeling in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development and reproduction, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis, and tumour metastasis. Most MMPs are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{contributor}} to angiogenesis is matrix <b>metalloproteinase</b> (MMP). MMPs help degrade the proteins that keep the vessel walls solid. This proteolysis allows the endothelial cells to escape into the interstitial matrix as seen in sprouting angiogenesis. Inhibition of MMPs prevents the formation of new capillaries. These enzymes are highly regulated during the vessel formation process because destruction of the extracellular matrix would decrease {{the integrity of the}} microvasculature.|$|E
25|$|Messenger RNA {{produced}} from the LMNA gene undergoes alternative splicing and is translated into lamins A and C. Lamin A undergoes farnesylation {{to attach a}} membrane anchor to the protein. This version of the protein is {{also referred to as}} prelamin A. Farnesylated prelamin A is further processed into mature lamin A by a <b>metalloproteinase</b> removing the last 15 amino acids and its farnesylated cysteine. This allows lamin A to dissociate from the nuclear envelope membrane and fulfill nuclear functions. Mutations causing laminopathies interfere with these processes on different levels.|$|E

Material and Methods: Fifteen New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to three groups: a negative control; a sham control group implanted with a collagen sheet; and an experimental group implanted with recombinant human tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase- 1 impregnated in a collagen sheet. Rabbits were sacrificed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks of consolidation. Results: Major expression of matrix <b>metalloproteinases</b> and tissue inhibitors of matrix <b>metalloproteinases</b> was observed at the early stage of consolidation, only positive signals of tissue inhibitors of matrix <b>metalloproteinases</b> were observed at 24 weeks. The addition of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases- 1 did not affect bone maturation and remodelling.

25|$|As noxious pain is sustained, spinal {{sensitization}} creates transcriptional {{changes in}} the neurons of the dorsal horn that lead to altered function for extended periods. Mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores results from persistent synaptic activity and leads {{to the release of}} glutamate, ATP, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Activated astrocytes are also a source of matrix <b>metalloproteinase</b> 2 (MMP2), which induces pro-IL-1β cleavage and sustains astrocyte activation. In this chronic signaling pathway, p38 is activated as a result of IL-1β signaling, and there is a presence of chemokines that trigger their receptors to become active. In response to nerve damage, heat shock proteins (HSP) are released and can bind to their respective TLRs, leading to further activation.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for MMP-3 is {{a variation on}} a larger theme seen in all matrix metalloproteinases. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated to a glutamate residue (Glu202) {{and one of the}} zinc ions present in the catalytic domain. First, the coordinated water molecule performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide substrate's scissile carbon while the glutamate simultaneously abstracts a proton from the water molecule. The abstracted proton is then removed from the glutamate by the nitrogen of the scissile amide. This forms a tetrahedral gem-diolate intermediate that is coordinated to the zinc atom. In order for the amide product to be released from the active site, the scissile amide must abstract a second proton from the coordinated water molecule. Alternatively, it has been shown for thermolysin (another <b>metalloproteinase)</b> that the amide product can be released in its neutral (R-NH2) form. The carboxylate product is released after a water molecule attacks the zinc ion and displaces the carboxylate product. The release of the carboxylate product is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{pathophysiology}} of HUS {{involves the}} binding of Shiga-toxin to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3; also called ceramide trihexoside which accumulates in Fabry disease) receptor {{on the surface}} of the glomerular endothelium. This action includes a cascade of signaling events leading to apoptosis and binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells. The Shiga-toxin-activated endothelial cells then become thrombogenic (clot-producing) by mechanism that is not fully understood, though they have been shown to induce the release of cytokines and chemokines that are implicated in platelet activation. Additionally, the binding action of Shiga-toxin inactivates a <b>metalloproteinase</b> called ADAMTS13, the deficiency of which causes the closely related TTP. Once ADAMTS13 is disabled, multimers of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) form and initiate platelet activation, causing microthrombus formation. The activation of platelets resulting from inhibition of ADAMTS13 is due to the hyperactivity of large multimers of uncleaved vWF. The arterioles and capillaries of the body become obstructed by the resulting complexes of activated platelets, which have adhered to the endothelium via large multimeric vWF. Through a mechanism known as microangiopathic hemolysis, the growing thrombi lodged in smaller vessels destroy red blood cells (RBCs) as they squeeze through the narrowed blood vessels, forming schistocytes, or fragments of sheared RBCs. The presence of schistocytes is a key finding that helps to diagnose HUS. Typically, this hemolysis results in a hemoglobin level of less than 80g/L.|$|E
