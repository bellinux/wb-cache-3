6000|$|The <b>mail</b> <b>facilities</b> {{in those}} days were as poor as the methods for transportation; {{and we can get}} an idea of the postal {{arrangements}} from an extract from a New York paper published in 1704, which states, [...] "In the pleasant month of May, the last storm put our Pennsylvania post a week behind, and has not yet com'd in." [...] But although this was rather slow communication, New Jersey was better off than many of the civilized communities of the day; for she had a regular postal system, which had been invented by Colonel John Hamilton.|$|E

This is greatly to be regretted, and I do {{not hesitate to}} recommend the authorization of a renewal of that contract, and also that the service may be increased from monthly to semi-monthly trips.

6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Since my return, the <b>mail</b> <b>facilities</b> {{have enabled}} Orion {{to keep me}} {{informed}} as to his intentions. Twenty-eight days ago it was his purpose to complete a work aimed at religion, the preface {{to which he had}} already written. Afterward he began to sell off his furniture, with the idea of hurrying to Leadville and tackling silver-mining--threw up his law den and took in his sign. Then he wrote to Chicago and St. Louis newspapers asking for a situation as [...] "paragrapher"--enclosing a taste of his quality in the shape of two stanzas of [...] "humorous rhymes." [...] By a later mail on the same day he applied to New York and Hartford insurance companies for copying to do.|$|E

While these incidents were false alarms, DOD and other federal and local agencies responded. The Postal Service suspended operations at two of its facilities and over a thousand DOD and Postal Service employees were given antibiotics as a precaution against their possible exposure to anthrax. This report describes (1) what occurred at the Pentagon and Skyline Complex <b>mail</b> <b>facilities,</b> (2) the problems we identified in detecting and responding to the incidents, (3) the actions taken by DOD that address the problems that occurred, and (4) the extent to which DOD's actions address the problems. ...|$|E
