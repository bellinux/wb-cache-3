30|$|For the {{identification}} of coliform, <b>MPN</b> <b>test</b> was done where 7 (18.42 %) samples showed positive. The standard plate count indicates that the total coliform in the drinking water was in the ranges of 14 – 40 in 100  ml of water samples in different areas and fecal coliform was detected in 6 (15.78 %) of total samples. But PCR analysis of LacZ gene for coliform and uidA gene for total coliform resulted in 10 (26.32 %) positive for faecal coliform and 7 (18.42 %) positive for only fecal coliform (Table  3, Fig.  2).|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives:The poor {{accessibility}} of microorganisms to PAHs in soil has limited {{success in the}} process of bioremediation as an effective method for removing pollutants from soils. Different physicochemical factors are effective on the rate of biodegradation. The main objective {{of this study is to}} assess effects of nutrient and salinity on phenanthrene removal from polluted soils. Materials and Methods:The soil having no organic and microbial pollution was first artificially polluted with phenanthrene then nutrients and salinity solution in two concentrations were added to it in order to have the proportion of 10 % w:v (soil: water). After that a microbial mixture enable to degrade phenanthrene was added to the slurry and was aerated. Finally, the residual concentration of Phenanthrene in the soil was extracted by ultrasonic and was analyzed using GC. We measured the microbial populationusing <b>MPN</b> <b>test.</b> This study was conducted based on the two level full factorial design of experiment. Results: <b>MPN</b> <b>test</b> showed that the trend of microbial growth has experienced a lag growth. The full factorial design indicated that nutrient had the maximum effect on bioremediation; the rate of phenanthrene removal in the maximum nutrients - minimum salinity solution was 75. 14 %. Conclusion: This study revealed that the more nutrient concentration increases, the more degradation will be happened by microorganisms in the soils. However, salinity in the concentration used had no effect on inhabitation or promoting on the Phenanthrene removal...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{detection}} assays {{were developed}} for Escherichia coli {{by using the}} fluorogenic substrate 4 -methylumbelliferone glucuronide (MUG). Among the Enterobacteriaceae, 97 % of E. coli strains, 17 % of salmonellae, and 40 % of shigellae produced a (beta) -glucuronidase that cleaved MUG to produce a fluorogenic end product visible under long-wave UV light. For immediate confirmation {{of the presence of}} E. coli in Most Probable Number (<b>MPN)</b> <b>tests,</b> MUG was incorporated into Lauryl Tryptose Broth (LTB) tubes at a final concentration of 100 (mu) g/ml. Results of both the presumptive test (gas production) and confirmed test (fluorescence) were obtained from a variety of food and water samples after incubation for 24 h at 37 C. The EC test (45. 5 C) for fecal coliforms confirmed over 90 % of the tubes showing both gas and fluorescence. Of 17 fluorescent-positive but gas-negative tubes that were encountered, four were fluorescent {{because of the presence of}} Salmonella sp., Shigella sp. or anaerogenic strains of E. coli; the other 13 tubes must have contained (beta) -glucuronidase producers at one time, but none could be isolated after 24 h of incubation. By using the LTB-MUG MPN assay, higher counts of heat- and chlorine-injured cells were recovered, compared to the Violet Red Bile- 2 agar overlay method. In addition, E. coli cells subjected to interference by antagonistic bacteria (absence of gas production) were also detected by the appearance of fluorescence. MUG was equally effective in detecting E. coli in other coliform methodologies, such as membrane filtration and direct plating, when incorporated in the culture media. A rapid confirmatory test that is amenable to automation was also developed: wells in microtitration plates were filled with a nonselective medium containing 100 (mu) g/ml of MUG. Pure or mixed cultures containing E. coli produced fluorescence after incubation for 4 h (most strains) to 24 h (a few weakly positive strains). The fluorogenic assays were very sensitive and easy to use, and the results were available much faster than results of conventional E. coli detection procedures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Water becomes {{contaminated}} with enteric pathogens such as coliform group of bacteria viz Salmonellae, Vibrio and dysentery causing bacilli. The human faecal material carried along with domestic sewage is often dumped in {{rivers and lakes}} leading to water contamination. The present study was undertaken to detect the enteric pathogens and to measure the extent of drinking water contamination with the pathogenic microorganisms. Water samples were collected from different areas of Solan city in Himachal Pradesh. Most probable number (<b>MPN)</b> <b>test</b> was performed to detect the coliforms in water samples collected from surface water sources, hand pumps, taps, roof top storage tanks and aqua-guards. Chlorination of some water samples was done to see the effect of chlorine on bacteria. The indicator organisms isolated were E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes. E. coli and Enterobacter aerogenes are the characteristic of intestinal tract of man and animals.

40|$|A Most Probable Number (MPN) {{method was}} {{developed}} {{allowing for the}} first time estimation of populations of bacteria capable of heterotrophic nitrification. The method was applied to an acidic soil of a coniferous forest exhibiting nitrate production. In this soil nitrate production was unlikely to be catalyzed by autotrophic nitrifiers, since autotrophic ammonia oxidizers never could be detected, and autotrophic nitrite oxidizers were usually not found in appreciable cell numbers. The developed MPN method is based on the demonstration of the presence/absence of nitrite/nitrate produced by heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria during growth in a complex medium (peptone-meat-extract softagar medium) containing low concentrations of agar (0. 1 per cent). Both the supply of the growing cultures in <b>MPN</b> <b>test</b> tubes with sufficient oxygen and the presence of low agar concentrations in the medium were found to be favourable for sustainable nitrite/nitrate production. The results demonstrate that in the acidic forest soil the microbial population capable of heterotrophic nitrification represents {{a significant part of the}} total aerobic heterotrophic population. By applying the developed MPN method, several bacterial strains of different genera not previously described to perform heterotrophic nitrification have been isolated from the soil and have been identified by bacterio-diagnostic tests...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The JAK 2 V 617 F {{mutation}} in exon 14 {{is the most}} common {{mutation in}} chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs); deletion of the entire exon 14 is rarely detected. In our previous study of > 10, 000 samples from patients with suspected <b>MPNs</b> <b>tested</b> for JAK 2 mutations by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with direct sequencing, complete deletion of exon 14 (Deltaexon 14) constituted < 1 % of JAK 2 mutations. This appears to be an alternative splicing mutation, not detectable with DNA-based testing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the possibility that MPN patients may express the JAK 2 Deltaexon 14 at low levels (< 15 % of total transcript) not routinely detectable by RT-PCR with direct sequencing. Using a sensitive RT-PCR-based fluorescent fragment analysis method to quantify JAK 2 Deltaexon 14 mRNA expression relative to wild-type, we tested 61 patients with confirmed MPNs, 183 with suspected MPNs (93 V 617 F-positive, 90 V 617 F-negative), and 46 healthy control subjects. The Deltaexon 14 variant was detected in 9 of the 61 (15 %) confirmed MPN patients, accounting for 3. 96 % to 33. 85 % (mean = 12. 04 %) of total JAK 2 transcript. This variant was also detected in 51 of the 183 patients with suspected MPNs (27 %), including 20 of the 93 (22 %) with V 617 F (mean [range] expression = 5. 41 % [2. 13 %- 26. 22 %]) and 31 of the 90 (34 %) without V 617 F (mean [range] expression = 3. 88 % [2. 08 %- 12. 22 %]). Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that patients expressing Deltaexon 14 mRNA expressed a corresponding truncated JAK 2 protein. The Deltaexon 14 variant was not detected in the 46 control subjects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data suggest that expression of the JAK 2 Deltaexon 14 splice variant, leading to a truncated JAK 2 protein, is common in patients with MPNs. This alternatively spliced transcript appears to be more frequent in MPN patients without V 617 F mutation, in whom it might contribute to leukemogenesis. This mutation is missed if DNA rather than RNA is used for testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{village of}} Yipelgu in the Northern Region of Ghana was the {{recipient}} of a 1, 000 -ceramic hemispheric water filter distribution, which was supplied by Pure Home Water (PHW) and funded by UNICEF-Ghana. The distribution to female heads of households began in November 2012, and approximately 700 ceramic hemispheric filters were disseminated by January 2013 when this research was conducted. This large-scale distribution provided the first opportunity to monitor and evaluate the performance of PHW's ceramic hemispheric filter design, branded as the AfriClay filter, in the field rather than during the factory quality control operations. Monitoring and evaluation was based on surveys measuring Correct Use and water quality tests. Correct Use is the first component of the " 3 C's", which denote Correct, Consistent, and Continuous Use. A user practicing the " 3 C's" can realize the full benefits of this and other household water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) products. The Correct Use survey was administered {{to a total of}} 85 beneficiary households in Yipelgu. Pertinent factors, such as filter assembly, treatment, safe storage, and maintenance, related to Correct Use were addressed in the survey. The variables included in the survey were hypothesized to inform the filter performance level. Stored untreated and filtered paired samples were also collected from each survey respondent's filter. IDEXX Quanti-Tray/ 2000 ® and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) bacteria <b>MPN</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to measure the water quality parameters of total coliform/E. coli and H₂S bacteria respectively. Turbidity was also measured. Water quality tests served as an objective measure for HWTS adoption and Correct Use. The AfriClay filter exhibited a wide range of performance but generally achieved 99 % total coliform (TC), 98 % E. coli, and 80 % turbidity reductions (geometrically averaged). In order to explain this observed performance variability, water quality and Correct Use survey data were analyzed. The variables of "fill frequency per day" and "duration of turbid water settling" were found to be statistically significant in possibly influencing the filter performance level from the observed data. by Kristine M.

In the present work, the availability of enterococci as a biological indicator was studied. No enterococcus was detected in water which was assumed not to be pollution by feces of human or animal origin. Enterococci did not grow in river water under any condition, and died in river water much faster than the coli-form group.

The NHDES Shellfish Program conducts a number of activities to minimize the health risks associated with consuming shellfish, and to continue to comply with National Shellfish Sanitation Program guidelines. Among basic program functions are a routine water quality monitoring program, “red tide” monitoring, and a pollution source identification and evaluation program. These sampling programs are supplemented by other activities aimed at improving the management of conditionally approved harvesting areas. Augmented sampling in conditionally approved areas after rainfall events and/or sewage treatment plant upsets provides information to improve management decisions and, in some cases, increase harvesting opportunities.

30|$|Heavy {{metals and}} {{microbiological}} contamination were investigated in groundwater {{in the industrial}} and coastal city of Thoothukudi. The main sources of drinking water {{in this area are}} water bores which are dug up to the depth of 10 – 50  m in almost every house. A number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries have been established since past three decades. Effluents from these industries are reportedly being directly discharged onto surrounding land, irrigation fields and surface water bodies forming point and non-point sources of contamination for groundwater in the study area. The study consists of the determination of physico-chemical properties, trace metals, heavy metals and microbiological quality of drinking water. Heavy metals were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and compared with the (WHO in Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) standards. The organic contamination was detected in terms of most probable number (<b>MPN)</b> <b>test</b> in order to find out faecal coliforms that were identified through biochemical tests. A comparison of the results of groundwater samples with WHO guidelines reveals that most of the groundwater samples are heavily contaminated with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium, lead, boron, aluminium, iron and vanadium. The selenium level was higher than 0.01  mg/l in 82  % of the study area and the arsenic concentration exceeded 0.01  mg/l in 42  % of the area. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to the discharge of effluents from copper industries, alkali chemical industry, fertiliser industry, thermal power plant and sea food industries. The results showed that there are pollutions for the groundwater, and the total Coliform means values ranged from 0.6 – 145  MPN ml− 1, faecal Coliform ranged from 2.2 – 143  MPN ml− 1, Escherichia coli ranged from 0.9 to 40  MPN ml− 1 and faecal streptococci ranged from 10 – 9.20  ×  102  CFU ml− 1. The coastal regions are highly contaminated with total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli. This might be due to the mixing of sewage from Thoothukudi town through the Buckle channel and fishing activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} oysters to purge {{themselves}} of microbial contaminants was investigated {{by identifying the}} microorganisms retained by oysters {{after they have been}} subjected to ultraviolet (UV) light-treated seawater. A UV intensity of 960 μw per min per cm 2 reduced the microbial count of seawater from 263 to 13 per ml. The coliform multitube <b>test</b> (<b>MPN)</b> was reduced from a high of 17 to < 0. 18 per 100 ml. Over 75 % of the microorganisms found in treated seawater were Acinetobacter/Moraxella, Vibrio/Pseudomonas type II, and Flavobacterium/Cytophaga. With the exception of coliforms, the microbial composition of oysters subjected to UV-treated seawater remained at levels comparable to the control oysters held in untreated seawater. Total counts ranged between 103 and 105 /g. The microorganism most frequently encountered were Flavobacterium/Cytophaga, Vibrio/Pseudomonas type II, Pseudomonas type III or IV, Acinetobacter/Moraxella, gram-positive cocci and Bacillus. Together they comprised over 90 % of the flora. Coagulase-positive, deoxyribonuclease-positive, and beta-hemolytic cocci were found in some samples, as were V. parahaemolyticus, V. aliginolyticus, and Aeromonas species...|$|R
30|$|A {{wide range}} of {{microorganisms}} can be present in drinking water and it is often impossible to test {{for all of these}} microorganisms (WHO 2011). In order to monitor microbial quality of drinking water, certain indicator microorganisms can be measured to test for faecal pollution. Here, we used the <b>MPN</b> assay to <b>test</b> for the presence of common bacterial contaminants in the borehole water samples. Overall, 14 % of groundwater samples tested exceeded the recommended 0.0  cfu/ 100  ml for coliforms by the WHO, indicating the presence of bacterial contaminants. The total number of coliforms ranged from 0.0  cfu/ 100  ml to more than 16  cfu/ 100  ml with a mean of 1.60  cfu/ 100  ml (Table  4). The presence of coliforms in these groundwater samples studied {{can be attributed to the}} absence of residual chlorine, an indication that the borehole water had not been chlorinated prior to sampling. Presence of coliforms in infected boreholes renders the water unwholesome, unless it is chlorinated. This is because excess coliforms may give an indication of the presence of other pathogens, which could cause waterborne diseases such as typhoid fever, hepatitis, gastroenteritis and dysentery (Lawson 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare chemical and microbiological quality of the 21 Iranian bottled drinking waters reported on manufacturer's labeling and standards in 2012. Samples were analyzed for chemical properties K+, F−, SO 4 [*] 2 −, Cl−, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and pH. Total and fecal coliform and heterotrophic plate counts of selected samples were analyzed by <b>MPN</b> and HPC <b>tests,</b> respectively, for three months. Finally, the labeled and real contents of the samples were compared. Potassium and sulfate ions about 43 and 52 percent of studied sample contents had values higher than label amounts, respectively. Ca 2 +, Cl− ions, and pH were about 71, 48, and 67 percent, respectively, less than label values. Total and fecal coliforms had negative results. The mean concentrations and standard deviations for K+, Cl−, pH, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, SO 4 [*] 2 −, and HPC were 1. 13 ± 1. 06, 16. 39 ± 31. 97, 6. 6 ± 0. 7, 28. 35 ± 10. 34, 86. 58 ± 33. 21, 24. 17 ± 17. 30 [*]mg/L, and 16855 ± 25603 cfu/mL, respectively. Thus, there is possibility of microorganisms’ growth in favorite conditions in bottled water. It was imperative to assess the public health risks in bottled water in Iran...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Recently {{the use of}} {{heterotrophic}} {{plate count}} (HPC) has received much attention as a supplementary indicator of the <b>MPN</b> <b>test</b> in water quality control. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has declared 500 cfu/mL as the maximum acceptable level for heterotrophic bacteria in distribution networks. Currently the HPC determination is not among the routine control items in Tabriz city {{and there is no}} published information on the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in that city's potable water. In this study the presence of HPC in potable water main was determined in Tabriz city, Iran.   Materials and Methods: A total of 50 water samples, representing drinking water of the whole city of Tabriz, were taken randomly from different districts of Tabriz city and their HPC, coliform, residual chlorine, turbidity, temperature, and pH were measured. For the heterotrophic bacteria the R 2 A and Nutrients Agar culture media were used, while the spread plate count method was used for the HPC test. The statistical tests used for data analysis were the t-test and regression.      Results: In 50 % of the samples heterotrophic bacteria were present. In 6 districts the HPC was higher than 500 cfu/mL. Based on Nutrient Agar and R 2 A, the HPC indicator in Tabriz drinking water was 184 ± 340 and 154 ± 315 cfu/mL, respectively, the growth rate being higher in the former medium. There was a significant correlation between the HPC and residual chlorine in both media (for Nutrients Agar, p< 0. 05; R= - 0. 347, and for R 2 A, p< 0. 05; R= - 0. 312). Also, there was a significant positive correlation between the HPC and pH (p< 0. 05). Further analysis of the data showed that the correlation between HPC values in both media was also significant (p< 0. 95, R= 0. 95). Conclusion: The presence of heterotrophic bacteria in 50 % of the water samples tested indicates that drinking water contamination with these bacteria is a public health problem in Tabriz city. As a result, monitoring of HPC at least once every 6 or, at least, 12 months, together with coliform bacteria, and the comparison of the results over time can help to better determine water quality in the distribution system, as well as boost the system operation and ensure drinking water with a high quality...|$|E
40|$|Ice Cream is {{dairy milk}} product {{which is a}} bit solid and tasty because of the various {{ingredients}} mixed in the making process. The presentation of Ice Cream itself is more creative and innovative, {{one of them is}} “Es Krim Pot”. This research is aimed to find out about the appropriateness of es krim pot which is sold around UMS Campus using <b>MPN</b> method. The <b>testing</b> held in Microbiology Laboratory of Biology, School of Teacher Training and Education-UMS with two process, they are, Presumptive Test with LB and Confirmed Test with BGLB. The appropriateness on consumption of es krim pot will be found by comparing the amount of MPN fecal coliform bacteria with the provision by BPOM RI Number HK 00. 06. 1. 52. 401. 2009 that the maximum limit is 3 MPN/ml. Samples used are from 3 different seller (P 1,P 2, and P 3) with 2 different sampling time, they are 11. 00 (W 1) and 15. 00 (W 2). The result obtained consecutively, are P 1 W 1 = 0, 42 MPN/ml; P 1 W 2 = 11 MPN/ml; P 2 W 1 = 0, 44 MPN/ml; P 2 W 2 = 2, 9 MPN/ml; P 3 W 1 = 0, 03 MPN/ml; P 3 W 2 = 2, 1 MPN/ml. From the result, it can be concluded that every seller are appropriate on consuming because according to the provision by BPOM on 2009 the amount of MPN fecal coliform are under 3 MPN/ml except on P 1 W 2, in the amount of 11 MPN/ml, stated as inappropriate...|$|R

Solomon, Geosciences, Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), Fort Wayne, IN 46805 - 1499, mcmikn 1110 @gmail. com As part of {{my upper}} level {{environmental}} class, I chose to {{examine the impact of}} the increasing Canadian geese population on water quality. Within the last 40 years, Indiana has seen a substantial growth in its population of Canadian Geese. This rise in population may mean that a larger amount of fecal matter is being produced, and may be detrimental to the water quality and other pond inhabitants. To test this hypothesis, water samples were taken from a pond in a city zoo, in the Midwest where a substantial growth in goose population has been observed, and compared to a retention pond of roughly the same shape and size with a much lower waterfowl population. The water samples, for the zoo pond and the residential pond were tested using the most probable number <b>test</b> (<b>MPN),</b> and both samples were then tested for E. coli using eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar. The water from the pond in the zoo had a very high bacterial count (240 / 100 ml) and tested positive for E. coli. The water from the residential pond with a substantially smaller waterfowl population had a very low bacteria count (43 / 100 ml) and the E. coli test was negative. Although it is an ongoing project, the current results seem to point to the fact that larger populations of waterfowl may {{have a negative effect on}} the water quality of the ponds they frequent...|$|R
