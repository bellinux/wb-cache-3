The empirical <b>marine</b> <b>extent</b> relationship is tuned so that the major marine retreat history of the North American and Eurasian ice sheets are modeled accurately in time and space.

40|$|The Austfonna ice cap covers {{an area of}} 8120 km 2 and is by far {{the largest}} glacier on Svalbard. Almost 30 % of the entire area is {{grounded}} below sea-level, while the figure is as large as 57 % for the known surge-type basins in particular. Marine ice dynamics, as well as flow instabilities presumably control flow regime, form and evolution of Austfonna. These issues are our focus in numerical simulations of the ice cap. We employ the thermodynamic, large-scale ice sheet model SICOPOLIS ([URL] which is based on the shallow-ice approximation. We present improved parameterizations of (a) the <b>marine</b> <b>extent</b> and calving and (b) processes that may initiate flow instabilities such as switches from cold to temperate basal conditions, surface steepening and hence, increases in driving stress, enhanced sliding or deformation of unconsolidated marine sediments and diminishing ice thicknesses towards flotation thickness. Space-borne interferometric snapshots of Austfonna revealed a velocity structure of a slow moving polar ice cap (menos que 10 m/a) interrupted by distinct fast flow units with velocities in excess of 100 m/a. However, observations of flow variability are scarce. In spring 2008, we established a series of stakes along the centrelines of two fast-flowing units. Repeated DGPS and continuous GPS measurements of the stake positions give insight in the temporal flow variability of these units and provide constrains to the modeled surface velocity field. Austfonna¿s thermal structure is described as polythermal. However, direct measurements of the temperature distribution is available only from one single borehole at the summit area. The vertical temperature profile shows that the bulk of the 567 m thick ice column is cold, only underlain by a thin temperate basal layer of approximately 20 m. To acquire a spatially extended picture of the thermal structure (and bed topography), we used low-frequency (20 MHz) GPR profiling across the ice cap and the particular flow units. The measurements indicate that the gross volume of Austfonna is cold. This observation is supported by model results which suggest that regional fast flow occurs despite the lack of considerable temperate-ice volumes. This in turn indicates that fast flow is accomplished exclusively by basal motion in regions where the glacier base is at pressure-melting conditions, and not by enhanced deformation of considerable volumes of temperate ice...|$|R

The main {{aim of this}} study is to investigate the vulnerability of this coastal area to marine flooding by considering the dynamics of the forcing component (Total Water Level) and the dynamics of the receptor (urban areas).

This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world’s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships...|$|R

We suggest that directly examining delayed metamorphosis or the latent effects associated with nutritional stress of larvae is a better model for investigating the ecological importance of DOM to marine invertebrates.

Our data suggest that the ability of marine iguanas to cope with predator introductions is limited by narrow reaction norms for behavioural wariness rather than by constraints in the underlying physiological stress system. In general, we predict that island endemics show flexible physiological stress responses but are restricted by narrow behavioural plasticity...|$|R

We investigated nauplius and cypris larvae of the barnacle Balanus (Amphibalanus) improvisus from the Swedish west coast with respect to temperature (12, 20, and 28 °C) and salinity (5, 15, and 30) tolerances.

This was also observed in cypris larvae when the preceding nauplii stages had been reared at a salinity of 30.

This paper is designed to encourage further debate and dialogue between stakeholders about management objectives.

The predators that are vulnerable to the depletion of FF are Sandwich terns, great skua and common guillemots, {{and to a lesser}} <b>extent,</b> <b>marine</b> mammals. Comparative evaluations of management strategies are required to consider whether maintaining the reserves of prey biomass or a more integral approach of monitoring mortality rates across the trophic system is more robust under the ecosystem approach. In terms of trophic energy transfer, stability, and resilience of the ecosystem, FF should be considered as both a sized-based pool of biomass and as species components of the system by managers and modellers. Policy developers should not consider the knowledge base robust enough to embark on major projects of ecosystem engineering. Management plans appear able to maintain sustainable exploitation in the short term. Changes in the productivity of FF populations are inevitable so management should remain responsive and adaptive. © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

To warrant sustainable economic development of coastal regions, we need to balance the marginal costs from coastal catchment water pollution abatement and the associated marginal benefits from marine resource appreciation. Water pollution abatement costs are, however, not equal across industries and, consequently, the question arises to what <b>extent</b> <b>marine</b> water quality improvement can efficiently be pursued across industries. In this paper we develop an optimal control approach to explore, analytically as well as quantitatively, social welfare maximizing rates of water pollution abatement across industries. For a case study of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) water pollution in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia, water pollution abatement cost functions for two agricultural industries are estimated to, in turn, explore social welfare maximizing rates of water pollution abatement per industry. Results for the Tully-Murray catchment show that DIN water pollution can be reduced by about 25 % through the adoption of win-win management practices in the sugarcane industry. However, when taking into account the benefits from reduced DIN water pollution in the downstream marine environment, this study shows that maximum social welfare gains can be obtained by reducing DIN water pollution through a reduction in the agricultural production area in combination with the adoption of lose-win management practices in the sugarcane as well as the grazing industry...|$|R

Although widespread and common in <b>marine</b> invertebrates, the <b>extent</b> of chimerism in wild populations of reef corals is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: The extent of chimerism was explored within two populations of a common coral, Acropora millepora, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, by using up to 12 polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci. At least 2 % and 5 % of Magnetic Island and Pelorus Island populations of A. millepora, respectively, were found to be chimeras (3 % overall), based on conservative estimates. A slightly less conservative estimate indicated that 5 % of colonies in each population were chimeras. These values are likely to be vast underestimates of the true extent of chimerism, as our sampling protocol was restricted to a maximum of eight branches per colony, while most colonies consist of hundreds of branches. Genotypes within chimeric corals showed high relatedness, indicating that genetic similarity is a prerequisite for long-term acceptance of non-self genotypes within coral colonies. Conclusions/Significance: While some brooding corals have been shown to form genetic chimeras in their early life history stages under experimental conditions, this study provides the first genetic evidence of the occurrence of coral chimeras in the wild and of chimerism in a broadcast spawning species.

These genotype-environment associations {{have been attributed to}} differential selection following larval settlement, but it remains unclear whether selective mortality during later juvenile stages further shapes genetic differences among habitats. We addressed this question by analysing differentiation patterns at GH and Prl markers together with a set of twenty-one putatively neutral microsatellite loci. We compared genetic variation of spring juveniles that had just settled in three ecologically different lagoons, against older juveniles sampled from the same sites in autumn, at the onset of winter outmigration. In spring, genetic differentiation among lagoons was greater than expected from neutrality, for both candidate gene markers. Surprisingly, this signal disappeared completely in the older juveniles, with no significant differentiation for either locus a few months later in autumn. We searched for signals of haplotype structure within GH and Prl genes using next-generation amplicon deep-sequencing. Both genes contained two groups of haplotypes, but high similarities among groups indicated that signatures of selection, if any, had largely been erased by recombination. Our results are consistent with the view that differential selection operates during early juvenile life in sea bream, and highlight the importance of temporal replication in studies of post-settlement selection in marine fish...|$|R

40|$|Although theory {{underlying}} the invasion paradox, or {{the change in}} the relationship between the richness of alien and indigenous species from negative to positive with increasing spatial scale, is well developed and much empirical work on the subject has been undertaken, most of the latter has concerned plants and to a lesser <b>extent</b> <b>marine</b> invertebrates. Here we therefore examine {{the extent to which the}} relationships between indigenous and alien species richness change from the local metacommunity to the interaction neighborhood scales, and the influences of abundance, species identity, and environmental favorability thereon, in springtails, a significant component of the soil fauna. Using a suite of modeling techniques, including generalized least squares and geographically weighted regressions to account for spatial autocorrelation or nonstationarity of the data, we show that the abundance and species richness of both indigenous and alien species at the metacommunity scale respond strongly to declining environmental favorability, represented here by altitude. Consequently, alien and indigenous diversity covary positively at this scale. By contrast, relationships are more complex at the interaction neighborhood scale, with the relationship among alien species richness and/or density and the density of indigenous species varying between habitats, being negative in some, but positive in others. Additional analyses demonstrated a strong influence of species identity, with negative relationships identified at the interaction neighborhood scale involving alien hypogastrurid springtails, a group known from elsewhere to have negative effects on indigenous species in areas where they have been introduced. By contrast, diversity relationships were positive with the other alien species. These results are consistent with both theory and previous empirical findings for other taxa, that interactions among indigenous and alien species change substantially with spatial scale and that environmental favorability may play a key role in explaining the larger scale patterns. However, they also suggest that the interactions may be affected by the identity of the species concerned, especially at the interaction neighborhood scale. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

40|$|The {{effect of}} nanogel {{colloidal}} and {{dissolved organic matter}} The aerosol generated from seawater proxies enriched with marine exudate presented organic volume fractions {{on the order of}} 8 – 37 %, as derived by applying a simple mixing rule. The hygroscopic growth and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of the marine organics-enriched particles where 9 – 17 % and 5 – 24 % lower, respectively, than those of the aerosol produced from artificial seawater devoid of exudate. Experiments in a companion paper indicated that the cloud nuclei formation could be enhanced in diatom bloom areas because of the increase in the primary particle production induced by marine organics. The experiments in the present study, however, indicate that the impacts of such an enhancement would be counteracted by the reduction in the CCN activity of the primary particles enriched in <b>marine</b> organics. The <b>extent</b> of the effect of the biogenic matter on the particle behaviour was dependent on the seawater organic concentration and type of algal exudate. Aerosol produced from seawater proxies containing diatomaceous exudate presented higher hydrophobicity and lower CCN activity than those enriched with nanoplankton exudate. The organic fraction of the particles was found to correlate with the seawater organic concentration, without observing saturation of the particle organic mass fraction even for unrealistically high organic matter concentration in seawater. These findings are indicative that discrepancies on the composition of the primary aerosol between different studies could partly be explained by the difference in the nature and concentration of the organic matter in the source seawater employed. Consistently across the experiments, theoretical analysis based on the Köhler model predicted a reduction in the primary marine aerosol CCN activity upon the incorporation of marine organics into the particle composition. This effect is consequence of the replacement of small inorganic sea salt molecules by large molar mass organic molecules, together with a moderate suppression of the surface tension at the point of activation of 5 – 0. 5 %, which leads to a dominance of the reduction in the dissolved solute in the Raoult term...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{identify}} appropriate geological analogues for the Holocene have prompted previous interglacial periods as a fitting choice. However, {{there is room}} for substantial improvements to our knowledge of past inter- and intra-interglacial sea level fluctuations. Studies that provide information on relative sea level movements during previous interglacial periods facilitate an understanding of the link between changes in climatological parameters, ice sheet response and resultant changes in sea level and afford more accurate prediction of sea level changes that could occur in the future. An interglacial lithological sequence from the Nar Valley area of north Norfolk, UK represents a marine transgression that occurred during marine isotope stage 9. The aim of this project was to provide an account of the nature of this marine transgression; in terms of its rapidity and whether any oscillations in sea level occurred. In order to do so, the project used foraminifera as a palaeoenvironmental indicator of water depth and, subsequently, sea level. Collating evidence from four study sites tracked this marine transgression over an elevation range of 20 metre and suggested a transgression initially characterised by oscillations of very small magnitudes that initiated {{to the west of the}} Nar Valley. As the transgression tracked eastwards, it was characterised by a smooth and somewhat gradual progression through the Nar Valley from west to east where, at its greatest <b>extent,</b> <b>marine</b> conditions persisted as far inland as a site at Bradmoor Hill. The maximum elevation of the marine transgression is estimated to have been 23 metres OD, with fully estuarine conditions established across most of the Nar Valley. This transgression appears to have been absent of any sizeable sea level oscillations, suggesting that MIS 9 serves as an appropriate analogue for the Holocene in terms of sea level change. The smooth nature of the transgression provides no evidence to suggest rapid changes in sea level occurred as a result of unstable ice sheets. This suggestion has important implications for better constraining the upper and lower bounds of predictions of future sea level change.

These cements are discontinuously arranged within the sequence that consists predominantly of grainstones but locally includes clotted muddy and filamentous textures that may be of microbial origin. Calcite cements vary in morphology with groups of crystals that include acute scalenohedral, rhombohedral and flattened concordant terminations; these show varying densities of inclusions that locally define growth zones and in some terminations divide {{in the manner of}} `split crystals' to form fibrous fringes. Morphological changes in calcite are inferred to reflect changes in water chemistry and crystal growth rates at the time of growth, allied to their relationship to the palaeo-water table, and linked in turn to changes in sea-level. Neomorphism and dissolution are widespread and variations in the severity of both imply response to the degree of undersaturation of pore waters that at times were probably balanced within very narrow limits. A total of 10 depositional units are identified. Those units {{at the base of the}} borehole reflect deposition and diagenesis within a marine environment. The influence of meteoric waters, indicated by stable isotopes, is first apparent at the top of Unit 1 and in Unit 2 (184 to 155 [*]m below sea floor). Petrographic evidence of vadose conditions appears at the tops of Unit 3 (131 to 99 [*]m below sea floor). Units 4 to 8, all deposited under marine conditions, provide isotopic evidence of meteoric or mixing-zone waters and petrographic indicators of vadose conditions, typically at the top of the units. Evidence indicates that in Unit 5 the water table was mobile and Units 6 a, 6 b, 7 and 8, all characterized by ultraviolet fluorescent cements, are capped by sub-aerial erosion surfaces. Unit 9 (the Holocene) reflects the recent re-establishment of <b>marine</b> conditions. The <b>extent</b> of alteration of the entire sequence reflects the substantial and pervasive influence of meteoric waters. This effect is interpreted as a result of a greater rainfall and river flow from the mainland during early and late stages of interstadial periods. The study reflects progress in the ability to recognize the diagenetic signal generated by sea-level change. However, whereas the isotopic results reflect the changing relationships between vadose and phreatic zones in groundwater systems beneath successive emergent surfaces, their correspondence with petrographic features is expressed only weakly and commonly lacks the systematic sequential overprinting implied by the distribution of cathodoluminescent zones of cements in many ancient limestones...|$|R
40|$|Particularly in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions, high-resolution climate records have demonstrated major {{variability in the}} hydrological cycle at orbital, millennial and sub-millennial time scales in the last 25, 000 years. Geographical patterns of past climate change (from the equator to both poles, and among continents and ocean basins at similar latitude) at these various time scales {{hold the key to}} understanding the climate-dynamical processes governing them, and to resolution of longstanding questions about the relative importance of tropical and high-latitude climate dynamics in translating external climate-forcing mechanisms into regional climate variability. Currently, dynamical analysis of past tropical climate variability is being hampered by the fragmentary or poorly dated nature of available records from key continental regions, debate to what <b>extent</b> <b>marine</b> records are representative for climate history on the continents, and uncertainty about whether traditional isotopic tracers applied to tropical continental records mainly reflect temperature or hydrological change. What has been missing is a continuous, high-resolution climate record from the tropics that adequately separates the evolution of temperature and hydrological change, and covers the period from the Last Glacial Maximum until the present with sufficient age control to establish supra-regional phase relationships in past climate anomalies at millennial and century time scales. In this context, the EuroCLIMATE project CHALLACEA here presents a reconstruction of climate history on the East African equator, based on multiple proxy-indicator analyses in the sediment record of a permanently stratified crater lake (Lake Challa, a 4. 2 km 2, 92 m deep crater lake on the lower East slope of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania) with stable physical limnology and sedimentation dynamics over the past 25, 000 years. This has resulted in a unique combination of high temporal resolution, excellent radiometric (210 Pb, 14 C) age control, and confidence that the recording parameters of the climatic proxies (i. e. the relationship between climate change and its proxy signals extracted from the sediment record) have remained constant through time. The equatorial (3 ° S) location of our study site in East Africa, where seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone spans the widest latitude range, provides unique information on how varying rainfall contributions from the Indian Ocean monsoons have shaped the region’s climate history. The detailed reconstruction of the temperature and moisture-balance history of equatorial East Africa from before the Last Glacial Maximum to the present uniquely weaves together tropical climate variability at orbital, millennial and century time scales. The temporal pattern of reconstructed climate changes bears the clear signature of half-precessional insolation forcing of tropical monsoon dynamics on the East African equator, modified by high southern latitude influence on the timing of post-glacial temperature rise, and by high northern latitude influence on tropical hydrological variability at millennial and century time scales...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} “marine scientific research” {{refers to}} a variety of scientific disciplines, such as biology, biotechnology, geology, chemistry, physics, geophysics, hydrography, physical oceanography, and ocean drilling and coring, which are dedicated to the study of oceans, marine flora, fauna, and physical boundaries with the solid earth and the atmosphere. The purpose of such research is “to observe, to explain, and eventually to understand sufficiently well how to predict and explain changes in the natural (marine) world. ” Marine scientific research thus contributes to the rational exploitation of the sea’s resources, the preservation of the marine environment, safer navigation, and military uses of the sea, as well as the better general understanding of the earth. For example, marine scientific research is germane in the location of oilfields, which allows for the exploitation of offshore oil resources. Also, by helping understand local marine ecosystems, as well as the substances and factors which may affect or endanger them, marine scientific research is essential for the protection and preservation of the marine environment. For example, the sustainable exploitation of a particular stock of fish can only be achieved after sufficient marine scientific research has provided the necessary data to prevent overfishing. Marine scientific research is also used for the study of waves and currents, depth soundings, searches for wrecks, and the overall mapping of the ocean floor, which are essential for the safety of navigation. Similarly, in relation to military uses of the sea, marine scientific research has contributed {{to the development of the}} ability to detect submarines. Marine scientific research also contributes to a better understanding of the earth by providing, through geology and geophysics, knowledge of the tectonic movement of the seafloor, submarine topography, terrestrial magnetism and paleomagnetism, gravity, quake and elastic wave, and sedimentation, which help predict tsunamis and earthquakes. Finally, through meteorology and climatology, marine scientific research provides information about the relationship of the oceans and the atmosphere. These, and other uses of marine scientific research, clearly illustrate the fact that such research is essential in many areas that affect the relationship between man and the sea. The roots of the age of ocean discovery can be unearthed from the voyages of scientists aboard the H. M. S. Challenger (1872 - 1876), who sampled both the ocean floor and water column. However, the true beginning of exploration was marked by the echo sounder and the development of the sonic methods used to trace submarines in the First World War. Currently, food and energy is impacted by the continuation of marine scientific research, and in effect, the future of mankind depends on it. Marine scientific research had been unregulated until the 1950 s, when the international community adopted the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and agreed to the introduction of a legal regime, which called for coastal State consent for the conduct of research on the continental shelf. In 1960, the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) established the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The IOC’s purpose is “to promote international cooperation and to coordinate programmes in research, services and capacity building, in order to learn more about the nature and resources of the ocean and coastal areas and to apply that knowledge for the improvement of management, sustainable development, the protection of the marine environment, and the decisionmaking processes of its member State[s]. ” To a certain <b>extent,</b> <b>marine</b> scientific research also falls under the jurisdiction of various other international organizations and bodies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), and the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) ...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine benthic assemblages {{are often}} numerically {{dominated}} by polychaetes. The limits of these populations {{are determined by}} larval, and probably {{to a lesser extent}} adult movement. A previous study (Newton 1996), indicated that planktonic polychaete larvae were very abundant over the summer months in the Hopkins River; however, the identification and source of these larvae was not known. Defining the extent of a population, and therefore the likelihood of that population recovering following a perturbation, is crucial for effective estuarine management. This study investigated both the likely source of the larvae, (i. e. estuarine or <b>marine)</b> and the <b>extent</b> of larval dispersal within and between estuaries by addressing the following questions: Which taxa produced the planktonic larvae? Are these taxa resident estuarine species? Are the larvae of different taxa evenly distributed within the estuary or do physicochemical parameters or other factors influence their abundance? Are the same larvae found in other estuaries along the coast? and Is there exchange of these larval taxa with the marine environment and other estuaries? Larvae were identified and described by culturing commonly occurring planktonic larvae until adult characteristics appeared. The spionids, Carazziella victoriensis and Prionospio Tatura, numerically dominated the plankton in the Hopkins and the spionid, Orthoprionospio cirriformia was recorded from the Hopkins, Curdies and Gellibrand estuaries. Two spionids, Carazziella sp. and Polydora sp. were identified from tidal waters. Mouth status and physicochemical conditions (salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen) were monitored in each estuary. Whereas the Merri and Gellibrand estuaries were predominantly stratified over the sampling period, the Curdies was more often well mixed and the Hopkins varied from well mixed to stratified. The duration of mouth opening and hence the opportunity for larval exchange also varied in each estuary. The Merri River was closed for 13. 5 % of days over the study period, the Gellibrand River for 18. 4 %, the Hopkins River for 49 % and the Curdies River for 71. 0 %. The distributions of larvae at spatial scales of metres, 100 s of metres and kilometres were investigated within a single estuary. While the same larvae, C. victoriensis, P. Tatura and bivalve larvae, were found {{along the length of the}} Hopkins estuary the abundances varied at different spatial scales suggesting different processes were influencing the distribution of P. Tatura larvae, and C. victoriensis and bivalve larvae. The distribution of larvae between several estuaries was investigated by monitoring meroplankton at two sites at the mouth of each of the four estuaries approximately monthly (except for winter months). Different meroplanktonic assemblages were found to distinguish each estuary. Further, C. victoriensis and P. Tatura larvae were only recorded in the Hopkins but larvae of the spionid, Orthoprionopio cirriformia were detected in the Hopkins, Curdies and Gellibrand estuaries. The extent of larval exchange with other estuaries and the marine environment was determined by monitoring tidal waters. Settlement trays were also deployed to determine if larvae were moving into estuaries and settling but not recruiting. P. tatura larvae were not detected in the tidal waters of any estuary and while C. victoriensis and O. cirriformia were found in both flood and ebb tides there was no evidence of movement of theses taxa to other estuaries. Larvae of the spionids, Carazziella sp. and Polydora sp., were found in tidal waters of each estuary but were rarely detected in the plankton within the estuaries. Neither species was found as an adult in background cores from any estuary, nor with the exception of a few individuals in the Merri, were they detected in settlement trays in any estuary. I conclude that the source of the larvae of C. victoriensis, P. Tatura and O. cirriformia is estuarine and while C. victoriensis, and O. cirriformia move in and outh of the source estuary in tidal waters there was no evidence for movement to other estuaries. The spionids, Carazziella sp. and Polydora sp were considered to be marine and while they moved in and out of estuaries in tidal waters they did not usually settle in the estuaries. The results of this study are a crucial first step in the development of ecological models to better understand dispersal in seasonally closed estuaries that are typical of southern Australia. This study emphasises the unique physicochemical characteristics and biological assemblages within these estuaries and the need for estuarine management to reflect these differences...|$|R
40|$|There is {{the need}} for a legal {{instrument}} that would first and foremost establish the executive powers of a new entity with overarching responsibilities and powers over all the authorities that have sectoral responsibilities for climate change. Such a legal instrument should also identify these sectoral authorities and their responsibilities, preferably within an Annex which could be amended and adjusted in a flexible manner. This instrument should be managed by a new unit on climate change within MRA and it should ensure integration without causing fragmentation between the sectors. At the same time, retaining the sectoral input would ensure that there is no duplication of roles, that the institutions are specialised within their own field and that the overarching institution does not becomes a bottle neck. In other words, different competent authorities responsible for the different sectoral policies and obligations should remain, but these must be answerable to an institution that has executive powers to ensure compliance and to coordinate long and short term planning with respect to climate change targets and impacts. By way of recommendation therefore, a legal instrument of this sort should seek to intervene as little as possible in the daily running of the sectoral policies and only apply its powers in situations of emergency when non compliance by the different sectors stalls the fulfilment of Malta’s obligations. Its main role should be to ensure implementation of a National Strategy on Mitigation and Adaptation. This legal instrument would not duplicate the role of public institutions that are already regulators for various sectors on climate change. It would however empower the new entity to take enforcement measures against the said institutions if they fail to do so. It would also ensure the implementation and enforcement of existing legislation that regulates the various sectors in order to rationalize their sustainable use and provide for conservation measures. This would benefit both the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. An entity entrusted with the overall responsibility for climate change law and policy must be legally empowered to ensure the implementation of national adaptation programmes. It must also coordinate the various sectors to carry out the necessary research to adopt and implement mitigation and adaptation measures. It must necessarily be supported by a parallel capacity building process in the various entities that run the day-to- day implementation functions. On an administrative level, without necessarily being included in a legal instrument, memoranda of understanding and stakeholder dialogue are indispensable tools to ensure cooperation. This will facilitate reaching mitigation and adaptation targets within the stipulated time frames. The mainstreaming of climate change impacts in national policies ensures the adoption of mitigation and adaptation measures and guarantees synergy and linkages amongst various public plans and programmes. Response to climate change should take place at a strategic level to assess beforehand the socio-economic impacts of any mitigation and adaptation measures adopted as a consequence prior to mainstreaming into national policy making. The existing Regulations on the Strategic Environment Assessment already include climate change impacts as {{one of the issues that}} needs to be taken into consideration in an SEA. Furthermore, for all those situations where an SEA is not required, Maltese authorities should promote pro-active adaptation measures such as, for example, in development planning, rather than take reactive adaptation measures. The new climate change legal instrument must ensure effective monitoring and stakeholder engagement, particularly the involvement of NGOS and Local Councils which increases public awareness on climate change issues. The new law should also take into consideration national security issues relating to climate change when formulating mitigation and adaptation strategies. The new law should also target the development of a research programme for climate change, including access to funding programmes. It is vital that Investment in research and development in all sectors should not remain on a voluntary basis. It will provide local industry with the necessary technology and it will generate specialised local expertise in a rapidly growing sector that is assuming a tremendous economic potential. Procrastination is detrimental on two main fronts. First because Malta will miss out in securing a place in this niche-market and second because we will keep relying upon foreign technology and expertise. Since Malta can rely on and pool from the scientific and technical advice of the European Environmental agency, it is best to concentrate on investing in scientific and technical research that addresses the local scenario. This should be earmarked as a priority for EU funded projects and care should be taken not to duplicate research conducted by EU agencies to which Malta has access, but rather to build upon it and apply it at the local level. It is also essential to include as a legal obligation the publication to civil society of information acquired as a result of research conducted at the EU level or carried out locally. It must be ensured that all sectors surmount the constraints due to the lack of a sound knowledge base on local ecosystem dynamics. Filling such a gap would serve to build local scientific evidence that would identify to what <b>extent</b> <b>marine,</b> terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna groups are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Emphasis should be placed on minor and already vulnerable groups. All sectors should be legally bound to maintain a Geographic Information System to integrate data related to climate change, and any other data required apart from spatial information. Adopting and implementing the recommendations suggested by the National Sustainable Development Strategy for Malta would greatly enhance the implementation of adaptation measures relating to climate change, both on a cross-sectoral and sectoral level. At present it is envisaged that the government is currently preparing a new Bill on sustainable development, in the meantime the applicable provisions of the EPA by virtue of which the sustainable development strategy was published should continue to apply. Malta should also endeavour to promote more regional cooperation in the Mediterranean under the Barcelona Convention framework and Euro Med, to identify the adaptation needs of the Mediterranean littoral to the impacts of climate change. Authorities should initiate immediately, even at the regional Mediterranean level, studies to assess vulnerability due to climate change, how new opportunities may be tapped, how to meet with the negative consequences of climate change in the sector, how to ensure that local operators adapt to the shift in tourism trends as a result of climate change. There {{is the need}} of systematic and sustained awareness building programmes to educate all. This will intensify awareness and promote a change in behavioural patterns to improve adaptation to climate change. Increasing awareness of climate change impacts within the government, industry, and community sectors will support cultural change transitions that are required for the adoption of more climate change friendly technologies, designs, and operations by public and private operators. The new climate change law should also obligate the various sectors to formulate contingency plans. This serves to: address the negative impacts envisaged as a result of climate change particularly upon vulnerable groups. assess socio-economic implications, with increased insurance covers for risks resulting from the likely impacts of climate change. identify financial guarantees and incentives amongst the various stakeholders in all sectors. peer-reviewe...|$|R
