5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream {{spore print}} {{with a slight}} salmon tinge. The spores are oval, with largish warts of around 1 <b>micrometre</b> (μm) which are joined by a {{well-developed}} network of mostly thin ridges. The spores measure 7.5–11μm by 6.5–9μm, and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100nanometres in size, {{are used}} in many applications. They {{are used in}} {{conductive}} inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of <b>micrometre</b> size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals {{in much the same}} way as larger silver particles.|$|E
5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a <b>micrometre,</b> not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
50|$|Hegman gauges are {{commonly}} {{available in the}} following ranges: 0 to 100 <b>micrometres,</b> 0 to 50 <b>micrometres,</b> 0 to 25 <b>micrometres,</b> 0 to 15 <b>micrometres,</b> and 0 to 10 <b>micrometres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mature male parasites {{measured}} 11.8 x 4.0 <b>micrometres</b> (range: 9.6 x 4.2 - 13.2 x 3.6 <b>micrometres)</b> {{and females}} 13.5 x 4.5 <b>micrometres</b> (range: 12.0 x 4.5 - 15.0 x 4.8 <b>micrometres).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The meronts are fan-like {{and contain}} 7 - 8 merozoites (range: 4 - 10). They measure ~5.0 <b>micrometres</b> (range:3.3-6.2) in length, 2.2 <b>micrometres</b> in width (range: 1.7-3.1) and 9.4 square <b>micrometres</b> (range: 5.4-12.2) in area. The pigment {{granules}} occupy 0.8-1.3 square <b>micrometres</b> in area.|$|R
5|$|Photonic {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} chitin of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a <b>micrometre</b> wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.|$|E
25|$|The well-to-wheel variant has a {{significant}} input on a model developed by the Argonne National Laboratory. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is {{used to determine the}} impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and six additional pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with size smaller than 10 <b>micrometre</b> (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 <b>micrometre</b> (PM2.5), and sulfur oxides (SOx).|$|E
25|$|Microaneurysms, {{also known}} as Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms, {{typically}} occur in small blood vessels (less than 300 <b>micrometre</b> diameter), most often the lenticulostriate vessels of the basal ganglia, and are associated with chronic hypertension. Charcot–Bouchard aneurysms are a common cause of intracranial hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the sarcocyst may be helpful in species {{diagnosis}} with 24 wall types identified in 62 species. S. hominis and S. suihominis both have walls of type 10. The wall of S. hominis is up to 6 <b>micrometres</b> thick and appears radially striated from villar protrusions up to 7 <b>micrometres</b> long. Its bradyzoites are 7 to 9 <b>micrometres</b> long. The wall of S. suihominis is 4 to 9 <b>micrometres</b> thick, with villar protrusions up to 13 <b>micrometres</b> long. Its bradyzoites are 15 <b>micrometres</b> long.|$|R

25|$|Air pollution: {{the release}} of {{chemicals}} and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their <b>micrometre</b> size PM10 to PM2.5.|$|E
25|$|He naturalised in France {{and stayed}} ten years, but his {{position}} became irksome, and at length intolerable. He, however, {{continued to work}} in the pursuit of science knowledge, and published many remarkable works. Among them was an elegant solution of the problem to determine the orbit of a comet from three observations and works on <b>micrometre</b> and achromatic telescopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of flux emitted by L and T dwarfs {{is in the}} 1 to 2.5 <b>micrometre</b> near-infrared range. Low and decreasing temperatures through the late M-, L-, and T-dwarf sequence result in a rich near-infrared spectrum containing {{a wide variety of}} features, from relatively narrow lines of neutral atomic species to broad molecular bands, all of which have different dependencies on temperature, gravity, and metallicity. Furthermore, these low temperature conditions favor condensation out of the gas state and the formation of grains.|$|E

50|$|Macrogametocytes {{are found}} only in mature {{erythrocytes}} even during heavy parasitemia. They measure 9.7 <b>micrometres</b> (range: 7.1 - 12.3) long, 2.3 <b>micrometres</b> (range: 1.9 - 2.8) in width and 21.2 (range: 13.1 - 30.6) square <b>micrometres</b> in area. The cytoplasm is coarsely granular in appearance and usually lacks vacuoles.|$|R
50|$|The microgametocyte are 9.7 <b>micrometres</b> (range: 7.6 - 12.0) long, 2.2 <b>micrometres</b> (range: 1.6 - 2.6) {{in width}} and 19.8 (range: 13.5 - 25.1) square <b>micrometres</b> in area. Compared with the macrogametocytes, their nuclei are {{relatively}} compact - a rare feature for avian hemosporidians. The nuclei are located centrally or subcentrally.|$|R
25|$|The {{distributors}} also purport {{that the}} coins {{have been struck}} using silver recovered from a vault in {{the rubble of the}} World Trade Center. The validity of this claim has not been confirmed. Distributors warn that the minting of the coin will cease once the quantity of recovered silver has been exhausted, and have therefore placed a limit on the number of coins that can be ordered per person. The coins are not solid silver, but are silver clad (0.0001inch (2.5 <b>micrometre)</b> layer). Actual silver content is 45mg, or 0.00145 troy oz.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding {{the arduous}} duties of his professorship, he found time for {{investigation}} in various fields of physical science, and he published {{a very large}} number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction <b>micrometre,</b> and various problems of spherical trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 <b>micrometre</b> thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E
50|$|Mature gametocytes are {{round to}} oval and measure 5.6 +/- 0.2 (range: 5-7) <b>micrometres</b> x 4.8 +/- 0.2 (range: 4-6) <b>micrometres.</b> Vacuoles are rarely seen.|$|R
50|$|Typically coffee {{filters are}} made up of {{filaments}} approximately 20 <b>micrometres</b> wide, which allow particles through that are less than approximately 10 to 15 <b>micrometres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Female gametocytes measure 18 <b>micrometres</b> x 4 <b>micrometres.</b> The {{cytoplasm}} {{tends to}} be more basophilic than the male gametocytes. 10-12 pigment granules are found in the cytoplasm.|$|R
25|$|Polypropylene {{is a major}} polymer used in nonwovens, {{with over}} 50% used for diapers or {{sanitary}} products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 <b>micrometre</b> range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar floating barriers near oil spills on rivers.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 <b>micrometre</b> in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view of what we know of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves {{toward the back of the}} cell.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the neural}} {{connections}} of the receptors, the optical system is an equally {{key player in}} retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, {{the image of a}} diffraction grating can subtend 0.5 <b>micrometre</b> on the retina. This is certainly not the case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.|$|E
50|$|Mature schizonts are 4.0 - 6.0 <b>micrometres</b> x 1.5 - 3.0 <b>micrometres</b> in {{size and}} give rise to 4-6 merozoites. Schizonts tend to lie lateral to the nucleus.|$|R
50|$|Coccolithophores are spherical cells about 5-100 <b>micrometres</b> across, {{enclosed}} by calcareous plates called coccoliths, which are about 2-25 <b>micrometres</b> across. Each cell contains two brown chloroplasts which surround the nucleus.|$|R

500|$|Turbulence at Triton's surface {{creates a}} {{troposphere}} (a [...] "weather region") rising to {{an altitude of}} 8km. Streaks on Triton's surface left by geyser plumes suggest that the troposphere is driven by seasonal winds capable of moving material of over a <b>micrometre</b> in size. Unlike other atmospheres, Triton's lacks a stratosphere, and instead has a thermosphere from altitudes of 8 to 950km, and an exosphere above that. The temperature of Triton's upper atmosphere, at , is higher than that at its surface, due to heat absorbed from solar radiation and Neptune's magnetosphere. A haze permeates most of Triton's troposphere, thought to be composed largely of hydrocarbons and nitriles created {{by the action of}} sunlight on methane. Triton's atmosphere also has clouds of condensed nitrogen that lie between 1 and 3km from its surface.|$|E
500|$|Viruses {{are among}} the {{smallest}} infectious agents, {{and most of them}} can only be seen by electron microscopy. Most viruses cannot be seen by light microscopy (in other words, they are sub-microscopic); their sizes range from 20 to 300nm. They are so small that it would take 30,000 to 750,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one cm. By contrast bacterial sizes are typically around 1 <b>micrometre</b> (1000nm) in diameter, and the cells of higher organisms a few tens of micrometres. Some viruses such as [...] megaviruses and pandoraviruses are relatively large. At around 1 micrometer, these viruses, which infect amoebae, were discovered in 2003 and 2013. They are around a thousand times larger than influenza viruses and the discovery of these [...] "giant" [...] viruses astonished scientists.|$|E
50|$|The gills {{are white}} to white-grey, {{sometimes}} with brown speckles. The spores are amyloidic {{and have a}} length of 8 to 10 <b>micrometres</b> and a width of 4 to 5.5 <b>micrometres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} capture {{relatively small}} dust particles with large liquid droplets. In most wet scrubbing systems, droplets produced are generally larger than 50 <b>micrometres</b> (in the 150 to 500 <b>micrometres</b> range). As {{a point of}} reference, human hair ranges in diameter from 50 to 100 <b>micrometres.</b> The size distribution of particles to be collected is source specific.For example, particles produced by mechanical means (crushing or grinding) tend to be large (above 10 micrometres); whereas, particles produced from combustion or a chemical reaction will have {{a substantial portion of}} small (less than 5 <b>micrometres)</b> and submicrometre particles.|$|R
50|$|Dot matrix {{holograms}} {{are capable}} of embedding microtext at various sizes. There are three types of microtexts in holograms: high contrast microtexts of size 50 - 150 micrometres; diffractive grating filled microtexts of size 50 - 150 <b>micrometres</b> low contrast microtexts. Microtexts of sizes smaller than 50 <b>micrometres</b> {{are referred to as}} nanotext. Nanotext with sizes of less than 50 <b>micrometres</b> can be observed with a microscope only.|$|R
