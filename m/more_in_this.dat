5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{states and}} feudal states, both low in infrastructural power, {{depend on the}} despotic rule of an elite class for {{societal}} order. Monarchs and emperors of the past could not extend their direct rule to every aspect of social life {{without the aid of}} modern technology. Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the infrastructural power of developed states rose rapidly. In the modern era, developed states became able to monitor their populations; provide employment, health care and welfare; impact all levels of the economy; and <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, they obtained their infrastructural power.|$|E
25|$|A low {{temperature}} example is work by Kitagawa, et al. {{who used a}} two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and adipic acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration. The result {{was one of the}} first instances of a MOF showing “superprotonic” conductivity (8 x 10−3 S/cm) at 25°C and 98% relative humidity (RH). They later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity even <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> {{low temperature}} regime that is dependent on degree of hydration, it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels.|$|E

25|$|By 1954, with Fred Trueman and Appleyard {{back in the}} team, Yorkshire rebounded and Wardle {{was able}} to become an enterprising attacking spinner once <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> role, he took 16 wickets against Sussex, and bowled so well against Pakistan that he toured Australia with Len Hutton's MCC side that winter. Apart from 5 for 79 and 3 for 51 on a flood-soaked pitch at Sydney, he had little to do. His use of left-arm off-breaks and googlies the {{following}} summer allowed Wardle to reach almost 200 first-class and 15 Test wickets. In the wet summer of 1956, Lock was again preferred in the Test side, to the disgust of the Yorkshire members, but Wardle, chiefly bowling wrist-spin, baffled all South African batsmen that winter on pitches giving him little help. In the second Test at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, he took 7 for 36 to dismiss South Africa for 72, and may have taken more than 26 Test wickets but for injury. On that tour, Wardle claimed 90 first-class wickets at 12 runs apiece.|$|E
25|$|The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{recommends}} statin {{treatment for}} adults {{with an estimated}} 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190mg/dl; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or <b>more.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> latter group, statin assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a statin is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited. Moreover, if a risk decision was uncertain, factors such as family history, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and an inflammation test (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0mg/L) were suggested to inform the risk decision. Additional factors {{that could be used}} were an LDL-C ≥ 160 or a very high lifetime risk. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for patients who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommend the use of statins for primary prevention, depending on baseline estimated cardiovascular score and LDL thresholds.|$|E

500|$|Joanna Bullivant, {{writing in}} Music and Letters, {{maintains}} {{that in his}} music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism. The critic Hugo Cole thought that, as a composer, Bush came close to Paul Hindemith's ideal: [...] "one for whom music is felt as a moral and social force, and only incidentally {{as a means of}} personal expression". [...] The composer Wilfrid Mellers credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed even when it was entirely out of fashion, he [...] "attempt to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future".

The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls.
