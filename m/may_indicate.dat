50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 18 mm for males and 19 mm for females. The main flight period is from September to October; a single specimen from early <b>May</b> <b>indicates</b> there <b>may</b> be spring flight.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 May the Conservatives {{promised to}} replace the 1983 Mental Health Act, to employ an {{additional}} 10,000 NHS mental health workers by 2020 and to tackle discrimination against those with mental health problems. <b>May</b> <b>indicated</b> that the Conservatives would maintain their net immigration target, and promised to implement a cap on [...] "rip-off energy prices", a policy that appeared in Labour's 2015 manifesto. <b>May</b> <b>indicated</b> she would permit a free vote among Conservative MPs on repealing the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales. On 11 May the Conservatives promised above-inflation increases in defence spending alongside its NATO commitment {{to spend at least}} 2% of GDP on defence.|$|R

5|$|Foram dissolution: Foraminifera tests {{appear to}} be more eroded during H3 and H6 (Gwiazda et al., 1996). That <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> an influx of nutrient-rich, hence corrosive, Antarctic Bottom Water by a {{reconfiguration}} of oceanic circulation patterns.|$|E
5|$|Low-tech {{communication}} {{aids are}} defined as {{those that do not}} need batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E
5|$|The star {{also shows}} {{evidence}} of a long-term radial velocity trend, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> {{the presence of an}} additional outer companion.|$|E
50|$|On string instruments, {{a string}} {{change is a}} change from playing on one string to another. This may also involve a {{simultaneous}} change in fingering and/or position (shift), all of which must be done skillfully to avoid noticeable string noise. String <b>may</b> be <b>indicated</b> through Roman numerals (I-IV) or simply the string's base note's letter (e.g. - A, E, G, etc.), fingering <b>may</b> be <b>indicated</b> through numbers for the fingers (1-4), and position <b>may</b> be <b>indicated</b> through ordinal numbers (e.g. 2nd). When two strings are played {{at the same time}} it is a double stop.|$|R

5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, UB-11 {{had been}} {{assigned}} to the Kiel Periscope School by September 1915. Uboat.net reports that UB-11' undertook no war patrols and had no successes against enemy ships, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> that the vessel remained in use only as a training vessel.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary Hittite {{accounts}} {{about the}} campaigns of Attarsiya and the Ahhiya in general <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> {{that there was}} a possible Mycenaean empire centered on late Bronze Age Greece. Moreover, Attarsiya might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name Atreus, a king of Mycenae according to Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{discovered}} that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> a common tidal origin for the satellites.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} activity {{occurred in the}} region farther east, on Hardy Peninsula and some surrounding capes and islands during the Miocene; potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 18 and 21 million years ago. These volcanic systems <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> that the Antarctic Plate is subducting beneath the Scotia Plate.|$|E
50|$|If the {{condition}} involves {{only a single}} duct, then microdochectomy <b>may</b> be <b>indicated,</b> in particular in women wishing to preserve the ability to breastfeed; if {{the condition}} involves from several ducts or if no specific duct could be determined, then a subareolar resection of the ducts (central duct excision, also called Hadfield's procedure) <b>may</b> be <b>indicated</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|On {{a string}} instrument, shifting, or a shift, is a {{movement}} of the fingers of the left hand from one position to another on the same string. Position is indicated through ordinal numbers (e.g., 3rd). Strings <b>may</b> be <b>indicated</b> through Roman numerals, I-IV, and fingering <b>may</b> be <b>indicated</b> through numbers, 1-4. When done skillfully shifting avoids string noise.|$|R

5|$|Rudolf Simek {{states that}} the obscurity {{of the names of}} the objects in the tale of Hjúki and Bil <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> that Snorri derived them from a folktale, and that the form of the tale of the Man in the Moon (featuring a man with a pole and a woman with a bushel) is also found in modern {{folklore}} in Scandinavia, England, and Northern Germany.|$|E
5|$|The border {{position}} of Transylvania {{led to the}} formation of the voivodeship, since the monarchs could not maintain direct control over this remote region. Thus the voivodes were never autonomous, but remained provincial officials. The voivodes were heads of Fehér County from 1201, which <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> that their position had its origin in the office of that county's ispán.|$|E
5|$|The chasms {{that open}} {{throughout}} {{the sea in}} the final moments of the book derive from the Hollow Earth theory. The area closest to the Pole is also, surprisingly, warm rather than cold, as Symmes believed. Symmes also believed there were civilizations inside this Hollow Earth and the enshrouded figure who appears at the end <b>may</b> <b>indicate</b> one such civilization near the Pole.|$|E
