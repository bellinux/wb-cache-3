5|$|It was {{not until}} the British {{discovery}} of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This frond-shaped fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest, and due to the detailed geological mapping of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. Palaeontologist Martin Glaessner finally, in 1959, <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> between this and the earlier finds and with a combination of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were recognised.|$|E
25|$|Brandt {{was already}} {{familiar}} with the legend of a unicorn among the Tatars of Siberia with a horn so large it required a sledge for transport, and <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> in interpreting the bump as {{the base of a}} horn. He also interpreted the rostrum of the upper mandible as the basis of a nasal horn, a hypothesis now rejected in favour of the cropping labia. In any case, the non-circular base indicates a section through the horn would not have been circular. This possibility is supported by another fossil with a non-circular partially healed puncture wound in the base, chiefly interpreted as the result of dueling other males with the horn.|$|E

In his 2000 book Wildlife Films, Bousé makes a stronger correlation between Annaud's film and Disney's Dumbo (1941), in that both young animals lost their mothers at an early age, creating an unfortunate situation that allows {{the rest of the}} plot to develop (although, Dumbo's mother was merely imprisoned for a while, and was re-united with her son at the film's end). Dumbo and The Bear also share a similarly purposed dream sequence, brought on by alcohol in the former and hallucinogenic mushrooms in the latter.|$|E

Gerda is masquerading as Helen Montressor, a distant Canadian cousin currently living on Blunt's estate. Blunt's money came from his now-deceased second wife, but he and Gerda never divorced; if the fact of Blunt's bigamy were known, he would be disgraced and ruined. Running into Blunt in the street, Mabelle Sainsbury Seale had recognised and spoken to {{him in front of}} his niece, but had not realised that he was now the prominent banker.

25|$|Early studies into Scandinavian {{sources and}} analogues {{proposed}} that Beowulf was {{a translation of}} an original Scandinavian work, but this idea has been discarded. In 1878, Guðbrandur Vigfússon <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> between Beowulf and the Grettis saga. This is currently {{one of the few}} Scandinavian analogues to receive a general consensus of potential connection. Tales concerning the Skjöldungs, possibly originating as early as the 6th century were later used as a narrative basis in such texts as Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus and Hrólfs saga kraka. Some scholars see Beowulf as a product of these early tales along with Gesta Danorum and Hrólfs saga kraka, and some early scholars of the poem proposed that the latter saga and Beowulf share a common legendary ancestry, Beowulfs Hrothulf being identified with Hrólf Kraki. Paul Beekman Taylor argued that the Ynglinga saga was proof that the Beowulf poet was likewise working from Germanic tradition.|$|E

The following morning the Pittsburgh Police arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The memorabilia is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. The car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and, over the weekend, Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen.

According to Sitchin's interpretation of Babylonian religious texts, which contradicts conclusions reached by credited scholars on the subject, a giant planet (called Nibiru or Marduk) passes by Earth every 3,600 years and allows its sentient inhabitants to interact with humanity. These beings, which Sitchin identified with the Annunaki of Sumerian myth, would become humanity's first gods.

500|$|The {{first known}} {{physical}} remain of the broad-billed parrot was a subfossil mandible collected {{along with the}} first batch of dodo bones found in the Mare aux Songes swamp. The English biologist Richard Owen described the mandible in 1866 and identified it as belonging to a large parrot species, to which he gave the binomial name Psittacus mauritianus and the common name [...] "broad-billed parrot". This holotype specimen is now lost. In 1868, shortly after the 1601 journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland had been rediscovered, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel examined an unlabelled pen-and-ink sketch in it. Realising that the drawing, which is attributed to the artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, depicted the parrot described by Owen, Schlegel <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> with the old journal descriptions. In 1875, because its bones and crest are significantly {{different from those of}} Psittacus species, the English zoologist Alfred Newton assigned it to its own genus, which he called Lophopsittacus. Lophos is the Ancient Greek word for crest, referring here to the bird's frontal crest, and psittakos means parrot.|$|E
500|$|The star's unusual name {{inspired}} {{the title of}} the 1988 film Beetlejuice, and script writer Michael McDowell was impressed by how many people <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> He added that they had received a suggestion the sequel be named Sanduleak-69 202 after the former star of SN 1987A. In August Derleth's short story [...] "The Dweller in the Darkness" [...] set in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, Betelgeuse is the home of the [...] "benign" [...] Elder Gods. The identity of the red star Borgil mentioned in Lord of the Rings was much debated; Aldebaran, Betelgeuse and the planet Mars were touted as candidates. Professor Kristine Larsen has concluded the evidence points to it being Aldebaran as it precedes Menelvagor (Orion). Astronomy writer Robert Burnham, Jr. proposed the term padparadaschah which denotes a rare orange sapphire in India, for the star. In the popular science fiction series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, Ford Prefect was from [...] "a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse."

500|$|The book {{includes}} extensive {{discussion of}} Gaëtan Dugas, a Canadian flight attendant {{who died in}} 1984. Dugas was labeled Patient Zero of AIDS, because he was linked directly or indirectly with 40 of the first 248 reported cases of AIDS in the U.S., and after he was told {{of his ability to}} infect others, defiantly continued to have unprotected sex. Many book reviews concentrated their material on Dugas, or led their assessment of the book with discussion of his behavior. Some reviewers interpreted Shilts' naming Dugas [...] "Patient Zero" [...] to mean that Dugas brought AIDS to North America; the National Review called Dugas the [...] "Columbus of AIDS" [...] and in their review of And the Band Played On states, [...] " [...] picked up the disease in Europe through sexual contact with Africans. Traveling on his airline-employee privileges, he spread it here from coast to coast." [...] Shilts never stated this in the book, instead writing, [...] "Whether Gaëtan Dugas actually was the person who brought AIDS to North America remains a question of debate and is ultimately unanswerable... there's no doubt that Gaëtan {{played a key role in}} spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other." [...] Time titled its review of And the Band Played On [...] "The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero", erroneously restating the claim that Dugas had brought AIDS to the continent.
