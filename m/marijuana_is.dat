A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for <b>marijuana</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E

Coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms. His paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash. Coats failed a random drug test. Coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee. Coats suit relied under a Colorado law called the Lawful Off-Duty Activities Statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time. The trial court and Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in Coats v.

25|$|Cannabis use is {{relatively}} popular, especially around Vancouver, B.C., Bellingham, Seattle, Olympia, Spokane, Portland and Eugene.

As of December6, 2012, possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for recreational use by persons over 21 years of age became legal in Washington state as a result of state ballot measure Initiative 502, which was approved by the state's voters on November6, 2012, by a ten-point margin.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine (1) whether family and peer <b>marijuana</b> use <b>are</b> {{independently}} related to adolescent marijuana use in Chile, (2) whether family and peer <b>marijuana</b> use <b>are</b> associated with adolescent marijuana dependence in adolescents using marijuana, and (3) whether the adolescent’s age moderates the association between family or peer use and adolescent marijuana use and/or dependence. Method This study used data from the National Survey on Drug Use in the General Population in Chile (a cross-sectional observational study), which was conducted in 2008 and 2010 in 4413 adolescents aged 12 – 19. Adolescents answered questions about their past-year marijuana use and dependence (ICD- 10 criteria) and the marijuana use of their family and peers. Logistic regressions were performed while controlling for confounders. Results Adolescents who had a family member who used <b>marijuana</b> <b>were</b> five times more likely to use the drug. Adolescents with a close friend who used <b>marijuana</b> <b>were</b> eight times more likely to use <b>marijuana.</b> When adolescents <b>were</b> using <b>marijuana,</b> they <b>were</b> {{three times more likely to}} be dependent if they had a family member who used the drug. However, no significant relationship was found between peer use and dependence. No statistically significant interactions were found between family or peer use and age. Conclusion Family and peer <b>marijuana</b> use <b>was</b> independently associated with adolescent’s past-year marijuana use; however, only family <b>marijuana</b> use <b>was</b> statistically associated with adolescent’s marijuana dependence...|$|R

500|$|The city of Portland, Maine legalized the {{possession}} of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana on November 5, 2013, making it the first city {{on the east coast}} to do so.

The law does not allow the sale of marijuana; and city police still intend to enforce state law, under which possession is a civil offense, and only medical <b>marijuana</b> <b>is</b> legal. Supporters of marijuana legalization believe, [...] "this is just the next domino," [...] said Marijuana Policy Project Maine Political Director, David Boyer, [...] "I think there's national implications, keeping the momentum that Washington and Colorado started last November in ending marijuana prohibition."

[...] "One thing I learned {{a long time ago}} is, you gotta be careful how you change [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.

[...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana.

500|$|Internationally, {{the sale}} of gravity bongs is often {{prohibited}} in countries where <b>marijuana</b> <b>is</b> illegal due to its association with the herb. In the United States, under the Federal Drug Paraphernalia Statute, {{which is part of}} the Controlled Substances Act, it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia, meaning that the bong is illegal. Since Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have legalized recreational use of the herb, gravity bongs (along with other related paraphernalia) can be legally sold to anyone over the age of 21. In countries and states where use of cannabis is illegal, some retailers insist that bongs are intended for use with tobacco in an attempt to circumvent laws against selling drug paraphernalia. While technically the term [...] "bong" [...] does not mean a device used for smoking mainly marijuana, drug-related connotations have been formed with the word itself (partly due to punning with Sanskrit bhangah, meaning [...] "hemp"). Thus for fear of the law some head shops will not serve customers who use the word [...] "bong" [...] or [...] "bongs", typically insisting instead on the term [...] "water pipe".|$|E
500|$|Because {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} <b>marijuana</b> <b>is</b> prominently {{featured in}} the episode, Fox had [...] "incredible fears" [...] about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast.

The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a [...] "pretty good amount" [...] of creative freedom with the episode. [...] " [...] obviously, the network didn't want us glorifying casual marijuana use", he said in an interview with the music magazine Relix. [...] " [...] like we usually do, we look at everything from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received. [...] "Weeks before it aired, we were going 'This is really going to kill everything...'", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|Possession of <b>marijuana</b> <b>is</b> still {{punishable}} {{by the law}} because of its schedule 1 drug standing.

[...] According to California health and safety codes (section 11357- 11362.9), punishment for possession of marijuana differs by amount unless the person is allowed to have cannabis with them. For amounts exceeding 28.5g, a person can be fined less or equal to an amount of five hundred dollars or be imprisoned in a country jail for {{less than or equal}} to six months or in some cases both. For amounts less than 28.5g, a person can be fined {{less than or equal to}} an amount of one hundred dollars.
