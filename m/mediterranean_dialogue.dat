25|$|NATO {{has added}} new members seven times since its {{founding}} in 1949, and since 2017 NATO has had 29 members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1952, Greece and Turkey became members of the Alliance, joined later by West Germany (in 1955) and Spain (in 1982). In 1990, with the reunification of Germany, NATO grew to include the former country of East Germany. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Dialogue</b> initiative and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1997, three former Warsaw Pact countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO. After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the Vilnius group of The Baltics and seven East European countries formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth enlargement in 2004. The Adriatic States Albania and Croatia joined in the sixth enlargement in 2009, Montenegro in 2017.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of the EU external migration policy by applying the external governance theory on the Global approach to migration (GAM) while exploring the nature of migration relations between the Union and the third countries. The Global approach to migration is based on the integration of migration issues (based on four thematic dimensions) in the EU external relations and on strengthening cooperation and dialogue with partner countries. The aim of the thesis is to clarify by the theory of external governance the relations between the EU and partner countries with which the EU cooperates in the management of migration flows. More specifically, the thesis focuses on mutual relations, which are reflected in cooperation on migration issues and answers the question whether GAM raised a qualitative change in relations between the EU and partner countries. Further, the text aspires on the reflection of the international role of the EU in its external relations of migration. The thesis identifies 10 major platforms of cooperation between the EU and third countries: (1) The European Neighbourhood Policy, (2) The Euro-African Process on Migration and Development, (3) The EU-Africa Partnership on Migration, Mobility and Employment, (4) The Union for <b>Mediterranean,</b> (5) <b>Dialogue</b> on [...] ...|$|R

500|$|NATO {{launched}} a Training Cooperation Initiative offering to share NATO training expertise with its <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Dialogue</b> (MD) countries (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel and Jordan) and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) countries. The initial phase included expanding those countries' participation in relevant existing NATO {{training and education}} programmes, {{and the establishment of}} a Middle East faculty at the NATO Defense College in Rome. As a second phase, NATO would consider supporting the establishment of a Security Cooperation Centre in the region, to be owned by the MD and ICI countries, with regional funding and NATO assistance.

In 1998, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was established. On 8July 1997, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999. Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. At that time, the decision was criticised in the US by many military, political and academic leaders as a [...] "a policy error of historic proportions." [...] According to George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and an advocate of the containment policy, this decision [...] "may {{be expected to have}} an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, [...] to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking." ...|$|E
