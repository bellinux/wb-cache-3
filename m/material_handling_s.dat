40|$|A key {{task in the}} <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> {{system design}} process is the {{selection}} and configuration of equipment for material transport and storage in a facility. <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment selection is a complex, tedious task, and there are few tools other than checklists to assist engineers {{in the selection of}} appropriate, cost-effective <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment. This paper describes the development of an intelligent <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment selection system called <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment selection advisor (MHESA). The MHESA is composed of three modules: (1) a database to store equipment types with their specifications; (2) a knowledge-based expert system for assisting <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> equipment selection; and (3) an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to choose the most favorable equipment type.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. These sub-optimal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} reduce <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes, and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises. The resulting methodology is expected to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing in-house <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes using visual management systems...|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{production}} logistics, <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> {{is concerned with the}} internal material flow, which consist of inventory management and transportation. The overall goal with <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is to ensure the production system access to <b>material,</b> where the <b>handling</b> is to be performed without any damage to neither material nor personnel. In a manufacturing company, a sufficient part of the total production cost can be directly derived from internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> According to Lean Production both transportation and inventory should be considered as waste. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of the internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, though it must not be on the expense of the delivery precision or compromising the safety. The study assumes that the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system is supposed to provide the productions system with the right materials, in the right quantity, at the right time, and doing so in cost effective manner. The purpose with this study is to identify and analyze <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> in order to develop and present recommendations for a safer and more cost efficient <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> with preserved delivery precision. The study is a case study, which has been conducted on site at Sandvik Mining in Sandviken. Sandvik Mining produces drill bits, drill rods and adapters, which are used for rock drilling. The data collection has been done through interviews and observations, where the authors have been interviewing employees from Sandvik Mining as well as conducting direct observations of the processes within the field of study. The study was complemented by a literature review, where the most influential fields of study where <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and Lean Production. The report presents a map of current material transportation flows within Sandvik Mining as well as how the management of these flows is conducted. From the map, problem areas have been identified and the underlying cause of these can be derived from the variations within the working methods. The variations occur due to the fact the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system does not meet the six aspects of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equation, namely: why, what, where, when and how materials should be transported as well as by who the transportation should performed. In order to create an effective <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> the study presents recommendations that aims to define and standardize <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities, which could be done by material-dedicated buffer zones. The study claims that these material-dedicated buffer zones would serve as reference points for the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, and based on which, it is possible to define the different <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities. The buffer zones can also provide necessary control to the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system {{as well as to the}} production system. Standardization of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities can, according to the study, reduce the variations in the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system as well as create opportunities for future improvements.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the verification of controls in <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems. While currently these controls are mostly validated using simulation, in the proposed approach, the correctness of the involved controls is automatically proven by means of model checking. Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis. The methodology is based on the definition of <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system elements, which are models of technical components such as conveyors or pushers. By interconnecting these elements, a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is built, which thereafter can be fed into a model checker to prove certain properties on the model. In order to also verify large and complex <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems, a compositional approach is proposed. There, the overall <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is partitioned into subsystems, which are subsequently verified separately. From the proofs of the subsystems, a proof of a property of the whole <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is derived. Practical experiments show how the proposed approach handles the verification of real-world <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems...|$|R

This measured force is then transmitted as radio frequency (RF) signals to the controller of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> robot, which in turn maneuvers the load so that the human operator only needs to exert {{a small portion of the}} force, leaving the actuator of the system to provide the remaining force required. Therefore, the actuators of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system add exertion only in response to the operator's hand force on the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, or on the object maneuvered by the robot.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine those {{occupational}} accidents at construction sites that are related to <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> as compared with all reportable occupational accidents at construction sites. The main concern is to define the kinds of accidents that occur in <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> The data were gathered from two sources: a large Finnish construction company and the database of reports of serious occupational accidents (Sammio). One third of all the reported accidents in the studied construction company occurred during materials transfer and 36 % of the absenteeism days resulted from these accidents. <b>Materials</b> <b>handling</b> thus caused more serious accidents than other work activities (t = - 2. 44, df = 351, p < 0. 005). Minor accidents were mostly due to over-exertion whereas serious accidents were mostly falling from a height and injuries caused by falling and collapsing objects. The manual transfer of materials caused most of the materials transfer accidents in the company and mechanical transfer most of the serious <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> accidents. Over-exertion can, therefore, be decreased by reducing manual <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> On the other hand, replacing manual transfers with mechanical transfers means that there arises a risk of serious accidents.
