The Sami in the interior managed to preserve more of their culture. In the 1970s, instruction of the Sami language started in schools, and a new sense of consciousness started to grow among the Sami; today <b>most</b> are <b>proud</b> of their background and culture.|$|R

40|$|The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Djenné, {{in modern}} day Mali, is exalted as an {{enduring}} {{wonder of the}} ancient African world by archaeologists, anthropologists, state officials, architects and travel writers.

Despite its great renown, the majority of local residents remain desperately poor. And while <b>most</b> are <b>proud</b> of their cultural heritage, they are often troubled by the limitations it places on their day to day living conditions. Joy argues for a more critical understanding of this paradox and urges us all to reconsider the moral and philosophical questions surrounding the ways in which we use the past in the present...|$|R

The book had been a dream of his since childhood, and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when he was an adolescent. This was another piece that he was convinced would save his publishing company. His financial adviser Henry Huttleston Rogers quashed that idea and got Twain out of that business altogether, but the book was published nonetheless.|$|E

Although the Court decided that the legislative act requiring Senatorial consent to such removal was unconstitutional, it thanked him for his service and he believed the decision vindicated President Andrew Johnson's position with respect to the Tenure of Office Act, and that the powerful dissent by Justices Holmes, McReynolds and Brandeis might eventually receive favorable future reconsideration. Pepper also took pride in his handling of the George Otis Smith case (concerning the Federal Power Commission), where Pepper vindicated Presidential rights against the Senate, having refused a senatorial delegation's offer to represent them but accepting that of Attorney General Mitchell.|$|E

5000|$|Henry VIII, {{consumed}} by paranoia and increasing illness, {{became convinced that}} Surrey had planned to usurp the crown from his son the future King Edward VI. The matter {{came to a head}} when Surrey quartered the attributed arms of King Edward the Confessor. John Barlow had once called Surrey [...] "the <b>most</b> foolish <b>proud</b> boy that is in England" [...] and, although the arms of Surrey's 3x-great grandfather Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk show that he was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor's arms, doing so was a most foolish act of pride. In consequence, the King ordered Surrey's imprisonment and his father sentencing to death on 13 January 1547. Surrey was beheaded on 19 January 1547 on a charge of treasonably quartering the royal arms. His father survived execution as the king died the day before that appointed for the beheading, but he remained imprisoned. Surrey's son Thomas Howard became heir to the Dukedom of Norfolk in place of his father, which title he inherited on the 3rd Duke's death in 1554.|$|R
