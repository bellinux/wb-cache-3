25|$|To {{the jurors}} who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural daimonion did not {{interfere}} with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed {{as a sign that}} such a defence was the correct action. In that way, the daimonion communicated to Socrates that death <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly worry) and not to be feared, or death is migration (higher plane of existence) in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus. Socrates concludes his self-defence by saying to the court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — nor the jurors. He asks that they ensure the well-being of his three sons, so that they learn to live ethically.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{they both}} {{traveled}} (together with their Chinese teacher Mr. Wong whom Rev. Nelson had converted) toward Changshu (Dzang Zok), {{a city of}} about 100,000 people) about 70 miles northwest of Shanghai in February 1858. They preached, including on Chinese New Year's Day, and confirmed Rev. Nelson's suggestion that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> place to establish a mission, and accordingly wrote bishop Boone for permission in May. However, a week after they received accommodation at a temple in February, a police officer advised the priest who gave them shelter not to harbor foreign devils. Before they returned in June, Britain's gunboat diplomacy had led to the Treaty of Tientsin. While Changshu's mayor was interested in their preaching (and became their new landlord), and many others also wanted the missionaries to stay, other Mandarin officials opposed them.|$|E
25|$|A by-effect of Stanton's {{performance}} in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont {{was that he}} was sought after for other prominent cases, such as the case of inventor Cyrus McCormick. In 1831, a young McCormick created a machine to harvest crops. The device was particularly useful in the burgeoning wheat fields of the Western United States. Demand for McCormick's invention grew rapidly, attracting fierce competition, especially from fellow inventor and businessman John Henry Manny. In 1854 McCormick and his two prominent lawyers, Reverdy Johnson and Edward M. Dickinson, filed suit against Manny claiming he had infringed on McCormick's patents. McCormick demanded an injunction on Manny's reaper. Manny was also defended by two esteemed lawyers, George Harding and Peter H. Watson. McCormick v. Manny was initially to be tried in Chicago, and the two lawyers wanted another attorney local to the city to join their team; the recommended choice was Abraham Lincoln. When Watson met Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, he had a dim first impression of him, but after speaking with Lincoln, Watson saw that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> choice. However, when the venue of the proceedings was transferred to Cincinnati rather than Chicago, and the necessity for Lincoln was negated, Harding and Watson went for their first choice, Edwin Stanton. Lincoln was not made aware that he had been replaced, and still appeared at the proceedings in Cincinnati with his arguments prepared. Stanton's apprehension towards Lincoln was immediate and severe, and he did well to indicate to Lincoln that he wanted him to absent himself from the case. The case proceeded with Harding, Watson and Stanton and Manny's true defenders; Lincoln did not actively participate in the planning or arguing of the case, but kept in Cincinnati as a spectator.|$|E

500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman {{arranged}} a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked [...] "awful". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, [...] "The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television." ...|$|E
500|$|A link {{developed}} during the war with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began {{as the result of}} a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914. The 16th Marquess of Winchester, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain John Banks Brady, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the Winchester-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC. A designated Rhodesian platoon, widely referred to thereafter as [...] "the Rhodesian Platoon", was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.|$|E

500|$|To {{spread his}} costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] In November 1939 {{the first issue}} of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three of the magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig, who was a pacifist, received his military call-up. [...] He decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector; he continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards that he [...] "would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim, a member of a group of aspiring writers called the Futurians, heard about the offer. [...] Wollheim told Robert W. Lowndes, another member of the Futurians, about the opening, and urged him to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig.|$|E
500|$|The Litigators {{is said to}} be [...] "an amusing and appalling {{look into}} the machinations of a {{nationwide}} class-action suit," [...] according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. [...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> starting point for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E

[...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I knew what I was doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
