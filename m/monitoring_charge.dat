40|$|Charge {{trapping}} and detrapping are mechanisms which substantially modify dynamically {{the electric}} features of high-k dielectrics and cause instability of the MOS flat band voltage. The timescale on which such phenomena take place {{depends on the}} space and energy distribution of traps and in high-k dielectrics it may span on a very wide interval. On the other hand, conventional electrical measurements operating in stationary conditions take several seconds, thus affecting the measurement result and inhibiting from <b>monitoring</b> <b>charge</b> transients at shorter times. In this work, we present a detailed investigation of flat band transients due to charge detrapping in Cl 2 O 3 films designed for nonvolatile applications, on a timescale spanning from hundreds of microseconds to ten minutes. For this purpose, a technique based on the pulsed C-V measurement has been used.

In particular, structural properties of as-grown and annealed films in the 6 - 26 nm thickness range, as well as leakage and capacitive behavior of metal-oxide-semiconductor stacks are characterized. As-deposited Al-ZrO 2 films in the mentioned thickness range are amorphous and crystallize in the ZrO 2 cubic phase after thermal treatment at 900 °C. Correspondingly, the dielectric constant (k) value increases from 20 ± 1 to 27 ± 2. The Al-ZrO 2 layers exhibit uniform composition through the film thickness and are thermally stable on Si, whereas chemical reactions {{take place at the}} TaN/Al-ZrO 2 interface. A transient capacitance technique is adopted for <b>monitoring</b> <b>charge</b> trapping and flat band instability at short and long time scales. The role of traps nearby the TaN/Al-ZrO 2 interface is discussed and compared with other metal/high-k oxide films.

The emergence of the superconducting state is correlated with {{the suppression of the}} orthorhombic distortion around T_C, exhibiting competition between orthorhombicity and superconductivity. Above T_S, the in-plane charge correlation length increases with the decrease of temperature, possibly induced by nematic fluctuations in the paramagnetic tetragonal phase. Upon cooling, anomalies in the in-plane charge correlation lengths along a (ξ_a) and b axes (ξ_b) are observed at T_S and also at T_N indicative of strong magnetoelastic coupling. The in-plane charge correlation lengths are found to exhibit anisotropic behavior along and perpendicular to the in-plane component of stripe-type AFM wave vector (101) _ O below around T_N. The temperature dependence of the out-of-plane charge correlation length shows a single anomaly at T_N, reflecting the connection between Fe-As distance and Fe local moment. The origin of the anisotropic in-plane charge correlation lengths ξ_a and ξ_b is discussed {{on the basis of the}} antiphase magnetic domains and their dynamic fluctuations.

40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{is known}} to age when under electrical stress. One cause of this is thought {{to relate to the}} movement and build up of charge within the insulation. The emission of a low level of light from polymeric materials when under electrical stressing is shown to occur before the onset of currently detectable material degradation. This light is termed electroluminescence (EL) and under an ac electric field is thought to relate to the interaction of charge in close proximity to the electrode-polymer interface. Understanding the cause of this light emission gives a very high resolution way of <b>monitoring</b> <b>charge</b> interaction and its influence on material ageing. This report presents the improvement to a system to measure changes in EL emission during the cycle of the applied field (point on wave measurements) under various electric fields. To investigate the relationship between EL and ageing, 100 ?m, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films were ultraviolet (UV) aged in 3 and 7 day intervals up to 17 days. The samples were aged in both air and nitrogen environments to separate the affect of photo-oxidation from photo irradiation reactions on charge movement. Changes as a result of ageing were characterised in terms of optical, chemical and electrical properties. These were investigated using ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ac ramp breakdown measurements and dielectric spectroscopy. The accumulation of space charge (SC) was then investigated using the pulsed electro acoustic (PEA) technique. This collection of results were used to explain changes in EL in terms of intensity and phase difference. A model using the bipolar charge recombination theory was then developed using trends shown in the characterising measurements to explain changes in EL. Results support the use of EL as a tool to investigate changes in charge movement very near the electrode-polymer interface...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{requirement}} of reliability for an insulation system gives researchers greater responsibility to investigate new techniques for monitoring and diagnosing dielectrics subjected to an electric field. It {{is well known}} that the presence of space charge is one of the important factors causing premature failure of polymeric high voltage cables. Space charge surveillance is becoming the most general applied skill to evaluate polymeric materials, particularly high voltage cables. The well-known pulsed electroacoustic method (PEA), a reliable non-destructive method, gives a reasonable resolution to the concentration of the space charge in the insulation material. My work contributes to the measuring of space charge in low density polyethylene using PEA. From the experiments to study space charge formation and distribution at the interface on multi-layer sample under DC and AC applied voltage, electrode materials and frequency are determined as two important factors in measuring the charge injection and distribution; the interface between films acts as a trap for charge carriers, especially for electrons; and positive charge has a high mobility compared to negative charge. Surface potential decay was studied to explain the crossover phenomenon and to find physical mechanism on charge decay of the corona charged film sample. Charge mapping technique (PEA) was successfully introduced to the potential study and it provides an alternative way to investigate charge decay process and allows <b>monitoring</b> <b>charge</b> migration through the bulk of corona charged film. One essential phenomenon, bipolar charge injection, has been first derived from the results of space charge distribution. The advanced PEA measurement system with high rate test and excellent phase resolving capability was designed in {{the last part of the}} study. Compared with the old system the new system can provide the enhanced experiment result for fast change situation, which can achieve high-quality diagnosis for the virtual industry situation such as polarity reversal and transient voltage failure...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{ages and}} degrades until its eventual failure under electrical stress. One {{cause of this}} relates to the movement and accumulation of charge within the insulation. The emission of {{a low level of}} light from polymeric materials while under electrical stressing occurs before the onset of currently detectable material degradation. This light is known as electroluminescence (EL) and under an ac electric field is thought to relate to the interaction of charge in close proximity to the electrode-polymer interface. Understanding the cause of this light emission gives a very high-resolution method of <b>monitoring</b> <b>charge</b> interaction and its influence on material ageing. A possible cause of this light emission is the bipolar charge recombination theory. This theory involves the injection, trapping and recombination of charge carriers during each half cycle of the applied field [1]. This work compares two models that to simulate the EL emission according to this bipolar charge recombination theory. Model 1 assumes a fixed space charge region and all injected charge is uniformly distributed in this region with charges able to either become trapped or to recombine with opposite polarity charge carriers [2]. This recombination relates directly the excitation needed for the emission of a photon of light as measured in experiments. Model 2 develops on this by accounting for the transport and extraction of charge with an exponential distribution of trap levels rather than a uniform distribution [3]. Figure 1 shows a good correlation between the two models and experimental data. The full paper will describe the models in more detail and present results comparing the simulated and experimental results under various applied waveforms. Model 1 and model 2 both provide a good correlation with experimental data but model 2 allows a greater understanding of the space charge profile in the region close to the electrodes as well as the shape of the conduction current. Further work involves developing these models to support changes in the charge trapping profiles due to material ageing and supporting simulated results with measured conduction current...|$|E

40|$|Iron (oxyhydr) oxide (FeOOH) {{minerals}} play {{important roles}} in various natural, technological and societal settings. The widespread abundance of these minerals has prompted numerous studies on their surface reactivity in aqueous media. Surface charge development, one that namely takes place through the adsorption of potential determining ions (p. d. i.; H+, OH-) and coadsorption of counterions (e. g. Cl-, ClO 4 -, Na+), is particularly interesting in this regard. Mineral surface charge development is determined by numerous factors related to the interplay of mineral surface structure, particle morphology and counterion identity. In this thesis the interplay between these factors is resolved by <b>monitoring</b> <b>charge</b> development on submicron-sized synthetic iron oxyhydroxide particles of different structures and sizes in aqueous media with counteranions of contrasting charge-to-size ratio (i. e. NaCl, NaClO 4). This work, which is summarized in an introductory chapter and detailed in five appendices, is focused on three types of synthetic lepidocrocite (ã- FeOOH) of different shapes and surface roughness, three types of goethite (á-FeOOH) of different levels of surface roughness, and finally akaganéite (â-FeOOH), a mineral representing unique ion exchange properties due to its hollandite-type structure. While charge development was chiefly monitored by high precisition potentiometric titrations, these efforts were supported by a range of techniques including electrolyte ion uptake by cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, particle imaging by (high resolution) transmission electron microscopy, porosity analysis by N 2 adsorption/desorption, surface potential development by electrokinetics, as well as thermodynamic adsorption modeling. These efforts showed that lepidocrocite particles of contrasting morphology and surface roughness acquired highly comparable pH and ionic strength p. d. i. loadings. Equilibriation times required to develop these loadings were however altered when particles became aggregated by aging. Goethite particles of contrasting surface roughness also acquired incongruent p. d. i. loadings, which were predominantly explained by the different charge-neutralizing capabilities of these surfaces, {{some of which were}} related to pore size distributions controlling the entrance of ions of contrasting sizes. Such size exclusion effects were also noted for the case of akaganéite where its bulk 0. 4 × 0. 4 nm wide channels permitted chloride diffusion but blocked perchlorate. Charge development at goethite surfaces in binary mixtures of NaCl and NaClO 4 solutions also showed that the larger size-to-charge ratio chloride ion exerted a strong effect on these results even when present as a minor species. Many of these aforementioned effects were also modeled using variable, counterion- and loading-specific, Stern layer capacitance values. The findings summarized in this thesis are providing a better understanding of surface processes occurring at iron oxyhydroxide surfaces. They should impact our ability in designing uses of such particles, for example, effective sorption in aquatic media, as well as to understand how they behave in natural systems...|$|E
