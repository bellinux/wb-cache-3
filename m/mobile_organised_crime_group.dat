40|$|Overview The illicit movement, {{trafficking}} {{and use of}} firearms is a serious national threat and a significant safety concern for the Australian community. The demand for and supply of illicit firearms in Australia is driven by a range of entities, from <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> to low-level individual criminals, who continue to seek, procure and use firearms to protect their interests and commit violent acts. Since 2010, intelligence has indicated that not only are serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> seeking access to firearms for criminal purposes, but {{an increasing number of}} groups are trafficking firearms. The illicit firearms market is driven in part by outlaw motorcycle gangs, Middle Eastern <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups,</b> and other groups engaged in trafficking illicit commodities such as drugs. These groups are known to have direct links to the use of illicit firearms but criminal involvement in the illicit firearm market is not limited to serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups,</b> gangs or particular criminal acts. A wide range of criminals acquire and use firearms to conduct their criminal business, protect their interests, intimidate others and commit acts of violence. No single <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>group</b> dominates the sale and supply of firearms in the Australian illicit market. Firearms enter the illicit market in Australia through a number of historical and contemporary diversion methods, depending on the firearm type. <b>Organised</b> <b>crime</b> is exploiting the rapid development of technology and its increasing availability to users worldwide. Criminals are likely to exploit new and emerging trends to acquire and traffic illicit firearms. <b>Organised</b> <b>crime</b> and firearms are inextricably linked, and law enforcement response strategies must address both illicit firearms supply routes and the criminal activities that drive firearms use...|$|R

40|$|Key points o Between 2000 and 2012 over 1, 000 police {{stations}} {{have been closed}} in the UK and many more have been placed on reduced opening hours. A similar situation is unfolding in Northern Ireland and Eire. This {{may be viewed as}} a strategic and operational withdrawal from the current concept of rural policing. This closure trend has significantly altered the landscape of rural policing in the UK. o In the same period, the landscapes of rural crime and criminality have also changed in {{that there has been a}} noticeable increase in the levels of the organisation of indigenous and international serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> involved in committing rural crimes. In short crime is becoming more entrepreneurial. The increase of rural crimes such as the theft of farm machinery and tools; livestock; and unregulated butchery practices, evidences the danger that serious and <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> pose to rural areas as they expand their criminal activities in the current economic recession. It does appear that Eastern European <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> are targeting the UK by stealing tractors and other items of heavy plant for resale in Europe and on the African subcontinent. There is evidence that British based <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> are also becoming more organised at exploiting criminal opportunities in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Foreword: In 2006, the Australian Government {{introduced}} the Anti-money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) which increased regulatory controls over businesses potentially able to facilitate organised criminal {{activities such as}} money laundering. The implementation of tougher legislation and associated law enforcement interventions may result in criminal organisations adjusting their tactics {{in order to continue}} their activities without detection. In this paper, the risk and potential impact of tactical displacement by organised criminals is discussed with regard to the potential for increased attempts by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> to corrupt public servants. There is a paucity of research exploring {{the nature and extent of}} public sector corruption committed by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups.</b> This discussion is informed by literature on ‘crime scripts’ originally developed by Cornish (1994) and the 5 I’s crime prevention framework developed by Ekblom (2011). Making use of public-source information about the commission of such crimes, as exemplified in two recent corruption cases, some intervention strategies are proposed that may be effective in reducing the risks of corruption of public sector officials by <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> in Australia...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between some features of the American criminal justice system and the infiltration of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> into New York's financial district to commit securities fraud. The primary focus {{of the study is}} to determine if and to what extent the present criminal justice strategies designed to counter <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> activities have {{had an impact on the}} entry of New York's five Italian-American crime families and Russian-origin criminals into the securities market. There are scattered works and articles on <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> related frauds in the stock market, but there is no thorough empirical study on the movement of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> from traditional rackets into the securities market in New York. This research was undertaken to remedy the paucity of criminological knowledge on the activities of <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> in the U.

The study utilised a combination of interviews, existing source documents and written materials.

40|$|Identity crime {{provides}} {{a foundation for}} many other forms of serious crime.

40|$|Through {{analysis}} of National Crime Agency held data on <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups,</b> and in-depth {{analysis of}} qualitative interviews with convicted fraudsters and enforcement professionals, this detailed study fills a significant {{gap in the}} contemporary literature.

Alongside the offender perspective is that of law enforcement interviewees, who provide a unique interpretation of the procedural and legislative weaknesses that appear to allow this type of offender to make considerable financial gain.

The paper uses social network analysis tools to determine the resilient characteristics of the network. This paper also assumes that these characteristics will be different to those of mainstream <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> because the police network operates within an established policing agency rather than as an independent entity hiding within the broader community.

40|$|Red Mafia' is the {{collective}} term for corrupt public officials in mainland China, {{mainly from the}} criminal justice system, who attempt to monopolise the protection business in the criminal underworld by abusing power. In contemporary mainland China, the Red Mafia has developed into an alternative system of governance that can control <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups,</b> enable them to flourish, and protect them where strong government and effective self-protection associations are absent. The author examines <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and corruption by analysing the Wen Qiang case, {{one of the most}} famous and widely publicised cases in Chongqing's latest crime crackdown campaign. Drawing on interview data and extensive published materials, this paper offers a tentative definition of 'Red Mafia', develops a typology of <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> describes the emergence of the Red Mafia in China, explores how gangsters developed relationships with public officials, suggests why <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> <b>groups</b> chose the Red Mafia as their preferred protection and enforcement mechanism, examines patterns of services provided, and explores the differences between the Red Mafia and other Mafia groups. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
