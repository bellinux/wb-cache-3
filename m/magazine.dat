5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round <b>magazine.</b> Unlike the double-column, dual-feed <b>magazine</b> insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the <b>magazine</b> was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the <b>magazine</b> body caused the <b>magazine</b> lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the <b>magazine</b> well did not keep the <b>magazine</b> firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the <b>magazine</b> housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
