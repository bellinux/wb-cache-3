Originally produced in the Czech language, the meticulously crafted animated feature is set in a magical world of toys and knick-knacks stored in the attic of a home in Prague. Following the symbolism of the Cold War era that impacted director Barta and the Czech Republic, the world of the attic is divided into the land of happy toys in the west and the land of evil in the east. The despotic Head of State rules over the evil empire of the east with a band of sinister minions, insects and rotted vegetables.

50|$|Optical models {{outperform}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>mice</b> on uneven, slick, soft, sticky, or loose surfaces, {{and generally}} in mobile situations lacking mouse pads.

50|$|Though not {{commonly}} referred to as optical <b>mice,</b> nearly all <b>mechanical</b> <b>mice</b> tracked movement using LEDs and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and didn't pass through holes in an incremental rotary encoder wheel.

5000|$|The {{first modern}} optical {{computer}} mice were the Microsoft IntelliMouse with IntelliEye and IntelliMouse Explorer, introduced in 1999 using technology developed by Hewlett-Packard. [...] It worked on almost any surface, and represented a welcome improvement over <b>mechanical</b> <b>mice,</b> which {{would pick up}} dirt, track capriciously, invite rough handling, {{and need to be}} taken apart and cleaned frequently. Other manufacturers soon followed Microsoft’s lead using components manufactured by the HP spin-off Agilent Technologies, and {{over the next several years}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>mice</b> became obsolete.The technology underlying the modern optical computer mouse is known as digital image correlation, a technology pioneered by the defense industry for tracking military targets. A simple binary-image version of digital image correlation was used in the 1980 Lyon optical mouse. Optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture in materials such as wood, cloth, mouse pads and Formica. These surfaces, when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode, cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset. Images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved.|$|R
50|$|The {{top surface}} of the mouse is wiped with a plastic {{cleanser}} to remove the dirt that accumulates from contact with the hand, as on the keyboard. The bottom surface is also cleaned {{to ensure that it}} can slide freely. If it is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>mouse,</b> the trackball is taken out, not only to clean the ball itself, but to scrape dirt from the runners that sense the ball's movement and can become jittery or stuck if impeded by grime.|$|E

Mice with less image-processing power also have problems tracking fast movement, whereas some high-quality mice can track faster than 2 m/s.|$|R

5000|$|Bush also relates that, unlike digital technology, Memex {{would be}} of no {{significant}} aid to business or profitable ventures, {{and as a consequence}} its development would occur only long after the mechanization of libraries and the introduction of what he describes as the specialized [...] "group machine", which would be useful for the sharing of ideas in fields such as medicine. Furthermore, although Bush discusses the compressional ability and rapidity so key to modern machines, he relates that speed will not {{be an integral part of}} Memex, stating that a tenth of a second would be an acceptable interval for its data retrieval, rather than the billionths of a second that modern computers are capable of. [...] "For Memex," [...] he writes, [...] "the problem is not swift access, but selective access". Bush states that although the code-reading and potential linking capabilities of the rapid selector would be key to the creation of Memex, there is still an issue of enabling [...] "moderately rapid access to really large memory storage". There is an issue concerning selection, Bush conveys, and despite the fact that improvements have been made in the speed of digital selection, according to Bush, [...] "selection, in the broad sense, is still a stone adze in the hands of the cabinetmaker". Bush goes on to discuss the record-making process and how Memex could incorporate systems of voice-control and user-propagated learning. He proposes a machine that could respond to [...] "simple remarks" [...] as well as build trails based on its user's [...] "habits of association," [...] as Belinda Barnet described them in [...] "The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush's Memex." [...] Barnet also makes the distinction between the idea of a constructive Memex and the [...] "permanent trails" [...] described in As We May Think, and attributes Bush's machine learning concepts to Claude Shannon's <b>mechanical</b> <b>mouse</b> and work with [...] "feedback and machine learning".|$|E

40|$|Abstract The 1980 Xerox {{optical mouse}} invention, and {{subsequent}} product, {{was a successful}} deployment of embedded vision, {{as well as of}} the Mead–Conway VLSI design methodology that we developed at Xerox PARC in the late 1970 s. The de-sign incorporated an interpretation of visual lateral inhibition, essentially mimicking biology to achieve a wide dynamic range, or light-level-independent operation. Con-ceived in the context of a research group developing VLSI design methodologies, the optical mouse chip represented an approach to self-timed semi-digital design, with the analog image-sensing nodes connecting directly to otherwise digital logic using a switch-network methodology. Using only a few hundred gates and pass tran-sistors in 5 -micron nMOS technology, the optical mouse chip tracked the motion of light dots in its field of view, and reported motion with a pair of 2 -bit Gray codes for x and y relative position—just like the <b>mechanical</b> <b>mice</b> of the time. Besides the chip, the only other electronic components in the mouse were the LED illuminators.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the user and a graphical interface relies on a protocol that defines the semantics of the actions performed by the user an the input devices. This protocol binds each action to {{an effect on the}} graphical interface. We propose a system that adapts this protocol to the particular context on the graphical interface in order to speed-up many operations. This approach is particularly useful for helping people having physical handicaps to have a comfortable interaction with the most common software tools, like web browsers.

40|$|Positioning {{tracking}} {{is not a}} {{new idea}} as we have been seen from the ability of the GPS (Global Positioning System) to track the position of the object, in general with acceptable accuracy but the cost of GPS installation is expensive. However, in the case of detecting the exact position in signal-blocked closed environment (e. g. inside building, forest, mines and others); the accuracy factor provide by GPS is low. Thus, this project presents a positioning tracking system that is able to track the movement of an object within a small area or inside buildings. A complete set of the positioning tracking system consists of a pair of computer <b>mechanical</b> <b>mouse</b> and a microcontroller. From the position displayed on the computer screen, the position of the object can be located. The pair of mouse detects each movement of the object and sends the movement data to microcontroller. Linear, angular displacement and positioning calculation are also being discussed. From the results, it's shown that the positioning system is applicable. However, some small errors are also occurred but in acceptable range...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} create an algorithm, which predicts the {{endpoint}} of a cursor movement, an experiment was performed to reveal characteristics of cursor movements. In the experiment subjects had to click on a button {{in the center of}} the screen after which they moved the cursor onto a target which subsequently appeared. After the target was reached it disappeared. Targets were radially located at angles of n * 45 degrees (0 ≤ n ≤ 7), and at distances of 150, 250 or 350 pixels (34 pixels/cm). Each of nine subjects executed this experiment three times, using either a <b>mechanical</b> <b>mouse,</b> an optical trackball or a mechanical force feedback trackball. The variables included in the analyses were curvature, variability around the mean path and the distance whereon peak velocity occurred. The results show that there is no need to compensate for a curvature other than zero in the algorithm. As the devices differ in their amount of variability and the location of the peak velocity one algorithm for each device is preferable. Within one device it could be considered to have a less accurate prediction or to make a special-case algorithm for direction and distance. To increase the accuracy even more one could choose to make an algorithm for each person separately. 1...|$|E
