40|$|We {{consider}} the smoothing problem for multiscale stochastic models {{based on the}} wavelet transform. These models involve processes indexed by the nodes of a dyadic tree. Each level of the dyadic tree represents one scale or resolution of the process, thus moving upward on the tree divides the resolution by 2 while moving downward multiplies it by 2. The processes are built according to a recursion in scale from coarse to fine to which random details are added. To operate the change in scale, one must perform an interpolation. This is achieved using the QMF pair of operators attached to a wavelet transform. These models {{have proved to be}} of great value to capture textures or fractal-like processes, and also to perform <b>multiresolution</b> <b>sensor</b> fusion. Up to now however, fast smoothing algorithms were available only {{in the case of the}} Haar transform. We now provide algorithms that handle any orthogonal or biorthogonal wavelets. A smoothing theory is developped to define the field of fast a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{selective}} {{vision system}} sequentially collects {{evidence to support}} a specied hy-pothesis about a scene, {{as long as the}} additional evidence is worth the eort of obtaining it. EÆciency comes from processing the scene only where necessary, to the level of detail necessary, and with only the necessary operators. Knowledge repre-sentation and sequential decision-making are central issues for selective vision, which takes advantage of prior knowledge of a domain's abstract and geometrical structure and models for the expected performance and cost of visual operators. The TEA- 1 selective vision system uses Bayes nets for representation and benet-cost analysis for control of visual and non-visual actions. It is the high-level control for an active vision system, enabling purposive behavior, the use of qualitative vision modules and a pointable <b>multiresolution</b> <b>sensor.</b> TEA- 1 demonstrates that Bayes nets and decision theoretic techniques provide a general, re-usable framework for constructing computer vision systems that are selective perception systems, and that Bayes nets provide a general framework for representing visual tasks.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} for multiresolutional multisensor target {{identification is}} presented. It uses the computationally efficient scale sequential approach to hypothesis testing during identification and implements the inverse discrete wavelet transform to fuse data from different <b>multiresolution</b> <b>sensors.</b> We show that fusion {{leads to an}} increase in the probability of correct identification without {{a significant increase in the}} number of computations. 1 1 This research is partially sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Grant F 49620 - 93 - 1 - 0490. I. Introduction The goal of this paper is to investigate a multisensor multiresolutional approach to target identification. One sensor often does not provide enough information to build an ATR (Automatic Target Recognition) system that performs effectively against targets in natural and man-made clutter. There are strong indications [5] that the use of several sensors gives for target identification better results than the use of one [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic imaging {{technologies}} {{are faced with}} the challenge of power consumption when transmitting large amounts of image data from the acquisition imager to the display or processing devices. This is especially a concern for portable applications, and becomes more prominent in increasingly high-resolution, high-frame rate imagers. Therefore, new sampling techniques are needed to minimize transmitted data, while maximizing the conveyed image information. From this point of view, two approaches have been proposed and implemented in this thesis: A system-level approach, in which the classical 1 D row sampling CMOS imager is modified to a 2 D ring sampling pyramidal architecture, using the same standard three transistor (3 T) active pixel sensor (APS). A device-level approach, in which the classical orthogonal architecture has been preserved while altering the APS device structure, to design an expandable <b>multiresolution</b> image <b>sensor.</b> A new scanning scheme has been suggested for the pyramidal image sensor, resulting in an intrascene foveated dynamic range (FDR) similar in profile to that of the human eye. In this scheme, the inner rings of the imager have a higher dynamic range than the outer rings. The pyramidal imager transmits the sampled image through 8 parallel output channels, allowing higher frame rates. The human eye is known to have less sensitivity to oblique contrast. Using this fact on the typical oblique distribution of fixed pattern noise, we demonstrate lower perception of this noise than the orthogonal FPN distribution of classical CMOS imagers. The <b>multiresolution</b> image <b>sensor</b> principle is based on averaging regions of low interest from frame-sampled image kernels. One pixel is read from each kernel while keeping pixels in the region of interest at their high resolution. This significantly reduces the transferred data and increases the frame rate. Such architecture allows for programmability and expandability of multiresolution imaging applications...|$|R
40|$|We propose random {{distributed}} <b>multiresolution</b> {{representations of}} <b>sensor</b> network data, {{so that the}} most significant encoding coefficients are easily accessible by querying a few sensors, anywhere in the network. Less significant encoding coefficients are available by querying {{a larger number of}} sensors, local to the region of interest. Significance can be defined in a multiresolution way, without any prior knowledge of the source data, as global summaries versus local details. Alternatively, significance can be defined in a dataadaptive way, as large differences between neighboring data values. We propose a distributed encoding algorithm that is robust to arbitrary wireless communication connectivity graphs, where links can fail or change with time. This randomized algorithm allows distributed computation that does not require strict global coordination or awareness of network connectivity at individual sensors. Because computations involve sensors in local neighborhoods of the communication graph, they are communication-efficient. Our framework uses local interaction among sensors to enable flexible information retrieval at the global level...|$|R
40|$|Today {{there exist}} several {{applications}} where a real visible scene {{needs to be}} sampled to electrical signals, e. g., video cameras, digital still cameras, and machine vision systems. Since the 1970 ’s charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors have primarily been used for this task, but {{during the last decade}} CMOS image sensors have become more and more popular. The demand for image sensors has lately grown very rapidly due to the increased market for, e. g., digital still cameras and the integration of image sensors in mobile phones. The first out of three included papers presents a programmable <b>multiresolution</b> machine vision <b>sensor</b> with on-chip image processing capabilities. The sensor comprises an innovative multiresolution sensing area, 1536 A/D converters, and a SIMD array of 1536 bit-serial processors with corresponding memory. The SIMD processor array can deliver more than 100 GOPS sustained and the onchip pixel-analyzing rate can be as high as 4 Gpixels/s. The sensor is intended for high-speed multisense imaging where, e. g., color, greyscale, internal materia...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{distributed}} <b>multiresolution</b> representation of <b>sensor</b> network data so that large-scale summaries {{are readily available}} by querying {{a small fraction of}} sensor nodes, anywhere in the network, and small-scale details are available by querying a larger number of sensors, locally in the region of interest. A global querier (such as a mobile collector or unmanned aerial vehicle) can obtain a lossy to lossless representation of the network data, according to the desired resolution. A local querier (such as a sensor node) can also obtain either large-scale trends or local details, by querying its immediate neighborhood. We want the encoding to be robust to arbitrary, even time-varying, wireless communication connectivity graphs. Thus we want to avoid cluster heads or deterministic hierarchies that are not robust to single points of failure. We propose a randomized encoding which enables both robustness, and distributed computation that does not require long distance coordination or awareness of network connectivity at individual sensors. Our distributed encoding algorithm operates on local neighborhoods of the communication graph...|$|R
