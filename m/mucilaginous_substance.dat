40|$|The {{liberation of}} tetraspore in Gracilaria verrucosa was studied in detail with special {{reference}} to the structure and abnormal division in {{the contents of a}} packet of extruded tetraspores. 1) An extruded mass of tetraspores is surrounded by some <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substance</b> about three to several microns thick, and is joined to the plant surface. Accordingly, spores remain on the frond similarly to Sargassum eggs. Inside the <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substance</b> a thin vesicle envelops the four spores. When the vesicle became empty, methylene blue solution makes its presence and feature evident. Much the same structure of the extruded tetraspores as above may be expected for other red algal species not only G. verrucosa. 2) Around each spore, just after the release from a thin vesicle, a thin layer of mucilage is observed, by means of which spore will presumably attach to the substratum. Set freed spores sink together in a group scarcely changing any mutual position in still water, very likely they are embedded in some gelatinized substance. 3) In damp-dried materials packets of tetraspores are ready to extrude, but when kept in that condition too long the progress of liberation becomes slack and the spores seem less vital in appearance. After extrusion from the frond it takes twenty seconds to two and a half minutes before the spores are released from the thin vesicle, ellipsoid or comma shaping. 4) Sometimes there were observed abnormal divisions in the contents of a packet without producing four spores. When only three spores were produced, one of them was evidently large in size and had two nuclei, but other two spores has no significant feature in appearance. In tetrasporangium the arrangement of four spores is cruciate, but instance of tetrahedral has been observed as well. 津屋崎におけるオゴノリの繁殖時期に四分胞子の放出時の経過を観察し,放出四分胞子の構造,異常例のあることなどを明らかにした. 1. 体表に放出された四分胞子は薄い膜に包まれ,それはさらに粘質物に包まれて放出口につながつているため,放出後すぐには沈下しない. このことはホンダワラ類における放出卵の例と似ているが,オゴノリにかぎらず他の種類の放出四分胞子でも同様であることが推測される. 2. 四分胞子が薄い膜から出た直後には,薄層の粘質が胞子の周囲をとり巻いているように思われるが,これは胞子が基物に付着する際に役立つものと考えられる. また膜内の別の粘液により, 4 この胞子は距離を近く保つて沈下する. 3. 陰干し時間を長くすると胞子の放出はゆるい経過をとるようになり,胞子の活力も弱まるように思われる. すなわち体表に放出された後,薄い膜内にとどまる時間が長くなり,膜に生じた破れから 1 こずつ曲玉～だ円形になつて脱出する,しかし陰干しがそれ程強度でない場合は, 4 この胞子は同時に飛散するように膜から出る. 4. 四分胞子が分れる際の異常例として 3 こにしか分れない例をはじめ,核の数の異常なものを観察した. また四分胞子の分割法が従来いわれている十字型のみでなく,スギノリ目では珍らしい三角すい型の例も多くみられた...|$|E

In this paper, the author observed the attaching mechanism of conchospores and monospores using Porphyra yezoensis as material, and also studied experimentally the physical factors affecting the both spores, such as light intensity, temperature, chlorinity and water current. The results obtained are summarized as follows: The conchospores liberated from Conchocelis-thalli were accompanied by a great quantity of <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substance,</b> which helps the floating and adhesion of the spores. In experiments under various degrees of light intensity, the attachment of both conchospores and monospores was most abundant at 5, 000 ～ 10, 000 lux, and decreased under light intensity lower than 1, 000 lux. In darkness both spores did not adhere to the substratum. The suitable temperature for spore attachment was 20 ～ 25 ℃, and the attaching ratio showed a remarkable decrease at low temperature such as 5 ～ 10 ℃. The optimal range of sea water chlorinity for attachment was between 14. 5 and 18. 6 ‰. Within the range from 0 to 90 cm/sec of water current, the number of attached spores was abundant at the rapid current. ノリ殻胞子,単胞子の着生について,スサビノリを用いてそれらの着生機構を観察し,また着生と照度,温度、塩分および水流などとの関係をしらべた。 1. 殻胞子は放出にあたり多量の粘液を伴なっており,それは胞子の浮上,基物への接触を助長する。また,放出単胞子の粘液は少ない。 2. 着生に対する照度の影響では,殻胞子,単胞子ともに 5, 000 ～ 10, 000 luxで着生が多く, 3, 000 lux以下の低照度では徐々に少なくなり,暗黒下ではほとんど着生しない。 3. 温度の影響では,両胞子とも 20, 25 ℃ で着生が良く, 10 ℃ 以下では不良であった。 4. 塩分と着生の関係は,Cl 14. 5, 18. 6 ‰で着生数が多く, 11. 5 ‰以下では減少している。 5. 水流と着生の関係は, 90 cm/secまでの範囲で,水流の速いほど着生数は多くなっているが,その理由として高速では胞子の接触機会が多いためと思われる...|$|E

In order to understand the characteristics of historical Korean paper and the development of tools and materials used over time, surveys on Korean and Japanese collections at the British Library and a private Korean collection were carried out. Korean objects dated between the 12 th and the 18 th century were examined. The data collected from the surveys was compiled in a database and analysed. The data analysis revealed that the thickness of paper was closely related to the thickness of bamboo splints used in manufacture of papermaking screens. Research also included a summary of morphological characteristics and photomicrographs of fibres from nine indigenous plants which were used for traditional Korean papermaking. These standard fibre samples were used as reference to identify the fibres of unknown paper objects surveyed. This fibre identification confirmed the main material to be paper mulberry and, additionally, provided information on supplementary materials including rice straw, reed, hemp, and mechanical wood pulp of coniferous origin — a material that has not been recognised as one of the common supplementary materials in previous studies.

50|$|The {{attachment}} of a fungal spore on {{the surface}} of the host plant is the first critical step of infection. Once the spore is hydrated, an adhesive mucilage is released from its tip. During germination, <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances</b> continue to be extruded at the tips of the germ tube, which are essential for germ tube attachment and appressorium formation. Spore adhesion and appressorium formation is inhibited by hydrolytic enzymes such as α-mannosidase, α-glucosidase, and protease, suggesting that the adhesive materials are composed of glycoproteins. Germination is also inhibited at high spore concentrations, which might be due to a lipophilic self inhibitor. Self inhibition can be overcome by hydrophobic wax from rice leaf.In response to surface signals, the germ tube tip undergoes a cell differentiation process to form a specialized infection structure, the appressorium. Frank B.

Notwithstanding the strong resemblance between S. horneri and S. filicinum in the external shape excepting {{the difference in the}} vesicular shape remarked by W. H. Harvey, they are distinguishable in sexuality : the former is strictly dioecious while the latter monoecious and androgynous in the receptacle. In April 1955, he happened to obtain another alga with the ellipsoidal or somewhat ovato-fusiform vesicles. It may not be identified with a typical form of S. filicinum and also not undoubtedly with S. horneri. In this paper the author intends to report the results of observations on this alga especially on the sexual organs and the embryo-development, and also to try some comparison with those of S. horneri and S. filicinum. The material were collected with some bottom gill-nets, chiefly at Hutae, Amakusa Islands, Higo Province. The results are summarized as follows : 1) The alga in question bears strong resemblance to both S. horneri and S. filicinum in having the disco-fibrous root, the fine spinous processes on stem, the cylindrical receptacles, and the alternato-pinnatisected leaves, but is different by having the ellipsoidal vesicles (Fig. 1). 2) The alga seems to mature about in April to May in Amakusa Islands, so is it in S. horneri, but comparing with the latter the former may be later slightly. 3) The receptacles are androgynous; besides male and female conceptacles the same receptacle harbours hermaphrodite ones (Fig. 2), but the number of hermaphrodite conceptacles is indeed less than the others in each receptacle. The male conceptacles are not more than the female 2 ̆ 7 s, and they are found in any part of the receptacle, not being confined in the basal part as in S. filicinum; though they gather more in the basal part. In the hermaphrodite conceptacle the oogonia and the antheridial hairs are not intermingled, but occupy the side position to each other. 4) Discharge of oogonia takes place periodically, and the discharged portion advances acropetally in each receptacle, as is usual in many other members of the genus Sargassum. 5) Discharged oosphere is ellipsoidal measuring ca 265 x 205 p, which is surrounded by a thick layer of <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substance.</b> Around the outer wall of the thick layer there is observed a girdle-like dissolved portion as is reported on S. horneri (Kunieda & Suto 1940) and S. filicinum (Sawada 1955). 6) The embryo-development takes the same course with S. horneri. The rhizoid cell is segmented into 8 radially arranged cells (2 ̆ 2 radial 8 -cell type 2 ̆ 2 by Inoh 1930), and yet those 8 rhizoids developed from the rhizoid cell another group of about 7 to 15 rhizoids are observed to begin growth. 1. 筆者はシダモクによく似た植物を天草に於て入手し, 観察を行つた結果,生殖器官並びに胚発生に関して若干の知見を得ることが出来た. 2. 外形はアカモク, シダモクと非常によく似ているが, 気胞が大概楕円形である点, これらとは少し異なる. が, その他では仮盤状の根, 刺状突起のある単条の茎, 葉, 冠葉等, 外観は殆ど異なるところはない. 3. 成熟期は, アカモクと略々同時期か或いは多少遅れるのではないかと思われる. 4. 生殖器托の外形は, アカモクの雌またシダモクのものと殆ど同じであるが, 生殖案の性状に関しては大いに異なつた点がある. 即ち雌雄の両生殖案の他に, hermaphrodite の生殖案も存在することは興味深く思われるが, 尚これら 3 種の生殖案は, 1 生殖器托内に於てどの部分からも見出された. 又 hermaphrodite の生殖案にあつては, 雌雄はその案内に於て互に混生することなく, 案ロをはさんで両側に位置するものしか見られなかつた. 雄生殖案が生殖器托の基部の少部分に特に多く存在することは, シダモクに非常によく似た性質である. 5. 1 生殖器托に於て, 卵の放出は基部から上部に向つて 2 ～ 3 回位に分けて行うものと思われる. 6. 放出卵は, 大きさが略々 265 × 205 μ の楕円形で, アカモク, シダモクのものと大体一致し, 膠質状物質に包まれて暫く生殖器托表に附著している. 精子の侵入位置としてはアカモク, シダモクと同様に, 蔵卵器中膜に帯状の膨潤部が観察された. 7. 胚発生の経過は, アカモクと同様な型をとると考えられる. 即ち仮根細胞は放射状に 8 箇に分割され, その後, 仮根細胞に起因しない仮根群が内側から伸び始めて, 合計 10 数本から 20 本前後の仮根が伸長を行う. 8. 仮根細胞に起因する仮根群が或る程度仲びた後に, その内側から別な仮根群が現れる例の多かつた事実は, 従来アカモクについて報含されていたものと必ずしも一致しない. しかし, アカモクに於ても今回の植物と同様な例を福岡市外の材料で観察することが出来たので, 胚発生に関してはアカモクに同じと考えても差支えないと思う...|$|E

Detailed analysis of seasonal changes shows in addition that the size of the colonies greatly increases during the course of Phaeocystis sp. flowering, reaching sizes as high as 1 mm diameter {{at the top of the}} bloom when nutrients are depleted.

The {{results from this study}} show that plants suitable for thin layer green roofs resist drought conditions through physiological mechanisms such as succulent foliage, surface cuticles, <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances,</b> hairs or spines, and the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Plants that grew well came from the families Crassulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Portulacaceae. When temperature reduction effectiveness was measured in regard to plant height, the best reductions in temperature occurred in 35 cm plants, followed by 15 cm and then 10 cm plants. Green leafed plants have better temperature reduction effects than purple/red leafed plants. The plants suggested in this study are suitable for regions with subtropical climates. Selecting thin layer green roof plants that resist drought, survive well, and decrease temperature effectively can adequately use water resources and realize green building concepts such as ecological friendliness, energy conservation, carbon emissions reduction, and water conservation.

40|$|Sterculia striata  {{presents}} {{two types}} of flowers on the same foot, perfect flowers that are functionally pistilate, and staminate flowers. For this reason this species was described as andromonoecious. The ovary is apocarpous, constituted by 4 - 5 carpels, while the style and the stigma are coherent. Considering their ontogeny and organization, the ovules are constituted by two units: the nucellar one, formed by nucella and inner integument; and the funicular one, that includes chalaza and external integument. The position of exostome near the hilum is in accordance with an anatropous ovule. However, due to the combination of all these characteristics the ovule of  S. striata  is described as hemianatropous. The ovule displays a very prominent exostome that persists in the seed as a caruncle. It also presents an obturator of placentarian origin. The fertilization is acrogamous. Three phases of the ovule and seed ontogeny were detected: initial, where nucella is curved until 90 º; prefertilization, where the external integument continues its growth until the exostome is closed at 180 º; and posfecundation, where the nucelar unit retakes the erect position and the embryo is inverted {{with respect to the}} hilum. The seed coat is multiplicative, being the layer of macrosclereids of the exotegmen the mechanical layer. The fruit is a follicle, in which each carpel presents abundant lysigenous cavities filled with <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances.</b> </div...|$|R

Purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) is an important plant naturally found as a weed in field crops and lawns. Purslane is widely distributed around the globe and is popular as a potherb {{in many areas of}} Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean region. This plant possesses <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances</b> which are of medicinal importance. It is a rich source of potassium (494 mg/ 100 g) followed by magnesium (68 mg/ 100 g) and calcium (65 mg/ 100 g) and possesses the potential to be used as vegetable source of omega- 3 fatty acid. It is very good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and gamma-linolenic acid (LNA, 18 : 3 w 3) (4 mg/g fresh weight) of any green leafy vegetable. It contained the highest amount (22. 2 mg and 130 mg per 100 g of fresh and dry weight, resp.) of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid (26. 6 mg and 506 mg per 100 g of fresh and dry weight, resp.).

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} young roots of trifoliate orange budded with satsuma {{mandarin}} cultured hydroponically under pH 4. 5 - 5. 6, 6. 0 - 6. 3 and 7. 5 - 7. 6 were investigated {{to know the}} pH optima for this plant. Under pH 4. 5 - 5. 6, root tips were pointed and meristematic zone appeared wider. Starch grains {{were found on the}} rootcap and cortical cells apart from the tip but were absent completely from the cortical cell files close to the root apex. These characteristics remained similar along the exposure time. Under pH 6. 0 - 6. 3, roots were subjected to gradual shortening of growing zone followed by epidermal and root tip injuries on longer induction. Starch grain content in the cortical cells gradually increased up to 10 days of induction followed by conspicuous decrease, especially near the injured epidermis. The adverse effects of pH 7. 5 - 7. 6 started at short exposure resulting the severe sloughing of rootcap cells and bulbous structure of root tip. The epidermal injury also became conspicuous even within 3 days. The root apex secreted <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances</b> which were followed by injuries. Numerous starch grains were initially accumulated in the cortical cells but degraded completely at longer exposures. The cortical cells remained elongated and cell length gradually increased from the root apex towards the root base at pH 4. 5 - 5. 6. In contrast, the cells turned to round and their lengths became higher near the root apex in pH 6. 0 - 6. 3 and 7. 5 - 7. 6 compared to pH 4. 5 - 5. 6...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical {{changes in}} root tips of trifoliate orange grafted with satsuma {{mandarin}} (Citrus unshiu Marc. cv. Okitsu Wase) at 0, 10, 25 and 50 mM NaCl {{in the culture}} solution were investigated after 3, 5, 8, and 10 days induction. At no-salt-control treatment, the root tips were always sharply pointed, apical initial cell layers were distinct and meristematic zone was wider. The rootcap and cortical cells apart from the root tip possessed only a few starch grains. The cortical cells were elongated and cell length gradually increased from the root tip towards the base. In contrast, under 10 mM NaCl, root tips gradually turned round and the meristematic zone finally shortened. Only a few starch grains accumulated up to 8 days of induction followed by degradation in the rootcap cells but cortical grains gradually increased. At 25 mM NaCl, severe sloughing of rootcap cells and the secretion of <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances</b> appeared on the 5 th day. The epidermal and root tip injuries were found and the apical initial cell layers became indistinct from the 5 th day onward. Lignification occurred in the central cylinder which gradually proceeded towards the root tip. Starch grain accumulation increased in the cortical cells but decreased in the rootcap cells along the exposure time to the saline solutions. The cortical cells tended to round and cell length increased near the root tip. At 50 mM NaCl solution, root tip and epidermal injuries and lignification in the central cylinder initiated on the 3 rd day and became severe at longer exposure. Starch grains were {{not found in the}} rootcap cells but the cortical grains gradually increased. The cortical cell rounding and enlargement started {{from the very beginning of}} induction...|$|R
50|$|Reproduction of the {{parasite}} only {{occurs in the}} definitive host. In acanthocephalans, adult males have cement glands in their posterior ends. The widely held {{theory is that the}} <b>mucilaginous</b> and proteinaceous <b>substance</b> that these glands secrete is used by males to seal up the females after copulation in order to prevent leakage of the inseminated sperm and further insemination by other males. It has also been found that these males may create this seal on other males in order to prevent them from copulating. These seals, or copulatory caps, last for a week.|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersal}} unit of C. mopane {{consists of}} a seed borne within an indehiscent fruit. Both the seed and fruit are short-lived Under natural environmental conditions the seeds seldom remain viable {{for more than a}} year and pericarps of fruits are usually completely degraded after one year. The transitory nature of the testa is reflected in its anatomical structure as it is thin-walled and unlignified at maturity. Seed structure does not conform to that of the typical legume. The thin testa is highly permeable to water and lacks the characteristic malpighian cells and other sclerenchymatous elements. Although water does not penetrate the pericarp of newly-matured fruits, the pericarp soon becomes permeable under natural environmental conditions. Dye experiments using the apoplastic tracer acid fuchsin. revealed that once the fruit becomes permeable, it initially allows water to enter mostly through the ventral and dorsal sutures. With increased scarification of the pericarp, water is able to penetrate over its entire surface. An aril that originates partly from the funicle and partly from the outer integument circumvents the seed. The cells of the aril contain gum-like or <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances</b> that swell considerably when they are in contact with water. The aril is situated along the circumference of the seed, in close proximity to the carpel sutures and may aid fruit opening by increasing tension on the fruit valves The aril is abundantly supplied with vascular bundles as well as with an air canal that forms a highly efficient water transporting system during imbibition. If seeds are removed from fruits prior to imbibition, the aril swells to such an extent that its cells, including the vascular tissue, become disrupted. Imbibitional damage was constantly observed in seedlings that originated from seeds that were removed from fruits prior to imbibition. Seedlings originating from seeds left enclosed in fruits did not show similar damage In enclosed seeds the aril cells and vascular connections remained intact during imbibition. As the seeds of C. mopane are highly water permeable and lack a functional lens to control the rate of water entry, it is proposed that the pericarp governs the passage of water to the seed...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, as per ASTM standards, pure {{biodiesel}} (B 100) {{is considered}} to be an alternative fuel under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Biodiesel refers to a diesel-equivalent, processed fuel derived from biological sources (such as vegetable oils), which can be used in unmodified diesel-engine vehicles. In recent years, biodiesel fuels have received significant attention both as a possible renewable alternative fuel and as an additive to existing petroleum-based fuels. Besides just an additional fuel supply, biodiesel exhibits several advantages when compared to existing petroleum fuel.;The state of Iowa and Iowa State University through the Iowa Energy Center sponsors research regarding alternate energy and efficiency. The Iowa Energy Centers 2 ̆ 7 Biomass Energy Conversion (BECON) facility in Nevada, Iowa houses the state 2 ̆ 7 s most innovative and collaborative biomass conversion projects for developing new fuels and chemicals from biomass and enhancing existing processes. The biodiesel pilot plant at BECON is one of such projects. The pilot plant evolved slowly from producing biodiesel at a laboratory scale with fats and oils to pilot scale production in batches. Efforts were made to make this a continuous process starting from preparing feedstock to final production of biodiesel. The work represented by this thesis was undertaken in order to get one step closer to the goal of making a continuous process.;Crude soybean oil contains impurities that can be classified into two categories: oil insoluble and oil soluble. The oil insoluble impurities consists of seed fragments and meal fines, free water and long chain hydrocarbons or waxes. Most of these materials can be removed by filtration. The oil-soluble materials include free fatty acids, phosphatides, gummy or <b>mucilaginous</b> <b>substances</b> and some other compounds. Phosphatides in soybean oil are most commonly referred to as 2 ̆ 7 gums 2 ̆ 7. Currently, at BECON the soybean oil produced from the soybean processing plant was stored in a tank and the gums (mainly phosphatides) were removed by gravity separation by settling in the tank and through filtering. Gravity separation {{takes a long time to}} remove the gums and it is not very efficient in removing gums because some can not be removed. Therefore, a process capable of separating gums in real time to match with the speed of soybean oil production was needed at the pilot plant. Centrifugal separation of gums is fast and is widely used in the food processing industry. Therefore, centrifugal degumming was chosen and a degumming system was put in place as a tool to demonstrate its use for the biodiesel industry. This thesis will describe the system and main process parameters, which can be varied to get optimum results. Because of time constraint, verifying the effects of all the process parameters on the degumming of oil was beyond the scope of this project. However a system has been developed and its performance is demonstrated here...|$|R
2500|$|Cephalopods are not {{broadcast}} spawners. During {{the process}} of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a [...] "male to female neck" [...] position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate {{the process of}} fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat {{to ensure the safety}} of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a <b>mucilaginous</b> adhesive <b>substance.</b> These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.|$|R
