50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and <b>at</b> engine <b>idle.</b> Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the problem of car random burst shaking while its engine is running <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> The {{disturbing}} vibration is excited by non-uniform engine rotational frequency that is transferred to the car body vibration and finally to passengers.

The paper presents how to use newly developed measurement methods and data processing tools. Key words: engine running <b>at</b> <b>idle,</b> random burst shaking, transfer path for vibration. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceReducing fuel {{consumption}} {{is a prime}} objective {{in order to meet}} regulatory and customer demands. Given this context, an original port fuel injected engine featuring variable valve actuation was initially investigated when operating <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> with low intake valve lift. An improvement of both fuel economy and engine cycle-to-cycle variability was recorded <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> operation, which is a prominent feature of real world driving, especially in congested city traffic. To complete the picture, however, results concerning the engine's internal aerodynamics are necessary. In the present study, the internal aerodynamics and gas exchange phenomena of the engine are examined when using low intake valve lift. For this purpose, a 3 D CFD (computational fluid dynamics) dynamic simulation of the <b>motored</b> engine <b>at</b> a speed corresponding to idle operation has been adopted. Experimentation was also performed to obtain data to set the initial and boundary conditions and to calibrate and validate the CFD model. The results provide important insights into the effects of operating the engine with low intake valve lift: increased flow velocity, turbulence and swirl intensity and reduction of internal EGR (exhaust gas recirculation). Thus, this CFD study confirmed our previous work recorded phenomena mentioned as the cause of the engine's idle operation improvement...|$|R

50|$|One {{source for}} vacuum advance {{is a small}} opening located in {{the wall of the}} {{throttle}} body or carburetor adjacent to but slightly upstream of the edge of the throttle plate.

Other vehicles use vacuum directly from the intake manifold. This provides full engine vacuum (and hence, full vacuum advance) <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> Some vacuum advance units have two vacuum connections, one at each side of the actuator membrane, connected to both manifold vacuum and ported vacuum. These units will both advance and retard the ignition timing.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{remains an}} {{attractive}} alternative fuel to petroleum {{and a number}} of investigators claim that adding hydrogen to the air intake manifold of a diesel engine will reduce criteria emissions and diesel fuel consumption. Such claims are appealing when trying to simultaneously reduce petroleum consumption, greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants. The goal of this research was to measure the change in criteria emissions (CO, NO x, and PM 2. 5) and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), using standard test methods {{for a wide range of}} hydrogen addition rates. A two-stroke Detroit Diesel Corporation 12 V- 71 TI marine diesel engine was mounted on an engine dynamometer and tested at three out of the four loads specified in the ISO 8178 - 4 E 3 emission test cycle and <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> The engine operated on CARB ultra-low sulfur # 2 diesel with hydrogen added at flow rates of 0, 22 and 220 SLPM. As compared with the base case without hydrogen, measurements showed that hydrogen injection at 22 and 220 SLPM had negligible influence on the overall carbon dioxide specific emission, EFCO 2. However, in examining data at each load the data revealed that <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> EFCO 2 was reduced by 21 % at 22 SLPM (6. 9 % of the added fuel energy was from hydrogen) and 37. 3 % at 220 SLPM (103. 1 % of the added fuel energy was from hydrogen). At all other loads, the influence of added hydrogen was insignificant. Specific emissions for nitrogen ox ides, EFNO x, and fine particulate matters, EFPM 2. 5, showed a trade-off relationship <b>at</b> <b>idle.</b> <b>At</b> <b>idle,</b> EFNO x was reduced by 28 % and 41 % with increasing hydrogen flow rates, whilst EFPM 2. 5 increased by 41 % and 86 % respectively. For other engine loads, EFNO x and EFPM 2. 5 did not change significantly with varying hydrogen flow rates. One of the main reasons for the greater impact of hydrogen <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> is that the contribution of hydrogen to the total fuel energy is much higher <b>at</b> <b>idle</b> as compared to the other loads. The final examination in this paper was the system energy balance when hydrogen is produced by an on-board electrolysis unit. An analysis at 75 % engine load showed that hydrogen production increased the overall equivalent fuel consumption by 2. 6 % at 22 SLPM and 17. 7 % at 220 SLPM. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
