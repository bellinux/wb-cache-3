5|$|The {{identity}} of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into <b>monomethylhydrazine,</b> {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Monomethylhydrazine,</b> {{as well as}} its {{precursors}} methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw Gyromitra esculenta, {{have been}} shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E
500|$|Gyromitra infula, {{commonly}} known as the hooded false morel or the elfin saddle, is a fungus in the family Helvellaceae. The dark reddish-brown caps of the fruit bodies develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The stipe is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. G.infula is considered inedible as it contains the toxic compound gyromitrin, which, when metabolized by the body, is converted into <b>monomethylhydrazine,</b> a component of some rocket fuels. The toxin may be removed by thorough cooking. Gyromitra fungi are included in the informal category [...] "false morels".|$|E
2500|$|The {{false morel}} {{produces}} the poison gyromitrin {{which is an}} organic derivative of hydrazine that is converted to <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> by metabolic processes. Even the most popular edible [...] "button" [...] mushroom Agaricus bisporus produces organic hydrazine derivatives, including agaritine, a hydrazine derivative of an amino acid, and gyromitrin.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{propulsion}} unit was mounted above the orbiter bus. Propulsion was furnished by a bipropellant (<b>monomethylhydrazine</b> and nitrogen tetroxide) liquid-fueled rocket engine {{which could be}} gimballed up to 9 degrees. The engine was capable of [...] thrust, translating {{to a change in}} velocity of 1480 m/s. Attitude control was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{variants}} of hydrazine {{that are used}} as rocket fuel are <b>monomethylhydrazine,</b> (CH3)NH(NH2) (also known as MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, (CH3)2N(NH2) (also known as UDMH). These derivatives are used in two-component rocket fuels, often together with dinitrogen tetroxide, [...] N2O4. These reactions are extremely exothermic, and the burning is also hypergolic (it starts burning without any external ignition).|$|E
2500|$|The orbiter's {{dry mass}} is , and it carried [...] {{of fuel and}} oxidiser at launch. Its main engine, which is a {{derivative}} of the system used on India's communications satellites, uses the bipropellant combination <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from Earth. It was also used {{to slow down the}} probe for Mars orbit insertion and, subsequently, for orbit corrections.|$|E
2500|$|Main {{propulsion}} comprises 24 paired bipropellant 10N thrusters, {{with four}} pairs of thrusters {{being used for}} delta-v burns.

2500|$|The {{propulsion}} subsystem {{consisted of}} a 400N main engine and twelve 10N thrusters, together with propellant, storage and pressurizing tanks and associated plumbing. The 10N thrusters were mounted in groups of six on two 2-meter booms. The fuel for the system was [...] of <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> and nitrogen tetroxide. Two separate tanks held another [...] of helium pressurant. The propulsion subsystem was developed and built by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm and provided by West Germany, the major international partner in Project Galileo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the Jarvis vehicle was {{designed}} to use two Rocketdyne F-1 engines, powered by RP-1 rocket fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX); these were the same engines used by the Saturn V's first stage. The second stage would use a single Rocketdyne J-2 LOX/liquid hydrogen (LH2) engine, while the third stage was intended to utilise eight Marquardt R-4D reaction control system thrusters, fueled by a hypergolic mix of nitrogen tetroxide and <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> (N2O4/MMH), to provide final boost, and {{to allow for the}} deployment of multiple payloads into different orbits. Jarvis was designed to be capable of carrying payloads of up to [...] in diameter; as many as six satellites could be carried on a single rocket, and it was suggested that the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation be deployed in this manner.|$|E
2500|$|Spacecraft {{power is}} {{provided}} by the solar panels which contain 11.42 square meters of silicon cells. The originally planned power was to be 660 W at 1.5 AU but a faulty connection has reduced the amount of power available by 30%, to about 460 W. This loss of power does significantly impact the science return of the mission. Power is stored in three lithium-ion batteries with a total capacity of 64.8 Ah for use during eclipses. The power is fully regulated at 28 V, and the Terma power module (also used in Rosetta) is redundant. Main propulsion consists of 24 bipropellant 10N thrusters. The spacecraft carried [...] of propellant at launch, composed of <b>monomethylhydrazine</b> fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser, providing a maximum delta-v of [...] Four of the thrusters are used for delta-v burns. During routine phase, the spacecraft's power consumption is in the range of 450 W - 550 W.|$|E
50|$|Gyromitrin is a toxin and {{carcinogen}} {{present in}} {{several members of}} the fungal genus Gyromitra, G. esculenta.
