[...] He returned to Europe in 1951 to serve as London bureau chief. [...] In 1955, after the sudden death of the Paris bureau chief, he was given that position back, and for a time he held both posts simultaneously. [...] While Time bureau chief of London and Paris, he also spent some time writing about his favorite subject, sports, for the magazine, for which he covered the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. [...] In early 1956, he accepted a temporary assignment to head a contingent of writers to cover the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy for Time, Inc.'s fledgling Sports Illustrated, started two years earlier by Luce. [...] His first article for the magazine was a piece on the dominance of the Soviet Union in their first Winter Olympics.
