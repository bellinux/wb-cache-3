5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle.

5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the New Kingdom, and quite possibly earlier, the festival procession had become an opportunity for people to seek oracles from the god. Their questions dealt with subjects ranging from the location of a lost object to the best choice for a government appointment. The motions of the barque as it was carried on the bearers' shoulders—making simple gestures to indicate [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no", tipping toward tablets on which possible answers were written, or <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> particular person in the crowd—were taken to indicate the god's reply. In the Greco-Roman period, and possibly much earlier, oracles were used outside the festival, allowing people to consult them frequently. Priests interpreted the movements of sacred animals or, being asked questions directly, wrote out or spoke answers that they had supposedly received from the god in question. The priests' claim to speak for the gods or interpret their messages gave them great political influence and provided the means for the High Priests of Amun to dominate Upper Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E

The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had {{formed in the}} late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit [...] "The Boys Are Back in Town", which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US.

Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the new wave of British heavy metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.|$|E

2500|$|Georg Hegel distanced his {{philosophy}} from psychology by presenting truth {{as being an}} external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth {{is analogous to the}} mechanics of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. [...] "Truth is its own self-movement within itself." [...] Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of dialectical triplicity toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. Chalybäus used the terms [...] "thesis", [...] "antithesis", and [...] "synthesis" [...] to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity. [...] The [...] "thesis" [...] consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an [...] "antithesis" [...] occurs which opposes the [...] "thesis." [...] In turn, the [...] "synthesis" [...] appears when the [...] "thesis" [...] and [...] "antithesis" [...] become reconciled and a higher level of truth is obtained. This [...] "synthesis" [...] thereby becomes a [...] "thesis," [...] which will again necessitate an [...] "antithesis," [...] requiring a new [...] "synthesis" [...] until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the Absolute Spirit <b>moving</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> goal.
