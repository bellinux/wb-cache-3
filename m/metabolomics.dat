5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of labor in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with <b>metabolomics</b> and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E

25|$|The English-language {{neologism}} omics informally {{refers to}} a field of study in biology ending in -omics, such as genomics, proteomics or <b>metabolomics.</b> The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome or metabolome respectively. The suffix -ome as used in molecular biology {{refers to a}} totality of some sort; similarly omics has come to refer generally {{to the study of}} large, comprehensive biological data sets. While the growth {{in the use of the}} term has led some scientists (Jonathan Eisen, among others) to claim that it has been oversold, it reflects the change in orientation towards the quantitative analysis of complete or near-complete assortment of all the constituents of a system. In the study of symbioses, for example, researchers which were once limited to the study of a single gene product can now simultaneously compare the total complement of several types of biological molecules.|$|E
500|$|... 20th century {{developments}} in plant biochemistry {{have been driven}} by modern techniques of organic chemical analysis, such as spectroscopy, chromatography and electrophoresis. With {{the rise of the}} related molecular-scale biological approaches of molecular biology, genomics, proteomics and <b>metabolomics,</b> the relationship between the plant genome and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis. The concept originally stated by Gottlieb Haberlandt in 1902 that all plant cells are totipotent and can be grown in vitro ultimately enabled the use of genetic engineering experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as GFP that report when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in bioreactors to synthesise pesticides, antibiotics or other pharmaceuticals, as well as the practical application of genetically modified crops designed for traits such as improved yield.|$|E

In this regard, MS-based systems are useful to acquire more detailed information about the wide spectrum of compounds from a complex biological plant sample. LC-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) {{is also used}} in plant <b>metabolomics,</b> but this technique can only detect and quantify the most abundant metabolites. LC-MS has been useful to advance the field of plant <b>metabolomics,</b> which aims to study the plant system at molecular level providing a non-biased characterization of the plant [...] metabolome in response to its environment.

2500|$|The {{small size}} of its genome, {{and the fact that}} it is diploid, makes Arabidopsis thaliana useful for genetic mapping and {{sequencing}} — with about 135 mega base pairs and five chromosomes, A. thaliana has one of the smallest genomes among plants. It was long thought to have the smallest genome of all flowering plants, but that title is now considered to belong to plants in the genus Genlisea, order Lamiales, with Genlisea tuberosa, a carnivorous plant, showing a genome size of approximately 61Mbp. It was the first plant genome to be sequenced, completed in 2000 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. The most up-to-date version of the A. thaliana genome is maintained by the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). Much work has been done to assign functions to its 27,000 genes and the 35,000 proteins they encode. Post-genomic research, such as <b>metabolomics,</b> has also provided useful insights to the metabolism of this species and how environmental perturbations [...] can affect metabolic processes.|$|E

5000|$|Metabolites are the {{intermediates}} {{and products}} of metabolism. Within {{the context of}} <b>metabolomics,</b> a metabolite is usually defined as any molecule less than 1 kDa in size. However, there are exceptions to this depending on the sample and detection method. For example, macromolecules such as lipoproteins and albumin are reliably detected in NMR-based <b>metabolomics</b> studies of blood plasma. In plant-based <b>metabolomics,</b> {{it is common to}} refer to [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] metabolites. A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function. Examples include antibiotics and pigments. By contrast, in human-based <b>metabolomics,</b> it is more common to describe metabolites as being either endogenous (produced by the host organism) or exogenous. Metabolites of foreign substances such as drugs are termed xenometabolites.|$|E

As such, <b>metabolomics</b> is finding {{an increasing number of}} applications in the environmental sciences, ranging from understanding organismal responses to abiotic pressures, to investigating the responses of organisms to other biota. These interactions can be studied from individuals to populations, which can be related to the traditional fields of ecophysiology and ecology, and from instantaneous effects to those over evolutionary time scales, the latter enabling studies of genetic adaptation.|$|E

The development and establishment of mass spectrometry techniques for the identification and quantification of low molecular endogenous metabolites (< 1500 Daltons) in body fluids and tissues was a logical consequence. <b>Metabolomics</b> are differentiated into non-targetetd and targeted <b>metabolomics.</b> Non targeted <b>metabolomics</b> only show a restricted number of established protocols for the processing of raw data, dependency of instruments and the difficulty to obviously elucidate the chemical identity of the targeted metabolites in which one is interested.

50|$|The data {{generated}} in <b>metabolomics</b> usually consist of measurements performed on subjects under various conditions. These measurements may be digitized spectra, or {{a list of}} metabolite levels. In its simplest form this generates a matrix with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding with metabolite levels. Several statistical programs are currently available for analysis of both NMR and mass spectrometry data. For mass spectrometry data, software is available that identifies molecules that vary in subject groups {{on the basis of}} mass and sometimes retention time depending on the experimental design. The first comprehensive software to analyze global mass spectrometry-based <b>metabolomics</b> datasets was developed by the Siuzdak laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute in 2006. This software, called XCMS, is freely available, has over 20,000 downloads since its inception in 2006, {{and is one of the}} most widely cited mass spectrometry-based <b>metabolomics</b> software programs in scientific literature. XCMS has now been surpassed in usage by a cloud-based version of XCMS called XCMS Online. Other popular <b>metabolomics</b> programs for mass spectral analysis are MZmine, MetAlign, MathDAMP, which also compensate for retention time deviation during sample analysis. LCMStats is another R package for detailed analysis of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry(LCMS)data and is helpful in identification of co-eluting ions especially isotopologues from a complicated metabolic profile. It combines xcms package functions and can be used to apply many statistical functions for correcting detector saturation using coates correction and creating heat plots. <b>Metabolomics</b> data may also be analyzed by statistical projection (chemometrics) methods such as principal components analysis and partial least squares regression.|$|E
