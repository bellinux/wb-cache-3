25|$|The {{cookbook}} {{method of}} teaching introductory statistics leaves {{no time for}} history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught as received unified method. Surveys showed that graduates of the class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors. While the problem was addressed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> and calls for educational reform continue, students still graduate from statistics classes holding fundamental misconceptions about hypothesis testing. Ideas for improving the teaching of hypothesis testing include encouraging students to search for statistical errors in published papers, teaching the history of statistics and emphasizing the controversy in a generally dry subject.|$|E
500|$|Good Girl Gone Bad {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews.

[...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B.

Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that the album [...] "sounds {{as if it were}} scientifically engineered to deliver hits". Peter Robinson of The Observer commended her collaborators for [...] "masking her own shortcomings" [...] and commented that, [...] "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." [...] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although it [...] "goes bad when Rihanna tries her hand at treacly ballads and glum sentiment", at times Good Girl Gone Bad is a [...] "thrilling throwback to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J.
