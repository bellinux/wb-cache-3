40|$|Background: Joining {{of plastic}} {{composites}} is {{a practice of}} long-standing interest in the medical industry. An enormous number of <b>medical</b> <b>disposable</b> products are assembled using plastic joining solvents. Medical devices are becoming more complex and more sophisticated, both in performance specifications and structural complexity. Solvent bonding for assembly of plastic parts is an effective method of making permanent connections. This method produces aesthetic and clean looking joints with low weight and sufficiently strong connections. Assembling with solvent bonds can be cost saving, but might be tricky in achieving desired performance. Bonding of medical components involves a thorough understanding in design, material compatibility, performance testing, assembly methods and regulatory affairs...|$|E

Although custom packs constitute a well-known concept in the hospital setting, little is known on methodologies to configure them, especially {{if the number of}} medical items, procedures and surgeons is large. In this paper we propose a mathematical programming approach to guide hospitals in developing or reconfiguring their custom packs. In particular, we optimize the configuration process so that the number of material touch points, the number of configured packs and the cost of waste is optimized. We develop an intuitive integer non-linear programming model which we eventually linearize and apply to real data of a medium-sized Belgian hospital. We report on the crucial data gathering phase and the problems we encountered in retrieving accurate information. A computational experiment compares the optimized results with the performance of the current configuration settings and indicates how to improve the custom pack usage. Multiple scenarios are listed and evaluated, such as the development of surgeon-specific or discipline-wide custom packs. We point at some interesting insights that can be taken up by the hospital management to guide the configuration and accompanying negotiation processes, both internally (surgeons) and externally (vendors).

40|$|A custom pack {{combines}} <b>medical</b> <b>disposable</b> items into {{a single}} sterile package that is used for surgical procedures. Although custom packs are gaining importance in hospitals due to their potential benefits in reducing surgery setup times, little is known on methodologies to configure them, especially {{if the number of}} medical items, procedure types and surgeons is large. In this paper, we propose a mathematical programming approach to guide hospitals in developing or reconfiguring their custom packs. In particular, we are interested in minimising points of touch, which we define as a measure for physical contact between staff and medical materials. Starting from an integer non-linear programming model, we develop both an exact linear programming (LP) solution approach and an LP-based heuristic. Next, we also describe a simulated annealing approach to benchmark the mathematical programming methods. A computational experiment, based on real data of a medium-sized Belgian hospital, compares the optimised results with the performance of the hospital’s current configuration settings and indicates how to improve future usage. Next to this base case, we introduce scenarios in which we examine to what extent the results are sensitive for waste, i. e. adding more items to the custom pack than is technically required for some of the custom pack’s procedures, since this can increase its applicability towards other procedures. We point at some interesting insights that can be taken up by the hospital management to guide the configuration and accompanying negotiation processes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Management and Graduate School of Business Administration of Bilkent Univ., 1998. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 1998. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 46. Biotek Medikal {{is operating}} in the service industry since 1986. It became a leading firm in importing and selling bio-medical instruments and disposables (single use); particularly for cardiovascular surgery (CVS) and cardiology. (CRD) In 1989, due to sales expansion, need for assistance in sales activities forced the company to expand the existing sales force. Branch offices in Istanbul and Izmir were opened in that period. Until then, service to other parts o f Turkey has been handled from the Ankara office. In 1990, a drop was recorded in sales. Unplanned expansion, lack of coordination in sales, the general manager's concentration on administrative issues rather than sales were the major causes of the drop in sales that year. The Gulf Crisis made the situation even worse by delays in shipments from suppliers and changing policies in payment schedules by reimbursement agencies. When the crisis started, the Health Budget funds were transferred to probable emergency cases in the Southeast. For the first time, Biotek experienced serious payment problems with its suppliers due to late collection o f its receivables. The biggest devaluation in the republic's history in April 1994 led to a further crisis in the medical sector due to import dominant structure. Shortly after this devaluation all health care reimbursement entities ran into financing problems which {{had an impact on}} local distributors and suppliers as well. This was a fast growing market and most of the other competing firms were also enjoying the market conditions before the reshaping of the relations o f hospitals with reimbursement agencies. Biotek is now facing the challenge of organizing its structure to adapt to the rapid growth of the firm and the changes in the industry. In addition, Biotek has to struggle with the government regulations dictating the policy change in payments of the state owned enterprises. Page 2 of 48 In terms of the basic elements of the strategic management process, the thesis focuses only on environmental scanning and strategy formulation. Reference 1 In the environmental scanning, the thesis analyses the opportunities and threats that Biotek Medikal faces in the medikal market. Here the task environment of Biotek Medikal is clarified by reference to the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers and the competition among the competitors. The environmental scanning analysis also addresses the internal environment of Biotek Medikal in which {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the company and its competitors are examined through technical capacities, human resources, market relations etc. Reference 2 Based on the findings of the earlier chapters, the final chapter tries to formulate strategies for Biotek Medikal designed to improve the competitive position of the company's products within the <b>medical</b> <b>disposable</b> market. Here particularly the following points are questioned; Should Biotek compete on the basis of low cost or should it differentiate its products on some basis other than cost such as focusing on the most profitable product lines or, if present, finding market niches. In conclusion different alternative strategy formulations are evaluated in terms of Porter's competitive strategy i. e., cost focus, cost leadership. Aygen, MertM. S...|$|E

On the basis of swelling kinetics, pressure of 10 MPa and temperature of 40 °C were chosen for supercritical solvent impregnation (SSI) of the PLA samples during 2 to 24 h. The highest swelling extent was observed for the PLA monolith after 24 h treatment with pure scCO 2 (7. 5 %) and scCO 2 with thymol (118. 3 %). It was shown that sufficiently high amount of thymol can be loaded into both PLA monolith and film using SSI after only 2 h (10. 0 % and 6. 6 %, respectively).

40|$|Irradiation of {{packaging}} materials-in most cases, plastic-generally {{leads to}} the formation of free radicals and ions, which eventually result either in cross-linking or in chain scission. The latter {{leads to the}} release of volatile radiolysis products that may induce off-odors in the polymers, thereby altering the migration characteristics of packaging materials. Irradiation also affects polymer additives, which change the specific migration behavior of polymer additives and additive-related decomposition products. Both migration and sensory changes of presterilized packaging materials strongly affect the quality of packaged goods and consumer safety. Radiation processing is widely used for medical product sterilization and food irradiation. Moreover, the use of irradiation has become a standard treatment to sterilize packages in aseptic processing of foods and pharmaceuticals. Nowadays, packaging consists of natural or synthetic plastics; therefore, the effect of irradiation on these materials is crucial for packaging engineering. The effect of ionizing radiation on polymeric materials has been found to manifest itself in two ways: (i) as a molecular weight increase (cross-linking); and (ii) as a molecular weight decrease (chain scission degradation). The ability of radiation to process the packaged material, compared to the ineffectiveness of chemical treatments, is a critical advantage over the others. The most important applications of polymer irradiation are: (i) sterilization of <b>medical</b> <b>disposables,</b> syringes, and tubing; and (ii) food and food packaging irradiation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
