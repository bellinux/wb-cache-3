40|$|Effect of {{protected}} fat on fatty acid composition and {{conjugated linoleic acid}} level in meat and milk of sheep Summary The purpose of modifying animal fats is to produce high quality products, which meet the dietary recommendations. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is actually under extensive research because of its potent anticarcinogenic properties and also because of {{its effect on the}} human immune system. Products received from ruminants (milk and meat) are the richest natural sources of CLA. Nutritional manipulation of diets for ruminants leads to higher level of CLA in milk. The influence {{of protected}} fat addition to diet for <b>milking</b> <b>ewes</b> and growing lambs on the fatty acid level and concentration of cis- 9, trans- 11 octadecadienoic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid, was investigated. Four lactating sheep, average body weight (BW) 50 ± 5 kg were used in the first experiment. The basic diet for milking sheep was composed of 60 % concentrate and 40 % meadow hay which was supplied with 0, 4, 8 and 10 % of protected fat in dry matter. Feeding protected fat to dairy sheep had no statistically significant influence on fatty acid composition and milk fat CLA content. During the second experiment 12 fattened lambs (average BW 22 ± 2 kg) were used. Animals were divided into two groups and fed control (without protected fat addition) and experimental (6 % of protected fat in dry matter) diets. Supplementing diets for fattened lambs with 6 % protected fat statistically significant improved CLA content in meat (muscles) (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Grassland are {{now being}} {{acknowledge}} for their multifunctional role. However the intensification of livestock production {{has led to a}} decrease in grassland use. In the production of the french cheese named Roquefort many farmers have abandoned natural grassland use to feed the <b>milking</b> <b>ewes.</b> This trend is less pronounced in few farmers' group wishing reduction in farm input and environemental impact while using the grassland. In order to maintain the level of the milk production the farmers have to innovate in new grazing systems and turnout to pasture practices. Designing new grazing practices requires understanding of links between the animal feeding and grassland management. To develop the necessary knowledge we have built a research project involving farmers. This project study has focused on the benefits from the large diversity of cultivated providing more flexibility in the farm management. We have conducted 20 -farmers's interviews to have an insight into the grassland and herd management's practices, and milk production results. A multivariate analysis has permitted to define 5 patterns of turnout to pasture managements. For each pattern we have described a different milking curve for two-first months of pasture. The milking curves are based on the milk level and the milk persistency. The main results report on links between feeding practices and milk production. Further analysis of the different patterns could identify the predisposing factors of the milk persistency. We have showed that some practices such as large diversity of grazing grassland use are favorable for maintaining the high level of milk production. The two main conclusions are firstly the traditional feeding system can be used to the levels of milk production. Secondly, the livestock intensification needs protein supply use combined with the large diversity of cultivated grassland. These points can be easily applied while advising farmers...|$|E

40|$|This dissertation's {{objectives}} were {{to evaluate the}} effects of body condition score (BCS) at parturition and nitrogenous supplementation on milk production of Serra da Estrela ewes fed on grass; and, afterwards, to determine which protein level in the diet {{would be the most}} adequate to allow full expression of their milking potential. It was also intended to characterise the ewes' intermediate metabolism in early lactation (0 to 42 days), looking for metabolic indicators of the ewes' mertabolic status during this period. Ewes had free access to daily cut grass. In the 1 st study, two types of supplement (corn and corn gluten feed) and two BCS at parturition (#>=# 2, 5 and #< 2, 5) were tested using 24 ewes. In the 2 nd study, three levels of CP in the diet (17, 21 and 25 %), using different proportions of gluten meal and cassava, were tested on 27 ewes. All supplements, fed at 18 : 00 hours, supplied 5, 6 MJ metabolisable energy daily. Ewes nursed their lambs until the 21 st day of lactation, being milked at 8 : 00 hours from then on (milk corresponding to 14 : 30 hours of production, milk fat composition in fatty acids (f. a.) and lamb growth were evaluated.

In a sheep farm, two groups of <b>milking</b> <b>ewes</b> with identical genetic material, management, nutrition, health status and similar production characteristics were formed. One group (46 ewes) served as control, while the other one (48 ewes) served as a probiotic-treated group. Both groups of ewes received a similar feeding regiment, but the ewes of the second group were additionally offered a probiotic product containing B. licheniformis and B. subtilis (BioPlus 2 B, Chr. Hansen, Denmark) at the approximate dose of 2. 56 x 10 (9) viable spores per ewe per day. Lamb mortality during the 1. 5 months suckling period, and milk yield during the 2 months of milk collection for commercial purposes have been recorded. In the non-treated control group, 13. 1 % mortality was observed versus 7. 8 % in the probiotic-treated group (P = 0. 33), with mortality being mainly due to diarrhoea. Microbiological examination of diarrhoeic faeces from some of the dead lambs in both groups revealed the presence of Escherichia coli. The average daily milk yield per ewe was significantly lower in the control group (0. 80 l) than that in the probiotic-treated group (0. 93 l) (P < 0. 05). Fat and protein content of milk in ewes that received probiotics was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased compared with untreated ewes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the sheep milk yield and quality as affecting by concentrate dietary supplements prepared on farm by mixing locally produced barley and legume grains, used as alternative to a commercial feed. A total of twelve <b>milking</b> <b>ewes,</b> averaging 92 ± 9 days in milking and 56 ± 6 kg of live weight, were housed in individual pens and divided homogeneously into four groups. Each group was fed ad libitum with a grass-legume hay and received, according to a 4 x 4 Latin square design with periods comprised of 21 days, one of the following isonitrogenous concentrates: 500 g chickpea and 300 g barley (CP); 450 g faba bean and 350 g barley (FB); 550 g pea and 250 g barley (PE); commercial feed mixture containing maize and soybean meal (CF). The ewes intake of concentrates based on legume grains was higher than that of commercial feed (702, 702, 678 vs. 587 g/d SS for CP, FB, PE and CF, respectively; P 0. 001). Comparing the different protein sources, the FB and PE increased milk yield in comparison with CP (710, 718 vs. 654 g/d for FB, PE and CP, respectively; P 0. 001), whereas CF gave intermediate milk level (677 g/d). FB and PE diets improved also the efficiency of dietary protein utilization for milk casein synthesis in comparison with the other diets (96, 99 vs. 89, 88 g casein/kg crude protein intake for FB, PE, CP and CF, respectively; P 0. 001). Being the same protein intake, these results from FB and PE seem to be attributable to their better amino acid composition, and also to their higher degradability favouring the balance between dietary energy and protein in the rumen for the microbial protein synthesis. Moreover, the diet induced variations in milk fatty acid (FA) profile, especially regarding some healthy polyunsaturated FA. Indeed, compared with FB and PE concentrates, CP increased, similarly to CF, milk contents in linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 n- 6 c 9 c 12) (2. 24, 2. 25 vs. 1. 54, 1. 42...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{consumption}} of cheese has {{increased over the}} years. The average Swede consumes somewhere around 20 kilograms of cheese per year, which is an increase of a 100 % over the past 50 years. One {{of the most popular}} kinds of cheese during the past decades is mozzarella, due to its’ use as pizza cheese. Flavor and consistency differ between the traditional kind, made out of buffalo’s milk, and the industrially made kind, made out of cow’s milk. Both the techniques as well as the kinds of milk used have a huge impact on the final product. The authors had access to fresh <b>ewe’s</b> (sheep’s) <b>milk</b> from a local farmer. Could it be used to produce a new type of mozzarella? The main purpose of this paper was to develop a technique to produce fresh hand-made mozzarella made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> using starter bacteria. The second purpose was to perform a sensory evaluation of the produced cheese in order to compare cheese made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> with cheese made out of cow’s milk. In a series of experiments we examined how cheese production was affected by rennet, starter cultures, temperatures and pH-levels. The sensory evaluation was performed using a group of respondents who were asked to perform a simple ranking test where one sample was mozzarella made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk,</b> one sample was mozzarella made out of cow’s milk and one sample was store-bought mozzarella made out of cow’s <b>milk.</b> <b>Ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> turned out to be unsuitable for production of mozzarella using the procedure we developed. The proteins in <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk</b> behaved differently from the proteins in cow’s milk when the cheese curd was stretched in hot water, resulting in a less stringy and more porous texture. The most suitable bacterial starter was a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, both of which you find in yoghurt. Results from the sensory evaluation showed that the respondents preferred the fresh mozzarella made out of cow’s milk. The method that we developed did not produce the desired texture in mozzarella made out of <b>ewe’s</b> <b>milk.</b> However, it is well adjusted for the production of mozzarella made out of cow’s milk.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to use modelling and statistical approaches to expand {{our knowledge of the}} immune responses against gastrointestinal nematode infections, {{to assess the impact of}} nematode infection, and to use our improved knowledge to examine novel means of selective breeding in farm animals (sheep) as a control strategy. To expand the knowledge of the host immune response against infection, Chapter 2 of this dissertation focuses on immunoglobulin A (IgA), an antibody that binds nematode molecules, and its transfer through the body from the abomasal mucus (i. e. site of infection, where it is produced) to the blood plasma, where it is typically measured. These findings have been published in Parasitology (Prada Jimenez de Cisneros et al., 2014 a). The implications of low levels of infection in adult <b>milking</b> <b>ewes,</b> which are more resistant than lambs, were also studied. A relationship is generated between infection levels using parasitological data and production data. There were however limitations in the dataset, which are discussed at the end of Chapter 3. Parasite resistance in adults sheep at low levels of infection was also studied, especially since the most common parasitological marker of disease is the faecal egg count (i. e. number of nematode eggs in the animals faeces) which is subject to substantial measurement error, among other limitations. Chapter 4 analyses a dataset of adult animals with low infection levels using a zero inflated binomial model (ZINB) and extends the model by including other evidence of parasite resistance to discriminate between exposed and unexposed animals. To examine selective breeding, an individual-based data-driven immunogenetically explicit mathematical model was developed. One application of this model is to compare the efficacy of two selective breeding schemes, each based on a different marker for disease, namely faecal egg counts and plasma IgA. This work has been published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface (Prada Jimenez de Cisneros et al., 2014 b). The model can be extended to create a distribution for the variation in larval intake that best fits the field data. This allows the partitioning of the variation in adult worm burden into different components. The purpose is to quantify the contribution of the immune response and larval intake to determine which of the two accounts for more of the variation in the level of infection. The model can be also extended to explore selection schemes in the two components of the immune response (i. e. namely the IgA mediated and IgE mediated immune response) and estimate animal size at the end of the grazing season...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} being a {{favourable}} product regarding its feeding value, <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> cannot be compared by its production volume with either cow or goat milk. Because it is rich in fats, proteins and minerals <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> belongs to an outstanding valuable human food (Antunović et al., 2001). It is known that the <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> content can vary due to {{various factors such as}} lactation stage, feeding, breed, season of the year, etc. (Jelinek et al., 1993). In general, <b>ewe</b> <b>milk</b> contains very low concentrations of heavy metals. Accelerated industrial and agricultural develop-ment considerably affects environmental emis-sions of selected toxic elements: cadmium, lead, mercury and arsenic (Lopez et al., 2002). Their concentrations in animal organisms and their milk concentrations may increase very fast, although their excretion through milk is very low (Miller, 1971; Houpert et al., 1997). Their ecosystem ac-cumulation (water-soil-plant-animal) makes them very toxic and leads to undesirable consequences for live organisms (Bogut et al., 2000; Piskorova et al., 2003). Free-living animals are important indi-cators of the environmental pollution with heavy metals (Kottferová and Koréneková, 1998). Sheep and cattle reared freely on pasture are also indica-tors of the environmental pollution (Gallo et al., 1996).
