Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression.

Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The <b>most</b> <b>aggressive</b> disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E
