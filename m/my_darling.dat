5|$|<b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine (1946) – Starring Henry Fonda, {{directed}} by John Ford.|$|E
5|$|Lake wrote {{another book}} about Wyatt Earp titled <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine in 1946 that {{director}} John Ford developed into the {{movie of the}} same name, which further boosted Wyatt's reputation. The book later inspired a number of stories, movies and television programs about outlaws and lawmen in Dodge City and Tombstone. Lake wrote a number of screenplays for these movies and twelve scripts for the 1955–61 television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp starring Hugh O'Brian as Earp.|$|E
5|$|Steven Spielberg, {{one of the}} film's {{executive}} producers, {{visited the}} director and the writers during pre-production {{to look over the}} script and the artwork. He provided Favreau with a collection of classic Western films. Spielberg also invited the director and the writers to a private screening of several Western films and provided live commentary on how to make one properly. The films included Stagecoach, <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine, and Destry Rides Again. Spielberg made several other suggestions: a main enemy alien, Jake's final use of the gauntlet being to decapitate an alien, and that Jake and Ella's first kiss should occur in the climax of the film.|$|E

5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, <b>my</b> <b>darling</b> husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Western story tellers {{and film}} makers {{featured}} the gunfight in many Western productions. Walter Noble Burns's novel Tombstone (1927) made Earp famous. Hollywood celebrated Earp's Tombstone days with John Ford's <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine (1946), John Sturges's Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) and Hour of the Gun (1967), Frank Perry's Doc (1971), George Cosmatos's Tombstone (1993), and Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp (1994). They solidified Earp's modern {{reputation as the}} Old West's deadliest gunman.|$|E

25|$|In spring 1940, Acuff and {{his band}} {{traveled}} to Hollywood, where they appeared with Hay and Macon in the motion picture Grand Ole Opry. Acuff appeared in several subsequent B-movies, including O, <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine (1943), in which he played a singing sheriff; Night Train to Memphis (1946), the title of which comes from a song Acuff recorded in 1940; and Home in San Antone (1949), in which he starred with Lloyd Corrigan and William Frawley.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{had been}} {{shooting}} the film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon {{the year before}} (1948) in Monument Valley, {{near the town of}} Mexican Hat, Utah, close to the locations where he had also filmed Stagecoach (1939), <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine (1946), and Fort Apache (1948). He wanted a different look for his next film and drove to Moab, Utah. Filmed in black and white on location, mainly north-east of the town of Moab, Utah in Professor Valley (with additional shooting at Spanish Valley south-west of Moab, and a few stage shots were done at Monument Valley).|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the television series, two more films were produced. A year after the television series finished, Urusei Yatsura: The Final Chapter was directed by Satoshi Dezaki and was released on February 6, 1988 as a tenth anniversary celebration. It was shown as a double bill with a Maison Ikkoku movie. The final film, Urusei Yatsura: Always <b>My</b> <b>Darling,</b> was directed by Katsuhisa Yamada and was released on August 18, 1991. In North America, Beautiful Dreamer was released by Central Park Media. The remaining five films were released by AnimEigo in North America and MVM Films in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1903, Lytton took a {{four-year}} break from D'Oyly Carte, starring {{in a number}} of successful West End musicals, including in the title role in The Earl and the Girl (1903–04), as Lieut. Reggie Drummond in The Talk of the Town (1905, a Seymour Hicks production), as Lieut. Reginald Armitage in The White Chrysanthemum (1905), as Boniface in The Spring Chicken (1905), as Aristide in The Little Michus (1905), as Captain Flapper in Billee Taylor (revival, c. 1906), as the Hon. Jack Hylton in <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> (1907, also a Hicks production), and in the title role in The Amateur Raffles (1907) Lytton performed in music hall between these engagements, performing in comic sketches with Connie Ediss for a time.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Fonda took a {{break from}} movies and {{attended}} Hollywood parties and enjoyed civilian life. Stewart and Fonda would listen to records and invite Johnny Mercer, Hoagy Carmichael, Dinah Shore, and Nat King Cole over for music, with the latter giving the family piano lessons. Fonda played Wyatt Earp in <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine (1946), which was directed by John Ford. Fonda did seven postwar films until his contract with Fox expired, the last being Otto Preminger's Daisy Kenyon (1947), opposite Joan Crawford. He starred in The Fugitive (1947), {{which was the first}} film of Ford's new production company, Argosy Pictures. In 1948, he appeared in a subsequent Argosy/Ford production, Fort Apache, as a rigid Army colonel, along with John Wayne and Shirley Temple in her first adult role.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Stewart's wife fell in {{love with}} one of his best friends, Norman, and so he granted her a divorce, but {{remained}} both her and Norman's friend, carrying no resentment towards them. Feeling alone, he turned to his second wife, Jean Mackinlay, who herself had just recently divorced her second husband, and although she refused his offer of reigniting their relationship, they did once more become friends. In 1968 he would re-united with another former lover, Beth Donovan, and married her, but he would leave her in June 1969 when he met a new woman, Isabel Sutherland, and subsequently moved in with her and her daughter. Meanwhile, in 1968 he won a Writer’s Guild Award for his six-part radio serial Watch the Wall <b>my</b> <b>Darling,</b> which was based upon the poem A Smuggler's Song by one of his favourite poets, Rudyard Kipling. Following this, in February of the following year, he once more returned to journalism, taking up employment with the popular weekly magazine Reveille.|$|E

25|$|Ford's first postwar movie <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine (Fox, 1946) was a romanticized {{retelling of}} the primal Western legend of Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, with {{exterior}} sequences filmed {{on location in}} the visually spectacular (but geographically inappropriate) Monument Valley. It reunited Ford with Henry Fonda (as Earp) and co-starred Victor Mature {{in one of his}} best roles as the consumptive, Shakespeare-loving Doc Holliday, with Ward Bond and Tim Holt as the Earp brothers, Linda Darnell as sultry saloon girl Chihuahua, a strong performance by Walter Brennan (in a rare villainous role) as the venomous Old Man Clanton, with Jane Darwell and an early screen appearance by John Ireland as Billy Clanton. In contrast to the string of successes in 1939–1941, it won no major American awards, although it was awarded a silver ribbon for Best Foreign Film in 1948 by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, and it was a solid financial success, grossing $2.75million in the United States and $1.75million internationally in its first year of release.|$|E

500|$|The gunfight was not {{well-known}} to the American public until 1931, when Stuart Lake {{published the}} initially well-received biography [...] {{two years after}} Earp's death. The book {{was the basis for}} the 1946 film <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine, directed by John Ford, and the 1957 film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, after which the shootout became known by that name. Since then, the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books, and has become an archetype for much of the popular imagery associated with the Old West.|$|E
500|$|The Voice of God instructs {{everyone}} {{to leave the}} ark. As they do, the animals sing [...] "Alleluias" [...] and the people sing a chorus of praise: [...] "Lord we thanke thee through thy mighte". God promises that he will never again destroy the earth with water, and produces a rainbow as his token. The cast begins Addison's hymn [...] "The spacious firmament on high", with the congregation joining {{in the last two}} verses. All the cast depart except Noye, who receives God's blessing and promise of no more vengeance: [...] "And nowe fare well, <b>my</b> <b>darling</b> deare" [...] before his departure from the stage.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most important and influential film-makers of his generation. Ingmar Bergman called him the greatest movie director of all time and Orson Welles regarded him highly. [...] With four Academy Awards, he is the most honored director in film history. [...] On February 8, 1960, Ford was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. [...] On March 31, 1973, Ford was honored with the Medal of Freedom Award and became the first person honored with the AFI Life Achievement Award. As of , ten films directed or co-directed by Ford have been added to The National Film Registry: The Iron Horse, Stagecoach, Young Mr. Lincoln, The Grapes of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley, <b>My</b> <b>Darling</b> Clementine, The Quiet Man, The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and How the West Was Won.
