It occurs in metamorphosed impure <b>magnesian</b> <b>limestones,</b> in serpentinite derived from ultramafic rocks, in kimberlites and carbonatites. Associated minerals include rutile, spinel, clinohumite, perovskite, diopside, serpentine, forsterite, brucite, hydrotalcite, chlorite and calcite.|$|E

In 1867 {{he joined the}} Kansas Pacific Railway first as assistant and later as superintendent of machinery. His work there ranged from [...] "keeping open its Western communications when the bridges were swept away, to designing, building and operating a mill for sawing, planing and turning the soft <b>magnesian</b> <b>limestones</b> by machinery, designing machine and car shops, etc." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{metamorphic}} rocks is {{integrated with the}} areal geology {{in the vicinity of}} the Cable stock, a granodiorite intrusive surrounded by Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Detailed geology of the zones of most intense metamorphism at the intrusive contact is described. Isochemical thermal metamorphism was followed by metasomatic addition of material and accompanied by various stages of alteration. Silicic <b>magnesian</b> <b>limestones</b> altered to diopside-grossularite marble by the introduction of iron. The addition of iron, little magnesia, and alumina altered the marble to a diopside-grandite tactite. Additional iron was deposited as magnetite and accompanied widespread dedolomitization and alteration. Rocks near the intrusive contact were replaced by epidote, mica, and scapolite. Areas of intense metamorphism occur at the granodiorite contact. Metamorphism is localized in areas of intense folding, fracturing, and shearing. The basic border of the stock indicates assimilation of calcareous rocks by the granodiorite; the transfer of calcium across the contact resulted in the development of pargasite, diopside, and scapolite. Deformation of the sediments was preceded and, in part, accompanied by forceful intrusion of the granodiorite. ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> is now {{incorporated}} {{within the}} Zechstein Group. In {{the southern part}} of its outcrop, the former 'Lower Magnesian Limestone' is now referred to as the 'Cadeby Formation'. Overlying this it is the 'Edlington Formation' (formerly the 'Middle Permian Marl') and above this the Brotherton Formation (formerly the 'Upper Magnesian Limestone'). In the north, the Lower <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> is now referred to as the Raisby Formation and the middle <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> as the Ford Formation. The Upper <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> is replaced by the Roker Formation (in its lower part) and the Seaham Formation (in its upper part) with the Edlington formation between them, though in the Durham area this last is replaced by the Fordham Evaporite Formation and the Seaham Residue.|$|R

40|$|The North East Regionâ€™s Groundwater Modelling Strategy has {{identified}} {{the need for}} the development of a conceptual model for the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> aquifer. In line with the Environment Agency R&D Technical Report W 214 (Environment Agency Framework for Groundwater Resources Conceptual and Numerical Modelling), a scoping study was produced, that identified areas of uncertainty and work required for the development of the conceptual model. The purpose of this project is to give the Environment Agency (EA) a regional understanding of the geology and hydrogeology of the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> and overlying superficial deposits in the North East Region, using information held by the British Geological Survey (BGS). This report contributes to the conceptual model and understanding of the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> aquifer. There is uncertainty in the amount of recharge that the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> receives from rainfall. The project is designed to gain a greater understanding of the geology of the superficial deposits and their hydrogeological properties. These are the key factors for the calculation of recharge to the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> aquifer from rainfall. This element of the conceptual model is essential in understanding the potential water resource available within this aquifer...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{understand}} influences of bulk structure of materials on strength behavior as well as water storage and transfer in order to assess durability and weathering. Therefore, a selection of different methods are applied and compared to optimize the understanding of material structure and physico-mechanical behavior. Optical microscopy (Digital Image Analysis) and scanning electron microscopy as well as water vapor permeability, biaxial flexural strength and ultrasonic velocity are measured on different natural materials: sandstones with clayey, silicious or calcareous binder, oolithic and micritic <b>magnesian</b> <b>limestones</b> and a thermally aged Proconnesian marble. Microstructurales and macrostructurales properties of these materials are studied before and after artificial weathering (freeze-thaw cycles). First, and in order to validate the efficiency of the digital image analysis to characterize porosity and structure, traditional porosity measurements as water ad- and absorption and mercury porosimetry are crosschecked with the result obtained from digital image analysis. Limits of each methods are also defined. Then, validations of non-destructive and semi-destructive methods are also pursued to evaluate their potential value to replace and complement standardized methods. By analysis of linear correlations, some essential mechanisms should be underlined, which may connect the macrostructure to the microstructure of the material. A systematic method of analysis should clearly appear and emphasize the role of the structure (grain size, grain contact and pore shape) on physical and mechanical behavior. The main parameters leading to weathering should then be identified and models of correlations drawn. Correlations between the various physico-mechanical properties could ameliorate the possibilities to assess durability and weathering in the natural environment...|$|E

25|$|The {{source of}} the Poulter is {{in a region where}} the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> aquifer. <b>Magnesian</b> <b>limestone</b> is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are lower than they have historically been, {{as a result of the}} extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|R

To the east of its catchment there is a band of Permian <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone,</b> which forms an escarpment. <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> is so called because it contains quantities of the mineral dolomite, which is rich in magnesium.

50|$|The {{sequence}} {{from the}} Marl Slate {{up to and}} including the Seaham Formation was formerly known as the <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone.</b> The 'Zechstein Group' replaced the former Don, Aislaby, Teesside, Staintondale and Eskdale groups. Several of these units have proved economically valuable. Anhydrite was sourced beneath Hartlepool and gypsum near Darlington. The <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> forms a broken west-facing scarp running from the western edge of Sunderland southwards through Houghton-le-Spring and Hetton-le-Hole to Coxhoe where its outcrop is offset to the west by the Butterknowle Fault. English Nature has defined this part of the county east of the scarp where the sequence is exposed at or near the surface, as the 'Durham <b>Magnesian</b> <b>Limestone</b> Plateau' in its assessment of 'character areas'. The occurrence of gypsum and anyhdrite reflects the extreme nature of the evaporation of the shallow Zechstein Sea on occasion though such evaporites are economically valuable. They also present constraints on development as ongoing subterranean solution of these deposits causes occasional catastrophic ground collapse. Similar solution in Palaeogene times has created 'collapse breccias' of overlying strata.|$|R
