Virus appeared to pass to the brain from the nasal, tonsil and pharyngeal regions by the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve.

Even in a country like Great Britain the more exotic types may be seen in these days when air travel has brought the remotest parts of the tropics within one or two days ' travelling time of North-western Europe. They may be classified into two main groups (Rhodes, 1948) : A.

40|$|Background: Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 5 (BoHV- 5) is {{a member}} of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae responsible for <b>meningo-encephalitis</b> in young cattle. The first case of bovine <b>meningo-encephalitis</b> associated with a herpesvirus infection was reported in Australia. The current geographical distribution of BoHV- 5 infection is mainly restricted to South America, especially Brazil and Argentina. Outbreaks of BoHV- 5 are regularly observed in Argentina suggesting the circulation of the virus in the bovine population. Results: Seventeen field strains of BoHV- 5 isolated from 1984 to now were confirmed by differential PCR and subjected to restriction endonuclease analysis (REA). Viral DNA was cleaved with BstEII which allows the differentiation among subtypes a, b and non a, non b. According to the REA with BstEII, only one field strain showed a pattern similar to the Argentinean A 663 strain (prototype of BoHV- 5 b). All other isolates showed a clear pattern similar to the Australian N 569 strain (prototype of BoHV- 5 a) consistent with the subtypes observed in Brazil, the other South-American country where BoHV- 5 is known to be prevalent. The genomic region of subtype b responsible for the distinct pattern was determined and amplified by PCR; specifically a point mutation was identified in glycoprotein B gene, on the BstEII restriction site, which generates the profile specific of BoHV- 5 b.
