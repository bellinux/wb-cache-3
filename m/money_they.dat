5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of <b>money,</b> <b>they</b> frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and <b>money.</b> <b>They</b> laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am {{to prevent it from}} falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E

60|$|Considering men in {{relation}} to money, there are three kinds whom I dislike: men who have more <b>money</b> than <b>they</b> can spend; men who have more <b>money</b> than <b>they</b> do spend; and men who spend more <b>money</b> than <b>they</b> have. Of the three varieties, I believe I have the least liking for the first. But, as a man, I liked Spencer Grenville North pretty well, although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions-- I've forgotten exactly how many.|$|R

5|$|Milk met Scott Smith, 18 {{years his}} junior, and began another relationship. Milk and Smith {{returned}} to San Francisco, {{where they lived}} on <b>money</b> <b>they</b> had saved.

5|$|The Klondike's {{choice of}} {{programming}} earned it a negative reputation, and Towne Cinema {{was unable to}} run the Klondike profitably. The company sought buyers for the theatre as early as 1976, asking $600,000. But, despite all of the theatre's problems under Towne Cinema, {{it is unlikely that}} it would have been returned to its original use without the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> poured into its renovation. Their efforts to restore the building are a significant reason why the Princess is a cinema today.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} effectively illegalised the ROIA {{and led to}} {{the immediate}} release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924.|$|E
5|$|The real Brian {{is ready}} to go home but Stewie admits that he already gambled away their return tickets. Brian admits that he cannot call for help after taking money from Lois.

Preparing to leave, the duplicated pair sitting nearby accidentally take the empty backpack from the unlucky pair, while the real Stewie takes the duplicated pair's backpack, which is full of money.|$|E
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|A Thousand Leaves is the 10th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} May 12, 1998, by DGC Records. A Thousand Leaves was the band's first album recorded at their own studio in Lower Manhattan, which was built with the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> had made at the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. Since the band had an unlimited {{amount of time to}} work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisational tracks that were developed unevenly. Three highly experimental extended plays, , , and , were recorded simultaneously with the album.|$|E
5|$|Before 1984, {{all three}} contestants {{received}} their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed {{in order to}} make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash consolation prize is provided by Geico.|$|E
5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of <b>money</b> <b>they</b> had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E
40|$|Money {{is a very}} {{attractive}} item for any persons to be pursued. In the sociological perspective, the poverty {{is a function of}} a social system where money is within it.

Poverty is seen as a theology where people can be poor at certain time and situation...|$|R

5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> would receive to fight them.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Rush won {{the title}} of Champion of the Clarence from Prospero Coulon. The two men then joined forces as a rowing team and competed at the Anniversary Day Regatta of 26 January 1870 held at Port Jackson. Rush and Coulon contested several events, notably winning the single-scull and pair-oar races, and while the prize <b>money</b> <b>they</b> {{received}} was modest, their performances were noted by Sydney rowers who quickly challenged them to private matches for large stakes. Rush and Coulon remained in Sydney for some months after the January regatta, and continued to win as a team.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Heyer {{followed}} {{her husband to}} Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with <b>money</b> <b>they</b> borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide {{the bulk of the}} family's earnings with her writing.|$|E

5|$|In March 1989, he {{was sold}} to Hull City for £200,000 (at the time a Hull record). This move reunited him with manager Eddie Gray. Leeds spent the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> {{received}} {{from the sale of}} Swan on bringing Gordon Strachan in from Manchester United. Leeds would go on to win the league title in 1991–92 under Wilkinson, with Strachan playing a large part in the success. However Swan and Hull did not find success; Gray used Swan in defence, and lost his job in the summer following a run of just one win in twelve games.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix {{on the kitchen floor}} of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the <b>money</b> <b>they</b> offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
