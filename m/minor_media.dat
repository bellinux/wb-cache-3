500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Last Rites/Loved to Deth", {{consists}} of two parts. The first part, [...] "Last Rites", is an instrumental segue featuring a piano intro, a reinterpretation of J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Mustaine explained that [...] "Loved to Deth" [...] was his [...] "version of a love song" [...] to his girlfriend at the time. The title track was inspired by The Punisher comic book, and tells of a paid serial assassin. The song caused <b>minor</b> <b>media</b> controversy when a man posted an online request to a radio station to play the tune, saying it was [...] "good music to go postal and kill {{a bunch of people}} to". The man was later arrested under suspicion of commencing a potential shooting spree. [...] "The Skull Beneath the Skin" [...] was developed under the working title [...] "Self Destruct". The song graphically describes a horrendous human torture, while also probing into the occult and black magic. Mustaine pointed that the creation of Vic Rattlehead was explained throughout that track. [...] "Rattlehead", according to Dave Mustaine, was dedicated to the band's mascot and their fans.|$|E

In their press release, LucasArts president Simon Jeffery stated that [...] "the Sam & Max sequel, much like the recently announced , perfectly complements LucasArts' renowned adventure game legacy and lends further support to the company's commitment to investing in and developing more of our original properties".

The game was officially announced for Windows at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention on May 12, 2003, where the full title Sam & Max: Freelance Police was revealed. LucasArts reaffirmed the projected early 2004 release date at the convention. The game's trailer was also presented at E3, reintroducing the characters and confirming that the original voice actors for Sam and Max, Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson respectively, were set to reprise their roles. Over the following months, several <b>minor</b> <b>media</b> releases were made, revealing new information regarding the game's developmental direction and graphical style. The game's release was highly anticipated by journalists in the video game industry, who published various previews and interviews with the development team, particularly with lead designer Michael Stemmle, one of the original designers of Sam & Max Hit the Road.|$|E

500|$|Chicago-based Environmental Systems Design, Inc. {{will provide}} mechanical, plumbing, {{electrical}} and fire protection engineering, {{as well as}} teledata, audio/visual, security systems and acoustics. Langan International {{will be responsible for}} geotechnical engineering as well as some ground level site work such as transportation engineering and parking, including the design of the proposed 3,000–4,700 car underground parking garage that will be located near, but not under the tower for terrorism reasons. Langan also designed the tower's foundation, which {{has to be able to}} support the tower despite the less than optimal subsurface conditions, such as soft rock and permeable coral, which could cause the piles to settle. Thornton Tomasetti has provided the structural engineering for two of the previous world's tallest building title holders, the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, and the Taipei 101 in Taiwan, as well as the under construction Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, which will be the second tallest building in China after completion. Saudi Binladin Group is the largest construction firm in the Middle East, with over 35,000 workers and hundreds of projects. They recently constructed the topped-out [...] Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower in Mecca, which is the tallest building in Saudi Arabia and third tallest in the world, as well as the largest skyscraper in the world by floor area and volume. Aside from buildings, the firm has also constructed many major infrastructure projects, such as the King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport expansion and the [...] six lane Al Qassim Expressway through Saudi Arabia. Saudi Binladin Group is owned by the family of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As a result, it has sparked some <b>minor</b> <b>media</b> buzz. When asked his thoughts about this in an interview, Adrian Smith simply stated that they are the largest construction firm in the Middle East, most significant work in Saudi Arabia was done by them, and that it is a very large family that shouldn't be stereotyped by one of its members. Furthermore, in January 2012, New York City judge George B. Daniels ruled that no charges could be filed against SBG to repay the victims of 9/11 as there is no evidence of the construction firm financially supporting bin Laden after he was removed as a shareholder following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.|$|E

5000|$|A mature leafcutter colony {{can contain}} more than 8 million ants (the maximum {{size of the}} colony varies between species), mostly sterile female workers.

Acromyrmex ants exhibit {{a high degree of}} biological polymorphism, four castes being present in established colonies - minims (or [...] "garden ants"), <b>minors,</b> <b>mediae,</b> and majors. Majors are also known as soldiers or dinergates. Each caste has a specific function within the colony. Acromyrmex ants are less polymorphic than the other genus of leafcutter ants Atta, meaning comparatively less difference in size exists from the smallest to largest types of Acromymex. The high degree of polymorphism in this genus is also suggestive of its high degree of advancement.|$|R
