40|$|Packaging as {{a medium}} of {{communication}} and information products {{is characterized by the}} presence of visual elements of packaging that is capable to build the image of the product in the minds of target consumers. Packaging of visual element consists a logo as the brand and PDP (<b>Main</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Panel)</b> consists of typefaces, colors, shapes, and layout (layout). Communication and information the product presented through packaging visual elements can be creating identity of product in the minds of consumers. Design packaging serves to differentiate one product with another similar product on the market. 'Awani' is a brand of culinary product is offered as typical Balinese souvenirs to tourists. Packaging using the motif Poleng as visual appeal of the packaging elements. This motif is used as a tool to communicate the image of the product 'Awani' in the minds of target consumers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the forms of representation of motive poleng as the Awani’s creative packaging design concept and, to know the implied meaning of representation Poleng motif on Awani’s packaging design. The first step is to classify and identify the visual elements in packaging design and then analyze the forms of representation poleng motif in the visual elements of ‘Awani’ packaging. The next stage of analyzing the meaning representation Poleng motif is using qualitative descriptive methods with interpretive semiotic approach. Semiotic approach is to examine the text for the sign and its meaning interpreted through code (decoding) and the sign behind the text. Contribution of this study is to provide theoretical knowledge about the relationship between design concepts in the determination of visual elements in forming the image of product packaging. So it can be a reference for the small industrial sector in communicating the product's image through the minds of the target consumer packaging design...|$|E

It depicts St. George on horseback, fighting with the dragon. The saint has pierced the dragon with his lance, which is broken, and has drawn his sword and holds it aloft to strike the dragon. The dragon is reeling under the attack but has managed to pierce the horse with one of its claws, and the horse is rearing. On the ground, baby dragons peer out from cavities and the ground is littered with human bones.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the performance of}} rats in a delayed non matching-to-position task using an automated visual memory apparatus. A new testing procedure {{has been used to}} restrict the problem of motor mediation. In this procedure the rat must first activate a sample stimulus (either the right or left visual <b>display</b> <b>panel).</b> It has then to respond to one of three retractable levers that were extended throughout the retention delay before it can receive a reinforcer (reward pellet vs. nothing) for a response made to either one of the two visual stimulus <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> A response on the levers was independent from a response on the stimulus <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> These retractable levers were set in a compartment that protruded 15 cm from the back wall below the <b>display</b> <b>panels,</b> forming a platform which the rat needed to climb in order to reach the stimulus <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> By requiring the rat to respond to one of these levers the rat could not linger by the correct <b>display</b> <b>panel.</b> Furthermore, as the rat could not anticipate the location of the response lever which would permitted the trial to continue nor the duration of the retention delays before a lever press allow access to the choice stimuli, the rat could not position itself by the correct panel during the retention delay. Rats were able to learn this task readily and perform above chance over delays of up to 16 sec, even though the task demands were likely to restrict any motor mediation strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of new displays in modern vehicles sets {{the challenge to}} revisit {{the design of the}} conventional display units, toward more simplified appearance. The present study aims to evaluate the usefulness of the information provided to the drivers by the conventional vehicle display units, in order to trace directions that would lead to a simplification of the future <b>display</b> <b>panels.</b> Based on the concept of operative images, two working hypotheses were formulated: (i) the experienced drivers have developed an operative image-reference (OI-R) for the <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> of their own vehicle(s), reflecting the relative importance they attribute to the information emitted by the various <b>displays</b> of the <b>panel,</b> and (ii) the experienced drivers' drawings of the <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> of their own vehicle will be guided by their OI-R for it - providing therefore traces of the content of their OI-R, while the less experienced drivers' drawings will be closer to the actual <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> of their own vehicle. The method of drawing from memory was used to obtain traces of the operative images of both experienced and less experienced non-professional drivers. The obtained 335 drawings were compared to the actual <b>display</b> <b>panels,</b> as to their overall resemblance and to specific features. The results of the data analysis are in accordance to our working hypotheses. Considering the main features of the experienced drivers' OI-R, directions for the simplification of the appearance of conventional display units are proposed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society...|$|R

The plasma panel sen-sor (PPS) is a variant of micropattern gas radiation detectors. PPS components are non-reactive and intrinsically radiation-hard materials, such as glass substrates, metal electrodes and inert gas mixtures. Plasma <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> used as detectors were tested with cosmic ray muons, beta rays and gamma rays, protons, and thermal neutrons.
