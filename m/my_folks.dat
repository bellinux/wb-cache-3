Ev Strupper, arguably {{the best of the}} four, was partially deaf; because of his deafness, he called the signals instead of the team's quarterback. When [...] "Strupe" [...] tried out for the team, he noticed that the quarterback shouted the signals every time he was to carry the ball.

[...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." ...|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. <b>My</b> <b>folks</b> offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But <b>my</b> <b>folks</b> and I decided that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E

500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because <b>my</b> <b>folks</b> in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

His family, impoverished by the Great Depression, moved to King County, Washington, when he was two years old. There they tended dairy cows, kept laying hens, had a small orchard, and made cedar-wood shingles,. At the age of seven, Snyder was laid up for four months by an accident. [...] "So <b>my</b> <b>folks</b> brought me piles of books from the Seattle Public Library," [...] he {{recalled}} in interview, [...] "and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious — I figure that accident changed my life. At the end of four months, I had read more than most kids do by the time they're eighteen. And I didn't stop."

In 1966, when he was three years old, his parents divorced. Along with his two half-sisters, Julie and Jenny, he was raised by his mother and stepfather in Grand Rapids. Each summer, he would visit his father in Hollywood for two weeks, a time during which the two would bond. [...] He idolized his father, and recalled, [...] "Those trips to California were the happiest, most carefree, the-world-is-a-beautiful-oyster times I'd ever experienced." [...] In 1974, when Kiedis was twelve years old, he moved to Hollywood to live with his father full-time. His father was a struggling actor who sold drugs, which {{had a significant impact on}} Kiedis, as the two would often use marijuana and cocaine together. Kiedis accidentally tried heroin for the first time at age 14, mistaking the substance for cocaine. Through his father Blackie, Kiedis, who worked under the stage name of Cole Dammett, landed his first acting role appearing as Sylvester Stallone's character's son in the 1978 film, F.I.S.T. That same year he would land two more acting jobs, one being on an ABC Afterschool Special and the other an appearance in the film, Jokes <b>My</b> <b>Folks</b> Never Told Me.|$|E
