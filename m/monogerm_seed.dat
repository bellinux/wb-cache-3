50|$|By the 1940s, {{progress}} {{was being made}} toward mechanically separating multigerm seed into segmented seed, allowing a reduction in labor-intensive agricultural thinning. Research was being made toward a true <b>monogerm</b> <b>seed</b> by Russian refugees Viacheslav F. Savitsky, Helen Kharetchko Savitsky, and Utah native Forrest Vern Owen. U-I and other sugar companies created the Beet Sugar Development Foundation, with a laboratory in West Jordan. Together with the USDA's Division of Sugar Plant Investigations, they financed a search for naturally occurring monogerm seeds. Two such plants were found, both in Oregon. These were named SLC Monogerm 101 and SLC Monogerm 107. The first commercial monogerm sugar beet resistant to the Curly Top blight was launched in 1955 by U-I, and by 1958 it was in large-scale production.|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} changes in {{technology}} of planting sugar beet. In the Czech Republic, sugar beet is {{the most widely used}} raw material for sugar production since the mid- 19 th century. The sugar beet production and production of sugar {{are one of the most}} important segments of agro-food complex, but nowadays sugar beet is also strategic crop of which feed and fertilizers are being made. It is also a source of renewable energy in the form of anhydrous ethyl alcohol and stillage to be processed in biogas plants. Sugar produced in the Czech Republic has a similar quality to the best producers in the EU. In the last two years, Czech growers achieved yields of about 80 t. ha- 1. The yield is constantly increasing, annually by an average of more than two tons. Ploughing has always been a priority during the processing of sugar beet. In the course of time, is rather recomended on heavy soils to use ploughless technology. Nowadays genetically <b>monogerm</b> <b>seed</b> varieties are being used for sowing. The seeds are sown for finite distances by precision seeders. Harvesting is carried out by self-propelled sugar beet harvesters with high-capacity containers. In the Czech Republic there have been only seven still functioning sugar factories, which belong to five major companies. The strongest market position has the company - Sugar mills and Distilleries TTD a. s...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effects of steckling weight and planting density on sugar beet monogerm (Cv. 9597) seed quantitative and qualitative characteristics, this experiment was carried out in Ardabil Agricultural Research Station-Iran (38 ° 30 'N and 48 ° 30 'E) during 2 years (2002 - 2003). In the study, steckling weight (main-plot) in three levels including 100, 100 - 200 and 200 - 300 g and planting density (sub-plot) in three levels including 40, 50 and 60 cm were used in a split-plot experiment based on the RCBD (Randomized Complete Blocks Design) with 5 replications. The measured characteristics were morphological and qualitative (velocity and uniformity of germination) characters, seed size distribution and <b>monogerm</b> <b>seed</b> percentage. According to the results of the experiment, the effect of planting density on the auxiliary branches No. and seed yield was significant at the probability levels of 1 and 5 %, respectively. Seed yield increased by 43 % as planting density was increased from 65 x 40 to 65 x 60 cm. The increase in steckling weight led to the increase in standard seed portion (with 3. 5 - 4. 5 mm in diameter), germinable standard seed yield (11 %) and decrease in germination velocity and germination uniformity; and increase in planting density was accompanied by increase in > 4. 5 mm seed percentage, velocity and uniformity of germination and decrease in germinable standard seed yield. Eventually, the highest seed yield (1208 kg ha - 1) was obtained by using steckling weight of 200 - 300 g and planting density of 65 x 60 cm. </p...|$|E
40|$|Large changes {{introduced}} in the sugar beet production technology in the Vojvodina Province over last 40 years resulted in changes in the etiology and harmfulness of different agents of sugar beet root diseases. Improvements in cultivation practices reduced the harmfulness of some diseases while increased the harmfulness of others. Some disease agents became obsolete, but others gained importance. New agents of root diseases were found. The most frequent damages, persisting {{over long periods of}} time were caused by seedling damping-off, Fusarium root rot, charcoal root rot, parasitic (Rhizomania) and non-parasitic root bearding. The parasitic damping-off caused by several fungal species but most frequently by Phoma betae occurred at the time when multigerm seeds were used in combination with extensive cultural practices. The agents of seedling diseases completely lost their significance as the consequence of switching to fungicide - treated <b>monogerm</b> <b>seeds,</b> earlier planting and improved soil tillage. In the period of intensive use of agricultural chemicals, seedling damping-off occurred frequently due to the phytotoxic action of chemicals (insecticides, herbicides and mineral fertilizers). In some years, frosts caused damping- off of sugar beet seedlings on a large scale in the Vojvodina Province. Poor sugar beet germination and emergence were frequently due to spring droughts. Sometimes they were due to strong winds. The occurrence of Fusarium root rot and charcoal root rot intensified on poor soils. Fusariosis symptoms were exhibited as plant wilting and different forms of root rot. In recent years root tip rot has occurred frequently in the first part of the growing season causing necrosis and dying of plants. Lateral roots tended to proliferate from the healthy tissue, giving the root a bearded appearance similar to Rhizomania. Fusarium oxysporum was the most frequent agent of this fusariosis. F. graminearum, F. equiseti, F. solani have also been identified in recent years as the agent of root rot, but its importance was much lower. Charcoal root rot and plant wilting (Macrophomina phaseolina) have caused extensive damages in sugar beets, especially under the conditions of severe drought and high temperatures in summer. In some years, it was the dominant agent of root rot. Mixed infections caused by fungi from the genera Fusarium and M. phaseolina were encountered frequently. The extent of damage caused by these diseases was reduced by improved pro- duction technology. Rhizomania of sugar beet (caused by beet necrotic yellow vein virus) was identified in Serbia in the 1970 s. Results of recent investigations have shown that BNYVV is widespread in Vojvodina, since the virus was found on 36, 7 % (24, 674 ha) of acreages from 67, 213 ha of total sugar beet acreages inspected on incidence of BNYVV in the period from 1997 to 2004 year. In the last few years, the occurrence of Rhizoctonia root rot (Rhizoctonia solani) was registered in some localities in Vojvodina...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Studies were {{conducted}} on the causes of low germination of <b>monogerm</b> sugarbeet <b>seed</b> grown in western Oregon. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} identification and measurement of endogenous inhibitors as related to the germination and vigor. Both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods were applied to examine the organic substances in the aqueous seedball extracts as influenced by environmental factors during maturation. Effects of exogenous factors such as harvest time after anthesis, liming of the soil and post harvest drying temperature on the subsequent germination were examined. Attempts were made to improve germination potential of a given seed lot by pre-germination treatments. Effects of soaking, leaching and drying upon germination were compared and examined. Leaching studies were further expanded to measure the change of inhibitor content at various leaching intervals and to relate concentrations to germination and vigor. Varying concentrations of gibberellic acid (potassium salt) were applied to germinating seed to examine effects on seed dormancy. Five phenolic compounds and oxalic acid as the soluble and insoluble salt were shown to be present in the sugarbeet fruit. Among the five known phenolic substances, ferulic acid was most inhibitory to germination. Oxalic acid at various levels of concentration did not influence germination although oxalic acid did inhibit the seedling growth at relatively low concentrations. Among four sugarbeet seed samples tested, a low germinating lot (variety 4426) was shown to contain the least amount of oxalic acid, however, ferulic acid content of this lot was considerably higher than the others. It was concluded that oxalic acid was not involved in dormancy of the seed samples tested. Among the several pre-germination treatments tested to improve germination potential of the given varieties, complete drying after leaching of seed samples showed the best response. Germination potential of the monogerm varieties used in these studies greatly increased by drying them completely after leaching. Vigor as measured by length of seedlings was markedly improved. Simple leaching did not improve germination. Optimum leaching time for best germination of the varieties tested was from 12 to 20 hours...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Maturation {{rates of}} <b>monogerm</b> sugar beet <b>seed</b> grown in Western Oregon were {{measured}} quantitatively to determine attainment of maximum seed development and germination. Seed was collected at various intervals after anthesis from two hybrid varieties representing the extremes in resistance (hard bolting) and susceptibility (easy bolting) to seedstalk development. The effects of harvesting procedures on seed development and germination were compared {{at the various}} stages of maturity using simulated direct and windrow methods. Maturity as determined by maximum germination and dry seed weight occurred at 40, 43 and 45 days after anthesis for the three years studied. Heat units accumulated from anthesis to maturity remained constant for all three years, even though 1965 was much warmer. It was concluded that the seed on sugar beet plants should be mature after 900 heat units are attained or 45 days after peak anthesis. The primary factor lowering the germination potential of mature seed was the occurrence of underdeveloped seeds, Chemical inhibitors in the sugar beet fruits as measured by firm ungerminated seeds may also reduce the germination for seed collected prior to maturity. Some seeds were capable of germination 20 days after anthesis. Plants and seeds of the hard bolting variety remained green throughout the maturation period, whereas easy bolting plants reached senesence and shattered. Plant appearance and percent moisture content were {{not found to be}} reliable indicators of sugar beet seed maturity. Maximum germination and dry seed weight were attained at nearly the same levels regardless of harvesting method used. Sugar beets cut prematurely continued seed development while drying on the windrowed plant, but also contained more substances inhibitory to germination. It was determined that germination, dry seed weight, heat unit accumulation and days from anthesis to maturity could all be used to estimate the optimum stage to harvest sugar beets for seed...|$|R
40|$|In {{common with}} the {{majority}} of crop species, in sugar beet nutrition nitrogen is an important element due to its role in sucrose utilization and plant growth. Application of precision agriculture, in order to apply the right amount of input at the right time in the right area, is appropriate to decrease chemical use and increase plant growth. Problem statement: More often farmers apply fertilizers with low efficiency, low uniformity and high price such as spinner spreader, boom spreader or application with planting machines simultaneously. Fertigation can reduce labor cost and may improve uniformity, effectiveness and timeliness of application. Approach: The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine spatial variability of sugar beet performance affected by urea fertigation as well as established a management strategy based on spatial variability of tubers and soil total N. This study was conducted in Fesaran village, Isfahan Province of Iran and limited to sugar beet (<b>monogerm</b> <b>seed).</b> Urea applied through sprinklers. Soil samples were taken to determine soil total N as well as sugar beet tubers samples to specify yield. Results of soil and crop analysis were used to produce spatial variability maps through GS + and ArcGIS 9. 2 software. Semivariogram results were used to perform an ordinary kriging to obtain interpolated values of selected variables from the sample points through and across the study area. Results: It was found that there was a low spatial variability of soil total N and yield which indicates that the soil has a homogenous total N as well as homogenous yield through and across the field. Yield variability map of sugar beet properties demonstrated that the higher yield was seen in the southern part of the study area where laterals were closer to pump. Conclusion: The results of urea fertigation through sprinklers showed pipeline layout and pump station position impact on variability of sugar beet properties...|$|E
