5|$|After the {{division}} arrived in England, Ernest Down was posted to India {{to oversee the}} formation of the 44th Indian Airborne Division, and was replaced by Major General Roy Urquhart. In September 1944, for Operation <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> in the Netherlands, the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade was attached to {{the division}}. Following <b>Market</b> <b>Garden,</b> fewer than 2,200 men from the 10,000 that were sent to the Netherlands returned to the British lines. Having suffered such severe casualties, the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded, with its surviving men being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade. The division then went through a period of reorganisation, but had still not fully recovered {{by the end of the}} war, due to the acute shortage of manpower throughout the British Army in 1944-1945. Still under strength in May 1945, it was sent to Norway to disarm the German army of occupation; returning to Britain in November 1945 where the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> {{plays in the}} livelihood strategies of rural-urban migrants. It {{contributes to the literature}} on <b>market</b> <b>gardening,</b> livelihood strategies and migration by positioning <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> as a highly flexible and adaptable mechanism for managing the rural-urban transition among households with few labour alternatives. Such perspective elevates <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> from simply being a land use category to being an active instrument in the management of rural-urban migration processes. The expanding urban centre of Kapit, Sarawak, Malaysia is used as a case study of a rapidly expanding small town in a predominantly rural domain. <b>Market</b> <b>gardening</b> emerges as an important source of income for both individuals and households as rural-urban migrants negotiate the transition between farming and urban settlement. Many rural-urban migrants adopt <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> or associated <b>market</b> selling as their first employment in urban centres. First generation migrants often have low off-farm skills which limit their ability to take on alternative occupations. While a rise in <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> activity is enabled by a growth in demand for fresh vegetables, in the context of Sarawak it is also heavily influenced by the involvement of the state that actively encourages participation, provides advice to farmers and offers subsidies. The expansion of roads from rural to urban areas also {{plays an important role in}} improving market gardeners access to urban markets, as well as their access to material inputs. At the same time, increased access has heightened competition by attracting new entrants to urban vegetable markets. Interviews with 10 sellers and 30 market gardeners from Kapit were conducted in 2004. In contrast to <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> in larger centres documented in the literature, this small isolated town case identifies market gardeners as typically middle-aged, rural-urban migrant women with limited education and employment skills other than subsistence farming. <b>Market</b> <b>gardening</b> and associated selling is adopted because they are unable to acquire alternative employment to support their household and children’s education. As such, <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> in the urban setting is a logical extension of the woman’s role as the primary farmer in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|The <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> {{practices}} of Sydney 's culturally diverse inhabitants {{have long been}} neglected in the plans for growth of this aspiring global city. Yet, in providing fresh food {{for the city and}} local employment, practices such as <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> arguably contribute not only to Sydney's globalizing demographic and cultural fabric, but also to the city's environmental sustainability. Encroaching urbanization, however, currently threatens over 50 percent of the <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> on Sydney's peri-urban fringe suggesting that the current planning vision neglects this productive aspect of the city. In the face of urban encroachment discourses of heritage have been mobilised around the <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) growers in the city's South-West. Exhibitions on the histories of these growers have sought to highlight the place of CALD migrant farmers within the city's historical landscape and their role in shaping the city physically and culturally. The extent to which a heritage framing will serve to protect what is a 'living' tradition of <b>market</b> <b>gardening,</b> however, is less than certain. While they continue to contribute to the city's fresh food supply, the alternative land use {{practices of}} these groups such as <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> are often (too easily) dismissed as marginal or periphery {{to the life of the}} city. Recognition through prevailing heritage discourses which privilege built form risk framing the practice of <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> by CALD growers as essentially an antiquated tradition that is only ever an ephemeral element of urban growth. More broadly conceived notions of 'heritage' are possible however -ones that acknowledge that all inhabitants have a stake in the city, environmentally, economically and culturally. In drawing attention to Sydney's 'diverse urban isms' this paper explores the historical role of <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> in 'growing' the city and their potential contributions to sustaining Sydney into the future. 13 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{operation}} {{had been a}} failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included developing {{a new version of}} the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E

5|$|Once in Britain the {{division}} {{was attached to}} U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, which commanded all American airborne formations, and which in turn {{became part of the}} First Allied Airborne Army when it was formed on 21 August, under the command of Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton. Although attached to XVIII Airborne Corps, {{the division}} was not chosen to participate in Operation <b>Market</b> <b>Garden,</b> a large-scale airborne operation intended to seize several bridges through the Netherlands to allow the Allied armies to bypass the Rhine river and enter Germany. The 17th was passed over in favour of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions because it had only recently arrived in the European Theater and was considered to be unprepared logistically as it was still collecting its combat equipment. The division, now with Colonel Edson Raff's 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment under commanda veteran unit which had fought in Normandy under command of the 82nd Airborne Divisionremained in England as a theater reserve during <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> and its aftermath, as the Allied armies continued their advance towards Germany.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in Niamey (capital city of Niger) to explore the <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> periurban system. This {{activity}} is an option to minimize the risk of urban food insecurity in the Republic of Niger. In Niamey, you have two traditional areas to practise the <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> production: Gamkalle and Yantala. The investigations study the area of Gamkalle. This study revealed more than 600 <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> producers in Gamkalle. 50 producers of Gamkalle have been interviewed. These producers predominantly belong to the ethnic group “Zarma” and <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> is their main economic activity. The principal period of production is during the dry season, the producers cultivate lettuce, cabbage, tomato, sweet pepper, beetroot, celery, carrot, parsley. Despite the higher costs notably in particular for input, the incomes generated by this activity are very high ($ 2805. 23 /year/acre). In conclusion, <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> presents an opportunity for urban dwellers to increase and diversify their incomes and obtain food security. Nevertheless, there are many constraints to develop this production: land tenure security, pollution by industrial production and access to quality seeds, pesticides and fertilizers.

5|$|Operation <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> was an {{airborne}} assault by three {{divisions in the}} Netherlands in September 1944, including the British 1st and the American 82nd and 101st, to secure key bridges and towns along the expected Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, 1st Airborne, supported by the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting an easy advance, XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, to reach the airborne force at Arnhem within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, <b>Market</b> <b>Garden,</b> had been conducted.|$|E
5|$|The M21 {{served on}} the Western Front, seeing action in Normandy and in {{southern}} France, before later being used during the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of Belgium, Operation <b>Market</b> <b>Garden,</b> and the invasion of Germany from the west.

5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat {{for the failure of}} <b>Market</b> <b>Garden.</b> Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E
