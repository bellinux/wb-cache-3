5|$|The station's {{full-length}} <b>mezzanine</b> allows crossover {{from any}} of the station's four staircases from each platform, with a total of eight staircases from the <b>mezzanine</b> to platform level. There is no direct indoor access to the Queens Center Mall's entrance at the northwest corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue from the <b>mezzanine.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in {{the ceiling}} of the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the <b>mezzanine</b> to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the <b>mezzanine</b> floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing <b>mezzanine</b> passes over the unused space.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the <b>mezzanine</b> allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the <b>mezzanine.</b> Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The <b>mezzanine</b> narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the <b>mezzanine</b> directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the <b>mezzanine</b> did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mezzanines</b> {{may serve}} {{a wide variety}} of functions. Industrial <b>mezzanines,</b> such as those used in warehouses, may be {{temporary}} or semi-permanent structures.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mezzanines</b> {{help to make}} a high-ceilinged space {{feel more}} {{personal}} and less vast, and can create additional floor space. <b>Mezzanines,</b> however, may have lower-than-normal ceilings due to their location. The term [...] "mezzanine" [...] does not imply a function, as <b>mezzanines</b> {{can be used for}} a wide array of purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{lines are}} {{connected}} by passageways and <b>mezzanines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Located on the <b>mezzanine</b> level, Rebar—the hotel bar—opened on April 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum was}} {{designed}} in a French inspired Egyptian Revival style by the architects Antoine Nahas and Pierre Leprince Ringuet, and built with Lebanese ochre limestone. It comprises a basement, a ground floor, a <b>mezzanine</b> floor and a terrace; the central block {{is covered by}} a glass roof, above the <b>mezzanine,</b> giving natural overhead light.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} tracks and two side {{platforms}} here. In between the local tracks and the express tracks, there are trackway walls. The station {{has a full}} length <b>mezzanine,</b> but as the fare control and booth area {{are at the center}} of the <b>mezzanine,</b> crossover is available only at the easternmost staircase.|$|E
50|$|The {{library with}} its {{teakwood}} <b>mezzanines</b> and catwalks {{is one of}} the best-maintained areas in the college. The teakwood <b>mezzanines</b> are the extra reading and storage areas in the library the library furniture has been designs keeping in mind the exact space provision for the storage. The library is divided into bays, which are partitioned with the storage cupboards.|$|R

5|$|A second {{improvement}} project involves {{building a}} pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern <b>mezzanine</b> of Metro Center {{with the western}} <b>mezzanine</b> of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection would {{reduce the number of}} passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remains unfunded.|$|E
5|$|Porter had a {{refreshment}} vendor {{outside the}} fare gates on the <b>mezzanine</b> level. Unlike most MBTA stations, Porter has public restrooms.|$|E
5|$|Porter {{has five}} levels: the street-level entrances, the below-grade {{commuter}} platforms, the fare <b>mezzanine,</b> and two subway platform levels underground.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mezzanines</b> are {{commonly}} used in Modern architecture, which places a heavy emphasis on light and space.|$|R
2500|$|Both <b>mezzanines</b> have BMT-style {{directional}} mosaics tablets {{that says}} [...] "To Manhattan" [...] and [...] "To Coney Island." ...|$|R
50|$|In this station, all fare {{controls}} are at platform level {{and there are}} no <b>mezzanines,</b> crossovers, or crossunders.|$|R
5|$|This {{station is}} unusual in that its <b>mezzanine</b> is split in two halves. This is because at this location, Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway cross under Queens Boulevard but over the Queens Boulevard Line tracks; the <b>mezzanine</b> is {{at the level of}} Union Turnpike, one half on either side, with no {{connection}} between the two outside of fare control.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the increased patronage expected after {{the beginning of}} Second Avenue Subway service, the MTA built four new entrances {{at the intersection of}} Third Avenue and 63rd Street, leading to a new <b>mezzanine</b> at the eastern end of the station. Passengers travel between the new <b>mezzanine</b> and the platforms using four high-speed elevators, similar to the layout of several other stations deep underground. These elevators are the most space-efficient means of transporting people. These entrances opened on December 30, 2016. The MTA inaugurated Phase 1 of Second Avenue Subway service on January 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|At East Broadway on the IND Sixth Avenue Line (under Rutgers Street at this station), {{part of a}} two-track {{station was}} built for the IND Worth Street Line under East Broadway, above the {{existing}} line. Most of the constructed portion {{is now part of}} the <b>mezzanine.</b>|$|E
50|$|It resembles other {{elevated}} stations {{along the}} line, with wood <b>mezzanines</b> and no windscreens along the platform edges.|$|R

5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair of stairs to a lower <b>mezzanine.</b> Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (<b>mezzanine,</b> upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|The 1996 artwork here {{is called}} In Memory of The Lost Battalion by Pablo Tauler. It uses nine support beams in the station's <b>mezzanine</b> wrapped in {{different}} materials— including glass, iron, and stainless steel—to honor {{the soldiers who}} served in the 77th Infantry Division during World War I.|$|E
50|$|It resembles other {{elevated}} stations {{along the}} line: it has wood <b>mezzanines</b> and no windscreens along the platform edges.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, The CTA put new station wall signs {{over the}} old blue station wall signs {{in order to better}} direct people to the <b>mezzanines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first and}} third floors feature <b>mezzanines.</b> The store {{was one of the}} first in North Alabama to have elevators, along with central air {{conditioning}} and heat.|$|R
5|$|The Lights at the End of the Tunnel by William Wainwright, a large {{reflective}} mobile in the station's <b>mezzanine.</b> It {{was removed}} in 1986 after a lead weight fell off.|$|E
5|$|There are 3 exits {{leading to}} Lexington Avenue that were built {{as part of}} the {{original}} 1989 station, along with 4 exits to Third Avenue that were built {{as part of the}} Second Avenue Subway. The elevator between the street level and <b>mezzanine</b> was replaced in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the small}} family/chaplain's {{room on the}} third floor, was the servant's room with a corner {{fireplace}} and two windows on the <b>mezzanine</b> floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} at Washington/State {{is part of}} a long continuous platform beneath State Street {{which runs}} from the Jackson station to the Lake station, spanning nearly seven blocks, making it the United States' longest continuous passenger platform. There were two <b>mezzanines</b> with turnstiles for the station: a northern at Randolph shared with the Lake station and a southern at Madison. There are stairs and escalators along State Street between Randolph and Madison to access both <b>mezzanines.</b> Additionally, Washington is equipped with an elevator and was therefore accessible to people with disabilities.|$|R
50|$|If you’re allowed 60 percent lot {{coverage}} and 55 ft in height and the allowable floor {{area is a}} 2.0 FAR and that gives you three-and-a-half floors, {{what do you do}} with the extra height? We pushed that into the living spaces, creating double-height units with <b>mezzanines.</b> And you want that space in the living room and dining room and maybe the main bedroom, but not in the other rooms (kitchens, baths, home office etc). And we were allowed to exclude the <b>mezzanines</b> from the floor area based on memorandums that were circulating in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Concordia Hall is a 23000 m2 {{exhibition}} hall. The first {{trade show}} was hosted in 1966, while {{the upper floors}} were still being constructed. Adjacent to this vast space are two large <b>mezzanines.</b>|$|R
