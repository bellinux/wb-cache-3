5|$|The {{abundance}} of Ypresiomyrma queens collected {{suggests that these}} ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for excavating chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation; their large size and common occurrence in their geographical range would <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> were an important food source {{to a variety of}} birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> browsed on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
5000|$|Knowing what {{to store}} in a seed bank is the {{greatest}} challenge.

5|$|The 2006 FIFA World Cup {{qualification}} process and 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup (hosted in Guatemala) were both huge disasters for El Salvador. In the former {{they received a}} by to the second round where they inched past Bermuda 4–3 on aggregate (2–1, 2–2). In the third round they were drawn into a home–and–away round–robin group with Jamaica, Panama, and the United States. El Salvador finished last in the group with just 4 points from 6 games. In the 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup they failed to advance past the first round after losing against Panama 0–1 and Costa Rica 1–2. This <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> also failed {{to qualify for the}} 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They were coached by Carlos Cavagnaro.|$|E
5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

25|$|Since narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{are usually}} built with smaller radius curves, smaller structure gauges, lighter rails, etc., {{they can be}} substantially less costly to build, equip, and operate than standard gauge or broad gauge railways, particularly in mountainous or difficult terrain.

25|$|Surface {{activity}} {{appears to}} be related to the age and rotation rate of main-sequence stars. Young stars with a rapid rate of rotation exhibit strong activity. By contrast middle-aged, Sun-like stars with a slow rate of rotation show low levels of activity that varies in cycles. Some older stars display almost no activity, which may <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> have entered a lull that is comparable to the Sun's Maunder minimum. Measurements of the time variation in stellar activity can be useful for determining the differential rotation rates of a star.|$|E
