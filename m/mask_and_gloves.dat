500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible was {{published}} by Pantheon Books, an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday division of Random House, and released on June 5, 2007, as a hardcover. In the UK it {{was published}} by the Penguin Group imprint Michael Joseph. An audiobook was released {{at the same time}} featuring the voices of J. Paul Boehmer and Coleen Marlo. Grossman promoted the book by attending book signings in major American cities. In the UK it was promoted by wrapping telephone booths in advertising, in reference to Superman changing outfits in such booths. The cover art, which features photos of stereotypical comic book character clothing like a <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves,</b> by Chip Kidd was called [...] "excellent... sure to attract readers". By contrast, Bryan Hitch's cover art on the British edition, which features hand-drawn illustrations of the book's characters, was called [...] "counter-productive... unnecessary" [...] due to its graphical interpretations of characters that were deliberately written in prose only. The book was short-listed for the 2007 John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize. Work on a film adaption began in 2008 through Strike Entertainment with scripts being written Dan Weiss and Grossman.|$|E

'It is well,' said Madame de Selinville, {{who knew}} that nothing was more {{probable}} than that her brother should be playing the King to his sleep in the medicated <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> that cherished the royal complexion, and, moreover, that Henry was lingering to take his pastime in Italy to the great inconvenience of his kingdom.|$|E

50|$|The {{identity}} of Eric the Red {{was first used}} by Cyclops in X-Men #51 (December 1968). Cyclops pretended to be a mutant supervillain to infiltrate a group of mutants led by Mesmero and a robot pretending to be Magneto, who had captured {{the rest of the}} X-Men. Cyclops' Eric the Red costume included a <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> that redirected his optic blasts so that they were fired from his hands.|$|E
50|$|Human {{rhinovirus}} is most contagious {{during the}} fall and winter months. The virus can live up to 3 hours outside of a human host. Once contracted, a person is most contagious within the first 3 days. Preventative measures such as regular vigorous hand washing with soap and water may aid in avoiding the virus. Avoiding touching the mouth, eyes and nose, the most common entry points for rhinovirus, may also aid in prevention. Droplet precautions, which is a surgical <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves,</b> is the method used in major hospitals.|$|E

Gary [...] "Gee One" [...] Kendall and Randy [...] "DJ Wish One" [...] Bernal were both members of the MindTricks dance crew who were active in the San Francisco Bay Area. Both the MindTricks dance crew and the Three Muskee were friends and associates with each other. Tayag, Brewer, and Larot all later moved to the San Diego area, and what began as an effort to start a Southern California chapter of the MindTricks crew later evolved into Jabbawockeez.|$|R
50|$|In The Amazing Spider-Man #500, Peter has {{a mystical}} {{experience}} where he simultaneously experiences {{the beginning and the}} potential end of his career as Spider-Man. This costume he wears in his final battle is utilitarian, consisting solely of a reversible jacket, <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves.</b> In The Amazing Spider-Man #502, Peter receives the design for this exact costume from Leo Zelinsky, The Super-Hero Tailor. This was in response to his criticism that the hero's usual tight costume is unsanitary for his skin, threatening to cause athlete's foot all over his body.|$|E
50|$|The first Robotman was a {{scientist}} named Robert Crane whose brain was placed inside a robotic body {{after he had}} been fatally shot. Since Crane had to be legally dead for his assailants to be charged with murder, he created a civilian identity as Paul Dennis, accomplished with lifelike face <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves.</b> As Robotman, {{he was a member of}} the World War II-era team, the All-Star Squadron. He also fought crime solo with help from his canine sidekick, Robotdog. His stories were mostly lighthearted in nature, featuring whimsical situations and plenty of comedy relief (usually provided by Robotdog).|$|E

There, Reilly {{encounters}} Peter Parker, who has become bitter and angry following several tragedies. While they initially come to blows, they quickly begin working together, Ben donning his old Spider-Man <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> over his civilian clothes in his first outing. Soon after, Reilly dons a makeshift but more detailed costume, consisting of an all-red suit and mask under a blue sleeveless hoodie with a black spider motif, and is dubbed the [...] "Scarlet Spider" [...] by the press.|$|E
500|$|Lock {{spent several}} months in hospital. He stayed at the Royal Masonic Hospital with Richard Hillary, another Battle of Britain ace. They were {{operated}} on by Archibald McIndoe a famous surgeon. While there, Hillary wrote his memoirs The Last Enemy, {{before his death in}} a flying accident on 8 January 1943. He remembered Lock having Sulfapyridine treatment and being [...] "vociferous". The nurses wore anti-infection <b>masks</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves,</b> <b>and</b> Eric, [...] "with an amiable grin" [...] would curse them for it [...] "from dawn till dusk".|$|R

5000|$|Captain Stomper is Henry's superhero alter-ego, who {{appeared}} {{twice in a}} comic-book. He is attired in a red <b>mask,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves,</b> and blue boots. An image of a hammer {{is placed on the}} middle of his torso. In another appearance, he was attired in a blue super-hero leotard and a light blue cape attached to the back. Denzel comments that Captain Stomper was wearing [...] "blue super underwear", even though it was only half part of the superhero leotard. Captain Stomper has the power is to vigorously stomp to the ground, that causes mass destruction from far distance. It is so powerful, it could even pass through metal.|$|E
5000|$|During his crime-fighting career, Carstairs meets {{a number}} of allies and enemies. Among these is Dan Drekston, a {{reporter}} who threatens to reveal {{the identity of the}} Masked Man unless he can take Barney's place as Carstairs' companion. [...] He also encounters Phantom Man, a.k.a. Lenny Winchester, when he saves Carstairs' life. The Phantom Man is an old man in a blue business suit, fedora, domino <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> (a tribute to Will Eisner's The Spirit). Aphidman (a Spider-Man parody) is another, a high school student named Percy who mistakenly thinks he has superpowers like Spider-Man. [...] Carstairs also meets Maggie Brown, who was blinded by gunfire; after saving her life, Carstairs falls in love with Maggie, although Barney believes Maggie is faking her blindness. Barney also meets Carstairs' sister, Roxy Chicago, a criminal and murderer.|$|E
5000|$|Teeki the Fallen was Enchu's {{right-hand}} {{man and a}} powerful but mysterious foe to Muhyo and Roji. The association had marked him for 800 years or so. He 'meddled' in magic law {{and when he was}} finished, he disappeared into thin air. It was unclear what Teeki was; a ghost or a practitioner turned immortal by forbidden law. Teeki was also the one responsible for the fire inside the Arcanum after Rio followed Muhyo and company out into the forest. He seemed to like to killing and destruction, as he laughed at Mr. Maeda when he set the Arcanum ablaze and wanted to kill Muhyo's group instead of retreating. He was the one to introduce Enchu to Forbidden Magic Law. Teeki wore a four-eyed <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> that had the mark of Forbidden Magic Law on them.|$|E

50|$|Isolation is most {{commonly}} used when a patient {{is known to have}} a contagious (transmissible person-to-person) viral or bacterial illness. Special equipment is used in the management of patients in the various forms of isolation. These {{most commonly}} include items of personal protective equipment (gowns, <b>masks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves)</b> <b>and</b> engineering controls (positive pressure rooms, negative pressure rooms, laminar air flow equipment, and various mechanical and structural barriers). Dedicated isolation wards may be pre-built into hospitals, or isolation units may be temporarily designated in facilities {{in the midst of an}} epidemic emergency.|$|R

Tayag, Brewer, and Larot all later moved to the San Diego area, and what began as an effort to start a Southern California chapter of the MindTricks crew later evolved into Jabbawockeez. [...] "We want you to experience Jabbawockeez as a group and not just follow or be fans of one individual person. There's no lead dancer in our crew. Our philosophy is that when you watch us perform, you have to watch us as a whole... When we put maskson, it's not about who we are or where we came from. We're all one." [...] Jeff [...] "Phi" [...] Nguyen [...] Established in 2003 in San Diego, California, Jabbawockeez is the brainchild of the [...] "Three Musky" [...] who wanted to showcase freestyle dance. The name Jabbawockeez, coined by Joe Larot, was inspired by the fantastical monster from the Lewis Carroll nonsense poem Jabberwocky. The white <b>masks</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> from Phil, Kevin, and Joe's performances as Three Musky were adopted as the visual signature of the group. In San Diego, through Gary's connections, the Jabbawockeez added b-boys Rynan [...] "Kid Rainen" [...] Paguio and Chris [...] "Cristyle" [...] Gatdula to the group. The original seven-member iteration of the Jabbawockeez began {{performing as}} a group in 2004. This lineup consisted of Gary, Randy, Phil, Kevin, Joe, Rynan, and Chris.|$|R

5000|$|Scott Dyleski {{was found}} guilty of all the charges against him: first-degree murder, the special {{circumstance}} of murder in the commission of a first-degree residential burglary, first-degree residential burglary and an enhancement for using a dangerous weapon to bludgeon Vitale. He was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole. He was held in juvenile hall until his 18th birthday on October 30, 2006 (about one month after sentencing) and was then transferred to San Quentin Prison. He was kept out of the general population while his case was evaluated and was then transferred to Kern Valley State Prison several months later. In 2009, the Court of Appeal justices upheld the conviction and noted, [...] "The defendant in this case committed a truly heinous crime. Putting on a dark <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves,</b> and arming himself with a rock and a knife, he invaded the home of a complete stranger to him. Without any provocation, he viciously set upon Pamela Vitale, raining blow after blow on her as she tried to fight him off." [...] The court also noted that even as [...] "Vitale lay motionless and near death, defendant was still not done with her. He put away his rock and pulled out a knife. He pulled Vitale's T-shirt up and used the knife to draw some type of mark or symbol on Vitale's back. He then turned Vitale over and stabbed deep into her midsection, leaving a gaping wound in her abdomen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the details}} change {{somewhat}} over the years, Spider-Man's costume, {{with a few}} notable exceptions, remains fairly consistent. The standard is a form-fitting spandex bodysuit, which {{from the waist down}} is blue, except for mid-calf boots with a black web pattern on a red background. From the waist up, the fabric is a red-and-black web pattern, except for his back, sides, and insides of his upper arms, which are blue. There is a large red spider outline on his back, and a smaller black spider emblem on his chest. The black spider has changed over the years, featuring a spider with slightly smaller feet in the past. The mask has white one-way mirror type lenses rimmed with black. The white portions of the mask's eyes sometimes [...] "squint" [...] when Peter has his eyes partly shut. Whether this is his mask actually changing in response to his eyelids moving, or artistic license, is not clear. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, Spider-Man's eyes change size similar to a camera lens shutter, and a mechanical sound effect can be heard. In addition to covering his entire head, thereby leaving no distinguishing features, the mask also muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. The boots are composed of a thin material that allows Spider-Man's adhering ability to work through the soles of his feet. The boots, <b>mask,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> can be folded up and stored inside a pocket while the remainder of his costume can be worn under his civilian clothes. Modernly, Spider-Man has taken to making and wearing a bulletproof version of this costume.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Acer {{added an}} {{associate}} dentist, Dr. Elizabeth Greenhill. Greenhill told the Palm Beach Post {{that she had}} wanted him to autoclave his dental instruments, though he did routinely steam clean them. She told the paper that Acer did not make any extra effort towards the enforcement of universal precautions, despite CIGNA'S procedural manual for dentists covered this very subject, which included the use of <b>masks</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> while treating patients. Acer used neither, but this was overlooked by CIGNA's dental director, who regularly visited Acer's practice.|$|R

5000|$|His {{bad luck}} with horses led to two films {{dealing with the}} subject. [...] Hollywood Reporter critic Duane Byrge found the first feature, Horseplayer, an [...] "eerie and nauseating look into the most twisted form of artistic inspiration." [...] Reclusive Bud Cowan (Brad Dourif) is a weirdo {{who works in a}} liquor store. All bundled up in down jacket, ski <b>mask</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves,</b> he sits in the cold box, making sure the shelves stay stocked with beverages. Bud's well-defended {{seclusion}} is breached when Mathew (M.K. Harris) and Randi (Sammi Davis), a pair of siblings, force themselves into his life. Mathew is an artist whose inspirations come from his sister's lovers. Randi seduces Bud, in effect mentally raping him, but Bud {{turns out to be a}} good deal less balanced than any of her previous conquests. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film [...] "winning, thrilling... The L.A. minimalist movie at its best. A dry, deadpan psychological thriller that makes a virtue of its no-budget." [...] Critic Betsey Sherman of theBoston Globe wrote, [...] "This psychothriller is one of the best American independent films this year." [...] The L.A. Reader's critic Andy Klein said, [...] "The story bears a certain resemblance to [...] "The Servant;" [...] the difference is that none of director-cowriter Kurt Voss's characters, even the largely loathsome Mathew, are reduced to unreal symbols. 'Horseplayer' is one of the most professional and engrossing independents of the year." [...] Lead actor Brad Dourif explained his attraction to the role of Bud thusly: [...] "I'd done 'Horseplayer' roles before, but the writing in it is so terrific. There just aren't that many scripts that are that good." ...|$|E
30|$|All {{bacterial}} {{experiments were}} {{performed in a}} laminar flow hood according to the full aseptic technique protocol. The researchers wore a cap, a <b>mask,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> during the experiment to prevent the contamination of harmful bacteria. The anti-bacterial activities of SS-capped AgNPs were analyzed by broth dilution method against six different pathogenic microorganisms including gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)) and gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii). The pure cultures of bacteria were subcultured on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA). Each strain was inoculated into soybean casein digest (tryptic soy broth (TSB)) for 4 to 6  h at 37 °C. The growth cultures were diluted to 5 [*]×[*] 105  CFU/mL. AgNP suspension (1  mL) {{was added to the}} mixture of TSB (1  mL) and the bacterial culture (1  mL). After incubation at 37 °C for 24  h, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was examined. It is expressed as the lowest dilution which inhibited growth, judged by the lack of turbidity in the tube. After the bacterial experiment, the used cap, <b>mask,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gloves</b> were autoclaved before disposal. The flasks were autoclaved for sterilization, and the area was disinfected with 70 % ethanol.|$|E
