5|$|From its beginning, the <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of {{the metric}} system were the {{standard}} set of interrelated base units {{and a standard}} set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could replace {{a huge number of}} other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). The <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
5|$|One of the castle's <b>main</b> <b>features</b> is {{the range}} of heraldic devices found mainly on the west façade, which have been {{retained}} from the castle's original construction. They depict the coats of arms belonging to local gentry and peers of the late 14th to early 15th centuries and provide an approximate date of the castle's reconstruction from wood to stone.|$|E

There is a small moraine in the valley of Hemlock Run, a tributary of West Branch Fishing Creek.

5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of late Roman {{fortification}} clearly presage {{those of}} medieval castles. But the defensibility of late Roman forts {{must not be}} exaggerated. Late Roman forts were not always located on defensible sites, such as hilltops {{and they were not}} designed as independent logistic facilities where the garrison could survive for years on internal supplies (water in cisterns or from wells and stored food). They remained bases for troops that would sally out and engage the enemy in the field.|$|E
5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose <b>main</b> <b>features</b> are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs {{because most of the}} region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, and much of the region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration).|$|E
5|$|The Avars {{initially}} were nomadic horsemen, {{but both}} large cemeteries used by {{three or four}} generations {{and a growing number}} of settlements attest to their adoption of a sedentary (non-nomadic) way of life from the 8th century. The Avars' power was destroyed between 791 and 795 by Charlemagne, who occupied Transdanubia and attached it to his empire. Archaeological investigation of early medieval rural settlements at Balatonmagyaród, Nemeskér and other places in Transdanubia demonstrate that their <b>main</b> <b>features</b> did not change with the fall of the Avar Khaganate. New settlements appeared in the former borderlands with cemeteries characterized by objects with clear analogues in contemporary Bavaria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Moravia and other faraway territories. A manor defended by timber walls (similar to noble courts of other parts of the Carolingian Empire) was unearthed at Zalaszabar.|$|E

5|$|The Sandals farm {{contains}} three cottages {{dated to}} the 17th century. Heather Cottage is another 17th-century cottage, with 20th-century {{additions to the}} rear, on Worldham Hill, noted for its thatched roof. It {{is believed to be}} named after William Heather, a resident mentioned in the 1665 Hearth Tax returns. It became a listed building on 18 July 1986. The Three Horseshoes Public House was first licensed in 1834 {{and is one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the village. It was rebuilt some 50 years later by Henry Newman. Also of note is the Rectory House on Wyck Lane, and the Oast House, just to the west of the rectory.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the <b>main</b> <b>features</b> that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E

5000|$|If {{you hear}} the word B-movie, you will {{probably}} laugh heartily, but a B-movie director has his own worries. In newspaper ads the <b>main</b> <b>feature</b> usually has the most prominent place, and I'm way down at the bottom. The B-movie director's biggest worry is the question 'What effect will the <b>main</b> <b>feature</b> have that is shown before your film?' Films from Nikkatsu usually have the same plot: the main character {{falls in love with}} a woman, he kills the bad guy and gets the woman. This pattern is repeated in every film, so you concentrate on finding out all you can about who the actors are, who the director is, and the approach this director has. This is what the B-movie director does. For instance, the <b>main</b> <b>feature's</b> director has a habit of filming a love scene a certain way; this means that I have to handle it in another way. The director of the <b>main</b> <b>feature</b> has it easy. He doesn't have to find out how I work at all. He can just do whatever he wants. So actually a B-movie director has a harder task than his colleague who does the <b>main</b> <b>feature.</b> Because of this the studio should give me more money than him, actually, but it's just the other way around.|$|R
