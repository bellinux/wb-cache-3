40|$|Background: Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are {{the most}} common and often the first manifestation of {{coronary}} heart disease and lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Early detection/identification of acute <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury at risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients remains an unmet medical need. In the present study, we examined the sphingolipids level after transient cardiac ischaemia following temporary coronary artery occlusion during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients and determined the role of sphingolipids level as a novel marker for early detection of human <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury. Methods and Results: Venous samples were collected from either the coronary sinus (n = 7) or femoral vein (n = 24) from 31 patients aged 40 - 73 years-old at 1, 5 min, and 12 h, following elective PCI. Plasma sphingolipids levels were assessed by HPLC. At 1 min coronary sinus levels of sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P), sphingosine (SPH), and sphinganine (SA) were increased by 314, 115, and 614 %, respectively (n = 7), while peripheral blood levels increased by 79, 68, and 272 % (n = 24). By 5 min, coronary sinus S 1 P and SPH levels increased further (720 %, 117 %), as did peripheral levels of S 1 P alone (792 %). Where troponin T was detectable at 12 h (10 of 31), a strong correlation was found with peak S 1 P (R (2) = 0. 818; P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Aims Dynamic three-dimensional-cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance (3 D-CMR) perfusion proved highly diagnostic {{for the detection}} of angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD) and has been used to assess the efficacy of coronary stenting procedures. The present study aimed to relate significant coronary lesions as assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR) to the volume of myocardial hypoenhancement on 3 D-CMR adenosine stress perfusion imaging and to define the inter-study reproducibility of stress inducible 3 D-CMR hypoperfusion. Methods and results A total of 120 patients with known or suspected CAD were examined in two CMR centres using 1. 5 T systems. The protocol included cine imaging, 3 D-CMR perfusion during adenosine infusion, and at rest followed by delayed enhancement (DE) imaging. Fractional flow reserve was recorded in epicardial coronary arteries and side branches with ≥ 2 mm luminal diameter and > 40 % severity stenosis (pathologic FFR < 0. 75). Twenty-five patients underwent an identical repeat CMR examination for the determination of inter-study reproducibility of 3 D-CMR perfusion deficits induced by adenosine. Three-dimensional CMR perfusion scans were visually classified as pathologic if one or more segments showed an inducible perfusion deficit in the absence of DE. <b>Myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> burden (MIB) was measured by segmentation of the area of inducible hypoenhancement and normalized to left ventricular myocardial volume (MIB, %). Three-dimensional CMR perfusion resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 90, 82, and 87 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: <b>Myocardial</b> cell <b>ischaemic</b> injury during {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass and aortic crossclamp {{remains a}} key limiting factor to patient outcomes in {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting. Troponin I {{has been shown to}} be an effective indicator of <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury and achieves peak levels early post-operatively. Methods: All consenting CABG patients from one centre, during a one year period, were recruited. All surgeries were performed using identical techniques besides the cardioplegia volume and number of doses. Troponin I levels were checked regularly post-operatively until a peak troponin I level was ascertained. All the patient demographics, crossclamp times, bypass times and cardioplegia dosing were analysed using multiple combinations of statistical tools. Results: 172 patients were included in the study and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was found to be significant as a single variable (p= 0. 033). The combination of CBP time and ischaemia time (p= 0. 002) and the combination of CPB time and multidose cardioplegia (p= 0. 009), were both found to significantly affect peak troponin I levels. Another analysis was performed on the volume of cardioplegia used. While this was not significant as an individual variable it did become significant when combined with ischaemia time at a threshold total cardioplegia volume of 750 mls (p= 0. 026). Conclusions: The conclusion therefore is that using over 750 mls of cardioplegia in multiple doses will safely protect against an ischaemia time of up to 62 min. However there is no protection against the CPB time, which proved to have the most impact on myocardial cell damage in our practice. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{physiological}} condition, NO {{is produced}} by two constitutive NOS isoform; eNOS and nNOS. Both isoforms have specific cellular locations and although the role of eNOS in <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury and in cardioprotection has been thoroughly addressed, but the role of nNOS remains unclear. Therefore, {{the aims of the}} thesis were to: (i) investigate the role of nNOS in ischaemia/reoxygenation-induced injury, (ii) determine whether its effect is species-dependent, (iii) elucidate the relationship of nNOS with mitoKATP channels and p 38 MAPK, two key components of IP and (iv) investigate whether modulation of the NO metabolism can overcome the unresponsiveness of the diabetic myocardium to IP. Methods and Results: Ventricular myocardial slices from rats and mice, nNOS knockout mice, and also from human right atrial slices were subjected to 90 min ischaemia and 120 min reoxygenation (37 °C). Muscles were randomized to receive various treatments. Both the provision of exogenous NO and the inhibition of endogenous NO production significantly reduced tissue injury (creatine kinase release, cell necrosis and apoptosis), an effect that was species–independent. The protection seen with nNOS inhibition was as potent as that of IP, however, in nNOS-knocked out mice the cardioprotective effect of non-selective NOS (L-NAME) and selective nNOS inhibition (TRIM) and also that of IP was blocked while the benefit of exogenous NO remained intact. Additional studies revealed that the cardioprotection afforded by of exogenous NO and by inhibition of nNOS were unaffected by the mitoKATP channel blocker 5 -HD although it was abrogated by p 38 MAPK blocker SB 203580. Finally, in diabetic myocardium, IP did not decrease CK release neither reduced cell necrosis or apoptosis. In diabetic myocardium NO donor SNAP, inhibitor L-NAME and TRIM significantly reduced CK leakage, cell necrosis and apoptosis. Conclusions: nNOS plays a dual role in ischaemia/reoxygenation on that its presence is necessary to afford cardioprotection by IP but its inhibition reduces <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury. The role of nNOS is species-independent and exerted downstream of the mitoKATP channels and upstream of p 38 MAPK. Moreover, both the provision of exogenous NO and the suppression of endogenous NO production resulted in potent protection of diabetic human myocardium, overcoming the unresponsiveness of these tissues to IP.

40|$|Abstract Interest in off-pump {{coronary}} {{surgery and}} ischaemic preconditioning has been increasing. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate surrogate indicators of haemodynamic, myocardial, and cerebral outcome during off-pump surgery and preconditioning. Haemodynamics and myocardial preservation were monitored in a pilot study of twelve patients undergoing off-pump coronary surgery. Indicators of myocardial metabolism and tissue injury as well as cerebral damage were evaluated in a randomized study of thirty-three patients undergoing on-pump (11) or off-pump surgery with (11) or without (11) preceding <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> preconditioning for five minutes followed by reperfusion for five minutes. The pilot study showed minimal haemodynamic changes and myocardial derangements during off-pump surgery as evaluated intraoperatively based on transcardiac differences of ATP degradation products and lactate and postoperatively based on MB mass of creatine kinase and troponin T. In the following studies, <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> metabolism was evaluated intraoperatively by measuring transcardiac differences of ATP degradation products, lactate, and pH, which increased significantly from the baseline values in all study groups. However, the maximum values of lactate and pH were significantly higher in the cardiopulmonary bypass group (p =  0. 02 and p =  0. 007, respectively). There were no statistical differences between the preconditioning and non-preconditioning groups. Myocardial tissue injury was evaluated by postoperative leakage of MB mass of creatine kinase and troponin I. Their peak values were significantly higher (p <  0. 001 and p =  0. 008) after cardiopulmonary bypass (15. 1 μg/l and 13. 8 μg/l) than after off-pump surgery without preconditioning (6. 3 μg/l and 5. 2 μg/l). The respective values were 14. 8 μg/l and 7. 4 μg/l after preconditioning, and there were no statistically significant differences between the off-pump groups with and without preconditioning. Cerebral damage was evaluated based on the intra- and postoperative serum concentrations of neuron-specific enolase, which were corrected with respect to haemolysis. The corrected values were significantly higher after on-pump than off-pump surgery (p =  0. 003 and p =  0. 005). In conclusion, multi-vessel off-pump coronary artery surgery is a haemodynamically feasible procedure offering better myocardial preservation compared to on-pump surgery. Ischaemic preconditioning of the myocardium does not seem to improve myocardial preservation in off-pump surgery. The slightly lower levels of neuron-specific enolase also suggest less cerebral damage...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that oxygen-derived free radicals {{may play a role}} in <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> and reperfusion injury. Major sources of O 2 free radicals formation during ischaemia and reperfusion are: the enzyme xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils and the myocardial mitochondria. However, in the heart there are defense mechanisms against the toxic oxygen metabolites. They include the enzyme superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase plus endogenous antioxidants like vitamin E, ascorbic acid and cysteine. We have investigated in the isolated rabbit hearts the effects of ischaemia and reperfusion on these defence mechanisms. 90 min of ischaemia and/or hypoxia induced a significant reduction of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, and of reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio which was further declined after reperfusion indicating that an oxidative stress has occurred. These alterations are associated with massive tissue and mitochondrial calcium accumulation, loss of mitochondrial function and severe membrane damage.

40|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is {{proposed}} to {{be a key}} regulator of cellular and organismal metabolism and has reported vasculoprotective effects. In addition, many therapeutic agents used in the treatment of diabetes and atherosclerosis such as metformin, thiazolidinediones and statins may exert their vasculoprotective effects through activation of AMPK. Activation of AMPK has a number of potentially beneficial anti-atherosclerotic effects including reducing adhesion of inflammatory cells to the blood vessel endothelium, reducing lipid accumulation and the proliferation of inflammatory cells caused by oxidised lipids, stimulation of gene expression responsible for cellular antioxidant defenses and stimulation of enzymes responsible for nitric oxide formation. In humans and animals the AMPK cascade triggers vascular protective mechanisms that have been shown to reduce <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury and mutations in AMPK can cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Another meta-analysis covering over 350,000 people concluded that vitamin D supplementation in unselected community-dwelling individuals does not reduce skeletal (total fracture) or non-skeletal outcomes (<b>myocardial</b> infarction, <b>ischaemic</b> heart disease, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, cancer) by more than 15%, and that further research trials with similar design are unlikely to change these conclusions.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Baicalin {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for various animal models of cardiovascular diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis and <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> injury. However, whether baicalin plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy remains unknown. Here we investigated the protective effects of baicalin on cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and explored the potential mechanisms involved. Methods: C 57 BL/ 6 J-mice were treated with baicalin or vehicle following transverse aortic constriction or Sham surgery for up to 8 weeks, and at different time points, cardiac function and heart size measurement and histological and biochemical examination were performed. Results: Mice under pressure overload exhibited cardiac dysfunction, high mortality, myocardial hypertrophy, increased apoptosis and fibrosis markers, and suppressed cardiac expression of PPARα and PPARβ/δ. However, oral administration of baicalin improved cardiac dysfunction, decreased mortality, and attenuated histological and biochemical changes described above. These protective effects of baicalin were associated with reduced heart and cardiomyocyte size, lower fetal genes expression, attenuated cardiac fibrosis, lower expression of profibrotic markers, and decreased apoptosis signals in heart tissue. Moreover, we found that baicalin induced PPARα and PPARβ/δ expression in vivo and in vitro. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that long-term baicalin treatment presented no obvious cardiac lipotoxicity. Conclusions: The present results demonstrated that baicalin attenuates pressure overload induced cardiac dysfunction and ventricular remodeling, which would be due to suppressed cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, apoptosis and metabolic abnormality...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of regional wall motion {{is useful to}} identify myocardial ischaemia because wall motion abnormalities occur relatively upstream in the ischaemic cascade. Echocardiography is widely used for this, but the subjectivity of visual observation may hamper accurate evaluation. The analysis of myocardial velocity and strain by tissue Doppler and speckle tracking echocardiography has allowed the quantitative {{assessment of}} regional wall motion and facilitated the detection of subtle myocardial deformation {{that is difficult to}} identify by conventional methods, such as post-systolic shortening (PSS). PSS is defined as myocardial shortening that occurs after end-systole (or aortic valve closure), and it is observed in the myocardium with regional contractile dysfunction. In experimental and clinical studies, {{it has been reported that}} the assessment of PSS is superior to that of conventional parameters such as wall thickening or peak systolic strain in detecting acute ischaemia and diagnosing coronary artery disease. Moreover, it has recently been found that PSS remains after recovery from brief ischaemia despite the rapid recovery of peak systolic strain. The assessment of PSS allows after-the-fact recognition of <b>myocardial</b> <b>ischaemic</b> insults and is expected to be used for ischaemic memory imaging. In this review, the usefulness of the assessment of PSS for the diagnosis of acute ischaemia and ischaemic memory is demonstrated, and issues that need to be resolved for the widespread use of this assessment in the echocardiographic laboratory are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} behaviour of 90 {{patients on}} beta-blocking drugs for established {{coronary heart disease}} who were admitted to a coronary care unit with prolonged <b>ischaemic</b> <b>myocardial</b> pain was {{compared with that of}} 90 similar patients not on this therapy. Transmural myocardial infarction was confirmed in 30 of the patients on beta-blockers and in 62 controls. A diagnosis of myocardial necrosis without infarction was made in 20 patients on beta-blockers and in 14 controls. Coronary insufficiency was diagnosed in 40 patients on beta-blockers and in 14 controls. The incidence of simus bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, and radiological pulmonary oedema was similar in the two groups. Established beta-blockade, therefore, has not been shown to prejudice the outcome of patients with coronary heart disease admitted to hospital with prolonged <b>ischaemic</b> <b>myocardial</b> pain. On the contrary, it may protect some patients from the development of a myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|In {{the initial}} stages of an acute <b>myocardial</b> {{infarction}} the <b>ischaemic</b> myocardium suffers a degree of cellular injury which is entirely reversible if local blood flow is restored.
