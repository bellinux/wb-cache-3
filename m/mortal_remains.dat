5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar, the French colonial authorities shifted the location of these tombs thereby disrupting the original cosmological symbolism of their arrangement. When the original tombs were excavated for relocation, the French found the <b>mortal</b> <b>remains</b> of the nobles within had each been wrapped in numerous traditional lambas (woven silk cloths) then set within wooden coffins packed with charcoal. Bodies buried at Ambohimanga were found to have been entombed in the same way.|$|E

50|$|Soon after this, {{the great}} island of Númenor was raised out of Belegaer, {{close to the}} shores of Aman, and the Three Houses of the Edain were brought to live there. Henceforth, they were called the Dúnedain, or Men of the West, and were blessed with many gifts by the Valar and the Elves of Tol Eressëa. The Valar feared — rightly — that the Númenóreans would seek to enter Aman to gain {{immortality}} (even though a <b>mortal</b> in Aman <b>remains</b> <b>mortal,</b> due to it not being their final destination), so they forbade them from sailing west {{of sight of the}} westernmost promontory of Númenor. In time, and not without some corrupting help from Sauron, the Númenóreans violated the Ban of the Valar, and sailed to Aman with a great army under the command of Ar-Pharazôn the Golden. Eru collapsed a part of the Pelóri on this army, trapping it but not killing it. It is said that the army still lives underneath the pile of rock.|$|R

40|$|This thesis contextualises and {{explores the}} reconceptualization {{of the myth}} of Eteokles and Polyneices in Greek, Latin and Italian tragedy, the {{literary}} genre that {{more than any other}} offers the opportunity to trace its progressive transformation across a series of relatively continuous and consistent phases. Within these limits, this study represents the first comprehensive, systematic and detailed comparative analysis of the cultural development of this myth, charting the shaping of its key themes: war and rivalry, autochthony and patriotism, the connection between incest, parricide and fratricide, the effects of predestination/family curse, the clash between private and public interests, and the legitimate limits of power. By means of a close examination of the thesis’ main corpus (constituted by Aeschylus’ Seven against Thebes, Sophocles’ Antigone, Oedipus Tyrannos and Oedipus at Colonus, Euripides’ Phoenician Women, Seneca’s Oedipus and Phoenissae, Dolce’s Giocasta and Alfieri’s Polinice) this dissertation demonstrates that the brothers are not merely two stereotypical types whose characterisation as <b>mortal</b> enemies <b>remains</b> static and unvaried. Although their rivalry never stops, the meaning, dynamic and purpose of their struggle are progressively but profoundly transformed throughout the centuries. In particular, I argue that the martial component that initially defined this myth, admittedly important throughout its legacy, is variously adapted to accommodate either a warning against the horrors of violence and subjugation, a cautionary appeal against overly aggressive foreign policy, a denunciation of the unbearable price of civil strife, or an aspiration to pacifism. In parallel, I analyse how the reflection on power and power struggle becomes increasingly predominant, eventually displacing the war theme as the main focus of this myth with a warning against the dangers of tyranny...|$|R

25|$|Due to Hindu funeral rites - where <b>mortal</b> <b>remains</b> are cremated - most Indian {{casualties}} are commemorated with inscriptions on war memorials at Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial and the Anneau de la Mémoire of Notre Dame de Lorette Ablain St.-Nazaire French Military Cemetery {{rather than}} with individual graves.

25|$|Soon after, the tyrannical {{power of}} the foreign King in Italy spurred a revolt, {{especially}} around Catania and southern Sicily, which his German soldiers led by Markward of Annweiler and Henry of Kalden suppressed mercilessly.

Even Queen Constance, provoked by the neglect of Henry and pitying her countrymen, joined the revolts against him and besieged him in a castle, forcing him into a treaty.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of 15 years Lays had built a {{remarkable}} reputation as a singer. He had been a star at the court of the Ancien Régime, before performing {{at the opening of}} the Estates General at Versailles in 1789.

So it was unsurprising that his career continued to thrive in the new political climate under the government of the Directory. Lays was protected by the strong man of the new regime, Paul Barras, and became friends with his mistress, Josephine de Beauharnais, as well as the man who would become her husband, General Napoleon Bonaparte.

25|$|At {{the onset}} of Kali Yuga, once king Parikshit went hunting in the forest.

Kali smartly entered into Parikshit's golden crown and spoiled his thoughts. Parikshit entered the hut of a sage named Shamika as he was thirsty. He found the sage in deep meditation. He bowed to him several times but as there was no response. In anger, he took a dead snake and threw it around the sage's neck. Later when the sage's son, Shringin, heard of this incident he cursed the king to die of snake bite on the seventh day. On hearing this, the king forswore the throne for his son Janamejaya and spent his last seven days listening to the discourses of sage Shuka, compiled as the Bhagavata Purana under the banyan tree of Shukratal.

King Radama I likewise inhabited the building {{for much of his}} time at the Rova, and in 1820 he designated the building as the first site to house what {{came to be known as}} the Palace School, the first formal European-style school in Imerina.

500|$|Besakana is {{believed}} to have been the first residence of a Merina sovereign on the Rova site.
