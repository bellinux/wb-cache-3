500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including <b>morwongs,</b> sea catfishes, drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and guitarfishes) and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the full}} extent and {{severity}} of ecological changes in human-influenced ecological systems is needed to identify today’s management priorities and to set realistic restoration objectives for the future. However, reconstructing ecosystem baselines and understanding the causes and rates of ecological changes is often hampered by the scarcity of data about population and community status before exploitation, and by the challenges of fitting these (historical) data into modern analytical methods. This study aimed to identify the main sources of fishing impacts on marine communities of South East Australia and to gather and examine historical data available for the region that can provide information on baseline (pre-fishing) conditions to compare changes in fish communities as the fishing industry developed. South East Australia provides an ideal case study as its history of exploitation is relatively recent and there were surveys undertaken prior to exploitation. While a range of commercial fisheries have evolved in South East Australia since European colonization, during the last century bottom trawling has been the major fishing activity in the region. Bottom trawl surveys that included information on demersal species abundance and community structure were carried out both before and at different stages since trawling exploitation begun, and thus provide insights into {{the full extent of}} fishing impacts on South East Australian demersal fish communities. These surveys, covering the period 1898 - 1997, were performed by various research agencies, which collected and organized catch and effort data in different formats Additionally, the detail of the information reported changes across surveys and over the years. Hence, the initial need was to collect, digitalize and standardize all the information available. The bottom trawl survey dataset resulting from this step contained a total of 3, 083 tows sampling 574 species among chondrichthyes and osteichthyes. It spans the entire history of trawling exploitation and is analyzed in this study as an entire dataset for the first time. A comparison of pre- with post-trawling exploitation data (1898 - 1910 and 1980 s- 2010 s, respectively) revealed marked changes in the structure of demersal fish communities of South East Australia. These included shifts in the catch composition of the main families, as well as sharp declines in the total and individual family catch rate, most likely related to the effect of fishing. Among the steepest declines were those of key commercial families, such as flatheads and <b>morwongs,</b> on the continental shelf of Tasmania. The effect of trawling on demersal fish communities of South East Australia was also revealed by the application of species accumulation curves to the survey dataset. Specifically, the rate of species accumulation with area decreased as trawling intensity increased, suggesting that trawling modified community structure through the removal of particular species and through changes in the abundance and spatial distribution of the remaining species. This study’s findings have direct application to management and monitoring of the natural resources in South East Australia, and important implications for sustainable use and conservation prioritization. The study also provides a framework and approach that can be of guidance for the collection, standardization and analysis of analogous, patchy, unbalanced and overlooked historical datasets around the world...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Red <b>morwong</b> (Cheilodactylus fuscus; Cheilo-dactylidae: Perciformes), {{are large}} {{temperate}} rocky reef fish that are patchily distributed in local aggregations of 3 to> 100 fish. The home ranges and aggregating be-haviour of red <b>morwong</b> were investigated using external tags (n 114, over 35 mo) and ultrasonic transmitters (n 9 over 20 d) at coastal and estuarine sites in south-east Australia. Adult red <b>morwong</b> {{had a mean}} home range during the day of 1865 m 2 (SE 268). Night movement, determined by ultrasonic telemetry, indicat-ed a significantly greater mean home range of 3639 m 2 (SE 416). Home range did not dier significantly with size or sex. Fish movements were greatest and ag-gregation sizes varied most during the non-reproductive mid-summer period. Tagged fish (N 20) displaced 200 to 900 m returned in 1 to 3 d {{to the point of}} capture, often traversing open sand habitat and other aggrega-tions. During the day, fish were commonly found on bouldered habitat.
