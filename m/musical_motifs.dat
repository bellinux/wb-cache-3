5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with <b>musical</b> <b>motifs.</b> While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
25|$|African American music began {{incorporating}} Afro-Cuban <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> in {{the nineteenth}} century, when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity. The habanera was the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African motif. From the perspective of African American music, the habanera rhythm (also known as congo, tango-congo, or tango.) {{can be thought of}} as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.|$|E

25|$|Although true clave-based Afro-Cuban jazz did {{not appear}} until the mid-twentieth century, the Cuban {{influence}} {{was present at the}} birth of jazz.

25|$|Gregorian chants were {{organized}} initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 modes. Typical melodic features include a characteristic ambitus, and also characteristic intervallic patterns {{relative to a}} referential mode final, incipits and cadences, the use of reciting tones at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> woven together through a process called centonization to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct tetrachords, producing a larger pitch system called the gamut. The chants can be sung by using six-note patterns called hexachords. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using neumes, an early form of musical notation from which the modern four-line and five-line staff developed. Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as organum, were an early stage {{in the development of}} Western polyphony.|$|E
500|$|<b>Musical</b> <b>motifs</b> {{were used}} to bind the {{ceremony}} programme together: for example, the 'whistling' theme first heard during the minute's silence embedded within [...] "And I Will Kiss" [...] returned frequently — behind the fury as the ring was being forged, emerging triumphant as the five rings came together, and again later as the main theme of 'Caliban's Dream' whilst the flame was paraded around the stadium.|$|E
5000|$|The main <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> {{is based}} on a Norwegian folk song called [...] "The Lost Sheep", or {{natively}} [...] "Den bortkomne sauen".|$|R

500|$|The cantata in six {{movements}} {{opens with}} a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives leading to a chorus and a concluding chorale. The chorale tune, known as [...] "", appears in the first movement, played by the organ, and <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> of the arias are derived from it, providing an overall formal unity to the composition. Bach scored the work for two vocal parts (alto and tenor), a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of recorders, strings and continuo. In the alto recitative (movement 4), accompanied by all instruments, Bach creates the images of sleep, of waking up, and of funeral bells, the latter in the recorders and pizzicato of the strings.|$|E
500|$|The work {{displays}} a thoughtful symmetry. In {{the center of}} the five parts is the court hearing which confronts Jesus, Pilate, and the people. In the middle of the hearing, a chorale (22) interrupts the argument, which is a discussion about freedom and captivity. It is surrounded by two choral movements, which not only both ask for the crucifixion of Jesus, but also use the same <b>musical</b> <b>motifs,</b> the second time intensified. [...] Again, in a repetition of similar musical material, a preceding [...] choir explains the law, while a corresponding movement reminds Pilate of the Emperor whose authority is challenged by someone calling himself a king. Preceding this, Jesus is greeted in mockery as a king, corresponding in motif to the later request that Pilate should change the inscription saying he is [...] "the King of the Jews" [...] to [...] "He said: I am the King of the Jews".|$|E
500|$|In 1982 Enix {{sponsored}} {{a video game}} programming contest in Japan which brought much of the Dragon Quest team together, including creator Yuji Horii. The prize was {{a trip to the}} United States and a visit to AppleFest '83 in San Francisco, where Horii discovered the Wizardry video game series. The contest winners Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida, together with Horii, released the Enix NES game The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Music composer Sugiyama, known for composing jingles and pop songs, was impressed with the group's work and sent a postcard to Enix praising the software. Enix asked him to compose music for some of its games. The group then decided to make a role-playing video game that combined elements from the western RPGs Wizardry and [...] Ultima. Horii wanted to introduce the concept of RPGs to the wider Japanese video game audience. He chose the Famicom because, unlike arcade games, players would {{not have to worry about}} spending more money if they got a [...] "game over", and could continue playing from a save point. Horii used the full-screen map of Ultima and the battle and statistics-oriented Wizardry screens to create the gameplay of Dragon Quest. Dragon Ball creator and manga artist Akira Toriyama, who knew of Horii through the manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters to separate the game from other role-playing games of the time. The primary game designs were conceived by Horii before being handed to Toriyama to re-draw under Horii's supervision. When Horii first created Dragon Quest many people doubted that a fantasy series with swords and dungeons, instead of science fiction elements, would become popular in Japan; however, the series has become very popular there. Since then Horii has been the games' scenario director. Dragon Quest was Sugiyama's second video game he had composed for, Wingman2 being his first. He says it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme. His <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> from the first game have remained relatively intact.|$|E

2500|$|These marks {{are known}} in English as accents, notes or trope symbols, and in Hebrew as [...] ta`amei ha-mikra or just [...] te`amim. [...] Some of these signs were also {{sometimes}} used in medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah. [...] The <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> {{associated with the}} signs are known in Hebrew as niggun or neginot (not {{to be confused with}} Hasidic nigun) and in Yiddish as [...] trop: the word trope is sometimes used in English with the same meaning.|$|E
2500|$|This {{system is}} {{reflected}} in the cantillation practices of the Yemenite Jews, who now use the Tiberian symbols, but tend to have <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> only for the disjunctives and render the conjunctives in a monotone. [...] It is notable that the Yemenite Jews have only eight disjunctive motifs, thus clearly reflecting the Babylonian notation. The same is true of the Karaite mode for the haftarah; while in the Sephardi haftarah modes different disjunctives often have the same or closely similar motifs, reducing the total number of effective motifs to something like the same number.|$|E
2500|$|The {{score is}} also notable in Sondheim's output, {{because of its}} {{intricate}} reworking and development of small <b>musical</b> <b>motifs.</b> In particular, the opening words, [...] "I wish", are set to the interval of a rising major second and this small unit is both repeated and developed throughout the show, just as Lapine's book explores the consequences of self-interest and [...] "wishing." [...] The dialogue in the show {{is characterized by the}} heavy use of syncopated speech. In many instances, the characters' lines are delivered with a fixed beat that follows natural speech rhythms, but is also purposely composed in eighth, sixteenth, and quarter note rhythms as part of a spoken song. Like many Sondheim/Lapine productions, the songs contain thought-process narrative, where characters converse or think aloud.|$|E

5000|$|Genie {{shares the}} same <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> as Jasmine, symbolizing {{his desire to}} also be free. This cue was {{expanded}} into the song [...] "To Be Free" [...] for Disneys Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular.|$|R
50|$|This {{song was}} written by Harry Sommerdahl, Mattias Lindblom and Anders Wollbeck. It was {{inspired}} by a <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> in Requiem by Mozart. It features a theater atmosphere accompanied by orchestra, guitars, and Turunen's powerful voice.|$|R
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with the ideas expressed in his essays of the period 1849–51 (including the [...] "Communication" [...] but also [...] "Opera and Drama" [...] and [...] "The Artwork of the Future"), the four parts of the Ring were originally conceived by Wagner {{to be free of}} the traditional operatic concepts of aria and operatic chorus. The Wagner scholar Curt von Westernhagen identified three important problems discussed in [...] "Opera and Drama" [...] which were particularly relevant to the Ring cycle: the problem of unifying verse stress with melody; the disjunctions caused by formal arias in dramatic structure, {{and the way in which}} opera music could be organised on a different basis of organic growth and modulation; and the function of <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> in linking elements of the plot whose connections might otherwise be inexplicit. This became known as the leitmotif technique (see below), although Wagner himself did not use this word.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, hip hop artist Fab Five Freddy {{was putting}} {{together}} music packages in the largely white downtown Manhattan new wave clubs, and invited Bambaataa {{to perform at}} one of them, the Mudd Club. It {{was the first time}} Bambaataa had performed before a predominantly white crowd. Attendance for his parties downtown became so large that he had to move to larger venues, first to the Ritz, in a show organized by hip hop pioneer, Michael Holman, with Malcolm McLaren's group Bow Wow Wow, then to the Peppermint Lounge, The Jefferson, Negril, Danceteria and the Roxy. [...] "Planet Rock," [...] a popular single produced by Arthur Baker and the keyboardist John Robie, came out that June under the name Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force. The song borrowed <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> from German electronic music, funk, and rock. Different elements and musical styles were used together. The song became an immediate hit and stormed the music charts worldwide. [...] The song melded the main melody from Kraftwerk's [...] "Trans-Europe Express" [...] with electronic beats based on their track [...] "Numbers" [...] as well as portions from records by Babe Ruth and Captain Sky, thus creating a new style of music altogether, electro funk.|$|E
2500|$|After queuing to {{meet his}} idol Douglas P. {{backstage}} at a performance in Munich in December 1996, Albin Julius Martinek of Der Blutharsch later collaborated and toured throughout Europe between 1998-2000 with Death in June. Together, they produced the albums Take Care & Control and Operation Hummingbird, {{as well as the}} live album Heilige!. In comparison to previous Death In June works the material on these albums is primarily sample based, building on <b>musical</b> <b>motifs</b> from the likes of Richard Wagner, Franz Schubert, French 1960s pop icon Serge Gainsbourg amongst others. The two albums mark a significant departure from previous or subsequent Death In June material, featuring very little by way of Pearce's guitar, and could be classified {{as a part of the}} martial music genre. This is itself a genre which Pearce had arguably invented in 1986 on [...] "The World That Summer" [...] album with tracks like 'Death Of A Man' and again in 1989 on [...] "The Wall Of Sacrifice" [...] album with the title track and 'Death Is A Drummer'. Pearce wrote a song loosely inspired by an untitled Der Blutharsch song for the Fire Danger Season Der Blutharsch tribute compilation. The track title was later created/revealed as [...] "Many Enemies Bring Much Honour", which also appears on the rework and rarities album 'Abandon Tracks!' ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> {{with which}} Sibelius portrays the maiden's derisive {{laughter}} as she mocks {{the failures of}} Väinämöinen's attempts to meet her challenges has been claimed as the inspiration for Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack in the stabbing scene in Psycho.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dernière danse" [...] ("Last dance") {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by French singer-songwriter Indila. It served as the first single from her debut album, Mini World. The <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> is likely sampled from Charles Aznavour's song Parce Que Tu Crois.|$|R
50|$|While most of {{the episode}} is a parody of The Grapes of Wrath, other works {{referenced}} include a parody of Steven Seagal's speech from the ending of On Deadly Ground, and the five-note <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> used to communicate with aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|R

2500|$|A new theme {{arrangement}} and opening credit sequence was introduced with Series 4 (though a <b>musical</b> <b>motif,</b> or [...] "sting", {{from the original}} theme is still audible in numerous scenes). Although each episode of Miracle Day has a published individual title, Torchwood: Miracle Day is the only on-screen title used.|$|R
50|$|The concerto {{makes use}} of the <b>musical</b> <b>motif</b> A-E-F, a {{permutation}} of F-A-E, which stood for a personal motto of Joachim, Frei aber einsam ("free but lonely").
