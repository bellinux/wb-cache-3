5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|My lords, the law {{of nature}} moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, {{considering}} I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring {{from the bottom of}} my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

25|$|Erasmus said of Colet, “When I {{listen to}} Colet {{it seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{listening}} to Plato himself.” Erasmus likely portrayed Colet to show that one could be {{highly critical of the}} Church while still a loyal priest.

25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{publication}} of The Pothunters 1902 and that of Mike in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R.D.B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: [...] "I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was able to write at all." ...|$|E
