30|$|It {{was pointed}} out that the χDIA {{measurement}} based on the above-mentioned magnetic ejection is free of a background signal of the sample holder; it is also free of a mass measurement of the sample (Uyeda et al., 2010). In the conventional method, the minimum size of a measurable sample was limited by the above-mentioned two factors. This means that, in principle, magnetic susceptibility is obtained on samples of a limitlessly small size, as long as the motion of the sample can be detected. The lower limit of the sample size may reach several microns by introducing an optical microscope in the drop <b>box.</b> <b>Accordingly,</b> the identification of an individual grain, based on the above χDIA measurements, will become possible for a micron-size particle.|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} the E 2 F family of {{transcription}} factors are key regulators of genes involved in cell cycle progression, cell fate determination, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Many cell-based experiments suggest that E 2 F 1 is a stronger inducer of apoptosis than the other E 2 Fs. Our previous work identified the E 2 F 1 <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> and flanking region as critical for the specificity in E 2 F 1 apoptosis induction. We have now used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that bind the E 2 F 1 <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> and flanking regions, with a potential role in E 2 F 1 apoptosis induction. We identified Jab 1 as an E 2 F 1 -specific binding protein and showed that Jab 1 and E 2 F 1 coexpression synergistically induce apoptosis, coincident with an induction of p 53 protein accumulation. In contrast, Jab 1 does not synergize with E 2 F 1 to promote cell cycle entry. Cells depleted of Jab 1 are deficient for both E 2 F 1 -induced apoptosis and induction of p 53 accumulation. We suggest that Jab 1 is an essential cofactor for the apoptotic function of E 2 F 1...|$|R

40|$|To explore {{mechanisms}} for speci®city of function {{within the family}} of E 2 F transcription factors, we have identi®ed proteins that interact with individual E 2 F proteins. A two-hybrid screen identi®ed RYBP (Ring 1 - and YY 1 -binding protein) as a protein that interacts speci®cally with the E 2 F 2 and E 2 F 3 family members, dependent on the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> domain in these proteins. The Cdc 6 promoter contains adjacent E 2 F- and YY 1 -binding sites, and both are required for promoter activity. In addition, YY 1 and RYBP, in combination with either E 2 F 2 or E 2 F 3, can stimulate Cdc 6 promoter activity synergistically, dependent on the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> domain of E 2 F 3. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that both E 2 F 2 and E 2 F 3, as well as YY 1 and RYBP, associate with the Cdc 6 promoter at G 1 /S of the cell cycle. In con-trast, we detect no interaction of E 2 F 1 with the Cdc 6 promoter. We suggest that the ability of RYBP to mediate an interaction between E 2 F 2 or E 2 F 3 and YY 1 {{is an important component}} of Cdc 6 activation and provides a basis for speci®city of E 2 F function...|$|R
40|$|The E 2 F {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors provides essential activities for coordinating {{the control of}} cellular proliferation and cell fate. Both E 2 F 1 and E 2 F 3 proteins {{have been shown to}} be particularly important for cell proliferation, whereas the E 2 F 1 protein has the capacity to promote apoptosis. To explore the basis for this specificity of function, we used DNA microarray analysis to probe for the distinctions in the two E 2 F activities. Gene expression profiles that distinguish either E 2 F 1 - or E 2 F 3 -expressing cells from quiescent cells are enriched in genes encoding cell cycle and DNA replication activities, consistent with many past studies. E 2 F 1 profile is also enriched in genes known to function in apoptosis. We also identified patterns of gene expression that specifically differentiate the activity of E 2 F 1 and E 2 F 3; this profile is enriched in genes known to function in mitosis. The specificity of E 2 F function has been attributed to protein interactions mediated by the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> domain, and we now show that chimeric E 2 F proteins generate expression signatures that reflect the origin of the <b>marked</b> <b>box,</b> thus linking the biochemical mechanism for specificity of function with specificity of gene activation...|$|R

40|$|E 2 F {{activity}} {{controls the}} expression of a variety of genes that encode proteins essential for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. The E 2 F family consists of seven members containing several highly conserved domains including the marked box. In order to identify interaction partners for E 2 F that bind to the <b>marked</b> <b>box,</b> a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out by using a peptide of the transcription factor E 2 F 3 comprising the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> as bait. This experiment identified one of the regulatory subunit of the DNA-PK, called Ku 70 as a binding partner. Binding of the Ku subunit to E 2 F proteins has been confirmed and E 2 F 1 and E 2 F 3 tested to be direct targets of the Ku 70 / 80 heterodimer. DNA-PK, which is involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaksas well as the recombination of immunoglobin genes has recently been shown to be involved within the cell cycle control. We tested the regulatory function of E 2 F 1 in relation to the DNA-Pk by gamma-ray induced double strand breaks on running cell cycle. The potential functional mechanism of that protein complex have to be determined. The results indicate a significant reduction of E 2 F transactivation potential on transient cotransfection of Ku 70 and Ku 80. The modulation of E 2 F activity by DNA-PK demonstrates a key element in blocking the G 1 /S phase transition in the cell cycle after DNA damage, thereby allowing DNA repair before replication...|$|R
40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a role for E 2 F proteins in the control of transcription of genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and cell fate determination. Although {{it is clear that}} the functions of the E 2 F proteins overlap, there is also evidence for specific roles for individual E 2 F proteins in the control of apoptosis and cell proliferation. Investigating protein interactions that might provide a mechanistic basis for the specificity of E 2 F function, we identified the E-box binding factor TFE 3 as an E 2 F 3 -specific partner. We also show that this interaction is dependent on the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> domain of E 2 F 3. We provide evidence for a role for TFE 3 in the synergistic activation of the p 68 subunit gene of DNA polymerase α together with E 2 F 3, again dependent on the E 2 F 3 <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TFE 3 and E 2 F 3 were bound to the p 68 promoter in vivo and that the interaction of either E 2 F 3 or TFE 3 with the promoter was facilitated by the presence of both proteins. In contrast, neither E 2 F 1 nor E 2 F 2 interacted with the p 68 promoter under these conditions. We propose that the physical interaction of TFE 3 and E 2 F 3 facilitates transcriptional activation of the p 68 gene and provides strong evidence for the specificity of E 2 F function...|$|R
40|$|The pRB (retinoblastoma protein) has {{a central}} role in the control of the G(1) -S phase {{transition}} of the cell cycle that is mediated in part through the regulation of E 2 F transcription factors. Upon S-phase entry pRB is phosphorylated extensively, which in turn releases bound E 2 Fs to drive the expression of the genes required for S-phase progression. In the present study, we demonstrate that E 2 F 1 -maintains the ability to interact with ppRB (hyperphosphorylated pRB). This interaction is dependent upon the 2 ̆ 7 specific 2 ̆ 7 E 2 F 1 -binding site located in the C-terminal domain of pRB. A unique region of the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> domain of E 2 F 1 contacts the 2 ̆ 7 specific 2 ̆ 7 site to mediate the interaction with ppRB. The mechanistic basis of the interaction between E 2 F 1 and ppRB is subtle. A single substitution between valine and proline residues in the <b>marked</b> <b>box</b> distinguishes E 2 F 12 ̆ 7 s ability to interact with ppRB from the inability of E 2 F 3 to bind to the 2 ̆ 7 specific 2 ̆ 7 site in ppRB. The E 2 F 1 -pRB interaction at the 2 ̆ 7 specific 2 ̆ 7 site also maintains the ability to regulate the transcriptional activation of E 2 F 1 target genes. These data reveal a mechanism by which E 2 F 1 regulation by pRB can persist, when pRB is hyperphosphorylated and presumed to be inactive...|$|R
