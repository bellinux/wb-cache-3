5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, <b>mefloquine,</b> lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; <b>mefloquine</b> is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, <b>mefloquine</b> or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either <b>mefloquine,</b> lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mefloquine,</b> an {{antimalarial}} drug, {{also produces}} psychiatric side effects {{which may be}} mediated through 5-HT2A and/or 5-HT2C receptors.|$|E
25|$|Another agent, <b>mefloquine,</b> {{which has}} {{previously}} been used to treat and prevent malaria, was recognised in 2008–2009 to be effective against Schistosoma.|$|E
25|$|It {{has since}} been {{confirmed}} by Dr Remington Nevin that Clayton Matchee {{at the time of}} the incident was having an adverse reaction to <b>mefloquine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} treatments {{include a}} combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, artesunate, or <b>mefloquine.</b> A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone, metrifonate was as effective as praziquantel.|$|E
25|$|The best-understood {{examples}} of such hematin biocrystallization inhibitors are quinoline drugs such as chloroquine and <b>mefloquine.</b> These drugs bind to both free heme and hemozoin crystals, and therefore block the addition of new heme units onto the growing crystals. The small, most rapidly growing face is the face to which inhibitors are believed to bind.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{formation}} of hemozoin {{is essential to the}} survival of these parasites, it is an attractive target for developing drugs and is much-studied in Plasmodium as a way to find drugs to treat malaria (malaria's Achilles' heel). Several currently used antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and <b>mefloquine,</b> are thought to kill malaria parasites by inhibiting haemozoin biocrystallization.|$|E
25|$|Several fixed-dose ACTs are now {{available}} containing an artemisinin component and a partner drug which has a long half-life, such as <b>mefloquine</b> (ASMQ), lumefantrine (Coartem), amodiaquine (ASAQ), piperaquine (Duo-Cotecxin), and pyronaridine (Pyramax). Increasingly, these combinations are being made to GMP standard. A separate issue concerns the quality of some artemisinin-containing products being sold in Africa and Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), <b>mefloquine,</b> and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Cambodia was {{hit with}} a malaria epidemic. The {{situation}} of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least 30 people during the epidemic. This has prompted efforts by MSF to set up and fund a malaria outreach project and utilise Village Malaria Workers. MSF also introduced a switching of first-line treatment to a combination therapy (Artesunate and <b>Mefloquine)</b> to combat resistance and fatality of old drugs that were used to treat the disease traditionally.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{synthesized}} organofluorines {{have been}} found in microorganisms and plants, but not animals. The most common example is fluoroacetate, which occurs as a plant defence against herbivores in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil and Africa. Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate which are all believed to be biosynthesized in biochemical pathways from the intermediate fluoroacetaldehyde. Adenosyl-fluoride synthase is an enzyme capable of biologically synthesizing the carbon–fluorine bond. Man made carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals because it adds stability to the carbon framework; also, the relatively small size of fluorine is convenient as fluorine acts as an approximate bioisostere of the hydroxyl group. Introducing the carbon–fluorine bond to organic compounds is the major challenge for medicinal chemists using organofluorine chemistry, as the carbon–fluorine bond increases the probability of having a successful drug by about a factor of ten. An estimated 20% of pharmaceuticals, and 3040% of agrichemicals are organofluorines, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), <b>mefloquine,</b> and fluconazole.|$|E
2500|$|What {{has also}} come to light is the drug {{interactions}} associated with <b>mefloquine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The use of codeine {{while taking}} <b>mefloquine</b> {{has been linked}} to a few {{incidents}} involving violence and individuals displaying significant issues with hallucinations.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), <b>mefloquine,</b> and fluconazole. [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. [...] Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
2500|$|Some, {{including}} Member of Parliament John Cummins, quickly {{pointed out}} {{that three of the}} four men facing the most serious charges had been given experimental injections [...] of Lariam, a brand-name of <b>mefloquine,</b> to test its effects on combatting malaria in a controlled study group. The drug was known to cause paranoia, lack of judgment, neurosis and other mental side effects, and some have suggested it bore some responsibility for the soldiers' actions. Dr. Michele Brill-Edwards had actually resigned in protest from Health Canada over her belief that the drug could produce [...] "dangerous psychiatric reactions" [...] in the soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|When {{chloroquine}} {{resistance is}} common or when chloroquine is contraindicated, then artesunate is the drug of choice, {{except in the}} U.S., where it is not approved for use. Where an artemisinin-based combination therapy has been adopted as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria, {{it may also be}} used for P. vivax malaria in combination with primaquine for radical cure. An exception is artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP), which is not effective against P. vivax in many places. <b>Mefloquine</b> is a good alternative and in some countries is more readily available. [...] Atovaquone-proguanil is an effective alternative in patients unable to tolerate chloroquine. Quinine may be used to treat vivax malaria but is associated with inferior outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Bales had {{no history}} of mental disorder, and had {{undergone}} an extensive mental health screening to become a sniper in 2008. In 2010, he suffered a concussion in a car accident, underwent traumatic brain injury treatment at Fort Lewis, and was deemed healthy. Investigators examining his medical history described his ten-year U.S. Army tenure as [...] "unremarkable" [...] and {{found no evidence of}} serious traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress. A high-ranking U.S. official told The New York Times, [...] "When it all comes out, it will be a combination of stress, alcohol and domestic issues—he just snapped." [...] However, Bales had been taking an anti-malaria medication, <b>mefloquine,</b> now known to cause a wide range of side effects including psychiatric.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mefloquine</b> {{may cause}} {{abnormalities}} with heart rhythms that are visible on electrocardiograms. Combining <b>mefloquine</b> with other drugs that cause similar effects, such as quinine or quinidine, can increase these effects. Combining <b>mefloquine</b> with halofantrine can cause {{significant increases in}} QTc intervals.|$|E
50|$|In June 2010, {{the first}} case report {{appeared}} of a progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy being successfully treated with <b>mefloquine.</b> <b>Mefloquine</b> can also act against the JC virus. Administration of <b>mefloquine</b> seemed to eliminate the virus from the patient's body and prevented further neurological deterioration.|$|E
50|$|Liver {{function}} tests {{should be}} performed during long-term administration of <b>mefloquine.</b> Alcohol use should be avoided during treatment with <b>mefloquine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|All {{soldiers}} of the 43rd CSG were command directed to take a weekly dose of 250 MG of <b>Mefloquine</b> Hydrochloride (also known as Lariam or <b>Mefloquine)</b> an orally administered controversial medication used as a malarial chemoprophylaxis. This drug was recently added to the Department of Veterans Affairs War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) as a [...] "Potential Deployment Exposure." [...] This places <b>Mefloquine</b> {{in the same category}} as Agent Orange, Depleted Uranium, Burn Pits and others. Veterans who took <b>Mefloquine</b> should contact their VA Primary Health Care provider or the WRIISC 1-800-248-8005.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mefloquine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of seizures or a recent history of psychiatric disorders. Women should not become pregnant and should use effective birth control while taking <b>mefloquine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first randomized, {{controlled}} {{trial on}} a mixed population {{was performed in}} 2001. Prophylaxis with <b>mefloquine</b> was compared to prophylaxis with atovaquone-proguanil. Roughly 67% {{of participants in the}} <b>mefloquine</b> arm reported {{greater than or equal to}} one adverse event, vs 71% in the atovaquone-proguanil arm. In the <b>mefloquine</b> arm, 5% of the users reported severe events requiring medical attention, vs 1.2% in the atovaquone-proguanil arm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mefloquine</b> was {{formulated}} at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the 1970s {{shortly after}} the end of the Vietnam war. <b>Mefloquine</b> was number 142,490 of a total of 250,000 antimalarial compounds screened during the study.|$|E

50|$|A dose of 15-25 mg/kg is recommended, {{depending}} on the prevalence of <b>mefloquine</b> resistance.

It was not recommended for use during the first trimester, although considered safe during the second and third trimesters; nevertheless, in October 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its recommendation and approved use of <b>Mefloquine</b> for both prophylaxis and treatment of malaria in all trimesters, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed its categorization from C to B. <b>Mefloquine</b> frequently produces side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and dizziness. Several associations with neurological events have been made, namely affective and anxiety disorders, hallucinations, sleep disturbances, psychosis, toxic encephalopathy, convulsions and delirium.
