5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
500|$|The American poet Ezra Pound was {{introduced}} to the group in April 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own. In particular, Pound's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed, direct expression that he detected in the writings of Arnaut Daniel, Dante, and Guido Cavalcanti, amongst others. For example, in his 1911â€“12 series of essays I gather the limbs of Osiris, Pound writes of Daniel's line [...] "pensar de lieis m'es repaus" [...] ("it rests <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her") (from the canzone En breu brizara'l temps braus): [...] "You cannot get statement simpler than that, or clearer, or less rhetorical". These criteria of directness, clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry. Through his friendship with Laurence Binyon, Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining Nishiki-e prints at the British Museum, and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms.|$|E
2500|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he likes being with them. He likes being kidded-he likes being teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. [...] He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.|$|E
60|$|I said so to Miss Jillgall, and I say {{it again}} here. Nothing will induce <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> Helena.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wa-ant him <b>to.</b> Gi-gives <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> How've you been?' she panted. 'I wish chemists' shops hadn't red lights.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Stefan," [...] she whispered, [...] "what {{a narrow}} escape! It makes <b>me</b> tremble <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. They would have shot you, my Stefan!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Richardson was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. In January 1890, he spoke out against players like teammate John Clarkson who had joined the Brotherhood but remained with their old clubs. [...] Richardson said he would remain loyal to the Players' League even if it could only pay him $10 a week and added: [...] "I held up my hand and swore that I would stick to the brotherhood... I respect my word and regard my oath as sacred. [...] You have no idea how hot it makes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the way some of these players have acted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
60|$|I {{told her}} the reasons which induced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> hastening my departure, exactly as I have told them here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you write}} what you please, {{and read it}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It makes <b>me</b> sick <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Richard closed his eyes, and Mary wrote: ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{disposed}} to believe as he did, but yet {{the fact that}} the canoe could not be found caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> both <b>of</b> us were mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it was Sobber {{we ought}} to pay him back," [...] came from Songbird, grimly. [...] "A snake! Ugh, it makes <b>me</b> creep <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell, irately: [...] "Get {{you into}} this! Now, Amy, {{this is a}} little too much. You got {{yourself}} into it. You urged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> something--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, gentlemen. But {{really you}} have been my butts far too long for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{becoming}} yours. Madam, one word in private before I go.' ...|$|E
60|$|This was charming. She {{was such}} an {{extremely}} agreeable young person that it was delightful for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> myself in any way as her husband's successor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{talk like}} that! It makes <b>me</b> shiver <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. What {{in the world}} would we do if {{anything}} happened to poor, dear dad!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LYDIA Ma'am, {{you once}} {{commanded}} <b>me</b> never <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Beverley again--there is the man--I now obey you: for, from this moment, I renounce him for ever. [Exit.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask him {{if there}} are any snakes there, sir," [...] he said, and foolishly enough I put the {{question}} <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> other things.|$|R
6000|$|ELDRED [...] Heaven forbid that I should lift my {{hand against}} any man. [...] Eleanor, I have shed tears to-night, and it comforts [...] <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, {{come on to}} a hotel. Please do! It 'd just hurt <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you {{sleeping}} {{in one of them}} holes. I wouldn't sleep a bit if--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Serviss protested. [...] "Oh no! I haven't said that; but it troubled <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{her as a}} {{possible}} trickster. Please don't hint such a thing in Tolman's hearing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't it be great? But what a {{long time}} to wait! It makes <b>me</b> sick <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you out there riding mustangs and hunting bears and lions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will take}} us a long while to get rich, I'm afraid. It makes <b>me</b> tired <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. I guess we'd better go to sleep now, dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't talk of it, Ida; {{it makes}} <b>me</b> sick <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. I say--is {{that the old}} red rock where they saw {{the last of the}} poor little kid?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art {{good to me}} that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that {{in truth}} I know. But--but--it grieveth <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him that is to die, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It pleases {{you to make}} a joke of it, Kearny,' said I, without smiling. 'But it is no joke to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my Gatling {{mired in}} the river ooze.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Merciful me!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, {{putting her}} hand on her friend's shoulder. [...] "Supposin' you should find somethin', and we sleepin' here last night! It curdles <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it," [...] she said. [...] "You don't {{know what}} I have got <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> Give <b>me</b> till to-morrow; {{and let me}} write. Are you staying in Edinburgh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He did! But don't let's talk of it any more. It makes <b>me</b> angry <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him, and there's no use spoiling {{a lovely}} {{day like this}} by getting angry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{what you}} have said," [...] she pleaded. [...] "I have led a happy life; I am not used to suffer as I am {{suffering}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear life, {{what is it}} {{you doubt}} in me? Your earnestness not to do me harm makes it all the harder for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> never being more than a friend.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He said: [...] "Will {{you help}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{you while you}} are away? I want to imagine what your life is at home. Do {{you live in a}} town or in the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} he won't like it; but I can't help it if he don't. Harry ought to know that it's all {{nonsense}} for him and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> marrying. He does know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How stupid in <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that! Yes, thank you, I {{should like}} it very much;" [...] and {{producing}} her housewife, Sylvia fell {{to work with}} a brightening face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot but {{grieve for}} his sad condition, sir," [...] replied Anne, [...] "but as for {{anything}} more--it would make <b>me</b> shudder <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it--he {{is still too}} like Robin Goodfellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the work}} I {{had to put}} in," [...] said Lord Wisbeach, [...] "it makes <b>me</b> tired <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> some one else just walking in here as you did." ...|$|R
