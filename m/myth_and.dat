40|$|As {{the myth}} of the Eldorado evokes, {{international}} migration is partly shaped by the perceptions and imaginaries of migrants themselves. Beyond such cliché, however, there is little knowledge regarding the nature <b>and</b> influence of <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries on migration dynamics. As symbolic collective representations of individuals’ aspirations, hopes <b>and</b> dreams, <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries constitute an important part of migrants’ experiences and have concrete implications for the study of migration. This policy brief examines how migrants’ <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries influence the relationship between migration policies and migration movements. This policy brief focuses on four <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries that, after close analysis, shed new light on the dynamic interactions between migration policies and migration patterns. We have identified four myths based on discussions held among researchers and practitioners during a one-day symposium that we organized at the University of Ottawa in May 2014 : (1) {{the myth of}} the “migrant-as-hero”; (2) the myth of freedom of geographical mobility; (3) the <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries related to (im) migration categories; <b>and</b> (4) the <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries related to the country of destination as a country of human rights and better life. Based on a detailed analysis of these four myths, this policy brief reveals how <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries intervene as an additional element in the relationships between migration policies and migrants’ projects and strategies, and thus serves to move beyond simplified “dual” interactions between policies and migratory movements. We advance three policy-relevant recommendations: (1) more research is required to document the existence of a diversity of <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> to improve understanding of multiple influences migrants’ <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries have on the dynamics between migration policies and migrants’ projects; (2) because they have concrete implications at multiple levels, policy-makers should pay closer attention to migrants’ <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries; and (3) policy-making should adopt a more sensible approach to the particular context in which <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> imaginaries are (re) produced.

5|$|However, {{evidence}} {{pointing out}} that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E

5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth.

Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E

The text covers the period from World War II until the present day. Also, article is seeking for the political solution how to deal with <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> placing it in political context of apology and reconciliation in the Former Yugoslav Territories same as breaking the veil of secrecy in the Former Yugoslav Territories...|$|R

5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home of Clan MacIntyre is likewise {{the subject of}} conjecture. There is general agreement that the clan arose in the Hebrides, the islands west of the Scottish mainland. Some accounts, however, identify Skye as the ancestral home, while another tradition holds Islay {{to have been the}} locale. The story of how the clan made its way to the mainland and settled along the shore of Loch Etive in the vicinity of Ben Cruachan is again shrouded in <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> magic. It is said that seeking fresh pastures for their cattle they were initially obstructed by a mountain spirit. After testing their perseverance and courage the spirit instructed them to make their new home where the white cow in their herd should first lie down to rest. This site became known as Glen Noe.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting of}} the main series is a Northern European-style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> legends live side by side, while the {{spin-off}} game is set in an alternative reality leading {{from one of the}} first game's possible endings. The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities {{of a small group of}} protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Iron Age, {{there is}} much {{evidence}} for the use of horses in transport and battle, and for extensive trade between the inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast copper alloy cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. The horse was an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and <b>myth,</b> <b>and</b> is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|While Yeats's early poetry drew {{heavily on}} Irish <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> folklore, his later work was engaged with more {{contemporary}} issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His {{work can be}} divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as The Isle of Statues and The Wanderings of Oisin. His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist.|$|E
5|$|With this {{widespread}} appeal, {{the myth}} appears in more ancient texts {{than any other}} <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> in an exceptionally broad range of Egyptian literary styles. These sources also provide an unusual amount of detail. Ancient Egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague; the religious metaphors contained within the myths were more important than coherent narration. Each text that contains a myth, or a fragment of one, may adapt the myth to suit its particular purposes, so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events. Because the Osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways, different versions often conflict with each other. Nevertheless, the fragmentary versions, taken together, give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most Egyptian myths.|$|E

5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden tells {{a mythical}} saga of life's {{evolution}} on Earth, with a subtext of a creation <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> polytheistic evolution. The player takes {{the role of}} one of many billions of lifeforms created by Gaia, the nurturing and benevolent daughter of Sol, the Sun. Among the creatures known as life, there is a competition to evolve, and the best lifeform will eventually be granted the privilege of entering the Garden of Eden and becoming the husband and partner of Gaia. As the game progresses, it soon becomes apparent some mysterious external force is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner. Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously powerful beings that dominate all other lifeforms, overconsume resources and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue as intended.|$|E
5|$|Giorgio de Santillana, {{professor}} of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, along with Hertha von Dechend {{believed that the}} old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths {{are representative of the}} forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on <b>Myth</b> <b>and</b> the Frame of Time (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the precession of the equinoxes. Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|Human {{reactions}} to the sea are found in, for example, literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music, {{as well as in}} mythology and the psychotherapeutic interpretation of dreams. The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in <b>myth</b> <b>and</b> legend; its mention in proverbs and folk song; the use of ships in votive offerings; the importance of ships and the sea in initiation ceremonies and in mortuary rites; children playing with toy boats; adults making model ships; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters. Trade and exchange of ideas with neighbouring nations is one of the means by which civilizations advance and evolve. This happened widely among the ancient peoples living in lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in India, China and other Southeast Asian nations.

40|$|Pauline Melville’s The Ventriloquist’s Tale is an {{intricately}} layered {{novel in}} which the <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales of the Amerindians of Guyana, as they are represented in Melville’s novel, {{are engaged in a}} dialogue with their reality. This narrative/mythical dialogue results in enactments and re-enactments of the <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales, not only retelling them, but also recycling them, resulting in the Amerindians interpreting their <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales nonmetaphorically. Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of settings as chronotopes, “timespaces” in which time and space are inseparable from each other and from the theme, is used to define the distinct thematic qualities of the three narrative layers in the novel. I label these three chronotopes unfixed space, the juncture, and the interior. The interior is established as the chronotope {{in which the}} enactments <b>and</b> reenactments of <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales primarily take place, re/enactments which add yet another layer to the novel. I argue that the reason the chronotope of the interior is the nexus of these <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales is largely because the Amerindians adhere to a concept of time which is cyclical rather than linear. The enactments and reenactments are then unfolded as intentionally complex and contradictory threads, which are then untangled to show how the <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales are recycled in the novel. This untangling reveals how the threads interconnect, and how they can all {{be traced back to the}} narrator, the trickster deity Macunaima, suggesting he is as unbound by temporal and spatial limitations as the narrative layer of <b>myths</b> <b>and</b> folktales from which he has emerged...|$|R
