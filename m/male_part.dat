5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the <b>male</b> <b>part</b> of the icon. The torso, hip and pelvis {{of the female}} is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the <b>male</b> <b>part</b> of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. <b>Male</b> <b>part</b> of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E

25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina {{is short}} to very short. Oviduct is {{measuring}} about 2/3 {{of the length}} of the proximal part of the pedunculus, which is clearly shorter than its much narrower distal segment. Proximal part of the pedunculus about as broad as the proximal half of the oviduct, which is twice as broad as the distal half; the much narrower diverticulum reaches somewhat further than the bursa of the bursa copulatrix, which is separate from the spermoviduct. <b>Male</b> <b>part</b> of the genitalia forming a loop because the vas deferens and a short, most proximal part of the penis are united by a common sheath; with a single retractor muscle, inserting rather close {{to the beginning of the}} vas deferens, without a flagellum or caecum. The luminal structure, as far as visible in the transparent genital slides, enables the distinction of three segments: (1) a short broadest part with a relatively simple, longitudinal, luminal structure, (2) a much longer part, with a more complicated luminal surface of many protuberances that very gradually decrease in size towards segment (3), which has a wall structure with very small, irregular protuberances and changes into the epiphallus near the insertion site of the retractor muscle, without an obvious boundary.|$|E
500|$|Ron Lynch reprises {{his role}} as Mr. Pig in the episode; after the {{completion}} of [...] "Apple Thief", Ward wanted Mr. Pig to come back because he felt that both the character and Lynch's voice acting were funny. The titular song was written by McHale. When he was writing and recording the demo version, McHale, who has a penchant for [...] "smooth music", envisioned the female part to sound like Dolly Parton, and for the <b>male</b> <b>part</b> to be reminiscent of Meat Loaf.

[...] The famed prostitute Betsy Cox's 1773 listing {{describes}} how, when refused entry to {{a gathering of}} polite society at the newly opened Pantheon, she was helped by, among others, the Duke of Fife, who drew his sword to enforce her entry. [...] Some lists also contain defences of prostitution; earlier editions claim that the trade guarded against the seduction of young women, provided an outlet for frustrated married men, and kept other young men from [...] "le péche [...] que la Nature désavoue [...] ", or sodomy. [...] However, no such views were expressed with regard to lesbianism, which in England, unlike sexual acts between men, has never been illegal. [...] Miss Wilson of Cavendish Square thought that [...] "a female bed-fellow can give more real joys than ever she experienced with the <b>male</b> <b>part</b> of the sex", and Anne and Elanor Redshawe provided a discreet service in Tavistock Street, catering for [...] "Ladies in the Highest Keeping" [...] and other women who preferred to keep their activities private.|$|E

2500|$|Among their {{pantheon of}} deities, the Ngaju Dayak of Borneo worship Mahatala-Jata, an {{androgynous}} or transgender god. The <b>male</b> <b>part</b> of this god is Mahatala, who rules the Upperworld, and {{is depicted as}} a hornbill living above the clouds on a mountain-top; the female part is Jata, who rules the Underworld from under the sea {{in the form of}} a water-snake. These two manifestations are linked via a jewel-encrusted bridge that is seen in the physical world as a rainbow. Mahatala-Jata is served by [...] "balian", female hierodules, and [...] "basir" [...] transgender shamans metaphorically described as [...] "water snakes which are at the same time hornbills". Similar transgender shamans, the [...] "manang bali", are found in the Iban Dayak people. Girls fated to become manang bali may first dream of becoming a woman and also of being summoned by the god/dess Menjaya Raja Manang or the goddess Ini. Menjaya Raja Manang began existence as a malegod, until his brother's wife became sick. This prompted Menjara into becoming the world's first healer, allowing her to cure her sister-in-law, but this treatment also resulted in Menjara changing into a woman or androgynous being.|$|E

She had light-brown hair, which hung in dishevelled curls all round, a soft fair complexion, blue eyes, and a turned-up nose--a pert little nose that said plainly, [...] "I will have my own way; now see if I don't." [...] But the heart that {{animated}} the body to which that nose belonged, was a good, kind, earnest one; therefore, the nose having its own way was rather a blessing than otherwise to those happy individuals who dwelt habitually in the sunshine of Lizette's presence.|$|E

Mr. Sleary was reserved until the last. Opening his arms wide he took her by both her hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him crying.|$|E
