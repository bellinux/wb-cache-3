40|$|While {{power losses}} and {{efficiency}} of single components of electric <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems were researched extensively, the overall system efficiency has been rarely approached. The wide-spread applications of electric machines make them the largest electrical energy consumers, thus the efficiency of <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems is of fundamental effect on global energy consumption. Analytical efficiency modeling of <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems {{is a very difficult}} task due to complex interactions in a <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system (electrical, mechanical, magnetic, thermal, etc.). In this thesis, a novel method of applying black-box approaches for <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> efficiency modeling is presented. The proposed methodology is flexible and can be applied to any <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system where input and output powers and the control parameter can be measured or accurately estimated. The black-box methods do not model specific physical phenomena governing the system, but simply model the input-output relationship. The black-box modeling approach uses actual physical efficiency measurements of an experimental <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system. Such measurements include all possible interactions within the system, thus making the model comprehensive. Different methods of behavioral comprehensive black-box modeling approaches are presented and their accuracy is evaluated. Models are further benchmarked by assessing their ability to predict the value of the control parameter for maximum-efficiency operating points. One of the behavioral models is implemented on an experimental control platform and used to predict the control parameter for optimal efficiency operation. Finally, the developed models are scrutinized by comparing them to the current analytical knowledge...|$|R
40|$|AC motors {{have been}} used {{in a wide range of}} power ratings to date and are playing a {{prominent}} role in drive applications. However, their highly non-linear dynamic structure with strong dynamic interactions requires more complex control schemes than dc motors. [...] The conventional linear techniques can no longer satisfy the stringent requirement placed on high-performance ac <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> applications. Modern control techniques, such as optimal control and adaptive control, are applied in <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems. But the realization of these techniques is generally difficult because of large time-critical computation requirements. Typical field-oriented control of ac motors uses current loop sampling rates of 5 to 10 KHz. This implies that the controller must process the control algorithms within 100 to 200 μs. Thus, for high-performance ac drives, some powerful microcomputers, such as Transputers, and parallel processing techniques are used in ac <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems. On the other hand, reducing the energy losses in adjustable-speed electric <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> is becoming increasingly important due to the high cost of energy. [...] Transputer-based parallel processing of high performance ac <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> can be a good solution for fast dynamic calculation, flexible architecture and interactive control in order to achieve both requirements of high performance and loss minimization of ac <b>motor</b> <b>drives.</b> [...] The purpose of this study is to investigate and apply multiple Transputers in parallel processing of indirect field-oriented vector control employing loss minimization for high performance ac <b>motor</b> <b>drives.</b> A new scheme is proposed based on the use of multiple Transputers for real-time parallel processing implementation of the indirect field-oriented control scheme incorporating the loss minimization strategy. Losses in ac <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> are studied and verified by experiments. Computer simulation results of trials using five Transputers and experimental results of using four Transputers for parallel processing are presented in the thesis.
