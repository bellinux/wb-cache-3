Passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing both {{play an important role}} in the monitoring of forest biomass.

Both of these conditions decrease the estimation accuracy of forest biomass. A new optical and microwave integrated vegetation index (VI) was proposed based on observations from both field experiments and satellite (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RADARSAT- 2) data. According to the difference in interaction between the multispectral reflectance and <b>microwave</b> <b>backscattering</b> signatures with biomass, the combined VI (COVI) was designed using the weighted optical optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and microwave horizontally transmitted and vertically received signal (HV) to overcome the disadvantages of both data types.

The most accurate performance was obtained by the models based on the COVI and optical and microwave optimal variables excluding OSAVI and HV, in combination with a random forest algorithm and the largest number of reference samples. The results also revealed that the predictive accuracy depended highly on the statistical method and the number of sample units.

This modeling suite is assessed against measured snow on sea-ice geophysical properties and against measured active <b>microwave</b> <b>backscatter.</b> NARR data were input to the SNTHERM snow thermodynamic model in order to drive the MSIB model for comparison to detailed geophysical measurements and surface-based observations of C-band backscatter of snow on first-year sea ice. The NARR variables were correlated to available in situ measurements with the exception of long-wave incoming radiation and relative humidity, which impacted SNTHERM simulations of snow temperature. SNTHERM snow grain size and density were comparable to observations. The first assessment of the forward assimilation technique developed in this work required the application of in situ salinity profiles to one SNTHERM snow profile, which resulted in simulated backscatter close to that driven by in situ snow properties. In other test cases, the simulated backscatter remained 4 – 6 dB below observed for higher incidence angles and when compared to an average simulated backscatter of in situ end-member snow covers. Development of C-band inversion and assimilation schemes employing SNTHERM 89. rev 4 should consider sensitivity of the model to bias in incoming long-wave radiation, the effects of brine, and the inability of SNTHERM 89.

The study investigated differences in co-polarized backscatter observations from the scatterometer system for all three frequencies, modeled penetration depths, utilized co-pol ratios, and introduced dual-frequency ratios to discriminate dominant polarization-dependent frequencies from these snow covers. Results demonstrate that the measured co-polarized backscatter magnitude increased with decreasing snow thickness for all three frequencies, owing to stronger gradients in snow salinity within thinner snow covers. The innovative dual-frequency ratios suggest greater sensitivity of Ku-band microwaves to snow grain size as snow thickness increases and X-band microwaves to snow salinity changes as snow thickness decreases.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 <b>Microwave</b> <b>backscatter</b> is used {{to probe}} the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface. The SeaWinds {{scatterometer}} on QuikSCAT and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) are both microwave instruments that observe {{the state of the}} atmosphere. The Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX) was carried out in the summer of 1999 for the purpose of validating the TRMM PR. During KWAJEX measurements of the effect of rain on Ku-band <b>microwave</b> <b>backscatter</b> were made. At moderate and high incidence angles rain significantly increases surface backscatter. At low incidence angles few of the measurements proved to be statistically significant and a relationship between rain and surface backscatter could not be established. To verify our understanding of the effect of rain on sea-surface backscatter and to extend it to lower incidence angles, higher wind speeds, and other microwave frequencies, <b>microwave</b> <b>backscatter</b> from a rain-disturbed ocean surface is modeled. The modeled surface accounts for damping of surface waves by rain-induced subsurface turbulence and enhancement of gravity-capillary waves by rain-generated ring waves. The spectral representation of the ocean surface is used as input to a multiple scale (multiscale) scattering model, which separates surface waves into three distinct scales (short, intermediate, and long) and evaluates cross sections for each scale. At low incidence angles, Ku-band backscatter remains relatively unchanged because the enhancement of roughness by ring waves is compensated for by the damping of short gravity waves. At moderate and high incidence angles, rain increases the cross section and diminishes the wind relative directionality of the backscatter. To match the observations it is necessary to consider backscatter from stationary splash products which is substantial at high incidence angles. Although backscatter is dependent upon the wind at high wind speeds, relationships derived in rain-free conditions are invalid. Other commonly used microwave frequencies are significantly altered by rain. L-band backscatter decreases at low wind speeds, at moderate and high incidence angles. C- and Ka-band backscatter both increase and decrease, depending on the incidence angle and rain rate. It is also evident from the simulations that the contribution from stationary splash products will be significant at these frequencies...|$|E
