New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. Their status as favourites was enhanced when a young Jonah Lomu scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. They <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 15-12 to Joel Stransky's drop goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France {{over a period of}} ten years, but the United Kingdom soon <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the lead in production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.|$|E
5|$|In 1585, Queen Elizabeth I of England {{took the}} United Provinces of the Netherlands under her {{protection}} and signed the Treaty of Nonsuch with the States-General. England dispatched 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry soldiers to the Low Countries, and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, was proclaimed Governor-General of the Netherlands. Commanding untrained and badly paid levies, Leicester {{was unable to}} prevent the Army of Flanders under Alessandro Farnese, from seizing the towns of Grave, Venlo and Neuss, though he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Axel.|$|E

The factory team also brought an R91CP from Japan, which would compete in the invitiational class. Privateer Nova Engineering Racing ("From-A" [...] livery) would also come from Japan with their R91CK, also in the invitiational class. While the R90CKs suffered, the R91CP would <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the victory, nine laps ahead of a Jaguar. Nova Engineering would also <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> eighth place.|$|R

At his first European Championships, which were held in August in Munich, he again failed to progress from the qualifying round. With a best throw of 78.36metres he finished fifteenth overall, 68 centimetres behind Ari Pakarinen who secured the last spot in the final. Although Thorkildsen only <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> silver at the Norwegian championships behind Pål Arne Fagernes, his result of 83.43metres was enough to front the national top list in javelin throw for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese would {{subsequently}} {{attempt to}} occupy the city, but never <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it. In his journal of an expedition to the region in 1497-1499, the explorer João de Sá, who accompanied Vasco da Gama on the voyage, wrote that Magadoxo (Mogadishu) was controlled by Moors. A big town surrounded by four towers, it had houses several storeys high and large palaces in its center. De Sá and his men bombarded the city before continuing southwards along the seaboard. The Hawiye Somali, however, were later successful in defeating the Ajuran State and bringing {{about the end of}} Muzaffar rule.|$|E

The family moved to Nablus in the West Bank, then under Jordanian control. Abu Nidal graduated from high school there in 1955, and joined the Arab nationalist Ba'ath party. He began a degree course in engineering at Cairo University, but left without a degree after two years.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{attempt by}} I Corps {{to reach the}} city on D-Day was blocked by {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division and with the Germans committing most of the reinforcements sent to meet the invasion {{to the defense of}} Caen, the Anglo-Canadian front rapidly congealed short of Second Army's objectives. Operation Perch in the week following D-Day and Operation Epsom (26–30 June) brought some territorial gains and depleted its defenders but Caen remained in German hands until Operation Charnwood (7–9 July), when the Second Army <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the northern part of the}} city up to the River Orne in a frontal assault.|$|E
5|$|As {{holders of}} the competition, Arsenal was {{admitted}} into the Cup Winners' Cup for the 1994–95 season. They moreover contested in the 1994 European Super Cup, losing to Milan 2–0 on aggregate. In February 1995, Graham was sacked by Arsenal after it emerged he accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge {{for two of}} his clients: Jensen and Pål Lydersen. He was replaced by caretaker manager Stewart Houston (Bruce Rioch in the close season), who <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Arsenal into the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final after beating Sampdoria on penalties in the semi-finals. They however, did not retain the trophy after Real Zaragoza midfielder Nayim scored an extra-time goal, lobbing Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman.|$|E
5|$|Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders {{ignored the}} command, and Treviño Morales moved swiftly to avenge {{the death of}} his former comrade. On 30 January 2010, Treviño Morales kidnapped and {{slaughtered}} 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Veracruz that has led to thousands of deaths. Los Zetas used violent and intimidatory tactics to expand, forging a reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. It <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of most of the territories owned by the Gulf Cartel when they had essentially served as a single organization. With Treviño Morales as the second-in-command of the criminal organization, Los Zetas began killing Gulf Cartel members and other rival drug traffickers en masse and winning their territories.|$|E

5|$|By late 1461, risings in {{the north}} had been put down, and {{in the summer of}} 1462, Warwick {{negotiated}} a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which was accomplished by January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Sir Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt secure enough to travel south; in February he buried the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} title defense on August 29, 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of Israel, Halmich's last {{opponent}} before retiring. Following a close opening round, the boxing match {{turned into a}} brawl and Finer scored {{during the first half}} of the fight. From round five onwards, Kentikian <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision. On December 5, 2008, Kentikian faced Anastasia Toktaulova of Russia, the reigning GBU Flyweight Champion, although the GBU title was not on the line. During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent from the middle of the ring in most of the rounds. The three judges all scored the bout in favor of Kentikian. In December 2008, she was named Germany's female boxer of the year for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944, the {{situation}} on all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons. In a surprise attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 unserviceable aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.|$|E

5|$|RB Leipzig faced Sevilla in {{the opening}} match of the tournament; the German side were without striker Timo Werner, but manager Ralph Hasenhüttl named new signing Jean-Kevin Augustin in his first eleven. Midfielder Emil Forsberg forced Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico into action early on with a shot, but the ball was comfortably held on to. RB Leipzig {{continued}} to create chances and in the 18th minute a ball played over the Sevilla defence found Augustin. The forward's volley however flew over the goal and into the stand. Sevilla's first meaningful attack just after the half-hour mark resulted in a penalty. Bernardo's challenge on Walter Montoya in the penalty area was adjudged as a foul, despite video replays showing the defender <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the ball off the Sevilla midfielder. Wissam Ben Yedder stepped up to take the penalty and duly converted to give Sevilla the lead. The scoreline remained 1–0, despite both clubs' best efforts to score.|$|E

He fared better at the 1955 Pan American Games, taking home gold medals in both the individual and team versions of the rifle, three positions and prone at 50 meters, as well as the team high power rifle, three positions at 50 meters. He married Nancy Ord in 1956 and began training for that year's Summer Olympics, where he again finished 12th in a field of 44 competitors in the 50 m rifle three positions event and 31st in among 44 participants in the 50 m rifle prone tournament.|$|E

According to Charles Sévin, marquis de Quincy, a contemporary French artillery general and military historian of Louis XIV's reign, Juigné's corps was able to retreat to Olot in good order. On the other hand, the local 19th-century Catalan historian Esteve Paluzie i Cantalozella claimed that the French troops fled in disarray, leaving 150 prisoners to the Catalans, which they carried to Sant Esteve d'en Bas under a heavy escort.|$|E
