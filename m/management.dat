5|$|<b>Management</b> in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. <b>Management</b> comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business <b>management</b> came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource <b>management,</b> operations <b>management</b> (or production <b>management),</b> strategic <b>management,</b> marketing <b>management,</b> financial <b>management,</b> and information technology <b>management,</b> which was responsible for <b>management</b> information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide <b>management</b> into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of <b>management.</b> Design <b>management</b> overlaps mainly with the branches marketing <b>management,</b> operations <b>management,</b> and strategic <b>management.</b>|$|E
5|$|Architectural <b>management</b> can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of {{thinking}} which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural <b>management</b> as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural <b>management</b> has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural <b>management</b> has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to <b>management.</b> There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional <b>management</b> of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace <b>management</b> and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the <b>management</b> of architectural design, as well as architectural <b>management</b> in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural <b>management</b> falls into two distinct parts: office or practice <b>management</b> and project <b>management.</b> Office <b>management</b> provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural <b>management</b> extends between the <b>management</b> of the design process, construction, and project <b>management,</b> through to facilities <b>management</b> of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

5|$|Design <b>management</b> {{has taken}} a more {{strategic}} role within business since 2000, and more academic programs for design <b>management</b> have been established.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of <b>management’s</b> attitudes and {{responses}} to union activities in 20 call centres in Western Australia. Australian unions have identified call centres as an important sector to organise, but past research has acknowledged the importance of employer recognition of union rights to organise within the workplace as {{critical to the success}} of a union campaign. In addition, there is now substantial literature illustrating call centres as high control workplaces, and therefore difficult sites for unions to organise, although the question as to what extent these high control strategies reflect <b>management’s</b> attitude towards union organisation in call centres has been much less addressed. This article outlines <b>management's</b> stance towards unions within the sample of Western Australian call centres, detailing the forms their co-operation and resistance take. It explores the link between <b>management's</b> control strategies and their attitudes towards unions and, finally, identifies several factors influencing <b>management's</b> stance towards unions. ...|$|R
