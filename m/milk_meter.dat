40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} verify whether {{the time of day}} at which a milk sample is collected and the possible carryover in the milking system may affect pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) levels and, consequently, the pregnancy test results in dairy cows. In experiment one, we evaluated the effect of time of day at which the milk sample is collected from 51 cows. In experiment two, which evaluated the possible occurrence of carryover in the <b>milk</b> <b>meter</b> milking system, milk samples from 94 cows belonging to two different farms were used. The samples were subjected to pregnancy test using ELISA methodology to measure PAG concentrations and to classify the samples as positive (pregnant), negative (nonpregnant), or suspicious (recheck). We found that the time of milking did not affect the PAG levels. As to the occurrence of carryover in the <b>milk</b> <b>meter,</b> the PAG levels of the samples collected from Farm- 2 were heavily influenced by a carryover effect compared with the samples from Farm- 1. Thus, milk samples submitted to a pregnancy test can be collected during the morning or the evening milking. When the sample is collected from the milk meters, periodic equipment maintenance should be noted, including whether the <b>milk</b> <b>meter</b> is totally drained between different animals’ milking and equipment cleaning between milking is performed correctly to minimize the occurrence of carryover, thereby avoiding the effect on PAG levels and, consequently, the pregnancy test results. Therefore, a single milk sample can be used for both milk quality tests and pregnancy test...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the variability in cow´s milk somatic cell counts (SCC) depending on the type of <b>milk</b> <b>meter</b> used by dairy farms for official milk recording. The study was performed in 2011 and 2012 in the major cattle area of Spain. In total, 137, 846 lactations of Holstein-Friesian cows were analysed at 1, 912 farms. A generalised least squares regression model was used for data analysis. The model showed that the <b>milk</b> <b>meter</b> had a substantial effect on the SCC for individual milk samples obtained for official milk recording. The results suggested an overestimation of the SCC in milk samples from farms that had electronic devices in comparison with farms that used portable devices and underestimation when volumetric meters are used. A weak positive correlation was observed between the SCC and the percentage of fat in individual milk samples. The results underline the importance of considering this variable when using SCC data from milk recording in the dairy herd improvement program or in quality milk programs. ...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{monitoring}} {{might be}} an alternative for periodic checking of electronic <b>milk</b> <b>meters.</b> A computer model based on Dynamic Linear Modelling (DLM) has been developed for this purpose. Two situations are distinguished: more milking stands in the milking parlour and only one milking stand in the milking parlour, e. g. in case of robotic milking. In the first case the model {{is based on a}} comparison per milking session of the average per stand with the overall average over all stands. The model calculates a stand deviation factor per stand after each milking session. In the second case the model is based on a comparison of the measured milk with the total collected milk. The model calculates a separation term and a deviation factor after each collection to the milk. The measured milk yields of two experimental farms, one with and one without a milking robot, were used to test the model. It was possible to fit the stand deviation factor with the model for the comparison of milking stands. This factor can be interpreted as the relative error per milking stand and per milking session. The results correspond globally with routine control results. The results of the model at the milking robot farm for the comparison of measured and collected milk were hampered by unknown separations. The conclusions of this research are: Automated monitoring of <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> by a comparison of the average per stand with the overall average is possible. Validation on more farms is wanted. The measured milk yield should be corrected by the stand deviation factor if it is used for management purposes. Automated monitoring of <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> on <b>milk</b> robot farms by a comparison of the measured milk with the collected milk seems possible, provided that separated milk is recorded properly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Techniques for {{measuring}} the level of milking vacuum are presented and discussed {{with reference to the}} specifications given in ISO Standard 5707 and ASABE standard S 518. Common measurement and interpretation errors are illustrated in this paper along. Milking-time tests of average claw vacuum were shown to compare well to wet-tests (done with a milk flow simulator). Knowledge of simultaneous milk flow rate, either by using a flow simulator with a known flow rate or by estimating milk flow rate using <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> improves predictive ability and can provide better information from measurements made on fewer cows. The wet tests provide a more accurate assessment of differences between system configurations because the liquid flow rate is more precisely known and the cow-to-cow variation is eliminated...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} related to the POM - Measure 2 - Project B 15 “Veterinary {{services}} computerization and technical support to livestock farms”, in which innovative plants solutions has been introduced to recognize the single animal to measure the quantity of produced milk, to centralize and automate the management, in different cow and sheep and goats breedings in Puglia and Basilicata regions. The experimentation has foreseen dynamic tests, during the real milking of the cows, in an apulian plant in which different measurers of the quantity of milk have been installed: weigh jar, electronic weighing “bascule” milk-meter, electronic proportional milk-meter. In a mechanical point of view, the vacuum level and the vacuum fluctuations in three different milk pipe sections have been valued: at short milk tube, downstream from the claw, prior to the <b>milk</b> <b>meter.</b> Comparing the results, authors deduced that the electronic milk-meters, like the electronic proportional <b>milk</b> <b>meter,</b> allows inferior vacuum degree variations and less mechanical solicitations in cow udder; such situation is particularly evident with higher milk flow. The study also underlines that the vacuum drops during milking can be very critical if not immediately compensate with a suitable planning and periodic revision of the plants...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} compare the milking ability of ewes from pure European breeds (Tsigai, Improved Valachian, Lacaune, and their crosses) {{on the basis of}} their milk flow {{kinetics}} during machine milking throughout lactation. Ewes of the Tsigai (TS, n = 13), Improved Valachian (IV, n = 12), Lacaune (LC, n = 12), TS x LC (50 %, n = 12) and IV x LC (50 %, n = 12) on their 1 - 3 lactation were used. The ewes were in their 74 +/- 12 d of lactation at the beginning of the experiment. Milk flow data of each ewe were recorded during one evening milking in the middle of four successive months (May, June, July, and August). Milk flow was recorded by means of an automatic collecting jar equipped with an electronic <b>milk</b> <b>meter</b> device working in every 1 -s intervals. The milk flow curves were classified into three types: 1 peak (1 P), 2 peaks (2 P) and plateau (PL). The highest values of repeatability of parameters were found for stripped milk yield (SMY), maximum milk flow, latency time and milk yield at 30 s (over 0. 52). The lowest values were recorded for machine milking time (MMT), machine milk yield (MMY) and time to reach maximum milk flow (< 0. 33). Month of lactation significantly influenced most of the milkability data except latency time and time to maximum flow rate. The effect of genotype showed highly significant influence on most of the analyzed parameters. The lowest total milk yield (TMY) and MMY were measured in pure TS (0. 348 +/- 0. 021 and 0. 266 +/- 0. 0211, respectively) and IV breeds (0. 320 +/- 0. 0221 and 0. 259 +/- 0. 0211, respectively) as compared with Lacaune (0. 524 +/- 0. 0221 and 0. 360 +/- 0. 0211, respectively). The highest TMY and MMY were measured in ewes with PL milk flow types and the lowest in ewes with 1 P. Ewes with 1 P showed clearly shorter MMT and higher percentage of SMY as compared to PL and 2 P though SMY did not differ among groups. Interaction of milk flow type and stage of lactation influenced TMY and MMY, maximum milk flow, milk yield in 30 s of milking and MMT. A clear effect of milk flow type on TMY and MMY was observed each month...|$|E
40|$|During the 1986 - 1987 and 1987 - 1988 dairy seasons, milk {{samples were}} taken from cows within three New Zealand dairy herds. Individual quarter foremilk samples were taken using aseptic precautions, and whole udder, {{composite}} samples were obtained using a <b>milk</b> <b>meter,</b> at monthly intervals. The three herds differed with respect to herd size, milking shed design, use of teat spraying, and the incidence of mastitis, both past and present. The bacteriological status of each quarter was determined, {{and the ability of}} the following parameters to distinguish between infected and uninfected quarters, and between infected and uninfected cows was ascertained. (1) Somatic cell count (2) Sodium concentration (3) Potassium concentration (4) Electrical conductivity (5) pH (6) Lactose concentration (7) N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity (8) α 1 -antitrypsin concentration With the exception of the antitrypsin concentration, the concentration of each parameter in the milk changed during the course of milk removal. The effect of this variation on the composition of the composite milk sample is discussed. The stage of lactation at which the sample was taken exerted a significant effect on the level of each parameter in quarter foremilk samples. Similar effects were observed with composite samples, although statistical significance was not reached in every instance. Both infected and uninfected udder quarters were affected by the stage of lactation. The age of the cow exerted a significant effect on the levels of a number of the parameters within quarter foremilk samples. The effect of age of the cow on the level of each parameter within composite milk samples was generally not significant. The bacteriological status of the udder quarter exerted a significant effect on the level of each parameter in {{at least one of the}} three herds. The effect of the bacteriological status on the pH and on the potassium concentration of the milk was smaller in degree than was the effect on the remaining parameters. The herds differed with respect to bacteriological findings. Herd A showed a lower incidence of infection than did herds B or C The incidence of infection with minor pathogens was highest within herd B, while the incidence of infection with major pathogens was highest within herd C. The incidence of infection tended to increase with the age of the cow. While each of the eight parameters showed high specificity, the sensitivity was generally lower. An exception to this finding was the somatic cell count which showed both high sensitivity and high specificity. The somatic cell count was able to correctly classify more than 75 % of quarter foremilk samples in each of the three herds, being more consistent in this respect than were any of the other parameters, the diagnostic abilities of which varied between herds. The addition of second parameter to a model containing the somatic cell count generally did not increase the diagnostic accuracy of the system. The threshold value was found to vary both between herds, and between stages of the lactation, this variation being greatest for the somatic cell count. Providing that the threshold is adjusted for the stage of lactation, the somatic cell count is able to accurately predict the infection status throughout the dairy season. The selected threshold should take into account the level of bacterial infection within the particular herd to which it will be applied...|$|E

40|$|Large, {{progressive}} dairies {{are faced}} with a dilemma: How to operate a capital-intensive, labor-intensive parlor in a manner to allow calm milking of all cows on a regular schedule without sacrificing either production or milk quality. While this dilemma seems insurmountable on many dairies, careful analysis of the on-farm milking process can often find the “extra ” time needed to ensure production of high quality milk from high producing individuals without unnecessarily slowing cow throughput. One tool that has helped find this extra time without sacrificing good parlor performance has been the information and reports obtained from in-line <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> and management software. Determining Parlor Efficiency The goals for parlor efficiency could be described as follows: · Have cows enter the parlor and occupy stalls calmly yet quickly. · Have the milker begin an excellent udder prep routine within 60 seconds of cow entry.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} fresh-cow handling practices and techniques used during fresh cow evaluations to identify postpartum health disorders on 45 dairy farms in California ranging from 450 to 9, 500 cows. Fresh cow practices were surveyed regarding (a) grouping and housing, (b) scheduling and work organization, (c) screening for health disorders, and (d) physical examination methods. Information was collected based on cow-side observations and responses from fresh cow evaluators. Cows were housed in the fresh cow pen for 3 to 14 (20 %), 15 to 30 (49 %), or > 31 (31 %) d in milk. Fresh cow evaluations were performed daily (78 %), 6 times a week (11 %), 2 to 5 times a week (9 %), or were not routinely performed (2 %). There was significant correlation between the duration of fresh cow evaluations and the number of cows housed in the fresh pen. Across all farms, the duration of evaluations ranged from 5 to 240 min, with an average of 16 s spent per cow. During fresh cow checks, evaluators always looked for abnormal vaginal discharge, retained fetal membranes, and down cows. Dairies evaluated appetite based on rumen fill (11 %), reduction of feed in the feed bunk (20 %), rumination sensors (2 %), or a combination of these (29 %). Milk yield was evaluated based on udder fill at fresh cow checks (40 %), milk flow during milking (11 %), milk yield records collected by <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> (2 %), or a combination of udder fill and <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> (5 %). Depressed attitude was evaluated on 64 % of the dairies. Health-monitoring exams for early detection of metritis were implemented on 42 % of the dairies based on rectal examination (13 %), rectal temperature (22 %), or both (7 %). Dairies implementing health-monitoring exams took longer to perform fresh cow evaluations. Physical examination methods such as rectal examination, auscultation, rectal temperature evaluation, and cow-side ketosis tests were used on 76, 67, 38, and 9 % of dairies, respectively. Across dairies, we found large variation in signs of health disorders screened and how those signs were evaluated. Fresh cows were primarily evaluated based on nonspecific and subjective observations during screening. Future research efforts should focus on developing and validating scoring systems to more objectively identify health disorders in postpartum cows...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the {{research}} described in this thesis was to lay a proper foundation for designing and conducting efficient control and eradication programs for infection with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in the Canadian dairy industry. The objective in Chapter 2 was to identify potentially important risk factors for BLV infection in Canadian dairy herds. Of 272 study herds, from 8 provinces of Canada and tested during 1998 - 2003, 78 % were BLV-positive. Over 15 management determinants for the infection were evaluated. Herds with clinical cases of leukosis during the 12 months prior to sampling, as well as herds which purchased animals with unknown BLV infection status {{in the last five}} years, had a significantly increased proportion of BLV-positive cows. Herds from eastern provinces and those not purchasing cows {{in the last five years}} were more likely to be free from BLV compared to western provinces and farms purchasing cows in the last five years. The objective in Chapter 3 was to determine the lifetime effects of BLV infection on milk production and longevity of dairy cows in Canada. Overall, 4052 cows from 348 herds were enrolled in a historical cohort study, based on test results from 1998 - 2003 and lactation and culling records post-testing until 2013. Positive cows to BLV had consistently greater probability of being culled (or dying) than the negative cows (over lifetime lactations 2 - 7). Only BLV-positive cows with short longevity (2 and 3 lifetime lactations) had a significantly lower lifetime milk production compared with their negative counterparts. As the cows lived longer (> 3 lactations), the difference in milk production between the two cohorts was no longer significant. The objectives of Chapter 4 were: 1) to assess the potential for carryover of antibodies against BLV in milk samples obtained from shared meters; and 2) to determine if adjustment of the diagnostic test cut-off value would improve the test characteristics for meter-collected milk ELISA results. The study included 236 paired milk samples from 8 dairy farms in Prince Edward Island collected in 2013. Two simultaneous milk samples, one hand-collected at the beginning of milking, and the other from the corresponding <b>milk</b> <b>meter,</b> were taken from all lactating cows that were milked at the selected meters. The sequence of cows using each meter was recorded. Carryover of BLV antibodies at shared milk meters was significant. For low-titer cows, the carryover effect was positively associated with the titer of the preceding cows. This could result in generating false-positive results in the BLV antibody-ELISA test on meter-collected samples from dairy herd improvement (DHI) procedures. Based on a new optimal cut-point, a suspicious category on the ELISA titers was defined, and a retest on the samples falling within this range was recommended to reduce the false positive rate. The objectives for Chapter 5 were: 1) to determine the prevalence of BLV infection at the herd level using a bulk-tank milk (BTM) antibody ELISA in the Maritime region of Canada; and 2) to develop applied statistical models for predicting within-herd prevalence of BLV infection using the BTM antibody levels. To detect BLV infection and the antibody levels, a census was implemented on BTM samples from all dairy farms in the Maritime region in 2013 (3 monthly rounds of sampling on 623 farms). Another round of BTM sampling was coincided with individual cow sampling (all cows that contributed milk to the fourth BTM) in 90 selected herds. Herd-level prevalence of BLV in the Maritime region was 90. 8 %. In the individual testing, 30. 4 % of cows were positive. The statistical models developed in this study were able to predict true within-herd prevalence of BLV reasonably well based only on the BTM results. The model including all BTM tests (4 rounds of sampling) as the predictor had the best fit, although the models using 2 and 3 BTM tests provided similar results to 4 repeated tests. The focus for Chapter 6 was to assess the diagnostic performance of a commercially available ELISA for detecting BLV antibodies in BTM samples collected from dairy herds in Eastern Canada in 2013. Of 133 tested herds, 108 herds were found to be truly infected. At the resulting optimal cut-point, sensitivity and specificity of the BTM ELISA were estimated at 0. 972 (0. 921 – 0. 994) and 1 (0. 863 – 1), respectively. With the high prevalence of BLV infection across Canada and its detrimental economic impacts, pursuing broad-based control programs is necessary. All of the findings in the present research could contribute to designing and conducting efficient BLV control programs...|$|E

40|$|Objective The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{describe}} the relationship between milk yield and lactation number, stage, length and milking frequency in Korean Holstein dairy cows using an automatic milking system (AMS). Methods The original data set consisted of observations from April to October 2016 of 780 Holstein cows, with a total of 10, 751 milkings. Each time a cow was milked by an AMS during the 24 h, the AMS management system recorded identification numbers of the AMS unit, the cow being milking, date and time of the milking, and milk yield (kg) as measured by the <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> installed on each AMS unit, date and time of the lactation, lactation stage, milking frequency (NoM). Lactation stage is defined as the number of days milking per cows per lactation. Milk yield was calculated per udder quarter in the AMS and was added to 1 record per cow and trait for each milking. Milking frequency was measured the number of milkings per cow per 24 hour. Results From the study results, a significant relationship was found between the milk yield and lactation number (p 201 days) of cows. Also, milking frequency had a significant influence on milk yield (p< 0. 001) in Korean Holstein cows using AMS. Conclusion Detailed knowledge of these factors such as lactation number, stage, length, and milking frequency associated with increasing milk yield using AMS will help guide future recommendations to producers for maximizing milk yield in Korean Dairy industries...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{accuracy}} of milk-sampling devices used on farms with automated milking systems (AMS) {{is essential for}} development of milk recording protocols. The hypotheses {{of this study were}} (1) devices used by AMS units are similarly accurate in estimating milk yield and in collecting representative milk samples compared with devices used by certified milk recording providers on farms with conventional milking systems (CMS) and (2) devices used on both AMS and CMS comply with accuracy criteria described by the New Zealand Standard and by the International Committee of Animal Recording (ICAR). Milk recording data from 5 AMS farms were collected during 13 milk recording test days between December 2011 and February 2013. Milk yield was estimated by ICAR-approved <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> on AMS units. Milk samples were collected over a 48 -h period and submitted to an off-site certified laboratory for milk composition analysis. Data were also collected manually from 5 to 10 cows per AMS unit; a complete milking of a cow was weighed to serve as gold standard for milk yield, and 3 milk samples per cow milking were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to serve as gold standards for milk composition. A similar procedure was used during 6 milk recording occasions with devices used during conventional milk recording at a CMS research farm. Farm type, breed, season, and region did not appear to affect accuracy of devices used on AMS units. <b>Milk</b> <b>meters</b> used by AMS units complied with ICAR limits in 12. 5 and 25 % of the milk recording test days for test bucket weights between 2 and 10 kg and for test bucket weights > 10 kg, respectively. These percentages were 52 and 42 %, respectively, for devices used on CMS. Analyzing all samples as one milk recording test day, 1. 4 % fell outside the 20 % difference band for AMS compared with 1. 1 % of the milk samples for CMS. Devices used by AMS complied with ICAR in 73 % of the milk recording test days for fat percentage, compared with 42 % of the milk recording test days by devices used at the CMS farm. When analyzing all milk samples as one milk recording test day, 3. 5 % of the milk samples fell outside the 99 % ICAR limit for AMS compared with 17. 2 % of the milk samples for CMS. Applying the ICAR standards for fat percentage to crude protein percentage and SCC, devices used on AMS were accurate in estimating crude protein percentage but not in estimating SCC. Thus, devices on AMS units did not comply with national nor ICAR standards with regard to milk yield and fat percentage. However, devices used on AMS were similarly or more accurate compared with devices used during conventional milk recording. It is proposed that devices used on AMS units, when calibrated regularly and when set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction, have similar or improved accuracy compared with CMS devices. Because the New Zealand industry accepts data from devices currently used by certified providers for milk recording on CMS farms, results imply that the AMS devices should also be permitted to be used for milk recording...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 9 {{multiparous}} dromedary camels in late {{stage of lactation}} (287 ± 8 DIM; 3. 8 ± 0. 8 kg/d) were used to study the effect of manual udder stimulation on machine milking efficiency of dairy camels under intensive management condition. Experimental design consisted of 3 x 3 Latin square with 9 animals allocated randomly and equally to 3 treatment (T 1 = 60 s, T 2 = 90 s and T 3 = 120 s). All camels were machine milked twice daily. Milk yield and milk flow parameters were recorded by Lactocorder® <b>milk</b> <b>meters.</b> Udder health was evaluated by California mastitis test (CMT) and somatic cell counts (SCC). Cisternal milk was determined 14 h after milking using Atosiban®. Volumes of machine milk (MM), machine stripping milk (MSM) and residual milk (RM) were recorded in duplicate. No subclinical mastitis was detected during the experimental period {{as indicated by the}} CMT ( 25 %). The increase of udder stimulation from T 1 to T 3 decreased (p< 0. 05) the lag time (LT) (3. 83 to 2. 24 sec) in camels of G 1 and the MSM (26. 6 to 14. 8 %) as well as RM (46. 1 to 31. 4 %) in camels of G 2. Bimodal curves tended (P= 0. 08) to decrease from 43. 6 % to 28. 1 % when duration of udder stimulation increased from T 1 to T 3 in camels of G 2. In conclusion, increase duration of manual udder stimulation to 90 – 120 s ameliorate the machine milking efficiency in harder milked camels at late stage of lactation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|In dairy cattle, {{milk flow}} is an {{important}} functional trait which impacts production. Milk flow can be measured accurately by electronic <b>milking</b> <b>meters</b> (EMM) and robots. It is necessary to understand {{the implications of the}} transition from the use of subjective scores (milkability, from very slow - 1 to very fast - 5) to objective measurements (milk flow, kg/min), as well as the genetic (co) variation of the traits and with production and health traits. Records from Finnish Ayrshire primiparous cows were analysed for milkability, milk flow, annual milk yield and somatic cell count (SCC). Milk flow was recorded by Tru-Test (EMM) and the Lely robot milking systems. A total of 64 696 cows were analysed for milkability, 1618 cows for Tru-Test and 2232 cows for Lely. To estimate variance components, heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations, both single and two-trait animal models were fitted and analysed under REML using the DMU software. Heritability of milkability was 0. 25 (standard error 0. 01). For milk flow, heritability was 0. 41 (0. 08) and 0. 52 (0. 08) for Tru-Test and Lely, respectively. The genetic correlations with milk yield were 0. 10 (0. 04), 0. 43 (0. 14) and 0. 37 (0. 14), and with SCC, 0. 50 (0. 04), 0. 42 (0. 17) and 0. 35 (0. 17) for milkability, Tru-Test and Lely, respectively. Common sires provided a way to find the correlation between milkability and milk flow in the absence of common records; the results were positive but low. In conclusion, selection for milk flow is more efficacious than for milkability demonstrating the influence of quality and volume of recording on estimating heritability and genetic correlation...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was that sensors currently available on farm that monitor behavioral and physiological characteristics have {{potential for the}} detection of lameness in dairy cows. This was tested by applying additive logistic regression to variables derived from sensor data. Data were collected between November 2010 and June 2012 on 5 commercial pasture-based dairy farms. Sensor data from weigh scales (liveweight), pedometers (activity), and <b>milk</b> <b>meters</b> (<b>milking</b> order, unadjusted and adjusted milk yield in the first 2 min of milking, total milk yield, and milking duration) were collected at every milking from 4, 904 cows. Lameness events were recorded by farmers who were trained in detecting lameness before the study commenced. A total of 318 lameness events affecting 292 cows were available for statistical analyses. For each lameness event, the lame cow's sensor data for a time period of 14 d before observation date were randomly matched by farm and date to 10 healthy cows (i. e., cows that were not lame and had no other health event recorded for the matched time period). Sensor data relating to the 14 -d time periods were used for developing univariable (using one source of sensor data) and multivariable (using multiple sources of sensor data) models. Model development involved the use of additive logistic regression by applying the LogitBoost algorithm with a regression tree as base learner. The model's output was a probability estimate for lameness, given the sensor data collected during the 14 -d time period. Models were validated using leave-one-farm-out cross-validation and, {{as a result of this}} validation, each cow in the data set (318 lame and 3, 180 nonlame cows) received a probability estimate for lameness. Based on the area under the curve (AUC), results indicated that univariable models had low predictive potential, with the highest AUC values found for liveweight (AUC= 0. 66), activity (AUC= 0. 60), and milking order (AUC= 0. 65). Combining these 3 sensors improved AUC to 0. 74. Detection performance of this combined model varied between farms but it consistently and significantly outperformed univariable models across farms at a fixed specificity of 80 %. Still, detection performance was not high enough to be implemented in practice on large, pasture-based dairy farms. Future research may improve performance by developing variables based on sensor data of liveweight, activity, and milking order, but that better describe changes in sensor data patterns when cows go lame...|$|R

During the pre-partum training sessions, an animal was moved to the milking parlour (tandem 3 x 3) and left for 10 min in the milking stall, where the udder was thoroughly washed and massaged for 1 min. The massage included the stripping of the teats. Once calved, all the heifers were observed in the parlour for their first milking then on 7 occasions (3, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56 days after calving) during afternoon milking. The behaviours, recorded from the entrance in the milking stall to the removal of milking cluster, were step (foot lifted less than 15 cm off of the ground) and kick (foot raised above 15 cm off of the ground, even if a clear kick was not visible). Milk flow profiles were measured with electronic mobile <b>milk</b> flow <b>meters.</b> <b>Milk</b> samples were also collected to assess milk quality (CFU, SCC, lactose, protein, and fat). All variables were analysed with a linear mixed model for repeated measures. Animals of group T performed a lower number of steps (0. 08 - 0. 03 vs 0. 20 - 0. 03 n/min) and kicks(0. 13 - 0. 04 vs 0. 26 - 0. 03 n/min) than C animals. A reduction of number of kicks was observed as the lactation proceeded. Milk quality, milk production and milk flow profile were not affected by treatment. It can be concluded that a milking pre-partum training would reduce the level of fear in buffalo heifers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of six different working vacuum levels (range from 37 to 52 kPa) on the milk production, milk flow rate and milking times in Mediterranean Italian buffalo. A total of eight hundred and one milk flow curves were recorded at random from all of the four hundred and fifty animals in different parity and stage of lactation over a period of 12 weeks, with electronic <b>milk</b> flow <b>meters</b> (Lactocorder®). The different vacuum levels tested did not affect significantly the individual milk production per milking (on average 4. 02 ± 0. 06 kg). When diminishing vacuum level, a decrease in average and peak flow rate occurred (P< 0. 001), as well as an increase in effective milking time between attaching the teat cup and reaching the value of 0. 20 kg/min at the end of milking (P< 0. 001).  The vacuum levels of 37 and 40 kPa showed good milkability conditions, at which plateau phase was longer than decline phase and lag time was not affected by vacuum level. </p...|$|R

The highest average milk flow rate (3. 01 kg. min- 1) and the highest average peak milk flow rate (4. 96 kg. min- 1) were found in cows in second lactation, in comparison with primiparous cows (2. 87 kg. min- 1, and 4. 37 kg. min- 1) and cows in another lactation (2. 7 kg. min- 1, and 4. 3 kg. min- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] - The {{conservation}} of milk is of major concern {{in developing countries}} like India, {{due to the lack}} of supply at many household in rural and Industrial areas. In existing system a collection vehicle is assigned for each group of areas. If the vehicle fails to arrive at a particular destination at correct time the milk gets spoiled and becomes useless. The proposed method eliminates this drawback by sensing the quality of <b>milk</b> using pH <b>meter.</b> The pH value of good quality milk is 6. 7 and higher or lower pH values degrade the quality of milk. This technique directs the vehicle to the appropriate places using alert SMS so that the collection of milk may be fastened up which leads to its ultimate conservation by using wireless sensor networks with induced artificial intelligence...|$|R

A total of 330 milk flow recorders were collected during morning and evening milkings by using an electronic <b>milk</b> flow <b>meters</b> (Lactocorder (R)). <b>Milk</b> flow curves were examined and subject were divided according milk flow pattern in: normal pattern, bimodal pattern and "double pattern". Data were analysed by using ANOVA and Chi square test. Total milk yield per milking was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in pluriparous and consistent with the average DIM of 205 days. No differences in milk yield and maximum milk flow were found between the oxytocin groups while both parameters were higher in bimodal and double pattern groups compared to normal milk flow pattern. Lag time was higher (P< 0. 01) in oxytocin treated group and in normal vs the other two pattern groups. Length of main milking phase was higher in pluriparous, oxytocin treated group (P< 0. 01) and in bimodal vs the normal one (P< 0. 05) while double pattern showed the highest value (P< 0. 01). Percentage of bimodal milk flow was 13. 7 % while a double flow pattern was 12. 4 %.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} milking ability in dromedary camels, 124 milk flow curves were registered during morning milking of 20 dairy Maghrebi dromedary camels. Animals were in lactations 1 - 8, were 6 - 19 {{years old and}} were 4 - 15 months of their current lactation. Milk flow curves were recorded using an electronic <b>milk</b> flow <b>meter</b> (Lactocorder®). <b>Milk</b> flow curves were classified in three typical patterns: type 1 represents curves with one high and short peak of milk flow; type 2 represents curves with a moderate mean milk flow rate during a large plateau phase; and type 3 represents curves with lower mean milk flow rate and a relatively longer milking duration. The ratio of the different milk flow patterns in the population evaluated was 40 : 38 : 22 % for types 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The highest milk yield per milking, average and peak milk flow were observed in camels with type 1 curves (4 · 24 kg, 1 · 49 and 3 · 54 kg/min, respectively) followed by type 2 animals (3 · 30 kg, 1 · 12 and 2 · 12 kg/min, respectively) and lastly type 3 curves (2 · 34 kg, 0 · 65 and 1 · 23 kg/min, respectively). This study confirmed that a major proportion of dromedary camels have a suitable machine milking ability. Nevertheless, our results suggest that pre-stimulation and improving the milking process may improve milking efficiency and guarantee a more complete and rapid emptying of the udder...|$|R

40|$|The {{immediate}} effect on dairy cow mobility, daily activity and milk yield following treatment for claw horn disease was examined in 306 lame cows located on four Cheshire dairy farms over twelve months. The daily activity and milk yield of all cows in these herds was recorded on computer using pedometers and in-parlour <b>milk</b> flow <b>meters.</b> Lame cows identified by stockmen were assessed subjectively by locomotion score, then restrained and their claws examined {{to identify the}} predominant lesion present. Those with locomotion scores > 2. 5 that presented with sole ulcer, haemorrhage and bruising, or white line disease were studied. Claws of the affected limb were trimmed by one paraprofessional claw trimmer using the five-step Dutch method and the affected claw unloaded either by trimming or application of a block to the healthy digit: those on the contra-lateral limb were trimmed similarly. The same observer repeated the locomotion score assessment seven days later: trimming reduced the proportion of lame cows (score > 3) by 55 % and those with poor gait (score 2. 5) by 49 %, {{and the proportion of}} all cows not lame after trimming was 51 % (χ 2 4. 94 : P≤ 0. 001). Night time activity levels increased from 76 to 81 steps/hour on day 2 after treatment (P< 0. 05) but this was not maintained: daily milk yields fell by 2 %. Using univariate mixed models, year and season, parity and farm all had significant effects on locomotion and activity levels.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between milk flow traits, milk Somatic Cell Count (SCC) and teat apex score in primiparous cows during the first 120 days of lactation. A total of 82 primiparous Holstein cows were randomly selected in 6 herds characterized by different milking machines and management. The cows were monitored monthly during the first 120 days of lactation. Each month, milk flow curves of the whole udder of each primiparous cow were registered with continuous electronic <b>milk</b> flow <b>meters</b> (Lactocorder), quarter <b>milk</b> samples were aseptically collected, somatic cells were counted, and teat apex scores were assessed. Quarter milk samples were divided in two groups according to SCC: 200, 000 cells/ml, respectively. At udder level each cow was classified as low SCC (LSCC) when all quarters had < 200, 000 cells/ml and high SCC (HSCC) in all other situations, separately for each control. Animals with at least one HSCC control during the first 120 days of lactation (n= 33), compared to subjects always classified as LSCC cows (n= 49), showed significantly higher average milk flow (2. 32 vs 2. 13 kg/min; P< 0. 05), peak milk flow (3. 71 vs 3. 14 kg/min; P< 0. 05), lower duration of plateau phase (2. 33 vs 3. 27 min; P< 0. 05), longer duration of increase phase (0. 81 vs 0. 66 min; P< 0. 05), and higher average SCC (4. 07 vs 3. 45 Log 10 SCC; P< 0. 05). Moreover, primiparous cows with at least one HSCC control had a significant increase in peak milk flow during the first four months of lactation, while the other cows showed only a slight increase. Teat apex scores significantly increased in both groups of primiparous cows as lactation progressed but values in subjects always classified as LSCC animals were constantly lower with respect to cows with at least one HSCC control. The results obtained in this study support the relationship between SCC, teat apex score and milk flow traits...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and validate a mathematical model to detect clinical lameness based on existing sensor data that relate to the behavior and performance of cows in a commercial dairy farm. Identification of lame (44) and not lame (74) cows in the database was done based on the farm’s daily herd health reports. All cows were equipped with a behavior sensor that measured neck activity and ruminating time. The cow’s performance was measured with a <b>milk</b> yield <b>meter</b> in the <b>milking</b> parlor. In total, 38 model input variables were constructed from the sensor data comprising absolute values, relative values, daily standard deviations, slope coefficients, daytime and nighttime periods, variables related to individual temperament, and milk session-related variables. A lame group, cows recognized and treated for lameness, to not lame group comparison of daily data was done. Correlations between the dichotomous output variable (lame or not lame) and the model input variables were made. The highest correlation coefficient was obtained for the milk yield variable (rMY = 0. 45). In addition, a logistic regression model was developed based on the 7 highest correlated model input variables (the daily milk yield 4 d before diagnosis; the slope coefficient of the daily milk yield 4 d before diagnosis; the nighttime to daytime neck activity ratio 6 d before diagnosis; the milk yield week difference ratio 4 d before diagnosis; the milk yield week difference 4 d before diagnosis; the neck activity level during the daytime 7 d before diagnosis; the ruminating time during nighttime 6 d before diagnosis). After a 10 -fold cross-validation, the model obtained a sensitivity of 0. 89 and a specificity of 0. 85, with a correct classification rate of 0. 86 when based on the averaged 10 -fold model coefficients. This study demonstrates that existing farm data initially used for other purposes, such as heat detection, can be exploited for the automated detection of clinically lame animals on a daily basis as well...|$|R
40|$|Contents of casein {{fractions}} {{are known}} to affect coagulation properties and cheese yield of milk, but studies {{on the effects of}} κ-CN composition on variation of coagulation properties of milk are still very scarce. Effects exerted by κ-CN composition on variation of milk coagulation properties (MCP) were investigated using 2, 084 individual milk samples of Simmental cows. Rennet coagulation time (RCT), and curd firmness (A 30) were measured using a computerized renneting <b>meter.</b> <b>Milk</b> protein composition and genotypes at CSN 2, CSN 3 and BLG were obtained by reversed-phase HPLC. The percentage ratios of κ-CN (κCN%), of Glycosylated-κ-CN (G-κCN%), and Unglycosylated-κ-CN (U-κCN%) to total casein were measured. The degree of glycosylation (GD) was measured as the percentage ratio of glycosylated-κ-CN to total κ-CN. A difference of 1. 7 min (corresponding to 0. 37 SD of the trait) was observed for the average RCT of the two extreme classes of κCN% content. RCT decreased when κCN% and G-κCN% increased, whereas U-κCN% exhibited a slightly unfavourable effect on the onset of the coagulation process. A slight decrease of RCT was also observed for high GD, although this effect was less clear than that of G-κCN%. A favourable effect of κCN%, G-κCN% and GD on A 30 was also detected...|$|R
