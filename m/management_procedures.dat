40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development and}} application of a <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> (decision rule) {{that resulted in a}} voluntary reduction in the commercial catch of spiny rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) in the lower east coast of North Island of New Zealand. The <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed from an accepted assessment of the CRA 4 (Wellington-Hawke's Bay) fishery, which used an integrated length-based assessment model fitted to commercial fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) biomass indices, commercial length-frequency data, and tag-recapture data. The assessment model had been Bayesian, and used the joint posterior distribution of parameters to predict the effect of 384 alternative harvest control rules on the future size of the CRA 4 stock. The harvest control rules all used CPUE as their input, and generated annual changes in catch, which were then simulated by the population dynamics of the operating model. Uncertainty was added to evaluations through observation error, added to the simulated CPUE observations, and stochastic serial auto-correlation variation in recruitment. We describe how this <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was used to effect a voluntary reduction in catch {{to address the problem of}} a rapidly declining population. ...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{contributors}} to air, soil and water pollution is animal waste. According to a 2005 report by the USDA, more than 335 million tons of [...] "dry matter" [...] waste (the waste after water is removed) is produced annually on farms in the United States. [...] Animal feeding operations produce about 100 times more manure than the amount of human sewage sludge processed in US municipal waste water plants each year. Diffuse source pollution from agricultural fertilizers {{is more difficult to}} trace, monitor and control. High nitrate concentrations are found in groundwater and may reach 50mg/litre (the EU Directive limit). In ditches and river courses, nutrient pollution from fertilizers causes eutrophication. This is worse in winter, after autumn ploughing has released a surge of nitrates; winter rainfall is heavier increasing runoff and leaching, and there is lower plant uptake. EPA suggests that one dairy farm with 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city with around 411,000 residents. The National Research Council has identified odors as the most significant animal emission problem at the local level. Different animal systems have adopted several waste <b>management</b> <b>procedures</b> to deal with the large amount of waste produced annually.|$|E

REVISED <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>PROCEDURE</b> After the adoption of the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982, the Committee spent over eight years developing the Revised <b>Management</b> <b>Procedure</b> (RMP) for baleen whales (IWC, 1999 b).

40|$|For many fisheries, {{there is}} a need to develop {{appropriate}} indicators, methodologies, and rules for sustainably harvesting marine resources. Complexities of scientific and financial factors often prevent addressing these, but new methodologies offer significant improvements on current and historical approaches. The Australian spanner crab fishery is used to demonstrate this. Between 1999 and 2006, an empirical <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> using linear regression of fishery catch rates was used to set the annual total allowable catch (quota). A 6 -year increasing trend in catch rates revealed shortcomings in the methodology, with a 68 % increase in quota calculated for the 2007 fishing year. This large quota increase was prevented by management decision rules. A revised empirical <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed subsequently, and it achieved a better balance between responsiveness and stability. Simulations identified precautionary harvest and catch rate baselines to set quotas that ensured sustainable crab biomass and favourable performance for management and industry. The <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was simple to follow, cost-effective, robust to strong trends and changes in catch rates, and adaptable for use in many fisheries. Application of such “tried-and-tested” empirical systems will allow improved management of both data-limited and data-rich fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Overall {{equipment}} efficiency (OEE) {{is widely}} adopted in semiconductor manufacturing {{to assess and}} enhance equipment productivity. The rate efficiency, which is {{a major component of}} OEE, is utilized to evaluate the achievement of actual production rate to the equipment’s theoretical production rate. However, the rate efficiency is significantly influenced by factors beyond the equipment and, therefore, is inadequate for deciding whether a low production rate is due to the equipment itself. Such an inaccurate evaluation of production rate of equipment usually results in productivity loss. Hence, this study develops a novel metric, called running efficiency (RUNE), to compare the actual and theoretical production rates of the equipment. The RUNE is not affected by the production environment and can be employed to determine sources of equipment’s variation. Additionally, a RUNE <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> is also proposed. The <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> incorporates an automatic target-setting scheme to set the theoretical production time of every motion in equipment to obtain the RUNE value of equipment. An exponentially weighted moving average control chart is then utilized in the <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> to monitor the RUNE value of equipment. A real case from a 300 -mm fabrication in Taiwan is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
