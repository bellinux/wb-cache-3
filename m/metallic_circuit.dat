Composed of both a superficial component, and a component contained within canals beneath the fish's skin, the lateral line acts {{in a similar fashion}} to an array of differential pressure sensors. In an effort to enhance the situational and environmental awareness of marine vehicles, lateral-line-inspired pressure sensor arrays were developed to mimic the enhanced sensory capabilities observed in fish. Three flexible and waterproof pressure sensor arrays were fabricated for use as a surface-mounted 'smart skin' on marine vehicles. Two of the sensor arrays were based around the use of commercially available piezoresistive sensor dies, with innovative packaging schemes to allow for flexibility and underwater operation. The sensor arrays employed liquid crystal polymer and flexible printed circuit board substrates with <b>metallic</b> <b>circuits</b> and silicone encapsulation.

In {{the wire}} of the helix of magneto-electric machines, (as, for instance, in Mr. Saxton's {{beautiful}} arrangement,) an important influence of these principles {{of action is}} evidently shown. From {{the construction of the}} apparatus the current is permitted to move in a complete <b>metallic</b> <b>circuit</b> of great length during the first instants of its formation: it gradually rises in strength, and is then suddenly stopped by the breaking of the metallic circuit; and thus great intensity is given by induction to the electricity, which at that moment passes (1064. 1060.). This intensity is not only shown by the brilliancy of the spark and the strength of the shock, but also by the necessity which has been experienced of well-insulating the convolutions of the helix, in which the current is formed: and it gives to the current a force at these moments very far above that which the apparatus could produce if the principle which forms the subject of this paper were not called into play.|$|E

To ascertain this point with regard to quantity, the helix i (1053.) and the galvanometer (1055.) were both made parts of the <b>metallic</b> <b>circuit</b> used to connect the plates of a small electromotor, and the deflection at the galvanometer was observed; then a soft iron core was put into the helix, {{and as soon as the}} momentary effect was over, and the needle had become stationary, it was again observed, and found to stand exactly at the same division as before. Thus the quantity passing through the wire when the current was continued was the same either with or without the soft iron, although the peculiar effects occurring at the moment of disjunction were very different in degree under such variation of circumstances.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} used {{components}} in the RF transmission devices mounted on satellite antennas are the ISP modules. They are designed by exploiting hybrid materials technology to improve their operative characteristics. In particular they {{are made up of}} a Metallic carrier, a ceramic substrate, a metallic frame and a metallic cover. Inside the ceramic substrate <b>metallic</b> <b>circuits</b> and vias they are allocated to connect microelectronic components fixed on the external surface of the substrate of RF transmission modules. Metallic cover is one {{of the most}} delicate elements of the package because it must provide for the tightness of the assembly. The cover is welded to the frame by seam-welding technique. In order to assembly ceramic substrate and metallic frame a brazing process must be carried out. This brazing process introduces residual stresses at the end of the welding process. These residual stresses induced by the thermal cycles could cause crack growth and eventually a component fracture during the operating life of the satellite. In order to foresee their criticality, qualification tests, based on MIL standard, are mandatory. This MIL procedure establishes that the package must be thermally cycled with 500 cycles in the range of 223 K <= 398 K. On account of this, thermal loads, associated to thermal cycles, may cause fractures in ceramic Substrate and the failure of electronic components. In this paper a numerical approach able to simulate all the brazing process and to evaluate numerically all the stresses inside the ISP module will be proposed. Parametric studies on thermal loadings and on geometrical characteristics of the brazing subcomponents Such as the metallic carrier, the ceramic substrate, the metallic frame and the metallic cover in order to evaluate maximum and critical stresses will be also presented. To perform such numerical analysis laboratory tests such as DMA have been carried out and detailed in the paper. The aim of these tests is to characterize the mechanical and thermal properties of all the material employed for the numerical simulations. Finally a comparison between numerical analysis relevant to a broken ISP module will be presented in order to validate the used approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Silicon based {{integrated}} circuit (IC) technology is approaching its physical limits. For sub 10 nm technology nodes, the carbon nanotube (CNT) based {{field effect transistor}} {{has emerged as a}} promising device because of its excellent electronic properties. One of the major challenges faced by the CNT technology is the unwanted growth of metallic tubes. At present, there is no known CNT fabrication technology which allows the fabrication of 100 % semiconducting CNTs. The presence of metallic tubes creates a short between the drain and source terminals of the transistor and has a detrimental impact on the delay, static power and yield of CNT based gates. This thesis will address the challenge of designing robust carbon nanotube based circuits in the presence of metallic tubes. For a small percentage of <b>metallic</b> tubes, <b>circuit</b> level solutions are proposed to increase the functional yield of CNT based gates in the presence of metallic tubes. Accurate analytical models with less than a 3 % inaccuracy rate are developed to estimate the yield of CNT based circuit for a different percentage of metallic tubes and different drive strengths of logic gates. Moreover, a design methodology is developed for yield-aware carbon nanotube based circuits in the presence of metallic tubes using different CNFET transistor configurations. Architecture based on regular logic bricks with underlying hybrid CNFET configurations are developed which gives better trade-offs in terms of performance, power, and functional yield. In the case when the percentage of metallic tubes is large, the proposed circuit level techniques are not sufficient. Extra processing techniques must be applied to remove the metallic tubes. The tube removal techniques have trade-offs, as the removal process is not perfect and removes semiconducting tubes in addition to removing unwanted metallic tubes. As a result, stochastic removal of tubes from the drive and fanout gate(s) results in large variation in the performance of CNFET based gates and in the worst case open circuit gates. A Monte Carlo simulation engine is developed to estimate the impact of the removal of tubes on the performance and power of CNFET based logic gates. For a quick estimation of functional yield of logic gates, accurate analytical models are developed to estimate the functional yield of logic gates when a fraction of the tubes are removed. An efficient tube level redundancy (TLR) is proposed, resulting in a high functional yield of carbon nanotube based circuits with minimal overheads in terms of area and power when large fraction of tubes are removed. Furthermore, for applications where parallelism can be utilized we propose to increase the functional yield of the CNFET based circuits by increasing the logic depth of gates...|$|R

30|$|Molecular QCA gates are the {{building}} blocks of more complex modules. Probing molecular devices requires quantum chemical calculations, which are challenging as the molecular system grows in size. A semi-classical model was derived directly from the two-state approximation in the ET theory, serving as a device for studying mQCA gates. This model is very similar to the two-state model which is currently the core of the QCADesigner simulation engine for solving <b>circuits</b> based on <b>metallic</b> QCA. The range of applications and limitations of this model for mQCA gates was investigated carefully. The parametric TSM can be used to study more complex mQCA gates composed of practical candidate mixed-valence molecules, where exploiting the SA/CASSCF method is of high computational cost. A complete set of logic gates were implemented within the two-dot mQCA framework. These gates include INV and MinV gates, which provide a small molecular test bench, making further analysis by quantum chemistry methods, particularly SA/CASSCF, practical. The INV gate was studied as a nucleus of all other gates. It was also presented that output polarizations of all other gates can be derived from extrapolating the results obtained from inverters based on the additivity relation. We compared the results obtained from the TSM to those obtained from SA/CASSCF calculations for INV and MinV gates. The degree of agreement between the TSM and quantum chemical calculations is highly dependent on the μ parameter and the symmetry of the head groups. Additionally, application of the additivity relation for CASSCF method can in turn reduce the computational cost. It {{is important to note that}} we did not address questions of surface attachment, input/output, clocked control, layout, and patterning, which are the requirements of a practical QCA system. Moreover, we did not consider the relaxation of nuclear degrees of freedom associated with electron transfer. It is presented that for mQCA, the electron localization and Coulombic interactions play the key roles, and nuclear positions can be considered frozen (nuclear relaxation even assists charge localization) [4]. Although we limited our focus on the two-dot mQCA, it merits highlighting that the model can also be used for four-dot cells, since they can be considered as double two-dot cells. Our focus was on the mQCA gates as building blocks of circuits. The two-state model may be applied to simulate mQCA circuits as well, as it is currently used iteratively for simulation of <b>metallic</b> QCA <b>circuits</b> in the QCADesigner. However, to determine the additive error resulting from exploiting the two-state model for solving mQCA circuits, further quantum chemical calculations on the mQCA clocked circuits composed of several molecules are required, which are extremely challenging at the time, and have not been addressed in this paper.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{research}} the possibility of realizing hardware support for hybrid single electron transistor (SET) -CMOS circuits by a systematic approach of design, analysis and simulation. The metallic SET transistors considered in this work are fabricated within the chip interconnect layers using CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) -compatible processing. The CMOS process integration {{can be divided into}} front-end-of-line (FEOL) and BEOL processes. The FEOL includes processes required to form isolated CMOS transistors whereas BEOL is the second portion of the IC fabrication where the devices get interconnected through the wiring using multiple layers of dielectrics and metals. Therefore, <b>metallic</b> SET <b>circuits</b> can be easily stacked above the CMOS platform presenting a low cost, low thermal budget, improving the overall yield at high-volume production of highly integrated systems. This considerably decreases the interconnect parasitics and increases the density of functions while maintaining the overall acceptable performance. Many problems such as low current drivability, delay and small voltage gain that hinder SET technology for its implementation in integrated circuits can be alleviated by intelligent circuit design. Although a complete replacement of CMOS by SETs is unlikely in the near future, an augmentation of CMOS with SETs is desirable if interfacing from and to CMOS works well. Interfacing from CMOS to SET circuitry is simple as the current and voltage levels are small and in accessible range. But interfacing CMOS from SET circuits is delicate due to SET logic's low current driving capability for CMOS and its interconnect. There is no concrete research on the interface issue wherein a SET-only circuitry drives a CMOS and its interconnects. For such hybridization to become possible, it is necessary to demonstrate the SET logic driving capability for CMOS with sufficient current drive and output voltage. The core SET logic can be designed to operate at low voltage, but at the interface the output of the SET logic must be in a voltage range that can be fed to a CMOS input for proper logic functionality. It is hence necessary to develop and adopt a systematic design methodology for such hybrid circuits at a specific technology node for room temperature operation. In this thesis we will look at a generalized design methodology that can be applied to (a) develop a fabrication model with parasitic effect of a hybrid SET-CMOS and SET-only circuits, (b) design and analyze the SET based fundamental building block in hybrid SET-CMOS or SET-only circuit and (c) simulate such a circuitry to assess its merits. More specifically, we will address the interfacing issue of such hybrid circuits in which we exploit the maximum capability of a SET logic in terms of driving capability, voltage response and power for a room temperature operation. The result of this research motivates the application of SET logic in 2 stages realizing some properties beyond those of CMOS devices. The first stage is the heterogeneous integration at chip level around a CMOS core. In such a circuitry, the SET introduces new functionalities such as reconfigurable logic, random number-based circuits, and multiband filtering circuits that can be combined with CMOS based general purpose processors or I/O signal restoration. The second stage of application is to use a new information processing technology focussed on a "new switch" exploiting a new state variable to provide functional scaling substantially beyond that attainable solely with ultimately scaled CMOS...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} microwave cavities {{for various}} circuits in the front-end of transceivers such as filters, diplexers, and oscillators have conventionally been built with rectangular or cylindrical metallic waveguides, which typically have low loss, high quality (Q) factor, and higher power handling capability. However such waveguide cavity based circuits made by traditional metal machining techniques {{tend to be}} costly, particularly for complex multiple cavity based circuits, and not well suited to high volume commercial applications and integration with planar microwave integrated circuits. As commercial transceiver applications progress toward higher microwave and millimetre-wave frequencies, the use of waveguide based circuits for compact, highly integrated transceivers is becoming feasible, along with an increasing need for cost effective batch fabrication processes for realizing complex <b>metallic</b> cavity <b>circuits</b> without sacrificing structural quality and performance. It is expected that significant advancements in both microwave performance and integration will be achieved {{through the development of}} novel technologies for realizing vertically oriented three-dimensional (3 -D) structures. Although improvement has been made on increasing the resonator Q factor by exploiting silicon micromachining and low-temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC) techniques, there are some drawbacks inherent to silicon cavity micromachining and LTCC technology, including non-vertical sidewalls, depth limitations, and surface roughness for the silicon resonator, and dielectric and radiation loss for LTCC resonator. Polymer-based fabrication is a promising alternative to silicon etching and LTCC technologies for the batch fabrication of ultra-deep microwave cavity structures. In particular, deep X-ray lithography (XRL), as part of the LIGA process, is a microfabrication technology for precisely structuring polymers, and is increasingly being applied to RF/microwave microstructures. In addition to precise patterning capabilities, deep XRL is able to structure ultra-deep cavities due to the penetration ability of hard X-rays. Cavities of several millimetres are possible in a single lithographic exposure, and with excellent sidewall quality, including verticality near 90 degrees and surface roughness on the order of tens of nanometres. These structured polymers are subsequently used as electroforming templates for fabricating metal structures with correspondingly good sidewall quality. This thesis investigates the possibility of realizing high-Q cavity resonators and filters at microwave frequencies using the LIGA microfabrication process. Finite element method (FEM) electromagnetic simulation results based on the cavity models representing different fabrication conditions show that smooth LIGA cavity structures result in promising Q improvement over silicon and LTCC structures. And the potential advantages of LIGA resonators are more dramatic with cavity height and increasing operating frequency. Deep polymer cavity structures (1. 8 mm) fabricated using deep XRL demonstrate excellent sidewall verticality in the PMMA structure, with only slight shrinkage at the top surface of 8. 5 2. 5 mm in either lateral dimensions. This corresponds to sidewalls with verticality between 89. 82 o and 89. 9 o. The structure polymers are subsequently used as templates for metal electroforming to produce cavity resonators. The performance of the resonator is measured in a planar environment. A RT/duroid 6010 soft substrate patterned with coupling structures forms the sixth side, and thus completes the cavity. Despite the rather crude test assembly for the sixth side made by clamping, the measured resonator has a high unloaded Q of 2122. 2 85 at the resonant frequency of 24 GHz, indicating that LIGA cavities are especially promising for high performance applications. The relatively simple, single-step lithographic exposure also facilitates extension to more structurally complicated waveguide and multiple cavity-based circuits. This research work also proposes a high performance ``split-post' 3 -pole cylindrical post coupled Chebyshev bandpass filter suitable for LIGA fabrication. In addition to potentially batch fabricating such a filter lithographically by exposing the entire waveguide depth in a single exposure, the filter structures composed of three cavities with metallic multi-post coupling would be extremely difficult to fabricate using traditional machining techniques, due to the extremely fine post structure and high vertical aspect ratio required. However, these types of structures could be ideal for LIGA fabrication, which offers sub-micron features, aspect ratios of 100 : 1 or higher, resist thicknesses of up to 3 mm, and almost vertical and optically smooth sidewalls. Also, representative LIGA sidewall roughness is used to predict very low loss and high performance, suggesting that complicated structures with multiple resonator circuits and high internal components with high aspect ratios are possible...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceElectrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnAt RF {{frequencies}} and beyond, <b>metallic</b> <b>circuit</b> interconnects no longer behave as lumped-element wires; instead they exhibit distributed-element behavior and {{are classified as}} transmission lines. Power losses on transmission lines are of great concern to RF and microwave engineers and great care is taken to minimize power losses while still maintaining application-based robustness. The combination of low-temperature co-fire ceramics (LTCCs) and thin-film transmission line fabrication allows application-specific robustness and excellent microwave and millimeter wave performance to be achieved. LTCC technology provides a low-loss microwave substrate and allows for thin-film metal and insulator depositions to form precision transmission-line geometries and surface-applique capacitors. In the field of thin-film metals however, concern over excess power losses at high frequencies has arisen due to {{the necessity of a}} high-resistance metallic adhesion layer which is required for the mechanical adhesion of the transmission lines to the LTCC substrate. This is especially worrisome in a microstrip configuration where the current density is concentrated at the substrate-metal interface; exactly where the high-loss metal is situated. This thesis shows that if the high-resistance adhesion layer is limited to a thickness which is a fraction of its skin depth, with more conductive metals layered above, then those excessive resistive losses can be avoided. Issues with decreasing the total thickness of the thin-film layered metals are also investigated to achieve better interconnect line-and-space resolution, which is required for electronics operating at millimeter-wave bandwidths. Several test cases show that thinning of the metal layers has minimal impact on electrical performance. However, poor signal integrity is observed when the finished thickness of the metal stack up is reduced below 1 μm. Further testing reveals that surface roughness leads to manufacturing issues when trying to produce thin-films with thicknesses in the sub-micron range. Finally, a novel bypass and coupling capacitor topology is proposed and investigated. The capacitors are simple thin-film metal-insulator-metal constructions designed for use in a flip-chip mounting environment. Testing shows the capacitors exhibit a very low impedance through 20 GHz making them an ideal board-level bypass solution. This technology has the potential to replace all but the large bulk charge storage capacitors in electronic designs, increasing performance and mechanical robustness, while simultaneously decreasing bill of material cost and PCB assembly times...|$|E
