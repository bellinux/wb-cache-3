40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare two {{different}} ripening times (2. 5 and 5 months) of slow-fermented Italian-style salami made with ostrich meat and pork lard from the sensory viewpoint. Twenty-seven descriptors, grouped in external appearance, internal appearance, odour, flavor, off-flavours, texture, ripening time and general acceptability, were evaluated. Ripening time affected quite all sensory descriptors. Shape and casing were improved by the longer ripening time but, probably due to a larger presence of mould, the external acceptability was higher in 2. 5 months ripened salami (11. 2 vs 9. 1). The longer ripening improved significantly (P< 0. 001) the salami colour homogeneity and cohesiveness, reduced gamy odour and odour intensity, increased salty, fatness and <b>mouldy</b> <b>flavour</b> perception, but reduced the gamy flavour (P< 0. 05). The overall salami acceptability didnâ€™t change with the ripening time but panelists judged too fresh the salami of both ripening times. Seems likely that this perception was related to the too high pork fat inclusion used, as revealed with the PCA where ripening time and fat inclusion were negatively correlated. Overall results suggested that ostrich meat could be suitable for the production of long-ripened Italian-style salami...|$|E
