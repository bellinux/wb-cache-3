25|$|For {{the first}} time, {{large amounts of}} federal money went to public schools. In {{practice}} ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more <b>money</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities). For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 {{it was reported that}} {{less than half of the}} funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.|$|E
500|$|On May 28, 2003, a {{trademark}} {{for the name}} [...] "Silver Bullet" [...] was filed by Cedar Fair, {{the owners of the}} park. Construction for the new roller coaster began in September 2003 with the relocation of The Church of Reflections. As part of a $85 million investment in all Cedar Fair parks, Silver Bullet was announced to the public on December 1, 2003. The final piece of track was placed on September 30, 2004. On November 5, 2004, Knott's Berry Farm launched a [...] "First Rider Auction" [...] in which people from anywhere in the world would bid against each other in order {{to be one of the}} first public riders on Silver Bullet on December 7, 2004. Although sixty seats were made available, only 13 of these received bids. Out of those bids, the highest bid was $200 (US), and a total of $1643 was raised [...] with all the <b>money</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Speech & Language Development Center of Buena Park. After construction and testing was completed, the roller coaster opened first to the media, then to the public on December 7, 2004 though the initial scheduled opening was on Christmas Eve of 2004. Silver Bullet was also one of four attractions that opened at Knott's Berry Farm in the same year and carries a western theme.|$|E

2500|$|He {{asked the}} Court [...] "to {{focus on this}} word 'incidental.' ...In the context of <b>money</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> third party {{religious}} entities, nobody {{would say that the}} spending is incidental. It's the whole violation. In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems. The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. The funding that goes into that is incidental. I think that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 16, 2017, President Donald Trump {{issued a}} Presidential {{memorandum}} reversing {{some aspects of}} the Obama administration's actions regarding U.S. relations with Cuba, and characterizing them as [...] "terrible and misguided". He expanded the prohibition on American <b>money</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Cuban military, saying it also prohibits dealings with the Grupo de Administracion Empresarial, a conglomerate which the Cuban military manages. That will have the effect of placing certain hotels and other tourism facilities off-limits to Americans. He reinstated a ban on individual travel to Cuba by Americans, while leaving in place travel permission for organized [...] "educational" [...] groups and family visits. Airline and cruise ship visits to Cuba will continue to be permitted. Diplomatic relations will remain in place and the embassies will remain open. The new restrictions will go into effect only after appropriate regulations are drawn up by the Treasury and Commerce departments.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in <b>money</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E
