One of these issues is rate adaptation, that is, how to allocate the network resources among multiple flows, while minimizing the performance overhead. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we first define an analytical framework for a very simple topology. The model allows us to study the performance of an adaptive and responsive transport protocol when {{the effect of the}} lower layers are ignored. The mathematical approach alone does not represent a feasible solution, but it contributes to determining {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} our proposal. The main novelty of the proposed solution is that the congestion control approach is based on a hop-by-hop mechanism, which allows nodes to adapt their transmitting rates in a distributed way and to keep track of dynamic multi-hop network characteristics in a responsive manner. This is in contrast with classical literature solutions, founded on an end-to-end support.

It thus contributes methodical knowledge {{to the field of}} computer assisted planning of optical networks. A two-stage greenfield optical network design optimiser is developed, based on shortest-path algorithms and a comparatively new metaheuristic called simulated allocation. It is able to handle design of all-optical <b>mesh</b> <b>networks</b> with optical cross-connects, considers duct as well as fibre and node costs, and can also design protected networks. The method is assessed through various experiments and is shown to produce good results {{and to be able to}} scale up to networks of realistic sizes. A novel method, subpath wavelength grouping, for routing connections in a multigranular all-optical network where several wavelengths can be grouped and switched at band and fibre level is presented. The method uses an unorthodox routing strategy focusing on common subpaths rather than individual connections, and strives to minimise switch port count as well as fibre usage. It is shown to produce cheaper network designs than previous methods when fibre costs are comparatively high. A new optical network concept, the synchronous optical hierarchy, is proposed, in which wavelengths are subdivided into timeslots to match the traffic granularity. Various theoretical properties of this concept are investigated and compared in simulation studies. An integer linear programming model for optical ring network design is presented. Manually designed real world ring networks are studied and it is found that the model can lead to cheaper network design.

40|$|Abstract — Even though {{multiple}} non-overlapped channels {{exist in}} the 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum, most IEEE 802. 11 -based multi-hop ad hoc networks today use only a single channel. As a result, these networks rarely can fully exploit the aggregate bandwidth available in the radio spectrum provisioned by the standards. This prevents them from being used as an ISP’s wireless last-mile access network or as a wireless enterprise backbone network. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>network</b> (WMN) <b>architecture</b> (called Hyacinth) that equips each <b>mesh</b> <b>network</b> node with multiple 802. 11 network interface cards (NICs).
