50|$|The F6 is {{the current}} model of Nikon's F series {{and it is still}} in production. It replaces the Nikon F5, {{manufactured}} from 1996 to 2004. The Nikon F6 accepts nearly any Nikon F-mount lens with full <b>metering</b> <b>functionality,</b> except for non-AI (non-aperture indexing lenses made before 1977, unless the camera was modified by Nikon Service).|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of using adapted lenses however, is that focus is manual even with natively autofocus lenses. Full <b>metering</b> <b>functionality</b> is maintained however, as are some automated shooting modes (aperture priority). A further disadvantage with some LM and LTM lenses is that lenses with significant rear protrusions {{simply do not}} fit inside the camera body and risk damaging lens or body. An example is the Biogon type of lens.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Energy Measurements Ltd (EML), a {{joint venture}} {{partnership}} between Siemens and Spescom, manufacture prepaid electricity utility meters for both the local and international markets. Under the brand name CASHPOWER 2000, EML produces single and polyphase prepayment utility meters. Currently, these meters currently utilise a separate module for the measuring of electrical energy. In order to reduce component costs, EML proposed the energy measurement be conducted by the onboard Microcontroller Unit (MCU), a term known as On-Chip-Metering (OCM). It is envisioned that this would quickly translate {{in an increase in}} revenue. However, a major concern regarding this has been the increase in the required processor overhead. The CASHPOWER 2000 embedded MCU would be required to conduct all the present <b>metering</b> <b>functionality</b> in addition to the energy measurement. This, together with the cost analysis and compliance with the stipulated IEC 1036 regulations, constitute the key criteria in determining the projects viability. This dissertation represents the investigative and development stages of a prototype algorithm and accompanying peripheral hardware as a possible solution for OCM. As part of the preliminary research, several examples of digital power and energy-measurement techniques were investigated. A comparative analysis of these was performed to facilitate the development of a unique solution based on the research conducted. This completed, a prototype was developed and preliminary testing was conducted to determine its compliance with the stipulated regulations for a class 2 meter, as per IEC 1 O 36 speciﬁcations...|$|E

Pulse meters send a digital or analog electronic pulse to a recording device.

50|$|Sound level meters are {{commonly}} used in noise pollution studies for the quantification {{of different kinds of}} noise, especially for industrial, environmental and aircraft noise. The current international standard that specifies sound level <b>meter</b> <b>functionality</b> and performances is the IEC 61672-1:2013. However, the reading from a sound level meter does not correlate well to human-perceived loudness, which is better measured by a loudness meter. Specific loudness is a compressive nonlinearity that depends on level and also frequency, which can be calculated {{in a number of different}} ways.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{metering}} infrastructure (AMI) system, {{proposed in}} this paper, {{is capable of}} fulfilling all smart <b>metering</b> <b>functionalities</b> in real-time. The novel Local Metering Concentrator (LMC) layer is introduced as the set of independent embedded system components, allowing distributed architecture implementation. Two main data flows {{can be defined as}} command request processing and meter data acquisition. A command request, initiated by some of the top layer applications, is processed and forwarded through the system to the LMC layer, where the request is executed and the status is sent as a reply. The data and event acquisition is performed as an automatic function of the LMC layer. The collected data is forwarded to the system as soon as it is downloaded from the meters. The results of more than one-year exploitation of the installed pilot system are presented, emphasizing the real-time load profile data acquisition, allowing the distribution system operators (DSO) and the end consumer to be actively involved in energy saving. The introduced architecture enables load profiling, energy diagnostic and easy integration with any meter data management system...|$|R
40|$|Smart meters enable utility {{companies}} to automatically readout metering data {{and to give}} consumers insight in their energy usage, which should lead to a reduction of energy usage. To regulate smart <b>meter</b> <b>functionality</b> the Dutch government commissioned the NEN to create a Dutch standard for smart meters {{which resulted in the}} NTA- 8130 specification. Currently the Dutch grid operators are experimenting with smart meters in various pilot projects. In this project we have analyzed the current smart meter implementations and the NTA using an abstract model based on the the CIA-triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability). It is important that no information can be attained by unauthorised parties, that smart meters cannot be tampered with and that suppliers get correct metering data. We conclude that the NTA is not specific enough about the security requirements of smart meters, which leaves this open for interpretation by manufacturers and grid operators. Suppliers do not take the privacy aspect of the consumer data seriously. Customers can only get their usage information through poorly secured websites. The communication channel for local meter configuration is not secured sufficiently: consumers might even be able to reconfigure their own meters. Also, the communication channels that are used between the smart meter and gas or water meter are often not sufficiently protected against data manipulation. It is important that communication at all stages, starting from the configuration of the meter to the back-end systems and websites, is encrypted using proven technologies and protected by proper authentication mechanisms. ...|$|R

The SQ-B was a manually operating SLR {{evolved from the}} SQ-Ai, built to primarily satisfy the needs of professional [...] "studio" [...] photographers who work with hand-held light meters, studio or portable flash equipment and various other accessories. Thus, motorized film-advance and through-the-lens <b>metering</b> (TTL) <b>functionality</b> were not present, as well as B (bulb exposure) and T (time exposure), as found on other SQ-series models. T (time exposure), however, was available when utilizing the appropriate SQ-series Zenzanon-S/PS lenses which incorporated the time (T) exposure lever function; by default the Zenzanon-PS/B 80mm f/2.8 lens which accompanied the SQ-B model did not include this feature. All SQ-series accessories and lenses were interchangeable with the SQ-B with few exceptions.|$|R
40|$|Metering for accounting, charging, and QoS {{measurements}} is {{an important}} functionality of modern IP-based networks. Many approaches have been published {{and some of the}} outcomes have been already deployed. So far, the configuration of the metering entities is based on centralized management systems. These systems usually have no knowledge about the ongoing routing decisions, and as a consequence do not allow to choose the metering entities based on algorithms that depend on the currently chosen data path. However, some scenarios require a path-dependent <b>metering</b> configuration <b>functionality,</b> e. g. for load-balancing between multiple meters. In this paper we present a pathcoupled metering configuration that allows for sophisticated configuration options. Based on three different application scenarios, we discuss the requirements on a configuration signaling method, and present a path-coupled signaling approach which meets the identified requirements. Subsequently, we use the same application scenarios successfully assessing the approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{electric}} power grid has served us {{well for the}} past years. However, they are not {{designed to meet the}} demand of the future needs including the ever-rising energy demand, integration of the micro generation with the grid, reliability and security. Therefore, recently, an efficient electric energy system called the Smart Grid (SG) has been proposed as the next-generation electrical power system technology that embraces advanced communications technologies and ubiquitous computing capabilities in every aspect of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and consumption. The core component of the SG is a communication networks which comprises a variety of wireless communication technologies.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{electrical grid}} is transitioning into the smart grid. New equipment is being installed {{to simplify the}} process of monitoring and managing the grid, making the system more transparent to use but also introducing new security problems. Smart meters are replacing the traditional electrical utility <b>meters,</b> offering new <b>functionalities</b> such as remote reading of the consumption indexes, different time of use tariffs, automatic error reporting, and the possibility for the electricity providers to remotely turn off and on the electricity service at one location. This research thesis studies this last feature through two scenarios where we emphasize the effects of an attack exploiting the remote turn off feature, both on a theoretical level and through a simulation. In the first scenario, the frequency property of the grid is the target {{in an attempt to}} cause a widespread blackout. In the second scenario, the voltage is driven out of bounds by the adversary, causing physical damage to the electrical appliances of the affected customers. Data provided by the smart meters can be used to develop fraud and attack detection and mitigation tools. Obtaining real data can sometimes be cumbersome, due to privacy concerns. We propose an anonymization technique for sensitive data, based on a cryptographic procedure; this provides consistent results even if it is used over different traces. An implementation of this technique is also provided. In the process of developing fraud and attack detection and mitigation techniques, the case of off-line centralized data is covered, for both individual smart meters and clusters of smart meters...|$|R
40|$|Smart {{structure}} {{technologies have}} gained increasing {{interest on the}} market during the last years. The demand for active systems refers predominantly to active vibration control, especially vibration reduction, but also excitation of vibrations, above all with regard to high frequency testing. In recent years many questions hindering a commercial exploitation of this technology have been resolved by now. New methods, procedures and tools for efficient dimensioning, realisation and evaluation of active structure systems are available. In addition, costs have been reduced, production procedures established and new methods for system reliability assessment were developed. One aspect of the present paper is to give an overview on the actual {{state of the art}} of some recent achievements. The next logical step of entering larger scale markets is facing obstacles on component level. Most smart technologies are still based on piezoelectric material systems, which are limited nowadays with respect to active vibration control relevant performance as well as reliability. This {{is due to the fact}} that within smart structures, piezoelectric components are exposed to mission profiles markedly differing from those in classical applications like fuel injection or precision positioning. Keywords in the context of performance are linearity of the material parameters in order to exploit the sensing and actuating properties in closed-loop control application to the maximum possible extent, as well as low hysteresis with positive effects on power electronics design. In the sense of high reliability, resistance against moisture, high electric bias field and handling during manufacturing are crucial topics. The second aim of the paper is to point out some actual demands for future research. Efficient use and distribution in future energy infrastructures largely depend on distributed control, <b>metering</b> and accounting <b>functionalities.</b> In such a Smart Grid essential components are distributed over the complete infrastructure, in particular parts of the infrastructure will be placed under possibly hostile end-user's control.

40|$|Smart Meter (SM) is an {{advanced}} remotely readable energy meter with two-way communication capability which measures the electrical energy in real-time or near-real-time and securely sends data to Distribution System Operator (DSO). A smart metering system is {{an application of}} SMs on a larger scale, i. e. {{the application of a}} general principle on a system rather than on individual appliance. The European Commission (EC) has included ten common minimum functional requirements for electricity smart <b>metering</b> systems. One <b>functionality</b> requirement among these functional requirements is that the SM should allow remote ON/OFF switch to control the supply. Some DSOs who have installed remote ON/OFF switch are currently applying this technique for customers typically one by one when customers are changing addresses, or when contracts are terminated, or have defaulted on their payments. The switching functionalities of the SMs could be used for multiple customers, thereby opening up new possibilities for emergency electrical grid management by excluding prioritized customers. There is an interest to investigate if the multiple SMs switching might have some impacts on the Power Quality (PQ) of the electrical grid and also the challenges in implementing this technique on the existing smart metering system during emergency situation. In this thesis work, three field tests have been performed on multiple SMs switching focusing on the impact of the SMs switching on the PQ of the grid. A risk analysis was carried out before conducting the field tests. The PQ measurements were done by Power Quality Meters (PQMs) during the multiple SMs switching. Voltage variations and PQ events were recorded in the PQMs. Waveform data of the PQ events were recorded at 12. 8 kHz sampling frequency. The test results are then evaluated based on PQ standards. Moreover, performance of the existing smart metering system was investigated during the multiple SMs switching to identify the challenges and possibilities of using multiple SMs switching. The analysis of the test results show that there were no other PQ events or voltage variations except some transient events which were recorded at some customer level during the reconnection of the SMs. However, the duration of the transient events was only fractions of a millisecond and deviation of the voltage transients were below +/- 50 % except for few transient events which have deviations of more than +/- 50 % but less than +/- 60 %. This type of transient events {{may not be able to}} create damage to sensitive customers’ loads. The multiple SMs switching may not have impact on the PQ if the number of customers is low. However, SMs switching for large number of customers might have impact on the PQ which needs to be investigated. Moreover, the performance of the existing smart metering system during multiple SMs switching shows some limitations on implementing the switching technique for large scale of customers. The identified limitations are e. g., long time requirement for SMs switching and errors in the real-time status update report during SMs switching. Furthermore, the findings show that more research is needed to identify required functions for future smart metering system to implement multiple SMs switching during emergency grid management...|$|R
