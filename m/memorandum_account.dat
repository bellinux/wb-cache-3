40|$|The essay {{investigates the}} impact of the {{premature}} death of the father on brother and sister groups in noble Roman families of the seventeenth century. More specifically, it explores how this loss reflected on the biographical itineraries of individual members of the sibling unit; how adelphic relations between the orphans were reformulated according to order of birth and first born or cadet status, age, and sex; and what forms of solidarity and competition were engendered by the loss of a father. Since demographic historians have shown that orphanage at an early age is an important variable, the author argues that it cannot be overlooked – as historians have done so far – in studies on family relations, and especially when reconstructing childhood and adolescence experiences. The author’s investigation is mainly based on qualitative sources (letters, guardianship <b>memorandums,</b> <b>account</b> books, etc.) from the archives of the families selected for examination. These documents bear witness to the strength of kinship relationships, which provide support to the orphans during their lives, and to the role of proximity vs. distance in the evolution of inter-sibling bonds...|$|R

Many were letters; some fragments of manuscripts, <b>memorandums,</b> <b>accounts,</b> and other similar documents. The hawk does not pounce upon the chicken with a more sudden swoop than Judith sprang forward to seize this mine of hitherto concealed knowledge. Her education, as the reader will have perceived, was far superior to her situation in life, and her eye glanced over page after page of the letters with a readiness that her schooling supplied, and with an avidity that found its origin in her feelings. At first it was evident that the girl was gratified; and we may add with reason, for the letters written by females, in innocence and affection, were of a character to cause her to feel proud of those with whom she had every reason to think she was closely connected by the ties of blood. It does not come within the scope of our plan to give more of these epistles, however, than a general idea of their contents, and this will best be done by describing the effect they produced on the manner, appearance, and feeling of her who was so eagerly perusing them.|$|R

And this took long, for Jarvis's feelings forced him to say six times, [...] "Well, Mr. Pendyce, sir, what I say is we didn't oughter lose s'many birds in that last drive;" [...] and Mr. Pendyce to answer: [...] "No, Jarvis, certainly not.

Introduction: In making a {{study of the}} {{municipal}} ownership of the water supply of a small city, drawbacks are encountered in that suitable statistics are hard to procure. Accounts are kept with little attempt at proper classification. Many items are placed under general heads such as "maintenance" and "miscellaneous". Under these heads are listed one fourth of all expenditures incurred by the city water works of Manhattan. This ambiguous method of keeping books may be sufficient for ascertaining the loss and gain of the whole, but is certainly most unsatisfactory {{from the standpoint of the}} investigator into all the details of administration. Neither is it business-like nor safe. In spite of this disadvantage sufficient data have been secured upon which to base a discussion that will justify the conclusion herein reached. My efforts in this line have been greatly facilitated by the hearty cooperation of the city clerk and the free access to all his books, <b>memoranda,</b> and <b>accounts.</b> Valuable assistance was also rendered by several worthy citizens of the town. Criticisms offered are not intended to be personal, but merely to turn on the light where it is needed and to be suggestive of needed improvements. In making {{a study of the}} plant in which the citizens of Manhattan are interested, we find that in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas providing for the construction and maintenance of municipal water works systems, the citizens of Manhattan in 1886, then a city of about 2700 inhabitants began to agitate the question of installing a system of water works, and a special election on March 24 th of the following year, for the purpose of issuing bonds for the same...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} 2000 Army Aviation Modernization Plan using interviews, review of Program Objective <b>Memorandums</b> (POMs), Government <b>Accounting</b> Office (GAO) reports, records of congressional {{testimony}} and other supporting documents. I argue that non-integration is culturally imbedded in the Army. The cyclic patterns of build-up and teardown of the Army {{before and after}} conflicts {{have been replaced by}} a necessity to provide one integrated and interoperable force capable of continuous full spectrum operations. I have four major findings: First, favorable changes are evident in planning and coordination activities. These epic efforts from the three components are bound to improve integration and interoperability. Secondly, inadequate funding of the 2000 Army Aviation Modernization Plan causes integration and interoperability to either remain constant or decrease. Thirdly, the Army National Guard needs the second utility company of the multi-functional battalion in the RC Division structure to support dual mission requirements. Finally, funding for the Comanche program comes at the expense of Army National Guard and Active Component Army integration and interoperability. Consideration should be given to cutting the RAH- 66 program and applying alternative solutions that improve integration and interoperability of the Army while modernizing the Guard concurrently.

40|$|The {{nineteenth century}} {{was a period}} of {{extensive}} change in English rural society, in terms of both agriculture itself and the rural economy as a whole. Northamptonshire in this period, whilst remaining a predominantly rural county, underwent a significant transformation. This transformation, along with an extensive quantity of surviving data, has made nineteenth-century Northamptonshire a subject of great interest to historians. Within this context this study examines the rural rental economy in Northamptonshire across the period 1801 - 1881 ??? with particular focus on the recession years 1815 - 1831 ??? and is centred on the factors affecting the setting and payment of rents. Central to the study is a wealth of rental data, primarily extrapolated from estate account books. This is used to examine how the rental economy operated on landed estates {{within the context of the}} wider economy and prevailing agricultural prices. The importance of the relative roles of landowners, stewards and tenants in setting rents, extracting payments and negotiating reductions are the central focus, with investment in the land and changes in the wider economy also being examined in terms of their effect on the rental economy. The study began life as an examination of the moral economy of the landed estate but developed into an analysis of rental data, particularly estate accounts, and a study of the rental economy. The account books themselves provide evidence of the rental economy on the landed estate in the nineteenth century but do have their limitations. Whilst the books provide figures for agreed rents, payment of rents and abatements of rent, plus various memoranda, they do not provide acreages for holdings or distinguish types of holding. As a result a study of agreed and paid rents has been undertaken but figures for rent per acre and differences by type of farming cannot be identified. Instead, the study focuses on the flexibility of the rental economy and the importance of arrears and abatements in enabling the long-term survival of the landed income in Northamptonshire. The study examines accounts and rental data in terms of rent levels, the payment of rents and both temporary abatements and permanent rent reductions. The accounts evidence is supplemented by a number of other sources including landlord and estate correspondence plus annotations and <b>memoranda</b> in the <b>account</b> books themselves. The data is then placed in wider context (particularly that of Turner, Beckett and Afton???s 1997 study Agricultural Rent in England, 1690 - 1914) and examined in depth in terms of both what it tells us about the landed estate in Northamptonshire and the strengths and limitations of the accounts data...|$|R
60|$|The {{only thing}} besides Greek, that I learnt as {{a lesson in}} this part of my childhood, was arithmetic: this also my father taught me: it was the task of the evenings, and I well {{remember}} its disagreeableness. But the lessons were only a part of the daily instruction I received. Much of it consisted in the books I read by myself, and my father's discourses to me, chiefly during our walks. From 1810 to the end of 1813 we were living in Newington Green, then an almost rustic neighbourhood. My father's health required considerable and constant exercise, and he walked habitually before breakfast, generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey. In these walks I always accompanied him, and with my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers, is mingled that of the account I gave him daily of what I had read the day before. To the best of my remembrance, this was a voluntary rather than a prescribed exercise. I made notes on slips of paper while reading, and from these in the morning walks, I told the story to him; for the books were chiefly histories, of which I read in this manner a great number: Robertson's histories, Hume, Gibbon; but my greatest delight, then and for long afterwards, was Watson's Philip the Second and Third. The heroic defence of the Knights of Malta against the Turks, and of the revolted Provinces of the Netherlands against Spain, excited in me an intense and lasting interest. Next to Watson, my favourite historical reading was Hooke's History of Rome. Of Greece I had seen at that time no regular history, except school abridgments and {{the last two or three}} volumes of a translation of Rollin's Ancient History, beginning with Philip of Macedon. But I read with great delight Langhorne's translation of Plutarch. In English history, beyond the time at which Hume leaves off, I remember reading Burnet's History of his Own Time, though I cared little for anything in it except the wars and battles; and the historical part of the Annual Register, from the beginning to about 1788, where the volumes my father borrowed for me from Mr. Bentham left off. I felt a lively interest in Frederic of Prussia during his difficulties, and in Paoli, the Corsican patriot; but when I came to the American War, I took my part, like a child as I was (until set right by my father) on the wrong side, because it was called the English side. In these frequent talks about the books I read, he used, as opportunity offered, to give me explanations and ideas respecting civilization, government, morality, mental cultivation, which he required me afterwards to restate to him in my own words. He also made me read, and give him a verbal account of, many books which would not have interested me sufficiently to induce me to read them of myself: among other's Millar's Historical View of the English Government, a book of great merit for its time, and which he highly valued; Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, McCrie's Life of John Knox, and even Sewell and Rutty's Histories of the Quakers. He was fond of putting into my hands books which exhibited men of energy and resource in unusual circumstances, struggling against difficulties and overcoming them: of such works I remember Beaver's African <b>Memoranda,</b> and Collins's <b>Account</b> of the First Settlement of New South Wales. Two books which I never wearied of reading were Anson's Voyages, so delightful to most young persons, and a collection (Hawkesworth's, I believe) of Voyages round the World, in four volumes, beginning with Drake and ending with Cook and Bougainville. Of children's books, any more than of playthings, I had scarcely any, except an occasional gift from a relation or acquaintance: among those I had, Robinson Crusoe was pre-eminent, and continued to delight me through all my boyhood. It was no part, however, of my father's system to exclude books of amusement, though he allowed them very sparingly. Of such books he possessed at that time next to none, but he borrowed several for me; those which I remember are the Arabian Nights, Cazotte's Arabian Tales, Don Quixote, Miss Edgeworth's Popular Tales, and a book of some reputation in its day, Brooke's Fool of Quality.|$|R
