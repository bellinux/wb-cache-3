40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{investigation}} of surface damage induced by grinding operation on the rings made of 100 Cr 6 bearing steel of hardness 62 HRC. Progressively developed {{grinding wheel wear}} is caused by using the series of identical rings while the surface properties of <b>machined</b> <b>rings</b> like a hardness, residual stresses, microstructure alterations and magnetic Barkhausen noise (BN) emissions are monitored as manifestations of increased thermal damage. The noninvasive observations based on the BN emissions are performed on each ring while more laborious experimental techniques are used on selected rings. The presented results also indicate that properly suggested monitoring system based on BN emissions can reliably detect surface burn induced by thermal damage of ground surface...|$|R

Among the devices with tangential injection, the wiggle strip device and the <b>machined</b> <b>ring</b> with skirt construction provide the 13; most effective film cooling. The addition of a skirt to the wiggle strip may improve its performance in the lower velocity range. The lowest effectiveness was obtained with the splash cooling arrangement which gives effective cooling of the slot lip {{at the expense of}} downstream performance.

It has facility to determine both the peak and residual shear strength of soil, but the latter was not determined for the specimens in this study. Normal load applied were 50, 100, and 150  kg.

She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the <b>machine's</b> <b>rings</b> and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|R

Something entered, something paused, something stole silently towards the wireless machine, and paused again.

On the other, the fretted pinnacles of the firs cut sharp against the sky, and between stretched long swathes of fallen timothy and fern already turning yellow. Not far away, Mr. Oliver, sitting in the mower's saddle, was guiding his team {{along the edge of the}} grass which fell beneath the rasping knife, and the clink and rattle of the <b>machine</b> <b>rang</b> sharply through the still, evening air.
