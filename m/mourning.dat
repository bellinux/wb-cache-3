5|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} <b>mourning</b> doves {{is estimated to}} be approximately 475 million. The large population and its vast range explain why the <b>mourning</b> dove is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk.

Spring, which brings nature to new life, cannot restore him (sts. XVI-XXI). Urania rises, goes to Keats' death chamber and laments that she cannot join him in death (sts. XXII-XXIX). Fellow poets <b>mourn</b> the death of Keats: Byron, Thomas Moore, Shelley, and Leigh Hunt (sts. XXX-XXXV). The {{anonymous}} Quarterly Review critic is blamed for Keats' death and chastised (sts.
