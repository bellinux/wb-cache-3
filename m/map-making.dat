5|$|Cartography, {{the study}} and {{practice}} of <b>map-making,</b> and geography, {{the study of the}} lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth. Surveying, the determination of locations and distances, {{and to a lesser extent}} navigation, the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.|$|E
5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the <b>map-making</b> capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E
5|$|<b>Map-making</b> in China {{preceded the}} Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE– 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Markham was {{selected}} to accompany Sir Robert Napier's military expeditionary force to Abyssinia, as the expedition's geographer. This force was despatched by the British government {{as a response to}} actions taken by the Abyssinian King Theodore. In 1862 the king had written to the British government requesting protection against Egyptian invaders, and proposing the appointment of an ambassador. Unwilling to risk giving offence to Egypt, the British government did not reply. The king reacted to this slight by seizing and imprisoning the British consul and his staff, and ordered the arrest and whipping of a missionary who had allegedly insulted the king's mother. A belated reply to the king's letter resulted in the capture and incarceration of the deputation that brought it. After efforts at conciliation failed, the British decided to settle the matter by sending a military expedition. Because the geography of the country was so little known, it was decided that an experienced traveller with <b>map-making</b> skills should accompany the force, hence Markham's appointment.|$|E
5|$|From 1769 to 1778, Schmitt was {{assigned}} to the Turkish border areas, and was especially active in Temesvar, in the Banat, bordering the Ottoman Empire. In 1778, he was promoted to captain and mobilized against Prussia during the short War of the Bavarian Succession, after which he transferred back to the Balkan border areas, where he stayed until 1782. His thorough knowledge of the country guaranteed him <b>map-making</b> and intelligence assignments in Turkish-occupied Bosnia to gather information in preparation for an upcoming new war against Turkey. In particular, he developed material on the Turk's military situation. His work on the development of intelligence of Turkish strength in Osijek and Alt Gradiska satisfied his superiors and when the war actually broke out in 1787, he {{was assigned}} to the General Staff of the Slavonion Corps. He participated in the storming of the fortress at Šabac, in Serbia, on 24 April 1788. Emperor Joseph II promoted him personally to major on 14 May 1788. In 1789, Schmitt fought at the Siege of Belgrade, and on 23 February 1790, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In March 1790, he transferred to Bohemia, under command of Field Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon, for anticipated action against the Kingdom of Prussia. When this war came to naught, he was transferred to the Austrian Netherlands in 1791, to help contain a local uprising.|$|E
25|$|Triangulation {{had first}} {{emerged as a}} <b>map-making</b> method in the mid sixteenth century when Gemma Frisius set out the idea in his Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione (Booklet {{concerning}} a way of describing places).

There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as <b>map-making</b> or astrology and mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Grid reference: Although {{professional}} <b>map-making</b> {{and use of}} {{the grid}} had existed in China before, the Chinese cartographer and geographer Pei Xiu of the Three Kingdoms period was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid reference and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations.

25|$|Distance was {{measured}} by accurately fixing the source and detector points on a global coordinate system (ETRF2000). CERN surveyors used GPS to measure the source location. On the detector side, the OPERA team worked with a geodesy group from the Sapienza University of Rome to locate the detector's center with GPS and standard <b>map-making</b> techniques. To link the surface GPS location to the coordinates of the underground detector, traffic had to be partially stopped on the access road to the lab. Combining the two location measurements, the researchers calculated the distance, to an accuracy of 20cm within the 730km path.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{dominated}} the commercial cartography (corporate cartography) during {{the seventeenth century}} through the publicly traded companies (such as the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company) and the competing privately held <b>map-making</b> houses/firms. In the book Capitalism and Cartography in the Dutch Golden Age (University of Chicago Press, 2015), Elizabeth A. Sutton explores the fascinating but previously neglected history of corporate (commercial) cartography during the Dutch Golden Age, from ca. 1600 to 1650. Maps were used as propaganda tools for both the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (WIC) {{in order to encourage}} the commodification of land and an overall capitalist agenda.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, his Napoleon & the Archduke Charles; {{a history}} of the Franco-Austrian {{campaign}} in the valley of the Danube in 1809 reflected the dearth of English language material on the subject. For Petre, the campaign was of particular interest as the one of two campaigns in which Napoleon was opposed by arguably his most able continental opponent. In 1809, that opponent was the Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen; the other campaign, in Italy 1797, that opponent was Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. His son Roderick assisted with the <b>map-making.</b> The volume entered three reprints–1916, 1976, 1989—and a second edition in 1991, reprinted in 2001, reflected the ongoing fascination with the Napoleonic wars.|$|E
25|$|The {{company at}} first rented {{rooms at the}} Station Hotel in Wellington before moving to a {{building}} in Coalbrookdale; in February 1931 Merrythought moved permanently to its present site in Ironbridge. Business grew rapidly, despite the Great Depression, with the Ironbridge site becoming the largest soft toy factory in Britain in 1935 and by 1939 over 200 people worked for Merrythought. The company's site was rented at first, but was purchased from the Coalbrookdale Company in 1956. Merrythought has operated from the same site, situated between The Wharfage and the Severn, since 1931, {{with the exception of}} during World War II when the site was requisitioned by the Admiralty (for <b>map-making)</b> from the outbreak of war in September 1939. During the War, the company operated from Wellington and produced equipment for war use; Merrythought returned to their Ironbridge site in 1946. The oldest of the factory buildings were constructed in 1898 with further buildings added to the site during the 20th century as the business grew.|$|E
25|$|In {{the long}} run the {{competition}} between <b>map-making</b> firms Blaeu and Janssonius resulted in the publication of an 'Atlas Maior' or 'Major Atlas'. In 1662 the Latin edition of Joan Blaeu's Atlas Maior appeared in eleven volumes and with approximately 600 maps. In {{the years to come}} French and Dutch editions followed in twelve and nine volumes respectively. Purely judging from the number of maps in the Atlas Maior, Blaeu had outdone his rival Johannes Janssonius. And also from a commercial point of view it was a huge success. Also due to the superior typography the Atlas Maior by Blaeu soon became a status symbol for rich citizens. Costing 350 guilders for a non-coloured and 450 guilders for a coloured version, the atlas was the most precious book of the 17th century. However, the Atlas Maior was also a turning point: after that time the role of Dutch cartography (and Netherlandish cartography in general) was finished. Janssonius died in 1664 while a great fire in 1672 destroyed one of Blaeu's print shops. In that fire a part of the copperplates went up in flames. Fairly soon afterwards Joan Blaeu died, in 1673. The almost 2,000 copperplates of Janssonius and Blaeu found their way to other publishers.|$|E

500|$|The editor was {{available}} {{for the first time}} during the phase 1 beta testing of StarCraft II, when it came with a patch. With the start of phase 2, the editor was updated. At present, there is a large <b>map-making</b> community using the editor, creating first-person shooter games, RPGs, tower defense, and AoS-type games. The map database is constantly being updated as more map makers create mods for the community. The new editor also changes the way maps are distributed: rather than hosting games using local map files, users now create and join games using maps that have been published to Battle.net. [...] map or mod uploads are limited to a total of 50 MB of storage, divided between ten files at most, with no file being larger than 10 MB.

500|$|Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography {{suggests}} {{it was to}} be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, since Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and <b>map-making.</b> However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On 26 January 1598, the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On 6 June he lodged a second application, but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately afterwards. His wife was granted administration of his estate in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, because Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate pension of 50 florins on 9 April 1599. Molyneux apparently had no surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him. No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by Robert Morden and William Berry, and by Joseph Moxon. However, over 40years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were [...] "yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)".|$|E
500|$|The Wei (220–265) and Jin Dynasty (265–420) {{cartographer}} {{and official}} Pei Xiu (224–271) {{was the first}} in China to describe in full the geometric grid reference for maps that allowed for precise measurements using a graduated scale, as well as topographical elevation. However, <b>map-making</b> in China had existed since at least the 4thcenturyBC with the Qin state maps found in Gansu in 1986. Pinpointed accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the Qin and Han Dynasty, respectively, as evidenced by their existing maps, while the use of a rectangular grid had been known in China since the Han as well. Historian Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of Zhang Heng's work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng. Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography. Needham points out that the title of his book Flying Bird Calendar may have been a mistake, and that the book is more accurately entitled Bird's Eye Map. Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang's narrative [...] "Guitian fu" [...] contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of Confucius of the Zhou Dynasty, which Reiter suggests places maps (tu) on a same level of importance with documents (shu). It is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by Zhang Heng in 116 AD, called a Ti Hsing Thu.|$|E
