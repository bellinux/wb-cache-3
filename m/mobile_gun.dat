50|$|In this concept, highly <b>mobile</b> <b>guns</b> {{were held}} in reserve until {{friendly}} forces were attacked by enemy tanks. Then, the tank destroyers would be rapidly deploy to the flanks of the penetration. Tank destroyers employed aggressive, high-speed hit-and-run tactics. The conclusion drawn was that tank destroyer battalions should be raised. Immediately after the war, the battalions were disbanded and the anti-tank role {{was taken over by}} the Infantry, Engineer and Armor branches.|$|R

50|$|Italy and Spain use the Italian-built Centauro, a wheeled tank {{destroyer}} with a 105 mm cannon. The gun-armed tank destroyer may possibly see {{revival in}} the US Army through {{the introduction of}} the Stryker, more specifically, the M1128 <b>Mobile</b> <b>Gun</b> System, a Stryker variant armed with a 105 mm cannon which has remote control and autoloading capabilities. Originally, the Canadian Forces had considered replacing their aging Leopard 1 tanks with the Stryker <b>Mobile</b> <b>Gun</b> System. But with the increased use of IEDs capable of destroying Strykers by insurgent forces, they opted instead to purchase the Leopard 2 tank.|$|E

50|$|Several {{attempts}} to improve or replace the Sheridan {{have been made}} over the years since it was introduced. Several experimental versions of the Sheridan mounting a new turret carrying the NATO-standard 105mm gun were made, but the resulting recoil was so great as to make the vehicle almost unusable. The Army sought replacement in the United Defense M8 Armored Gun System, but the program was canceled in 1997 by the Pentagon before it could enter production. United Defense again pitted their AGS against other vehicles in the <b>Mobile</b> <b>Gun</b> System program of the 2000s. The AGS lost out against the wheeled General Dynamics Land Systems Stryker M1128 <b>Mobile</b> <b>Gun</b> System.|$|E
