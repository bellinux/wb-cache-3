40|$|Maintenance {{system at}} UMKM ED Aluminum Yogyakarta is using {{preventive}} and corrective maintenance program, but {{the implementation of}} this program still have many problems. The problem occurs {{because there is no}} maintenance system program and the company doesn’t have Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) in maintenance to overcome machine failures resulted in the increase of the downtime value. To cope the problems,  in this paper we used application of SOP and appropriate task maintenance selection using Maintenance Value Stream Map (MVSM) method supported by Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). Beside task selected among all products that have been produced, there is one machine that gives the biggest profit to the company. The product is feet infusion. Kondia milling machine is one of machines produces the feet infusion that has the longest downtime which was 17, 75 hour during January 2016 until October 2016. RCM consist of Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Pareto diagram, decision worksheet RCM, whereas the MVSM describes the maintenance activity. Based on Pareto analysis, the critical components on the Kondia milling machine were the <b>magnetic</b> <b>contactor,</b> relay, fuse, cutter, dynamo and bearing.

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use <b>magnetic</b> <b>contactors.</b> Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit breakers as switching elements.|$|R
50|$|Starters using <b>magnetic</b> <b>{{contactor}}s</b> usually derive {{the power}} supply for the contactor coil {{from the same}} source as the motor supply. An auxiliary contact from the contactor is used to maintain the contactor coil energized after the start command for the motor has been released. If a momentary loss of supply voltage occurs, the contactor will open and not close again until a new start command is given. this prevents restarting of the motor after a power failure. This connection also provides a small degree of protection against low power supply voltage and loss of a phase. However since contactor coils will hold the circuit closed with as little as 80% of normal voltage applied to the coil, {{this is not a}} primary means of protecting motors from low voltage operation.|$|R

One among the technologies, which has greater developments, is the solar powered automatic shrimp feeding system. For instance, the solar power which is a renewable energy can be an alternative solution to energy crisis and basically reducing man power by using it in an automatic manner. The researchers believe an automatic shrimp feeding system may help solve problems on manual feeding operations. The project study aimed to design and develop a solar powered automatic shrimp feeding system. It specifically sought to prepare the design specifications of the project, to determine the methods of fabrication and assembly, and to test the response time of the automatic shrimp feeding system. The researchers designed and developed an automatic system which utilizes a 10 hour timer to be set in intervals preferred by the user and will undergo a continuous process. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>contactor</b> acts as a switch connected to the 10 hour timer which controls the activation or termination of electrical loads and powered {{by means of a}} solar panel outputting electrical power, and a rechargeable battery in electrical communication with the solar panel for storing the power. By undergoing through series of testing, the components of the modified system were proven functional and were operating within the desired output.

40|$|Voltage sag {{is short}} {{duration}} reduction of RMS voltage {{and it is}} recognized as the most serious power quality problem for industries in Malaysia. The impact of voltage sag to the industrial equipment depends on the severity of voltage sag and the sensitivity level of equipments itself toward voltage sag. The concept of EMC for voltage sag problem call for utilities, customers, equipment manufacturer and regulators to play their role {{in order to minimize}} the impact of voltage sag by virtue of complying to SEMI F 47 and MS IEC 61000 curve. This project focuses on determining the sensitivity level of selected industrial equipments by conducting Ride through Test (RTT) using CHROMA 6530 Programmable AC Source and PSL Industrial Power Corruptor. The industrial equipments selected are the production machine for Semiconductor industries (Tester Machine, Wire Bond Machines and Die Attached), Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Magnetic contactors. The sensitivity or Immunity level data of the selected industrial equipments against voltage sag has been established. Comparison on the sensitivity level among similar type of equipments is also performed. It is evident from the RTT results, that majority of semiconductor equipments are very sensitive to voltage sag. The RTT results for PLCs and <b>magnetic</b> <b>contactor</b> also indicate that these two equipments are very sensitive to voltage sag and establish themselves as one of the ‘weak links’ in industrial equipment system. The established sensitivity data for the industrial equipments is helpful in predicting estimated loss due to voltage sag and determining the best cost effective voltage sag mitigation solution to the industrial equipments...|$|E
5000|$|AC {{electric}} motors can be run in fixed-speed operation {{determined by the}} number of stator pole pairs in the motor and the frequency of the alternating current supply. AC motors can be made for [...] "pole changing" [...] operation, reconnecting the stator winding to vary the number of poles so that two, sometimes three, speeds are obtained. For example a machine with 8 physical pairs of poles, could be connected to allow running with either 4 or 8 pole pairs, giving two speeds - at 60 Hz, these would be 1800 RPM and 900 RPM. If speed changes are rare, the motor may be initially connected for one speed then re-wired for the other speed as process conditions change, or, <b>magnetic</b> <b>contactors</b> can be used to switch between the two speeds as process needs fluctuate. Connections for more than three speeds are uneconomic.|$|R
50|$|Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles showcased two battery {{electric}} {{road vehicles}} at the Commercial Vehicle Show in November 1937. They were both 12-15 cwt models, with a British Thompson-Houston (BTH) motor, which {{was controlled by}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>contactors,</b> {{similar to those used}} on Sunbeam-BTH trolleybuses. One was fitted with an open deck milk float body, suitable for dairy work, while the other had a van body, manufactured by Glover, Webb & Liversidge, and was one of a batch of vehicles supplied to Selfridges, the London department store. The motor was mounted {{in the middle of the}} vehicle, and drove the rear axle through a Hardy-Spicer propellor shaft and double reduction gearing. The chassis carried three batteries, one on either side between the wheels, and one at the rear. When the vehicle was tested by Commercial Motor in 1940, it was available with five sizes of battery, rated at 128, 160, 192, 224 or 240 amp-hours, the larger sizes giving a longer range between charges.|$|R

A coupling simulation with machine, electric, <b>magnetic</b> on the <b>contactor</b> {{has been achieved}} in this model. Dynamic parameters which were called use the secondary development technology of ADAMS. The dynamic contact pressure signal of an AC contactor was obtained with ADAMS’s own simultaneous solution such as electromagnetic suction, kinematics and dynamics equations. The simulation results and actual measurement of contactor contact pressure signals are very similar. However, {{the complexity of the}} measured contacts vibration is greater than the simulation results because the actual working condition is more complex.

40|$|The {{electron}} collection and emission {{characteristics of a}} simple hollow cathode contactor, an extended anode hollow cathode contactor supplied by JSC, and a ring cusp <b>magnetic</b> field <b>contactor</b> are presented {{and the effects of}} discharge power and argon or xenon expellant flowrate on these characteristics are examined. All of the contactors are shown to exhibit good electron emission performance over a wide range of discharge power and expellant type and flowrate. Good electron performance is shown to be more difficult to achieve. Results suggest that the extended anode and ring cusp contactors should perform satisfactorily to electron emission currents beyond 1000 mA and {{electron collection}} currents beyond 500 mA. All contactors performed better on xenon than argon. A general theory of plasma contactor operation in both the electron collection and electron emission modes, which describes the current-limiting effects of space-charge phenomena is given. This current-limiting and collecting phenomenon is shown to be a function of driving potential differences and emitting and collecting surface radius ratio for the case of a spherical geometry. Discharge power did not appear to influence the electron collection current substantially in the experiments so it is suggested in light of the model that the contactors are generally not limited by their ion production capabilities under conditions at which they were tested...|$|R
