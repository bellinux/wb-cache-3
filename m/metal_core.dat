The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E

40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as penetration bead thickness and toe radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wires for robotic GMAW. Even though <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> electrode. Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding.

Results indicated that for <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis.

Pulsed welding revealed that only a trade-off between values of bead thickness and penetration can create a quality weld.

Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the groove angle. The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a groove angle of 75 degrees. The use of <b>metal</b> <b>cored</b> filler wires could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the solid wires.

Materials and Methods: Nine hundred ninety-one patients (2, 124 cores) who received either cast <b>metal</b> or resin <b>cores</b> luted with adhesive resin cement at the Fixed Prosthodontic Clinic of Okayama University Dental Hospital between April 1988 and December 1991 and whose structured clinical core record was filled appropriately comprised the study subjects. The clinical core record included information regarding patient age, sex, core restoration type, tooth location, tooth type, remaining coronal dentin, and root canal form. CSRs, as well as causes for failure, were analyzed 15 years postinsertion. Since 381 patients lacked data regarding predictors for core failure, a subsample of 610 patients (1, 053 cores) was used for the subsequent risk factor analysis. Results: The cumulative CSR of resin cores (78. 7 %) was significantly higher than that of cast <b>metal</b> <b>cores</b> (55. 4 %; log-rank test, P<. 0001). The Cox proportional hazards test revealed that sex (male, P<. 0001), absence of remaining coronal dentin (P=. 0057), core restoration type (cast metal, P=. 0186), and higher age at core insertion (P=. 0380) were significant predictors for core failure.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the spectroscopic and thermodynamic characterization of the unusual metal-RNA cluster found in the P 5 abc subdomain of the Tetrahymena group I intron. The P 5 abc subdomain {{is a part of}} the P 4 -P 6 domain found in the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron selfsplicing RNA. From both X-ray crystal structures of the P 4 -P 6 domain, a remarkable cluster of Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + ions was found in the P 5 abc subdomain (Cate et al. 1996; Juneau et al. 2001). It is believed that the <b>metal</b> ion <b>core</b> in the P 5 abc subdomain stabilizes the active conformation of the RNA (Cate et al. 1996). An understanding of the role of these metal ions in facilitating the correct structure of the P 5 abc subdomain provides insight into how metal ions help overcome the folding barriers of complex RNA structures. Under solution conditions, the properties of this uncommon <b>metal</b> ion <b>core</b> and its influence on the truncated P 5 abc subdomain structure have been investigated. Both EPR spectroscopy and thermal denaturation experiments have been employed to search for a spectroscopic signature of <b>metal</b> ion <b>core</b> formation and also determine the thermodynamic contribution of the <b>metal</b> ion <b>core</b> on the stability of the folded P 5 abc structure. A spectroscopic signature of <b>metal</b> ion <b>core</b> formation was assigned for the P 5 abc subdomain by EPR microwave power saturation studies. Power saturation studies of the P 5 abc subdomain, P 4 -P 6 domain and corresponding mutants reveal that the addition of 5 equivalents of Mn 2 + are required for the wild type P 5 abc subdomain to form the <b>metal</b> ion <b>core</b> under solution conditions in 0. 1 M NaCl.

40|$|Reactors {{utilizing}} a highly energetic neutron spectrum, often termed fast reactors, offer large fuel utilization improvements over the thermal reactors currently used for nuclear energy generation. Conventional fast reactor deployment has been hindered by the perceived {{need to use}} plutonium as fuel, coupling the commercial introduction of fast reactors to the deployment of large-scale thermal reactor used fuel reprocessing. However, the future of used fuel treatment in the United States is highly uncertain, creating a bottleneck for the introduction of fast reactor technology. A strategy centered around using uranium-fueled fast reactor cores in a once-through mode-a uranium startup fast reactor (USFR) -decouples fast reactor commercialization from fuel reprocessing and enables transition to a recycle mode once the technology becomes available and economic. The present work investigates the optimal strategy for recycling spent fuel from once-through sodium cooled fast reactors (SFRs), by analyzing the performance of various designs. A range of acceptable transitions are described and their economic, breeding, nonproliferation, and safety performance are characterized. A key finding is that the burnups of all cores were limited by the allowable fluence to the cladding {{rather than by the}} core reactivity. The carbide cores achieve fluence-limited burnups 15 - 25 % greater than the comparable <b>metal</b> <b>cores,</b> though the <b>metal</b> <b>cores</b> can be optimized via decrementing the fuel volume fraction to reach fluence-limited burnups within 10 % of the carbide cores. The removal of minor actinides from the recycled fuel has a minimal impact on the achievable burnups of both types of fuels, decreasing the fluence-limited burnup by less than half a percent in all cases. Similarly, long-term storage of the USFR fuel had minimal impact on the achievable burnups of all cores, decreasing the fluencelimited burnup by no more than 2 % in all cases. Levelized fuel costs were in the range of 5. 98 mills/kWh to 7. 27 mills/kWh for the carbide cores, and 6. 81 mills/kWh to 7. 57 mills/kWh for the optimized <b>metal</b> <b>cores,</b> which is competitive with fuel costs of current LWRs and once-through SFRs. The metal and carbide multicore cores, made using slightly more than one once-through SFR core, functioned as slight fissile burners with fissile inventory ratios (FIRs) near 0. 9. The uranium+ cores, made using one oncethrough SFR core plus natural uranium makeup, functioned in a fissile self-sustaining mode with FIRs near unity. All cores discharged fuel that was less attractive for weapon use than that of an LWR. The carbide cores had maximum sodium void worths in the range of $ 2. 81 -$ 2. 86, approximately half the worth of the <b>metal</b> <b>cores,</b> which were in the range of $ 4. 97 -$ 5. 14. Carbide and <b>metal</b> multicore <b>cores</b> possessed initial reactivities in the range of 15, 000 pcm, requiring either multi-batch staggered reloading or control system modifications to achieve acceptable shutdown margins. The uranium+ carbide and <b>metal</b> <b>cores</b> achieved acceptable shutdown margin with the nominal control configuration and the single-batch reloading scheme. The overall conclusion is that USFR spent fuel is readily usable for recycle. by Joshua Richard. Thesis (S. M.)
