5000|$|When a {{merchant}} swipes a customer's credit card, {{the credit card}} terminal connects to the <b>merchant's</b> <b>acquirer,</b> or credit card processor, which verifies that the customer's account is valid and that sufficient funds are available to cover the transaction's cost. At this step, the funds are [...] "held" [...] and deducted from the customer's credit limit (or available bank balance, {{in the case of}} a debit card) but are not yet transferred to the merchant. At the end of the day, the merchant instructs the credit card machine to submit the finalized transactions to the acquirer in a [...] "batch transfer," [...] which begins the settlement process, where the funds are transferred from the customer's accounts to the merchant's accounts.|$|R

30|$|The bank-level data permits us to {{identify}} both the issuer (consumer) and <b>acquirer</b> (<b>merchant)</b> {{sides of the}} two-sided market. As we will describe in the following section, this distinction between issuer and acquirer sides is also important {{to identify}} the network effects for merchant and consumers that affect their respective transaction volumes.|$|R
5000|$|An {{acquiring}} bank (also {{known simply as}} an acquirer) is a bank or financial institution that processes credit or debit card payments {{on behalf of a}} <b>merchant.</b> [...] The <b>acquirer</b> allows <b>merchants</b> to accept credit card payments from the card-issuing banks within an association. The best-known (credit) card associations are Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Indian Rupay, American Express, Diners Club, Japan Credit Bureau and China UnionPay.|$|R
40|$|We analyse a card {{payment system}} {{to assess the}} {{economic}} impact of the interchange fee. This fee is paid by the bank of the <b>merchant,</b> the <b>acquirer,</b> to the bank of the consumer, the issuer. We build up a mode in order to explore whether the interchange fee can enhance the participation to the system and thus increase the benefits of the system as a whole. We also investigate what kind of incentives the interchange fee provides to the actors of the system. We show that the interchange fee selected by the card associations differs from the one that would be selected by a welfare maximising social planner. Moreover the interchange fee selected by the market is likely to produce a smaller market for cards than the socially optimal one. ...|$|R

40|$|Interchange {{fees are}} interbank {{transfers}} {{that are used}} by payment platforms to allocate {{the total cost of}} a payment card transaction between the cardholder's bank (the Issuer) and the <b>merchant's</b> bank (the <b>Acquirer).</b> Each time a consumer pays by card, the Issuer of the card pays an interchange fee to the Acquirer of the transaction. In this paper, I study how banks' investments in payment card systems impact the privately and the socially optimal interchange fees. I show that if the Acquirer's contribution to investments is high, and if the consumers benefit more than the merchants from investments, the payment platform may decide to lower the interchange fee so as to encourage banks' investments in quality.

30|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} POS and ATM debit card transactions volumes in Spain, their interactions and their overall impact on the demand for currency. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} paper simultaneously exploring both usages of debit cards and the effects on the demand for money. From a policy point of view, the use of debit cards has been identified as one of the main examples of the transition from paper-based to electronic-based systems. 18 However, ATM transactions and POS transactions have opposite effects since the use of debit cards at ATMs increases cash withdrawals while the use of debit cards at POS reduces cash holdings for purchasing purposes. In this paper, we use a unique bank-level database for Spain that allows us to identify the issuer (consumer) and <b>acquirer</b> (<b>merchant)</b> sides of the use of debit cards at POS as well as the number of debit card withdrawals at a bank.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} two game-theoretic {{settings to}} determine the optimal values of an issuerís interchange fee rate, an acquirerís merchant discount rate, and a merchantís retail price in a credit card network. In the Örst setting, we investigate a two-stage game problem in which the issuer and the acquirer Örst negotiate the interchange fee rate, and the acquirer and the retailer then determine their merchant discount rate and retail price, respectively. In the second setting, motivated by the recent U. S. bill ìH. R. 2695,î we develop a three-player cooperative game in which the issuer, the <b>acquirer,</b> and the <b>merchant</b> form a grand coalition and bargain over the interchange fee rate and the merchant discount rate. Following the cooperative game, the retailer makes its retail pricing decision. We derive both the Shapley value- and the nucleolus-characterized, and globally-optimal unique rates for the grand coalition. Comparing the two game settings, we Önd that {{the participation of the}} merchant in the negotiation process can result in the reduction of both rates. Moreover, the stability of the grand coalition in the cooperative game setting may require that the merchant should delegate the credit card business only to the issuer and the acquirer with su¢ ciently low operation costs. We also show that the grand coalition {{is more likely to be}} stable and the U. S. bill ìH.

50|$|In 1996, Citibank, Itaucard and Unibanco {{believed}} {{it was necessary to}} have a company specialized in merchant acquiring and payment processing and founded Rede as Redecard by spinning off Credicard´s merchant acquiring and payment processing activities. In that same year, MasterCard International also became a shareholder of Rede. Since then, Rede has been the main <b>merchant</b> <b>acquirer</b> and payment processor for MasterCard and Diners Club International branded credit and debit cards in Brazil.|$|E
50|$|In {{practical}} applications, {{one would}} have several BDKs on record, possibly for different customers, or to contain the scope of key compromise. When processing transactions, {{it is important for}} the receiver to know which BDK was used to initialize the originating device. To achieve this, the 80-bit KSN is structured into three parts: as Key Set ID, a TRSM ID, and the transaction counter. The algorithm specifies that the transaction counter is 21-bits, but treats the remaining 59 bits opaquely (the algorithm only specifies that unused bits be 0-padded to a nibble boundary, and then 'f' padded to the 80-bit boundary). Because of this, the entity managing the creation of the DUKPT devices (typically a <b>merchant</b> <b>acquirer)</b> is free to subdivide the 59 bits according to their preference.|$|E
50|$|Before DUKPT, {{state-of-the-art}} at {{the time}} scheme was known as Master/Session. This required every PIN encrypting device to be initialized with a unique master key. This created the unwanted side effect where a table of encryption keys {{as large as the}} number of devices deployed was needed, when handling transactions originating from devices using Master/Session key management, given the need for unique keys per device. This table could become quite large for a major <b>merchant</b> <b>acquirer.</b> DUKPT solved this problem because - although each device is still initialized with a distinct key - this device initialization key is derived from a different key which an entire family of devices may share. Hence, the recipient of encrypted messages needs only to store one key to support a large number of devices in the field, while simultaneously meeting the unique-key-per-device requirement.|$|E
40|$|In {{a payment}} card {{association}} such as Visa, {{each time a}} consumer pays by card, {{the bank of the}} <b>merchant</b> (<b>acquirer)</b> pays an interchange fee (IF) to the bank of the cardholder (issuer) to carry on the transaction. This paper studies the determinants of socially and privately optimal IFs in a card scheme where services are provided by a monopoly issuer and perfectly competitive acquirers. We develop a framework that distinguishes card membership from card usage (transaction) decisions (and fees). In doing so, we reveal the implications of a structural asymmetry between consumers and merchants: the card usage decision at a point of sale is ultimately delegated to cardholders. Merchants are not allowed to turn down cards once affiliated with a card network. We show that this asymmetry induces the card association to set a too high IF creating scope scope for regulatory interventions, e. g., caps on IFs. These qualitative results are robust to imperfect issuer competition, imperfect acquirer competition, and to other factors affecting final demands, such as elastic consumer participation or strategic card acceptance to attract customers...|$|E

40|$|The {{value chain}} for network-branded prepaid cards {{involves}} more parties than those commonly present in credit- or debit-card issuing arrangements: the <b>merchant</b> <b>acquirer,</b> processors, a payment network, and a card-issuing bank. These additional participants may include a program manager, a distributor, and a seller. Since {{a number of}} independent businesses make up the chain, each one, as well as cardholding consumers, could be exposed to losses resulting from the insolvency of another party in the value chain. This risk is both real and manageable, as illustrated by two recent incidents involving network-branded prepaid cards: the failures of Silverton Bank, N. A [...] and Sprinbok Services, Inc. The Payment Cards Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia hosted a workshop of March 17, 2011, to examine the implications of insolvency in the network-branded prepaid-card value chains, to review how market participants have responded to this risk, and to discuss controls the industry has developed to mitigate and address these challenges, Kirsten Trusko, president of the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association (NBPCA); Terry Maher, partner at Baird Holm LLP and general counsel to the NBPCA; Jeremy Kuiper, {{managing director of the}} Bancorp Bank; and Ted Martinez, head of Visa’s North America credit settlement risk team, led the workshop. This paper summarizes the information presented at the workshop, including the ways in which consumers and businesses are protected from the insolvency of the issuing bank or a key participant. In addition, this paper highlights practices that have been developed in the industry to mitigate this risk. Electronic funds transfers...|$|E
