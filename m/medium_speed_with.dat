50|$|Banana Boats: The {{players were}} divided by sex {{and told to}} climb onto banana boats that were to be towed behind a powerboat. The {{challenge}} was for the men {{to move to the}} womens boat and the women to the mens without anyone falling in the water. There were three rounds, one at a very slow speed, worth $1,000 if successful, one at a <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> a shorter rope, worth $3,000 if successful, and one at a very fast speed with a shorter rope still, worth $6,000 if successful. Each round lasted ten minutes. The players easily won the first round, but ran out of time in the second, after the mens boat tipped over multiple times. The players won the last round with 2 seconds to spare, totaling $7,000 for this assignment.|$|E

The collected data {{have been used to}} produce iso-contours of thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX), specific hydrocarbons (HC) and specific carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a power-speed plane. The performance and emission maps are experimentally investigated, compared, and critically discussed.

For diesel and RME single fueling the maximum specific NOX emissions are centered at the mid speed, mid power region.

40|$|During vehicle {{deceleration}} due to {{friction between the}} lining and the brake drum, kinetic energy of the vehicle is turned into thermal energy that raises temperature of the drum brake components. This causesthermal elastic instability that affects braking performance and the brake drum lining failure. This work aimed to study the dynamic behaviors of the drum brake under various braking conditions. Three cases ofsevere braking are considered i. e., high wheel speed without carrying load, <b>medium</b> wheel <b>speed</b> without carrying load and <b>medium</b> wheel <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> full load. Moreover, a case of normal braking, having high wheelspeed without carrying load is also included for comparison purpose. Two dimensional finite element technique was adopted to simulate the dynamic interaction between temperature distribution, brake shoe movementand the declined of wheel speed. The coupled thermo-mechanical results reveal that severe braking {{is an important factor}} that causes high non-uniform temperature distributions and high-risk thermal elastic instability; whereas wheel speed and vehicle load have less effect on the braking behaviors...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a numerical procedure for the simulation of a marine propulsion plant in transient conditions: the model describes {{in detail the}} various elements of the propulsion system and the interactions existing between each of them. The thermodynamic behaviour of the main engine {{as well as of}} the turbocharger group is modelled, in order to predict not only the mechanical stress of the plant due to the transient conditions, but also the thermal stresses and working point of the compressor and of the turbine (pressure and temperature at inlet/outlet). As a first application of the model, the case is considered of a twin screw vessel powered by two four stroke <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> diesel engines <b>with</b> controllable pitch propellers. The simulations presented in the paper regard two transient manoeuvres of the ship: slam-start (from zero speed to full ahead) and crash stop (from full ahead to zero <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> a “full astern” command). The results of the simulations are compared with the available experimental data, regarding the time histories of the vessel speed, space run before a complete stop, propeller r. p. m. and shaft power, showing a good accordance. The procedure can be utilised to check the behaviour of the turbocharger group during a transient manoeuvre and to identify possible improvements in the ship control system or in the pitch-r. p. m. combination law to optimise the performances, in term of e. g. stopping space of the vessel or thermal and mechanical stresses of the plan...|$|R
