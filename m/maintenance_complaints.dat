However, engineered aerobic biological {{treatment of}} wastewater has been practiced in the United States, on a large scale, {{for only a few}} decades. In fact, in 1925, 80 percent of all cities in the United States with populations of over 100, 000 had no treatment systems at all (Linsley 1972). The basic aerobic treatment process involves providing a suitable oxygen rich environment for organisms that can reduce the organic portion of the waste into carbon dioxide and water in the presence of oxygen. With the ever increasing development of land, both suburban and rural, large central sewerage systems have not always been cost-effective or available. Many homeowners still rely on individual septic tank or other systems to treat and dispose of household wastewater onsite. Historically, aerobic treatment was not feasible on a small scale, and septic tanks were the primary treatment device, but recent technology advances make individual aerobic treatment systems efficient and affordable. Aerobic systems are similar to septic systems in that they both use natural processes to treat wastewater. But unlike septic (anaerobic) treatment, the aerobic treatment process requires oxygen. Aerobic treatment units, therefore, use a mechanism to inject and circulate air inside the treatment tank. Because aerobic systems use a higher rate process, they are able to achieve superior effluent quality. The effluent can be discharged to the subsurface as in a septic tank leach field or, in some cases, discharged directly to the surface. Current Technologies Individual aerobic systems have been in place since the 1950 's, however, these early systems consisted of little more than an aerator placed in a traditional septic tank. They were prone to noise, odor and <b>maintenance</b> <b>complaints,</b> and were used only where standard septic tanks were not feasible. The newer aerobic treatment units are pre-engineered and operate at a high level of efficiency. The demand for these units and the desire for direct surface discharge of the treated waste stream has led to a certification process by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). This certification (NSF Standar...|$|E

Previous research using a thought-experiment procedure showed that contamination rather than harm-related outcome expectancies differentiated best {{between high and}} low spider fearful undergraduates. This study investigated the alleged role of these UCS-expectancy biases in the <b>maintenance</b> of phobic <b>complaints.</b> First, this study sought to replicate these earlier findings in a community sample of high spider fearful individuals who applied for treatment (n = 60) and a sample of low spider fear controls (n = 30). Second, the present study tested if UCS-expectancies disappear following successful treatment and whether there were any differences between harm and contamination-related UCS expectancies in this respect. If contamination-and/or harm-related UCS-expectancy biases {{play a critical role in}} the maintenance of spider fear, these biases should be substantially reduced after successful treatment. The results showed that spider fearful individuals associated spiders relatively strongly with both harm-and contamination-related outcomes. Consistent with the alleged reciprocal relationship between phobic fear and UCS expectancy bias, both types of biased expectancies were effectively reduced following treatment.

5000|$|Combat {{experience}} {{showed that}} the I-16 had deficiencies; several aircraft were lost after structural failure of the wings which was quickly remedied by reinforced structures. Heavy machine gun bullets could sometimes penetrate the armored backrest and fuel tanks occasionally caught fire in spite of being protected. The hot Spanish summers required the addition of oil radiators, and dust adversely affected {{the life of the}} engines. Although some aircraft accumulated up to 400 hours of flying time, the average life of an I-16 was 87 days, of which one sixth was spent on <b>maintenance.</b> The biggest <b>complaint</b> in service was the light armament of only two 7.62 mm (0.30 in) machine guns. This was urgently addressed with the Type 6 which added a third ShKAS {{in the bottom of the}} fuselage. The four-gun Type 10 was nicknamed [...] "Super Mosca" [...] or simply [...] "Super".The total number of I-16s delivered to Spain from 1936 to 1938 amounted to 276. When the war ended on 1 April 1939, 187 Ratas had been lost in Spain: 112 lost in combat, one shot down by anti-aircraft fire, eleven destroyed on the ground, one force-landed and 62 lost in accidents.|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Not just {{avoidance}} behaviour, {{but also}} painful task persistence {{might be a}} risk factor for development and <b>maintenance</b> of pain <b>complaints.</b> In seeking to. understand these dysfunctional patterns of task performance, {{it has been suggested that}} mood influences the individuals' motivation to persist in a task depending on the interpretation of current mood within a certain motivational context. The aim of the present study was to test the effects of a social responsibility context and mood on persistence on a painful finger pressing task. Methods: A 2 Mood (positive vs. negative) x 2 Responsibility (high vs. neutral) between-subjects factorial design was used in which 79 healthy participants (53 women; mean age = 22. 99 years, SD = 4. 77) performed the finger pressing task. Results: The results show that mood and sense of responsibility independently influence task persistence: participants in a negative as opposed to positive mood spent more time on the task; the same was true for participants who reported a stronger sense of responsibility. In addition, an increase in pain during the task was associated with longer task persistence. No effect of pain-related fear on task persistence was found. Conclusion: This experimental study was the first to demonstrate an effect of sense of responsibility on persistence in a painful physical task. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} functional somatic syndromes {{is the presence}} of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the <b>maintenance</b> of the <b>complaints.</b> Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network. This alternative approach is {{based on the fact that}} self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments...|$|R

Thus, local authorities should have well-established management system to ensure that those assets are appropriately maintained for the benefits of local communities. Asset condition is {{a critical factor in}} decision making during asset <b>maintenance</b> process. Public <b>complaints</b> serve as one of the information sources to obtain the latest asset condition information. Nowadays, most of the local authorities used e-Complaint system as a platform for their customers to lodge their complaints on the services and public assets. However, utilization of present e-Complaint system is usually in tabular form and does not integrate with Geographical Information System (GIS). This research aims to provide GIS visualization for authorities and their stakeholders for easier identification of vulnerable asset types and locations. In this research, ArcGIS 9. 3 was used to develop GIS based e-Complaint system for managing, integrating and facilitating the visualization of complaint data and spatial data. The research area includes all public assets under the jurisdiction of Johor Bahru Tengah Municipal Council (MPJBT). Two platforms namely ArcGIS desktop and web-based GIS were employed to display the outcome of the developed system. This system was used to analyse MPJBT complaint database for the year 2010 from selected residential areas and allow administrators to determine the concentration of complaints as well as vulnerable asset types and locations. GIS visualization including maps, graphs and attribute tables serve as a better platform to provide a better understanding for analysis of current situations which facilitate future planning. As a conclusion, GIS based e-Complaint system can help to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public asset maintenance by determination of the concentration of vulnerable assets and socio-economic status through the interpretation of GIS visualization methods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results from a survey of transit agencies on web-based feedback tools and their role in enabling communication between agencies and riders. Motivation for the survey stems from the growing importance of web-based feedback tools in improving transit services. Web-based feedback can improve transit agencies' knowledge of issues relating to their systems while enhancing the transit riding experience. As the availability of Internet and smartphones increases among transit users, the tools available to gather feedback have grown in response. Web- and smartphone-based tools are instrumental in collecting {{a wide range of}} feedback, including commendations and <b>complaints,</b> <b>maintenance</b> issues, transit services, safety and security, long-term planning and other transit operations related issues. At the same time, transit agencies must determine how to best respond and manage the growing presence of information on the web relating to their agencies performance. Through a web-based survey administered to 130 transit agencies in the United States and Canada, information was gathered on the current and planned use of web-based tools by transit agencies. The overall survey results show that most transit agencies focus on sorting and responding to unsolicited feedback being collected primarily through social media, email, and online forms. Additionally, transit agencies see the benefits of web-based customer feedback, noting that the key to managing their systems into the future will involve developing agency-wide digital feedback plans that allow automation and integration across all feedback channels. Finally, transit agencies also noted that the primary downside to web-based feedback involved a lack of staff resources to support their systems. This thesis provides further analysis focusing on three questions regarding the survey results: -	How can agency size, based on unlinked trips, influence the survey responses collected from agencies regarding their use of web-based feedback tools? -	What variables from the survey can influence a transit agencies ability to provide web-based feedback tools to their riders? -	What factors might contribute to differences in transit agencies rider access estimates to Internet and smartphones? While the results show that larger agencies are able to offer more web-based feedback tools to their riders, there were problems with transit agencies incorrectly estimating their riders’ access to Internet and smartphones. This could cause issues regarding agencies ability to understand which web-based tools they should implement to engage their riders. This thesis details one portion of an overall project, which will provide framework for agencies to assess their needs and resources to determine how to create their own effective customer feedback systems in relation to what web-based feedback tools will most benefit themselves and their riders.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Quality, {{service and}} {{ambience}} are concepts {{synonymous with the}} restaurant industry. Whilst the importance of these, and the integral function they perform in ensuring guest satisfaction and ultimately {{the success of a}} restaurant can hardly be denied, how effectively these inextricable concepts have been integrated within restaurants of Hermanus is of particular interest to various stakeholders. In a recent article submitted to an impact study conducted by GHACT (Greater Hermanus Association for Commerce and Tourism) titled: "Restaurateurs and Other Catering Outlets - February 2002 ", the Chairman of the Restaurateurs Association of Hermanus stated: "Restaurateurs usually are very impulsive individual personalities, working long hours - they do not comply with regulations; do their own thing and do not plan their strategies for the future - seat of the pants. We urgently need to start managing and policing our industry similar to accommodation establishments (e. g [...] cleanliness, quality control and star ratings.) " The aim of this study project, originally commissioned by GHACT, is to contribute to GHACT's aim of stimulating commerce and tourism to Hermanus as part of their functions of core marketing, project development (impact studies), environment <b>maintenance,</b> and <b>complaint</b> resolution. A review of related literature as well as information gathered from 273 interviews, concerning 43 out of approximately 51 restaurants, forms the backdrop to this document. Definitions of key terms, investigation into previous empirical research, and identification of various excellence and guest satisfaction techniques, are the major focal points of this literature review. Four quality, service and ambience related assessments form part of the research, namely: 1) industry consistency in dealing with seasonality; 2) competitiveness between six specific restaurants; 3) tourist versus resident perceptions of restaurant excellence; and 4) individual restaurant excellence development areas. It was concluded that, although consistency throughout 2002 {{does not appear to be}} a concern for the Hermanus restaurant industry, the actual levels of quality, service and ambience offered by certain restaurants are below an acceptable standard. The Quality Matrix intervention presented in Chapter 5 integrates the tangible and intangible product and service standards essential for service excellence and guest satisfaction within all restaurants of Hermanus. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Kwaliteit, diens en atmosfeer is konsepte wat sinoniem is met die restaurantbedryf. Alhoewel die belangrikheid van hierdie konsepte sentraal is om tevredenheid by gebruikers te verseker en uiteindelik om sukses te bepaal, is dit ook belangrik vir belanghebbendes om te sien hoe effektief hierdie konsepte in die restaurantbedryf van Hermanus ingeburger is. In 'n onlangse artikel deur GHACT (Greater Hermanus Association for Commerce and Tourism), getiteld: "Restauranteurs and Other Catering Outlets - February 2002 ", sê die voorsitter van die Restauranteurs Assosiasie van Hermanus dat "Restaurateurs usually are very impulsive individual personalities, working long hours - they do not comply with regulations; do their own thing and do not plan their strategies for the future - seat of the pants. We urgently need to start managing and policing our industry similar to accommodation establishments (e. g [...] cleanliness, quality control and star ratings.) " Hierdie projek is deur GHAT aangepak in 'n poging om toerisme en koophandel in Hermanus te stimuleer deur impak studies, bemarking, omgewingsbeheer en klagte oplossing. 'n Oorsig van soortgelyke literatuur sowel as informasie wat versamel is van 273 onderhoude met betrekking tot 43 restaurante vorm die agtergrond van hierdie dokument. Die fokuspunt van hierdie literatuuroorsig was om die kern begrippe te definiëer, die bevindings van ander empiriese navorsing te analiseer, en tegnieke wat uitstaande diens en tevredenheid by gebruikers te verseker, te ondersoek. Vier kwaliteit, diens en atmosfeer verwante evalueringsareas vorm deel van die ondersoek, naamlik: 1) die eenvormigheid van die industrie in die hantering van seisoensverandering; 2) mededinging tussen ses spesifieke restaurante; 3) toeriste se persepsie teenoor die plaaslike inwoners se persepsie van restaurant kwaliteit en 4) individuele restaurant ontwikkelings areas. Alle gevolgtrekkings wat gemaak is in hierdie dokument is gebaseer op die bevindings van bogenoemde toetse. Daar is tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat alhoewel betroubaarheid nie 'n probleem blyk te wees vir die Hermanus restaurantbedryf nie, werklike kwaliteit, diensvlakke en atmosfeer deur sekere restaurante aangebied, wel onder aanvaarbare standaarde was. Die kwaliteitsmatriks voorgestel in Hoofstuk 5 integreer die tasbare en ontasbare produk en noodsaaklike standaarde vir kwaliteit diens en tevredenheid by gebruikers by al die restaurante in Hermanus...|$|R
