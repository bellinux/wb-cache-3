40|$|BACKGROUND. —Men {{diagnosed}} with clinically localized prostate carcinoma have several treatment options. The investigation of these options may delay {{the initiation of}} definitive therapy. In the current study, the authors evaluated whether time from biopsy to radical prostatectomy (RP) was predictive of postoperative biochemical disease recurrence (BCR). METHODS. —A total of 3149 consecutive patients who underwent RP as their initial treatment for prostate carcinoma {{within a year of}} diagnosis were identified. The time between diagnosis and RP was entered as a predictor in a multivariate logistic regression model predicting BCR at 3 years, 5 years, 8 years, and 10 years. The year surgery was performed and the nomogram-predicted probability of recurrence, which incorporates stage of disease, Gleason grade, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, were used as covariates. RESULTS. —The authors found no clear evidence of a significant effect of delay to diagnosis on BCR. For those patients treated within 6 months (96 % of the total sample) the odds ratio for each additional <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> was 1. 04, 1. 07, 1. 08, and 1. 02, respectively, for 3 -year, 5 -year, 8 -year, and 10 -year BCR-free survival (P> 0. 2 for all analyses).

40|$|AbstractWe {{analyzed}} {{outcomes for}} 668 {{patients who had}} systemic treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) to assess the utility of early treatment change for exacerbation of cGVHD as a surrogate for survival endpoints in clinical trials. Fifty-six percent of patients had treatment change within 2 years after diagnosis of cGVHD. The median onset of treatment change was 4. 4 months (range: 0. 3 - 50 months). The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years was 16 %, and overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 74 %. In time-dependent Cox models, treatment change was associated {{with an increase in}} risk of NRM (hazard ratio, 2. 53; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 - 3. 7; P <. 0001). The hazard ratio was attenuated by 6 % per <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in treatment change. Our results confirm that exacerbation of cGVHD is associated with an increased risk of NRM and with decreased OS, but the strength of this association is not large enough to allow the use of early exacerbation as a surrogate for survival endpoints in clinical trials. Other measures of clinical benefit, such as response, will need to be developed as endpoints in phase II trials for patients with cGVHD...|$|E

40|$|Summary Background: to {{evaluate}} if time between surgery {{and the first}} adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone therapy) in patients with breast cancer is {{a risk factor for}} lower overall survival (OS). Method: data from a five-year retrospective cohort study of all women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at an academic oncology service were collected and analyzed. Results: three hundred forty-eight consecutive women were included. Time between surgery and the first adjuvant treatment was a risk factor for shorter overall survival (HR= 1. 3, 95 CI 1. 06 - 1. 71, p= 0. 015), along with negative estrogen receptor, the presence of lymphovascular invasion and greater tumor size. A delay longer than 4 months between surgery and the first adjuvant treatment was also associated with shorter overall survival (cumulative survival of 80. 9 % for delays ≤ 4 months vs. 72. 6 % for delays > 4 months; p= 0. 041, log rank test). Conclusion: each <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> between surgery and the first adjuvant treatment in women with invasive breast cancer increases the risk of death in 1. 3 -fold, and this effect is independent of all other well-established risk factors. Based on these results, we recommend further public strategies to decrease this interval...|$|E
40|$|Why {{should you}} or anyone be {{interested}} in conducting a time intensive energy audit. What equipment is needed? When should you get started? Who should do it? The answer to Why is that energy costs are cutting into a company?s profit every minute of every day. Inefficient energy usage is like having money lost or stolen. Energy costs may account for up to 25 % of a company?s expenses {{and hundreds of thousands}} of dollars a year. To answer What will be discussed later in this paper. The answer to When is that the energy audit needs to be done now! Every day and <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> is throwing money away that could be put back into the business or distributed as profit.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{health care}} systems now use {{priority}} wait lists for scheduling elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, but there {{have not yet been}} any direct estimates of reductions in in-hospital mortality rate afforded by ensuring that the operation is performed within recommended time periods. Methods We used a population-based registry to identify patients with established coronary artery disease who underwent isolated CABG in British Columbia, Canada. We studied whether postoperative survival during hospital admission for CABG differed significantly among patients who waited for surgery longer than the recommended time, 6 weeks for patients needing semi-urgent surgery and 12 weeks for those needing non-urgent surgery. Results Among 7316 patients who underwent CABG, 97 died during the same hospital admission, for a province-wide death rate at discharge of 1. 3 %. The observed proportion of patients who died during the same admission was 1. 0 % (27 deaths among 2675 patients) for patients treated within the recommended time and 1. 5 % (70 among 4641) for whom CABG was delayed. After adjustment for age, sex, anatomy, comorbidity, calendar period, hospital, and mode of admission, patients with early CABG were only 2 / 3 as likely as those for whom CABG was delayed to experience in-hospital death (odds ratio 0. 61; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 39 to 0. 96). There was a linear trend of 5 % increase in the odds of in-hospital death for every additional <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> before surgery, adjusted OR = 1. 05 (95 % CI 1. 00 to 1. 11).

40|$|Introduction: Routine viral load (VL) {{monitoring}} is {{utilized to}} assess antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and virologic failure, {{and it is}} currently scaled-up in many resource-constrained settings. The first routine VL is recommended as late as six months after ART initiation for early detection of sub-optimal adherence. We aimed to assess the optimal timing of first VL measurement after initiation of ART. Methods: This was a retrospective, cohort analysis of routine monitoring data of adults enrolled at three primary care clinics in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, between January 2002 and March 2009. Primary outcomes were virologic failure and switch to second-line ART comparing patients in whom first VL done was at three months (VL 3 M) and six months (VL 6 M) after ART initiation. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. Results: In total, 6264 patients were included for the time to virologic failure and 6269 for the time to switch to second-line ART analysis. Patients in the VL 3 M group had a 22 % risk reduction of virologic failure (aHR 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 64 – 0. 95; p= 0. 016) and a 27 % risk reduction of switch to second-line ART (aHR 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 92; p= 0. 008) when compared to patients in the VL 6 M group. For each additional <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> of the first VL measurement (up to nine months), the risk of virologic failure increased by 9 % (aHR 1. 09, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 15; p= 0. 008) and switch to second-line ART by 13 % (aHR 1. 13, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 21; p< 0. 001). Conclusions: A first VL at three months rather than six months with targeted adherence interventions for patients with high VL may improve long-term virologic suppression and reduce switches to costly second-line ART. ART programmes should consider the first VL measurement at three months after ART initiation...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, Mexico redefined {{the role of}} the state in its economy through an ambitious program to liberalize trade, promote {{efficiency}} and reduce the size and scope of the state-owned sector. In Mexico, privatization led to a significant improvement in firm performance, as profitability increased 24 percentage points and converged to levels similar to those of private firms. From this increase, at most 5 percent can be attributed to higher prices and 31 percent to transfers from workers, with the remaining 64 percent representing productivity gains. There is evidence that privatization provides other social benefits, as greater access to services, which usually follows privatization, leads to welfare gains for the poorest consumers that outweigh any increase in prices. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect of privatization is its fiscal impact, whereby the proceeds from the sale are augmented by reduced subsidies and increased taxes and can help pay off debt or finance social spending. The Mexican privatization program can provide a valuable guide to privatization dos and don 9 ̆ 2 ts: First, the privatization process must be carefully designed and run in a transparent way. Special requirements such as bans on foreign direct investment or cash-only payments lead to substantial price discounts for firms sold, while simplicity breeds competition and leads to higher prices. A transparent program can also help quell the tendency of politicians to favor their friends by tweaking the rules of the game. Second, restructuring firms prior to privatization is counterproductive in raising net sale prices and should be avoided. Governments spend substantial resources on politically motivated investment or efficiency programs that are not valued by bidders and which can rarely be justified on the social ground on which they are sold. Additionally, restructuring programs lengthen the privatization process considerably and lower prices for firms sold 9 ̆ 7 in the case of Mexico, each <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> reduced the sale price by 2. 2 percent. Finally, this paper argues that it is essential to carefully deregulate and re-regulate privatized firms to ensure that they behave appropriately as well as to provide a corporate governance framework to ensure firms are able to finance their operations without relying on the Government for help...|$|E
30|$|The {{concurrent}} {{diagnosis of}} breast cancer and an unexpected early pregnancy represents the most challenging treatment scenario. It is considered that abortion is not a therapeutic procedure in these cases [13], but termination of pregnancy can be considered {{in order to facilitate}} completion of treatment. For patients at the first trimester who desire to continue the pregnancy, treatment is possible but there is a limited number of options during the first weeks of gestation. In fact, chemotherapy is prohibited during the first trimester, and endocrine treatments are not feasible [13, 15]. Surgery is safe at any time and during the first trimester as well [16], but breast conservation performed during a very early gestational age is associated with a long delay in postoperative radiotherapy. Unfortunately, there is limited and retrospective experience published on the delayed radiotherapy after breast conservation and its effect on outcome. In a study evaluating 568 patients with T 1 –T 2 N 0 breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and radiotherapy without systemic treatment, similar rate of recurrence was reported in node negative patients when radiotherapy starts up to 16  weeks after definitive surgery after a median follow-up of 11.2  years [17]. Another retrospective study reported on 13, 907 patients aged 65  years or older with stage I–II breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and radiotherapy taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare database. The authors concluded that delays of > 3  months were associated with poor survival, even though older age, black race, advanced stage, more comorbidities, and being unmarried were associated with longer time intervals between surgery and RT, and therefore, {{it is not clear whether}} the association is causal or due to confounding factors [18]. Chen et al. [19] performed a systematic review on the relationship between waiting time for radiotherapy and clinical outcomes with special attention on local recurrence. In this meta-analysis considering 20 high quality studies that had adequately controlled for confounding factors, a significant increase of local failure was demonstrated with increasing waiting times. The authors subsequently converted the relative risks derived from the meta-analysis into estimates of the increment in risk attributable to 1  month of the waiting time for RT and this translated into an absolute increase in the risk of local recurrence of 1.0  % per <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> of staring RT.|$|E
