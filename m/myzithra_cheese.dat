5000|$|Greek cuisine is {{very diverse}} and {{although}} there are many common characteristics amongst the culinary traditions of different regions within the country, there are also many differences, making it difficult to present a full list of representative dishes. For example, the vegetarian dish [...] "Chaniotiko Boureki" [...] (oven baked slices of potatoes with zucchini, <b>myzithra</b> <b>cheese</b> and mint) is a typical dish in western Crete, in the region of Chania. A family in Chania may consume this dish 1-2 times per week in the summer season. However, it is not cooked in any other region of Greece.Many food items are wrapped in Filo pastry, either in bite-size triangles or in large sheets: kotopita (chicken pie), spanakotyropita (spinach and cheese pie), chortopita (greens pie), kreatopita (meat pie, using minced meat), kolokythopita (zucchini pie) etc. The Greeks do with filo what the Italians do with pizza; They have countless variations of pitas (savory pies). Even the word pita was originally spelled πίττα (pitta), which shows a similarity to pizza.The areas with the largest tradition of making Greek pitas are the North-Western (Hepirus) and Central Greece (also called Roumeli).Also, {{a big part of the}} Greek Cuisine are seeds and nuts. Seeds and nuts are included in everything from pastry to main dishes.|$|E
40|$|Anthotyros {{is a type}} of low {{fat cheese}} {{produced}} from a mixture of sheep and goat milk. Anthotyros cheese in Crete is produced from the whey of hard cheese such as kefalotyri and graviera. Anthotyros is a cheese which comes from the <b>myzithra</b> <b>cheese</b> (whey) dehydration. The dehydrated anthotyros' physicochemical properties are moisture content of 35 %, fat content in dry matter of 55 % and low concentration of salt. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify which of the three gas compositions applied; MAP(1) : 40 % CO 2, 55 % N- 2, 5 % O- 2, MAP(2) : 60 % CO 2, 40 % N- 2 and MAP(3) : 50 % CO 2, 50 % N- 2 can lead to greater shelf life prolongation of anthotyros. The control samples were packaged in air. All cheese samples were kept under refrigeration (4 +/- 0. 5 degrees C) for 55 days. The statistical analysis of organoleptic characteristics was carried out by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by means of JMP 5. 0. 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|Characteristic of Kroustas is {{the smell}} of Raki {{distillery}} in October, the dry but cool summers, the dry and rocky landscape and the old ladies with the black scarfs and the wrinkled faces. What could you buy from Kroustas? Pure food like honey, almonds, walnuts, <b>myzithra</b> (soft sour <b>cheese)</b> and raki (locally distilled spirit).|$|R
40|$|In {{whey cheese}} manufacture, whey, plain or added with milk, is heated by direct fire, {{bubbling}} steam or alternatively in jacketed vats. In some cases, salt s or organic acids are previously added. At 80 - 85 OC, the first particles of curd form; at 85 - 95 'C, the curd may be cooked {{for a few}} minutes to reduce moisture content and/or to obtain the desirable level of browning. After drainage at room temperature during molding for ca. 4 h, whey cheese is stored at ca. 4 'C. The typical mass yield is 6 %, but addition of milk, calcium salts and preliminary concentration of protein (by condensation or ultrafiltration techniques) may increase yield considerably. Some types of whey cheeses are supposed to be consumed within a short time upon manufacture (e. g., Ricotta, Requeijdo and Manouri), whereas others bear a longer shelf life (e. g., Gjetost, Mysost and <b>Myzithra).</b> Whey <b>cheeses</b> are significantly different from one another in terms of chemical composition, which is mainly due to variations in the source and type of whey, {{as well as to the}} processing practices followed. Moisture content and pH of whey cheeses are usually high and favor microorganism growth (molds, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae account for the dominant microflora in these cheeses). Adequate packaging of whey cheeses should be provided, and legislation should be prepared to fix standard characteristics of each type of whey cheese, and hence protect typical products from adulteration and fakes. Marketing efforts should also be aimed at increasing whey cheese consumption, either directly or incorporated in desserts, snack dips and pasta-type dishes...|$|R
