25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] remarked the Scarecrow, [...] "what unhappy {{thoughts}} you have, to be sure. This {{is proof}} that born brains cannot equal manufactured <b>brains,</b> for <b>my</b> <b>brains</b> dwell only on facts and never borrow trouble. When there is occasion for <b>my</b> <b>brains</b> to think, they think, but I would be ashamed of <b>my</b> <b>brains</b> if they kept shooting out thoughts that were merely fears and imaginings, such as do no good, but are likely to do harm." ...|$|R

25|$|After the break-up, Weasel and Jughead {{formed a}} new band called The Gore Gore Girls, and Ben briefly {{performed}} in the original incarnation of The Vindictives. In 1991, the members of Screeching Weasel reunited for what {{was intended as a}} one-off gig to pay off debts the band incurred from the recording of Boogadaboogadaboogada!. The line-up consisted of Ben, Jughead, Vapid, Vermin, and Ward. After the show, Vapid discussed the idea of reforming Screeching Weasel with Jughead. All of the band's members agreed to reform, with the exceptions of Brian Vermin and Douglas Ward. To replace Vermin, drummer Dan Panic (Dan Sullivan) was brought in. Before recording their third studio album, <b>My</b> <b>Brain</b> Hurts (1991) for Lookout! Records, Weasel decided that he wanted to focus on singing and would no longer be playing guitar in the band. Vapid switched instruments from bass to guitar, and former Gore Gore Girls bassist Dave Naked joined the band. The recording sessions for the album also produced the extended play Pervo Devo.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the video {{in an interview with}} Time Out, saying: [...] "I can't even watch the Telephone video, I hate it so much.

But there are so many ideas in that video and all I see in that video is <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> throbbing with ideas and I wish I had edited myself a little bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1847 Josephine visited her brother in County Laois, Ireland. It was {{at the height of}} the Great Famine and the first time she had come into contact with {{widespread}} suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences and later recalled that [...] "As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself upon <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> and memory." ...|$|E

500|$|Ricketts {{was killed}} in 1948 when a train {{collided}} with his car while he was crossing the rail tracks. Ricketts' death severely hurt Steinbeck: [...] "he was part of <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> for 18 years". Although Steinbeck had moved to New York City shortly after the journey {{and the two men}} had not seen as much of each other in the following years, they had corresponded by mail and had been planning a further expedition, this time northwards to the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{were interviewed}} {{for the media}} and by investigators about their experience.

[...] Another gave this description of being burned by the steel: [...] "When the steel hit, it felt like being beaten by iron bars -- <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> went blank. I would be dead if I had turned my head".|$|E
500|$|In May 1832, Balzac {{suffered}} {{a head injury}} when his tilbury carriage crashed in a Parisian street. Although he was not hurt badly, he wrote to a friend about his worry that [...] "some of the cogs in the mechanism of <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> may have got out of adjustment". His doctor ordered him to rest and refrain from writing and other mental activity. When he had recuperated, he spent the summer at the Château de Saché, just outside the city of Tours, with a family friend, Jean de Margonne.|$|E

500|$|Milk had {{recently}} taken a new lover, {{a young man}} named Jack Lira, who was frequently drunk in public, and just as often escorted out of political events by Milk's aides. Since the race for the California State Assembly, Milk had been receiving increasingly violent death threats. Concerned that his raised profile marked him as a target for assassination, he recorded on tape his thoughts, and whom he wanted to succeed him if he were killed, adding: [...] "If a bullet should enter <b>my</b> <b>brain,</b> let that bullet destroy every closet door".|$|E
500|$|..... {{we turned}} off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm. I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E
500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E

500|$|Firmly contesting Carr's argument, {{journalist}} John Battelle {{praised the}} virtues of the web: [...] "hen I am deep in search for knowledge on the web, jumping from link to link, reading deeply in one moment, skimming hundreds of links the next, when I am pulling back to formulate and reformulate queries and devouring new connections as quickly as Google and the Web can serve them up, when I am performing bricolage in real time over the course of hours, I am 'feeling' <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> light up, I and [...] 'feeling' like I'm getting smarter". Web journalist Scott Rosenberg reported that his reading habits are the same as they were when he [...] "was a teenager plowing [...] way through a shelf of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky". In book critic Scott Esposito's view, [...] "responsible adults" [...] have always had to deal with distractions, and, in his own case, he claimed to remain [...] "fully able to turn down the noise" [...] and read deeply.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{accessories}} shown, {{the wings}} worn {{in the video}} were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team, Haus of Gaga, created the arrows. Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: [...] "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm going to pass out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Rollins {{began his}} film career {{appearing}} in several independent films featuring the band Black Flag. His film debut was in 1982's The Slog Movie, about the West Coast punk scene.

500|$|Nintendo's {{advertising}} campaign for Brain Age 2 featured several celebrities. The company announced on June 25, 2007 that Australian actress Nicole Kidman {{would appear in}} European television and newspaper advertisements to promote the game. Nintendo chose to feature her because of [...] "her universal appeal to mainstream audiences {{of all ages and}} backgrounds, as well as her reputation for being intelligent, entertaining and genuine". Kidman praised Nintendo's desire to reach out to new audiences with self-improvement products, and found that playing the game made her feel young. Nintendo also chose professional swimmer Kieren Perkins to promote Brain Age 2 in his native Australia, who commented, [...] "Having used the original Dr Kawashima's Brain Training game for a while now, I was genuinely looking forward to all of the new ways I could exercise my mind.

[...] In the United States, print advertisements and television commercials for the game featured American actress Liv Tyler.|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off <b>my</b> <b>brain.</b> I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe we should try this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. And then of course, later on, it creeps in <b>my</b> <b>brain,</b> and I'm like, 'maybe I should have done a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.|$|E
