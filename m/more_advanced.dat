5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E

50|$|<b>More</b> <b>advances</b> {{were made}} on Grotefend's work and by 1847, most of the symbols were {{correctly}} identified. Notable uses of Old Persian's decipherment include the decipherment of Elamite and Akkadian through the Behistun Inscription.|$|R

5000|$|The advance-decline {{line is a}} plot of the {{cumulative}} sum of the daily difference {{between the number of}} issues advancing and the number of issues declining in a particular stock market index. Thus it moves up when the index contains <b>more</b> <b>advancing</b> than declining issues, and moves down when there are <b>more</b> declining than <b>advancing</b> issues. The formula for ADL is: ...|$|R
5|$|A clay tablet {{found in}} ancient Iraq that {{promoted}} <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> agricultural techniques is sometimes considered {{the first known}} example of public relations. Babylonian, Egyptian and Persian leaders created pyramids, obelisks and statues to promote their divine right to lead. Additionally, claims of magic or religious authority were used to persuade the public of a king or pharaoh's right to rule.|$|E
5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African American population to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously. The biggest impact {{has been on the}} middle-class blacks, given that most black professionals are older and <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> in their careers, and the majority of the affluent and middle class are white.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires {{requires}} the player {{to develop a}} civilization {{from a handful of}} hunter-gatherers to an expansive Iron Age Empire. To assure victory, the player must gather resources in order to pay for new units, buildings and <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> technology. Resources must also be preserved, as no new resources become available as the game progresses, for example, trees that are cut down will not grow back.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the results}} of the Greek and Islamic {{influence}} on this period in European history was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.|$|E
5|$|As {{computers}} offered <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> user interfaces, such as {{windows and}} point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was useful {{to not only}} show the character-based dungeon, but details on the character's inventory, the monster they were in battle with, and other status messages, in separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands.|$|E
5|$|Based on Béla Bánáthy's {{original}} work, {{the program}} is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> levels of instruction. Each level is tailored {{to the needs of}} youth at specific ages and maturity levels.|$|E
50|$|After the 1971 conflict, the Corps was re-organised and <b>more</b> <b>advance</b> {{courses were}} introduced. Since 1971, the Regiment {{has emerged as}} one of the potent {{combatant}} arms in the Pakistan Army. It participated in notable operations and wars involving Pakistan at numerous occasions and time intervals.|$|R
50|$|The first {{ancestors}} of Nias were Austromelanesoid race from Hoabinth at 10,000 B.C. {{and then came}} <b>more</b> <b>advance</b> Austronesians from Taiwan which shifted {{the existence of the}} Austromelanesoids. The name of the island derives from the word used by the islanders to describe themselves, niha ("human").|$|R
50|$|The Social Media Language Learning (SMLL) {{method was}} {{originally}} {{created by a}} Barcelona, Spain, based company called Idiomplus. It consists in applying interactive social media channels to language learning, which will in turn enable the student to develop communication skills while using these social networks and became <b>more</b> <b>advance</b> in learning language.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> {{cetaceans}} appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies {{to cope with}} these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> than Mercury, capable of {{supporting}} two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
50|$|As {{previously}} stated, one of {{the major}} limitations of optical rectennas is the frequency at which they operate. The high frequency of light in the ideal range of wavelengths makes the use of typical Schottky diodes impractical. Although MIM diodes show promising features for use in optical rectennas, <b>more</b> <b>advances</b> are necessary to operate efficiently at higher frequencies.|$|R
40|$|Python is {{an ideal}} {{language}} for manipulating XML, and this new volume gives you a solid foundation for using these two languages together. Complete with practical examples that highlight common application tasks, the book starts with the basics then quickly progresses to complex topics like transforming XML with XSLT and querying XML with XPath. It also explores <b>more</b> <b>advance...</b>|$|R
40|$|The program {{described}} in this document aims to enable an extensible theorem prover using the resolution method. All the components in the prover, except the core engine, are modular and can be easily re-implemented or extended. For some of the components in {{the first version of}} the prover, simple default implementations were created while for others <b>more</b> <b>advance...</b>|$|R
