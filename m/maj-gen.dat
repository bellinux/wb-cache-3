25|$|Gough, on {{the advice}} of <b>Maj-Gen</b> Wilson, then insisted on adding another {{paragraph}} clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule on Ulster, with which French concurred in writing. Seely had not been consulted about this second assurance.|$|E
25|$|Former Israel Air Force chief <b>Maj.-Gen.</b> (res.) Amir Eshel {{has called}} the F-35 “game changing,” saying that Israel {{gathered}} new intelligence during a single flight by the F-35 early 2017 that other reconnaissance and intelligence gathering systems would take weeks to gather.|$|E
25|$|In November 1940 {{the brigade}} {{came under the}} command of the newly-formed 11 AA Division based at Birmingham.

25|$|The {{proposed}} solution {{will be put}} into binding legislation - Israeli Knesset will work out and accept appropriate legislation {{in the fall of}} 2012. Accordingly, the state will reorganize and strengthen the enforcement mechanism. A team headed by minister Benny Begin and <b>Maj.-Gen.</b> (ret.) Doron Almog is responsible for the implementation of this plan.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1884 Wilson married Charlotte Elise Gough (died 17 August 1942), the {{daughter}} of <b>Maj-Gen</b> Sir Hugh Gough, VC, of the Bengal Army. The Great War commanders General Sir Hubert Gough and Brigadier-General Sir John Gough, were her cousins. In 1887, shortly after he took command of the Lahore Division, Sir Hugh appointed his son-in-law as his aide-de-camp.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli Ambassador to the UN, Ambassador Dan Gillerman, {{met with}} UNIFIL commander, <b>Maj.-Gen.</b> Claudio Graziano, on 15 August 2008, after Israel {{was accused of}} {{unilaterally}} violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 by the almost daily overflights of Lebanese airspace, the continued occupation of the village of Ghajar, and Israel's refusal to submit maps of areas on which it dropped cluster munitions during the 2006 Lebanese war.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Alfred Bate Richards invited <b>Maj-Gen</b> William Ferguson Beatson of the Bengal Army {{to be the}} 3rd London RVC's honorary colonel. Beatson was in London in {{connection}} with a court case and had been supported by Richards and the Radicals in a series of high-profile disagreements with the War Office. Beatson took the salute at a parade in the Guildhall on 22 September 1860, but was under orders to return to India and was unable to accept the role permanently.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on 26 June 1918. First de facto Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. Khosrov bey Sultanov. When the Ministry was {{formally}} established Gen. Samedbey Mehmandarov became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. Ali-Agha Shikhlinski his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. Maciej Sulkiewicz (March 1919 – 10 December 1919) and <b>Maj-Gen.</b> Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 December 1919 – April 1920).|$|E
25|$|French was {{initially}} ordered {{to assemble the}} Cavalry Division at Maitland, near Cape Town. Now a local lieutenant general like Buller's other four division commanders, he was then ordered to take command of forces covering the Colesberg area, filling in the gap between Methuen's division (operating at Orange River Station, {{with a view to}} relieving Kimberley and Mafeking) and Gatacre’s Division at Stormberg. On 18 November he went up to De Aar, nearer the front, to confer with <b>Maj-Gen</b> Wauchope, in charge of the lines of communication.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{is based}} on a {{proposal}} developed by a team headed by Ehud Prawer, the head of policy planning in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). And this proposal, in its turn, {{is based on}} the recommendations of the committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg. <b>Maj.-Gen.</b> (ret.) Doron Almog was appointed {{as the head of the}} staff to implement the plan to provide status for the Bedouin communities in the Negev. Minister Benny Begin has been appointed by the cabinet to coordinate public and Bedouin population comments on the issue.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{believed}} {{his most important}} duty as DMO to be the drawing up of detailed plans for deployment of an expeditionary force to France, {{in accordance with the}} CID’s decision of July 1909. Little progress had been made in this area since Grierson’s plans during the First Moroccan Crisis. <b>Maj-Gen</b> Spencer Ewart (Grierson’s successor as DMO) and William Nicholson (CIGS) had both avoided direct dealings with Victor Huguet, the French Military attache. Of the 36 papers which Wilson wrote as DMO, 21 were taken up by matters pertaining to the Expeditionary Force. He hoped also to get conscription brought in, but this came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|The brigade {{landed at}} Cape Helles on the Gallipoli {{peninsula}} where Palin and his Sikhs {{took part in}} the Second and Third Battles of Krithia. In the Second Battle, the 14th Sikhs were in reserve as the Anzacs attacked. In the Third Battle, the 29th India Brigade under <b>Maj-Gen</b> Herbert Cox attacked along Gully Spur and Gully Ravine; the Sikhs, advancing along the Gully floor, suffered especially heavily. The bombardment had been inadequate and the Turkish defences were intact. 'The result was that, though the 14th Sikhs on the right flank pushed on despite losses amounting to three-fourths of their effectives, the centre of the Brigade could make no headway'.|$|E
25|$|In November 1940, at {{the height}} of The Blitz, a new 12 AA Division was formed to take over {{responsibility}} for western Scotland and Northern Ireland, while 3 AA Division retained responsibility for eastern Scotland. 3 and 42 AA Bdes were transferred from 3 AA Division to the new formation, and 12 AA Divisional Signals was formed by expanding the Glasgow company of 3 AA Divisional Signals. Both 3 and 12 AA Divisions, together with OSDEF and 7 AA Division covering northern England, formed part of a newly created 3 AA Corps, and 3 AA Division's commander, <b>Maj-Gen</b> Hugh Martin, was promoted to command the new higher formation.|$|E
25|$|External {{investigations}} {{suggested that}} the IDF could not have shot the boy and that the tape had been staged. In 2001, following a non-military investigation, conducted by Israeli Southern Command <b>Maj.-Gen.</b> Yom Tov Samia, the Israeli Prime Minister's Foreign Media Advisor, Dr. Ra'anan Gissin, along with Daniel Seaman of the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO) publicly challenged {{the accuracy of the}} France 2 report. In 2005, the head of the Israeli National Security Agency, Major-General (res.) Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF's initial admittance of responsibility. In order to avoid negative publicity and a resulting backlash, the IDF did not conduct its own official, military investigation until 2007. On October 1, 2007, Israel officially denied responsibility for the shooting and claimed that the France 2 footage had been staged, prompting criticism from Al-Durrah's father.|$|E
25|$|Responsible to London District {{but under}} the {{operational}} control of RAF Fighter Command, the Division's role was to command {{the growing number of}} Territorial Army (TA) anti-aircraft gun and searchlight units around London (2 AA Division was in formed in 1936 to cover the rest of the country). The headquarters of the division was formed by converting 47th (2nd London) Infantry Division, whose General Officer Commanding, Major-General R.H.D. Thomson, continued as GOC of the new formation. Thomson had been Commander TA Air Defence Brigades and Inspector of Regular AA Units, and thus already responsible for the four brigades or 'groups' that comprised the division. He also chaired the War Office committee on expansion and mobilisation of TA AA units, which sat from 1935 to 1937. Tompson was followed in 1937 by <b>Maj-Gen</b> Sir Frederick Pile, who was promoted in 1939 to command the whole of Anti-Aircraft Command.|$|E

500|$|On 30 January 1819 Sir Stamford Raffles, an Englishman {{who was the}} Governor of Bencoolen (now Bengkulu, Indonesia), {{entered into}} a {{preliminary}} agreement with the Temenggung of Johor, Abdul Rahman Sri Maharajah, for the British East India Company to establish a [...] "factory" [...] or trading post {{on the island of}} Singapore. This was confirmed by another agreement signed by Raffles, the Temenggung and Sultan Hussein Shah on 6 February. In June 1823 Singapore ceased to be a dependency of Bencoolen and was placed {{under the control of the}} Presidency City of Calcutta (Kolkata) in the Bengal Presidency. On 24 June 1824, Singapore and Malacca were formally transferred to the East India Company, with the result that they came under the control of Fort William. Full cession of Singapore to the Company by the Sultan and Temenggung was effected by a treaty of 19 November 1824, which was ratified by Calcutta on 4 March 1825. Between 1819 and 1826, Singapore was headed by two Residents of Singapore in succession, <b>Maj.-Gen.</b> William Farquhar and Dr. John Crawfurd.|$|E
