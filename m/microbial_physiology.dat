40|$|Optimisation of {{nutrient}} removal processes requires a detailed {{understanding of the}} <b>microbial</b> <b>physiologies</b> actually occurring within the biomass of different treatment zones, and also knowledge of how these communities respond to environmental factors. This paper describes a suite of four independent and complementary, microbiological techniques, utilised to obtain detailed assessments of wastewater bacterial biomass. Examples of these techniques are shown as applied to biofilms from two surface-flow wetlands used for treating sewage effluent. Intact biofilms were prepared via freezing, followed by cryosectioning and direct microscopic observation. This approach was combined with prior, in situ incubation of biofilm with radiolabelled thymidine to assess in situ, bacterial growth rates. Individual bacterial cells were assessed microscopically for in situ respiratory activity and phylogenetic identity, respectively through use of an inducibly-fluorescent redox stain (CTC), and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These complementary techniques enabled assessment of individual biofilm clusters according to their in situ status (growth, respiration, spatial location and phylogenetic affiliation). This approach detected significant spatial variations in biofilm; limited the bias inherent in data obtained using any one technique, and provided greater detail of subpopulations within the microbial community...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} new, or improved, biotechnologies, such as wastewater treatment digesters, inevitably start with laboratory-scale trials. However, it is rarely determined whether laboratory-scale results reflect full-scale performance or microbial ecology. The Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB) bioreactor, which is a high-rate anaerobic digester configuration, {{was used as a}} model to address that knowledge gap in this study. Two laboratory-scale idealizations of the EGSB-a one-dimensional and a three- dimensional scale-down of a full-scale design-were built and operated in triplicate under near-identical conditions to a full-scale EGSB. The laboratory-scale bioreactors were seeded using biomass obtained from the full-scale bioreactor, and, spent water from the distillation of whisky from maize was applied as substrate at both scales. Over 70 days, bioreactor performance, microbial ecology, and <b>microbial</b> community <b>physiology</b> were monitored at various depths in the sludge-beds using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (V 4 region), specific methanogenic activity (SMA) assays, and a range of physical and chemical monitoring methods. SMA assays indicated dominance of the hydrogenotrophic pathway at full-scale whilst a more balanced activity profile developed during the laboratory-scale trials. At each scale, Methanobacterium was the dominant methanogenic genus present. Bioreactor performance overall was better at laboratory-scale than full-scale. We observed that bioreactor design at laboratory-scale significantly influenced spatial distribution of <b>microbial</b> community <b>physiology</b> and taxonomy in the bioreactor sludge-bed, with 1 -D bioreactor types promoting stratification of each. In the 1 -D laboratory bioreactors, increased abundance of Firmicutes was associated with both granule position in the sludge bed and increased activity against acetate and ethanol as substrates. We further observed that stratification in the sludge-bed in 1 -D laboratory-scale bioreactors was associated with increased richness in the underlying microbial community at species (OTU) level and improved overall performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{subsurface}} igneous biome {{contains a}} vast portion of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s total biomass, yet we still know {{so little about}} it. Igneous environments such as iron-rich ocean crust and lava tubes may also host analogs to chemolithotrophically-driven life on other planets, so studying life in this biome is essential to understanding how life may survive on other planets. In this study, three igneous surface and subsurface environments were investigated for microbial preference for olivine, <b>microbial</b> <b>physiologies</b> and phylotypes present on olivine, and microbial growth on olivine in the laboratory via iron oxidation. These environments include a subseafloor borehole drilled into the ocean crust basalt basement, a lava tube with perennial ice, and a trio of Columbia River basalt-hosted freshwater terrestrial habitats. The subseafloor borehole (IODP Hole 1301 A) is situated on the eastern flank of Juan de Fuca Ridge (JFR) and {{was used in the}} first long-term deployment of microbial enrichment flow cells using osmotically-driven pumps. The flow cells contained igneous minerals and glasses, for which cell density and microbial abundances were evaluated. Total cell density and viable oligotrophs were highest for Fe(II) -rich olivines. Organotrophic bacterial isolates were capapble of iron oxidation and nitrate reduction, and grew on olivine in the laboratory. Putative neutrophilic iron oxidizers were also isolated from igneous riparian and cave environments in northwest and central Oregon. Isolated bacteria from all three environments were capable of chemolithotrophic growth with olivine and oxygen or nitrate in the laboratory. Bacteria isolated from river basalt were putatively capable of producing alteration textures on olivine surfaces in culture. Microbial life in the igneous subsurface preferentially attach to Fe²⁺-rich minerals, which suggests that life in the subsurface is heterogeneously distributed. The isolation of oligotrophic iron oxidizers that grow on olivine suggests that olivine supports a chemolithotrophic subsurface community based on primary productivity via iron oxidation. This generation of biomass on olivine surfaces creates organic carbon-rich coated mineral surfaces that may support a more complex community. The identification of Mars analogs living in Oregon lava tubes and the discovery that iron oxidizers may produce biosignatures on olivine surfaces are key findings that may provide the foundation for a new chapter in the search for life on Mars...|$|R

50|$|High-throughput {{phenotypic}} {{testing is}} increasingly important {{for exploring the}} biology of bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and animal cell lines such as human cancer cells. Just as DNA microarrays and proteomic technologies {{have made it possible}} to assay the level of thousands of genes or proteins all a once, phenotype microarrays (PMs) make it possible to quantitatively measure thousands of cellular phenotypes all at once. The approach also offers potential for testing gene function and improving genome annotation. In contrast to the hitherto available molecular high-throughput technologies, phenotypic testing is processed with living cells, thus providing comprehensive information about the performance of entire cells. The major applications of the PM technology are in the fields of systems biology, <b>microbial</b> cell <b>physiology</b> and taxonomy, and mammalian cell physiology including clinical research such as on autism. Advantages of PMs over standard growth curves are that cellular respiration can be measured in environmental conditions where cellular replication (growth) may not be possible, and that respiration reactions are usually detected much earlier than cellular growth.|$|R

White syndromes (WSs) are a prevalent group of coral diseases in the Indo-Pacific region that have been the focus of an increasing number of investigations over the past decade. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on WSs, advocate the use of established standardized criteria to describe disease lesions at gross and cellular levels to move the field forward, and highlight potential erroneous characterization of underlying causes that hinders ongoing progress in coral disease research. We argue for retention of the general term WSs for Indo-Pacific cases of tissue loss lacking distinguishing macroscopic signs and with unknown aetiologies, but erection of more specific names once standardized criteria are met. Recent advances in WS disease pathology, <b>microbial</b> ecology, <b>physiology,</b> ecology and environmental drivers are discussed and the need for greater application of interdisciplinary approaches is emphasized.
