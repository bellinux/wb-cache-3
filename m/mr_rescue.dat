40|$|Objective: To compare how at-risk {{tissue and}} core {{infarction}} were defined in two major trials that tested {{the use of}} MRI in selecting acute stroke patients for endovascular recanalization therapy. Methods: MRIs from 12 patients evaluated for possible endovascular therapy were processed using the methods published from two major trials, <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE</b> and DEFUSE 2. Specifically, volumes of at-risk tissue and core infarction were generated from each patient’s MRI. MRIs were then classified {{as to whether or}} not they met criteria for salvageable tissue: penumbral pattern for <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE</b> and/or target profile for DEFUSE 2) as defined by each trial. Results: Volumes of at-risk tissue by the two definitions were correlated (p= 0. 017) while the volumes of core infarct were not (p= 0. 059). The volume of at-risk tissue was consistently larger when defined by the penumbral pattern than the target profile while the volume of core infarct was consistently larger when defined by the target profile than the penumbral pattern. When these volumes were used to classify the MRI scans, nine out of 12 patients (75 %) were classified as having a penumbral pattern, while only 4 out of 12 patients (33 %) were classified as having a target profile. Of the 9 patients classified as penumbral pattern, 5 (55 %) were classified differently by the target profile. Interpretation: Our analysis found that the <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE</b> trial defined salvageable tissue in a way which made it more likely for patients be labeled as favorable for treatment. For the cohort of patients examined in this study, had they been enrolled in both trials, most of the patients identified as having salvageable tissue by the <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE</b> trial would not have been considered to have salvageable tissue in the DEFUSE 2 trial. Caution should be taken in concluding that MRI selection for endovascular therapy is not effective as imaging selection criteria were substantially different between trials...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{results of}} Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III, Magnetic Resonance and REcanalization of Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy (<b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE),</b> and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trials are {{expected}} to affect the practice of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The purpose of this report is to review {{the components of the}} designs and methods of these trials and to describe the influence of those components on the interpretation of trial results. METHODS A critical review of trial design and conduct of IMS III, <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE,</b> and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION is performed with emphasis on patient selection, shortcomings in procedural aspects, and methodology of data ascertainment and analysis. The influence of each component is estimated based on published literature including multicenter clinical trials reporting on endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. RESULTS We critically examined the time interval between symptom onset and treatment and rates of angiographic recanalization to differentiate between "endovascular treatment" and "parameter optimized endovascular treatment" {{as it relates to the}} IMS III, <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE,</b> and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trials. All the three trials failed to effectively test "parameter optimized endovascular treatment" due to the delay between symptom onset and treatment and less than optimal rates of recanalization. In all the three trials, the magnitude of benefit with endovascular treatment required to reject the null hypothesis was larger than could be expected based on previous studies. The IMS III and SYNTHESIS EXPANSION trials demonstrated that rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages subsequent to treatment are similar between IV thrombolytics and endovascular treatment in matched acute ischemic stroke patients. The trials also indirectly validated the superiority/equivalence of IV thrombolytics (compared with endovascular treatment) in patients with minor neurological deficits and those without large vessel occlusion on computed tomographic/magnetic resonance angiography. CONCLUSIONS The results do not support a large magnitude benefit of endovascular treatment in subjects randomized in all the three trials. The possibility that benefits of a smaller magnitude exist in certain patient populations cannot be excluded. Large magnitude benefits can be expected with implementation of "parameter optimized endovascular treatment" in patients with ischemic stroke who are candidates for IV thrombolytics...|$|E

40|$|In 3 recent {{randomized}} controlled trials of intra-arterial treatment of acute ischemic stroke - IMS-III, SYNTHESIS and <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE</b> - intra-arterial treatment increased {{the proportion of}} patients with recanalization and the treatment appeared safe.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Use of {{intravenous}} thrombolytic therapy in ischaemic stroke {{is restricted to}} a 3 -h time window because of the proof of this time window in pivotal clinical trials. Thrombolysis is aimed at recanalization of occluded arteries and reperfusion of the ischaemic penumbra, a region of critically hypoperfused, functionally impaired, but potentially viable brain. There {{are a number of}} current prospective trials that are testing the hypothesis that the presence of the penumbra will predict thrombolytic responders beyond 3 h. Recent findings Using magnetic resonance imaging, a mismatch between a larger perfusion-weighted imaging lesion and smaller diffusion-weighted imaging lesion is considered to represent the ischaemic penumbra. Perfusion-weighted imaging provides semiquantitative cerebral blood flow imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging is an index of the largely irreversible ischaemic core. This definition has been modified with the recognition that the perfusion-weighted imaging lesion includes benign oligaemia and that a portion of the diffusion-weighted imaging core is potentially salvageable with rapid reperfusion. Most acute stroke patients have a magnetic resonance imaging-penumbral signature within 6 h of stroke onset. The penumbra is commonly, but not invariably, associated with proximal arterial occlusion and is time-dependent. Preliminary studies have shown benefit from thrombolytic therapy beyond the established 3 -h window. Summary Penumbral imaging using magnetic resonance imaging with perfusion over diffusion weighted imaging mismatch can provide a physiological 'tissue clock' in individual patients. Based on this hypothesis, a number of prospective trials are being performed. These include EPITHET, DEFUSE, DIAS, <b>MR</b> <b>RESCUE</b> and ROSIE...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of acute ischemic stroke {{has undergone a}} sea of change {{with the introduction of}} intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Current guidelines state that the window period for IVT using rTPA is 4. 5 hours. The MERCI, Multi Merci, and Penumbra trials in which patients with acute ischemic stroke were treated using endovascular treatment demonstrated better recanalisation in patients having a large vessel occlusion. However, recently published data from the three large trials IMS 3, Synthesis Expansion, and <b>MR</b> <b>rescue,</b> which compared endovascular treatment with intravenous therapy, failed to demonstrate superiority of endovascular treatment over IVT. In these trials, stent retrievers were used in very few patients. We present our results from a tertiary care center in India where patients are treated using intravenous as well as endovascular modalities. Among the 53 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated between 2010 and 2012, 23 were treated with IVT and 30 with endovascular methods. Stent retriever was used in majority of the endovascular cases. Aims: To compare the outcomes of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with IVT versus those who were managed using endovascular therapy. To evaluate outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke with a large vessel occlusion in whom endovascular modalities were used and to compare them with those of patients who were treated with IVT in presence of a large vessel occlusion. Settings and Design: Data of patients who underwent thrombolysis at our centre was collected over a 3 -year period, that is, from 2010 to 2012. Endovascular treatment was done by an interventional neurologist. Materials and Methods: Data of patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent IVT or endovascular treatment at our centre between 2010 and 2012 was analyzed. Parameters included age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, door to needle time, stroke subtype, modality of treatment, outcome based on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score at 90 days follow up and mortality rates at 90 days. Statistical Analysis: Tabulated results were analysed using INSTAT Graphpad analyser. Data were analysed using paired and unpaired t-test, Chi-square test, and Fishers test as applicable. P value was considered significant when it was < 0. 05. Results: Upon comparison of the outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel disease treated with endovascular therapy with those treated with IVT, {{it was found that the}} former group had better outcomes. We also found that in spite of there being a significant difference in the NIHSS on admission and a significant difference in the door to needle time, the outcomes of patients treated using intravenous or endovascular therapy were similar. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality rates between intravenous and endovascular groups. Conclusions: IVT is currently the standard of care in the {{management of}} acute ischemic stroke. Endovascular treatment during the window period is reserved for those patients with contraindication to IVT. In this study, we found that patients with documented large vessel disease with no evidence of cross flow through Willisian collaterals benefit from endovascular treatment. We recommend that all patients of acute ischemic stroke, be subjected to a baseline angiogram either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to document vessel status. This will help in identifying patients who may benefit from early endovascular treatment, if they fail to improve with IVT. Further, large trials using stent retrievers are needed, to prove that endovascular treatment is superior to IVT, in presence of documented large vessel disease...|$|E
