40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 71 - 76). ix, 96 leaves, bound 29 cmAs {{interest in}} research on second language pragmatics increases, some pragmatics {{research has been done}} on Korean as a foreign language (KFL) learners. This research has focused on pedagogical aspects of Korean pragmatics and interlanguage pragmatics. However, very little research has been done on the pragmatics assessment of KFL learners, in terms of discussing appropriate <b>test</b> <b>types</b> and whether, certain speech acts and <b>test</b> <b>types</b> affect raters' assessment of KFL learners' pragmatics performance. The focus of this study is on investigating (a) whether factors such as <b>test</b> <b>types</b> and speech acts affect raters' assessments of the pragmatics of KFL learners and (b) which <b>test</b> <b>types</b> are most appropriate for assessing pragmatics of KFL learners. For these purposes, this study analyzes three interactions from the test results using the computer program FACETS (Linacre, 1996) : the interactions between rater bias and <b>test</b> <b>types,</b> rater bias and speech acts, and examinees and <b>test</b> <b>types.</b> This study uses three different pragmatics tests adapted from Hudson, Detmer, and Brown's (1995) pragmatics prototype tests: Open-written' Discourse Completion Task, Language Lab, and Role-play. Within each of these three <b>test</b> <b>types</b> are three speech acts: refusal, apology, and request. The results of this research indicate that all three raters showed different degrees of severity in their ratings', {{depending on the type of}} speech act. Additionally, each examinee showed different degrees of proficiency depending on the <b>test</b> <b>type.</b> I will discuss which <b>test</b> <b>types</b> are most appropriate for assessing KFL learners' pragmatics performance, how certain speech acts and <b>test</b> <b>types</b> affect raters' assessments, and how what these research findings mean for KFL classrooms...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{hypothesis}} that the performance (standards) <b>test</b> <b>type</b> would be a better match for girls than the norm referenced (measurement) <b>test</b> <b>type</b> is examined. With assessment becoming more high stakes and with an increased use of the performance <b>test</b> <b>type,</b> this research appears timely. In addition to cultural sex differences, the research literature supports the existence of sex differences in brain physiology, laterality, cognitive networking and specific skill strengths. Literature also supports distinctions between <b>test</b> <b>types</b> that call for different skills in respondents. Thus, this study is designed to examine sex and sex by <b>test</b> <b>type</b> differences on exemplars of norm referenced and performance based tests. Results on the Metropolitan Achievement Test (norm referenced) and the New Standards Reference Exam (performance) are used. To minimize confounding variables, an eighth grade homogeneous suburban population is chosen. Test results are analyzed using ANCOVA for between test differences and t-tests for within test differences. Scores on the Otis Lennon School Ability Test are used as covariates for four separate ANCOVA. For each analysis, independent variables are sex (boy, girl) and <b>test</b> <b>type</b> (MAT, NSRE). The dependent variables are mean scores on the total test and the subject areas of mathematics, language arts/writing and reading. The data set of 230 is comprised of 118 boys and 112 girls. Findings support significant sex and sex by <b>test</b> <b>type</b> interactions within a 95 % confidence interval. Girls outscore boys on both tests. In same sex comparisons, girls score higher on the NSRE and boys score higher on the MAT. The sex gap widens considerably on the NSRE. Sex differences within and between tests differ somewhat. On the MAT, girls score significantly better in all areas except mathematics. On the NSRE, girls significantly outscore boys in all areas. Results indicate the existence of sex differences within and between these <b>test</b> <b>types.</b> The hypothesis that the performance <b>test</b> <b>type</b> is a better match for girls is supported. However, since the sex gap widens with the performance <b>test</b> <b>type,</b> further research regarding sex and other group differences is recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of (a) skill <b>test</b> <b>type,</b> (b) choices, and (c) gender on the {{situational}} motivation profiles of adolescents during skill testing in physical education. Participants were 507 students (53 % male) aged 12 – 16 years (M = 13. 87; SD = 0. 94) attending a suburban junior high school in a western state in the U. S. All participants experienced either a norm-referenced, summative or a criterion-referenced, formative skill test with or without choices. The Situational Intrinsic Motivation Scale (SIMS) was administered to assess situational motivation. A 2 (<b>test</b> <b>type)</b> × 2 (choice) × 2 (gender) MANOVA was used to test for significant differences on each of the four SIMS indices. Significant <b>test</b> <b>type</b> and gender and a significant <b>test</b> <b>type</b> by gender interaction were found. These findings suggest practitioners should use criterion-referenced, formative skill tests especially when teaching girls in physical education...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to conduct an {{analysis}} on the effective use of <b>test</b> <b>types</b> for software development. The quality of the product is very important to satisfy clients and stay in business. Therefore software testing has become an important phase in the software development life cycle. As a result of the literature survey, the researcher has developed conceptual model and three hypotheses were derived based on the conceptual model. First three research objectives were accomplished by testing hypotheses using Pearson correlation and Regression analysis. Recommendation were given based on interview feedback, hypotheses output and descriptive statistical analysis. This study is conducted using a deductive approach. Data was collected from Quality Assurance professionals in Sri Lanka who are involved in Quality Assurance planning activities. The researcher has sent online questionnaire to collect raw data and also conducted interviews with quality assurance managers to identify their recommendations to use <b>test</b> <b>types</b> effectively. According to the hypotheses testing results it can be proved that there is an impact from testing constraints such as time, skills and poor requirements to <b>test</b> <b>type</b> selection and execution. It is also important to consider the application architecture type before selecting and executing <b>test</b> <b>types.</b> There is an impact from testing constraints to quality characteristics defined in ISO 9126 Model. In conclusion, when considering the result of this research, there is an impact from time constraints, skill constraint and poor requirements to the selection and execution of <b>test</b> <b>types</b> and limitation in testing of ISO 9126 quality characteristics. Most of the companies consider Web, Service, Mobile and Internet applications when select <b>test</b> <b>types.</b> So it is recommended to overcome time constraint with proper time management and skill constraints taking actions to improve skills...|$|R

A {{correction}} factor of 65 %, namely the proportion of pregnant women reactive in one syphilis <b>test</b> <b>type</b> that were likely reactive in the second, was applied to reported syphilis seropositivity data reported to WHO for global estimates of syphilis during pregnancy. ObjectivesTo identify more accurate correction factors based on <b>test</b> <b>type</b> reported. Search StrategyMedline search using: “Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh],” “Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh],” and “Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]. Selection CriteriaEligible studies must have reported results for pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology. Data collection and analysisWe manually calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal tests. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models. Main resultsCountries reporting both reactive non-treponemal and reactive treponemal testing required no correction factor. Countries reporting non-treponemal testing or treponemal testing alone required a correction factor of 52. 2 % and 53. 6 %, respectively. Countries not reporting <b>test</b> <b>type</b> required a correction factor of 68. 6 %.

40|$|Clinical {{trials are}} usually long term studies {{and it seems}} {{impossible}} to reach all required subjects at the same time. Performing interim analyses and monitoring results may provide early termination of trial after obtaining significant results. The {{aim of this study}} is comparing group sequential tests in respect to advantage of sample size reduction and early termination. In this study, 4 <b>test</b> <b>types</b> used in group sequential designs were compared with fixed sample size design test and each other. Comparisons were done according to two-sided tests for comparing two treatments. In this sense, 1080 models were performed. In models, 2 different Type I errors, 2 different powers, 5 different analysis groups, 6 different effect sizes and 9 different variances selections were considered. All <b>test</b> <b>types</b> increased the maximum sample size in different manner, compared with fixed sample size design. Each test had different critical values to reject H 0 hypothesis, at the same type I error rate and number of analyses conditions. Selection of <b>test</b> <b>type</b> used in group sequential designs depends on a few characteristics, as reducing sample size, early termination and detecting minimal effect size. Test performance is highly related with selected Type I error rate, power and number of analyses. In addition to these statistical characteristics, researchers should decide <b>test</b> <b>type</b> with respect to other trial conditions as the issue of trial, reaching subjects easy or not and importance of early termination...|$|R

The utility and increased sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have been reported; however, their use in US hospital laboratories is not well characterized. ObjectiveTo describe changes in RSV <b>test</b> <b>types</b> used by US hospital-affiliated laboratories, focusing on PCR testing prevalence. Study designData were collected from 480 to 666 laboratories each RSV season (2007 – 2008 through 2010 – 2011) across 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. A descriptive analysis was conducted using this convenience sample of RSV tests conducted from November to April each season. Total numbers and <b>types</b> of RSV <b>tests</b> performed were reported weekly and weekly proportions by <b>test</b> <b>type</b> were calculated. Kendall τ rank correlation was used to quantify associations between time and proportions of each <b>test</b> <b>type.</b> ResultsPCR <b>tests</b> accounted for 2 %, 3 %, 16 %, and 21 % of weekly tests (total range, 381, 068 – 481, 654 over 4 seasons) conducted each season from 2007 to 2011, respectively. The proportion of laboratories reporting ≥ 1 PCR tests was 4 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 16 %, respectively. Decreases in antigen testing and viral culture were similarly observed. ConclusionsAlthough antigen detection was the predominant <b>test</b> <b>type</b> reported in the sample of US hospital laboratories for RSV testing, PCR use increased to > 20 % of tests reported. These results demonstrate the increasing contribution of PCR to RSV surveillance. RSV surveillance systems relying solely on antigen detection results will not capture an increasing proportion of RSV test results...|$|R
