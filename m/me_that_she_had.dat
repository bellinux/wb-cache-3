On July 6, Clark recorded [...] "The Indian woman informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover {{a gap in the}} mountains in our direction..." [...] which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea advised Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. Later, this was chosen as the optimal route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Father <b>has</b> told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> lately got to {{know some}} nobleman; but I never {{supposed}} there could be any meaning in that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After this I don't {{know how}} I'm to trust her. I don't indeed. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been so artful throughout. It {{has been a}} regular case of catching." ...|$|R
60|$|She, too, {{perceived}} it, for the grating {{of a chair}} informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> risen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{only you}} told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone some days ago. Well, I am sound again and {{prepared}} to march, but say, how is my foster-son?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where is}} Freda?" [...] Edmund, {{who had been}} {{listening}} impatiently, exclaimed. [...] "One of your men told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been carried off. Is it true?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indifferently well," [...] Francis replied. [...] "I {{knew her}} when she was a child, and we seem to come {{together}} every now and then at long intervals. As a debutante she was charming. Lately it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> got into the wrong set." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Queen, in her gracious answer, informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{meant to}} <b>have</b> {{mentioned}} Mr. Poole to <b>me,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wished to place {{him in the}} Charter House, but found the society there was not such as he could associate with.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have brought}} back some {{knowledge}} from your travels, I find!" [...] said Jack Dunning, with comic gravity. [...] "Your mother writes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been sued for twenty-seven {{pairs of shoes}} furnished her by a shoemaker whom she never saw, or heard of, until she received the summons!" ...|$|R
60|$|But moments only, for {{the next}} thing he said {{put her in a}} {{particularly}} odious light. He informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sworn to hunt Mr. Anon down.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a {{stranger}} to Mrs. Delamayn," [...] the lady answered. [...] "The servant informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone out; and that I should find Mr. Delamayn here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never in public; but Madame Blumenthal tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{it played}} {{at her own}} house in Berlin, and that she herself {{undertook}} {{the part of the}} heroine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Six hundred tons, sir. She is {{a nearly}} new vessel, and sails fast for a ship of that kind. Her first mate told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a very {{valuable}} cargo on board, principally, I think, tobacco, sugar, coffee, wax, copper, mahogany, and cedar from Cuba. Her passengers are all Spanish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seven and a half, sir. Perry tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{been doing}} just that ever since the wind sprang up. I reckon that we are pretty well abreast of Finisterre now. We shall have the sun up in a few minutes, and I expect that it will come up behind the land.|$|R
40|$|QUESTION A {{patient who}} {{just found out}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is {{pregnant}} and suffers from migraine headaches informs <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been taking naratriptan. <b>She</b> indicates <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is planning on breastfeeding her baby and might need to continue treatment. How safe are the medications from this class of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew what}} I was about," [...] said Owen. [...] "It didn't strike <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the least right {{to come down}} on us that way and ask for explanations." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she would}} pat {{me on the}} arm and smooth my dress, as much as to assure <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a good opinion of me, the {{distance}} between us notwithstanding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, {{except when}} I thought {{it right to}} silence you. It was only too {{delightful}} to hear their very names. You might well tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> grown prettier than ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{went on in}} a {{way which}} {{confirmed}} these reflections, speaking with due solemnity. [...] "You ought to be made to know very well what we all feel. Mrs. Hudson tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> told you what she feels. Of course Roderick has expressed himself. I have been wanting to thank you too; I do, from my heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Plimmer {{came down}} to the wharf every time the ship was up, arter that. Sometimes she'd spend the evening aboard, and {{sometimes}} they'd go off and spend it somewhere else. <b>She</b> <b>'ad</b> a fancy for the cabin, I think, and the cap'n told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>'ad</b> said when they were married she was going to sail with 'im sometimes.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you want}} to marry her, don't you? {{but it seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no mind <b>that</b> way. Then it is for the man for whom <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a mind for? Well, Ibubesi, you have promised the six cows, and you saved me once from being killed for witchcraft, so I will say something. Don't give it to the chief Dario." ...|$|R
60|$|When Sophy had {{finished}} her tale, she told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left her boy in London, {{and had come}} down to devote herself to the task she had so long had before her.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she laid}} her arms about his neck and--though it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> as soon strangled as embraced him--her voice was wondrous sweet and caressing as she murmured in his ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "How did {{you happen}} to fall?" [...] I asked--not that I needed to inquire, for my own {{knowledge}} of wheelcraft assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> tumbled simply because she {{did not know how to}} ride.|$|E
6000|$|... "God knows I didn't want it, {{speaking}} personally," [...] said a German prisoner one day, with a laugh. [...] "I {{had been}} working at a printing business sixteen {{hours a day for}} seven years. It was just beginning to pay me, and now my wife writes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had to shut the place up and sell the machinery to keep them all from starving." ...|$|R
60|$|I quite {{believed}} Leeby when <b>she</b> told <b>me</b> afterwards <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> watched Jamie feeling {{beneath the}} mattress.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{more serious}} than that, Francine. The {{servants}} tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> hardly any appetite. <b>She</b> herself acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sleeps badly. I noticed her yesterday evening in the garden, under the schoolroom window. One of the girls dropped a dictionary. <b>She</b> started at <b>that</b> slight noise, as if it terrified her. Her nerves are seriously out of order. Can you prevail upon her to see the doctor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very quietly. Your Aunt Letty told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{spent most}} of her time in prayer since she heard it. But Miss Letty seems to think that on your account she is very full of joy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{she did not}} say that. She told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{declined}} the honour that you had offered her;--that she did not regard you as she must regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I found Anne in a {{state of}} the wildest grief. She told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen Philip shot by the vicomte, just as he was attacking him, and that you in turn had cut down the villain.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{young lady}} tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> seen you before, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> understands you are both persons of {{education}} and good manners, who have been driven from your native country by political troubles. Such being the case, I cannot regard you as common pedlars. I have known {{what it was to}} be reduced in fortune,"--my dear grandmother's voice trembled a little--"and can feel for those who thus suffer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{should it}} have been?' the girl asked. 'Warbles told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could <b>have</b> no {{difficulty}} in proving {{where she was}} at the time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been taken away from this?" [...] The Countess was silent, but moved away from the spot on which she stood to receive him towards the old desk, which stood open,--with the door of the centre space just ajar. [...] "If it be so, you have deceived me most grossly, Lady Lovel. But it can avail you nothing, for I know <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will be true to me. Do you tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been removed?" ...|$|R
