40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes {{the use of}} a variable-gain {{amplifier}} {{instead of}} a hard limiter for amplitude <b>modulation</b> (AM) <b>suppression</b> with low AM-PM (phase modulation) conversion. A hard limiter shows phase shift variations through inputamplitude dependent changes in output waveform, combined with bandwidth limitations. It is shown that these can be kept small only for limiter bandwidths much larger than the input frequency. A linear amplifier with variable gain used for AM suppression does not suffer from this problem. A CMOS variablegain amplifier with gain-insensitive phase shift has been designed for this purpose. The benefits and limitations of the technique are explored with reference to an experimental 2. 5 m BICMOS chip for a television IF demodulator. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the AM-PM conversion can be kept below 0 : 5 at 40 MHz over an input amplitude range of 20 dB, where typical hard limiters show 3 – 5 : This is achieved with an amplifier bandwidth of 80 MHz, while a hard limiter would need a bandwidth of more than 600 MHz to obtain similar results.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the effects of highfrequency electrical stimulation on electrographic seizure activity during and after stimulation (ONeffect and OFF-effect). Methods: The <b>modulation</b> and <b>suppression</b> of epileptiform activity during (ON-effect) and after (OFF-effect) high-frequency electrical stimulation was investigated using the high-K + and picrotoxin hippocampal slice epilepsy models. Uniform sinusoidal fields (50 Hz) were applied with various intensity levels for 1 min across brain slices. Extracellular and intracellular activity were monitored during and after stimulation. Results: The ON-effects of high-frequency stimulation were highly variable across individual slices and models; ON-effects included modulation of activity, pacing, partial suppression, or activity resembling spreading-depression. On average, epileptic activity, measured as power in the extracellular fields, increased significantly during stimulation. Following the termination of electrical stimulation, a robust poststimulation suppression period was observed. This OFF suppression was observed even at relatively moderate stimulation intensities. The duration of OFF suppression increased with stimulation intensity, independent of ON-effects. Antagonism of GABAA function did not directly effect OFF suppression duration. Conclusions: The present results suggest that “rational” seizure control protocols using intermittent high-frequency electrical stimulation should control for both ON and OFF effects...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Electronic {{factors in}} {{molecules}} such as quantum interference and cross-conjugation {{can lead to}} dramatic <b>modulation</b> and <b>suppression</b> of conductance in single-molecule junctions. Probing such effects at the single-molecule level requires simultaneous measurements of independent junction properties, as conductance alone cannot provide conclusive evidence of junction formation for molecules with low conductivity. Here, we compare {{the mechanics of the}} conducting para-terminated 4, 4 ′-di-(methylthio) stilbene and moderately conducting 1, 2 -bis(4 -(methylthio) phenyl) ethane to that of insulating meta-terminated 3, 3 ′-di(methylthio) stilbene single-molecule junctions. We simultaneously measure force and conductance across single-molecule junctions and use force signatures to obtain independent evidence of junction formation and rupture in the meta-linked cross-conjugated molecule even when no clear low-bias conductance is measured. By separately quantifying conductance and mechanics, we identify the formation of atypical 3, 3 ′-di(methylthio) stilbene molecular junctions that are mechanically stable but electronically decoupled. While theoretical studies have envisaged many plausible systems where quantum interference might be observed, our experiments provide the first direct quantitative study of the interplay between contact mechanics and the distinctively quantum mechanical nature of electronic transport in single-molecule junctions...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) elicited by simultaneous electrical stimulation of adjacent digits is generally {{less than the}} sum of potentials evoked by stimulation of each digit individually. This under-additivity suggests suppression between representations of adjacent skin regions and may reflect a process of lateral inhibition by interneurons in somatosensory cortex. Given that simply viewing the body enhances tactile acuity and that tactile acuity depends on cortical lateral inhibition, we investigated how viewing the body modulates suppressive interactions between simultaneous afferent volleys from adjacent fingers. We recorded SEPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the right index and middle fingers, either individually or simultaneously, while participants viewed either their own hand or an object. In between trains of electrical stimuli, participants discriminated the orientation of tactile gratings applied to either finger. Consistent with previous findings, viewing the hand enhanced tactile acuity. Furthermore, viewing the hand increased the suppression of the P 50 potential due to simultaneous electrical stimulation of both fingers. Moreover, the visual enhancement of tactile performance correlated across participants with the visual <b>modulation</b> of <b>suppression.</b> These results demonstrate that vision enhances somatosensation by modulating activity of inhibitory interneuronal circuits in the somatosensory cortex...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} investigate nonlinear optimization of periodic phase <b>modulation</b> for <b>suppression</b> of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in single-mode optical fibers. We use nonlinear multi-parameter Pareto optimization to find modulations {{that represent}} the best trade-off between SBS and optical linewidth, as measured by its RMS value. The optimization uses a temporal-amplitude-domain finite-difference Brillouin solver with noise initiation {{to find the best}} phase modulation patterns in the presence of coherent so-called cross-interactions. These can be important in short fibers, when the period is large enough to make the frequency-domain separation of the modulated signal comparable to, or smaller than, the Brillouin gain linewidth. We calculate the SBS threshold for the optimized modulation patterns and find that smaller spectral line-spacing improves the SBS threshold for the same linewidth. By contrast, whereas the maximum modulation depth and modulation frequency influences the range of accessible linewidths, they do not significantly alter the threshold for a given linewidth. We investigate the dependence on fiber length and find that while shorter fibers have a higher threshold, the increase is smaller than the often-assumed inverse dependence on length. Furthermore, we find that optimized formats are superior in terms of SBS threshold as well as in terms of linewidth control, compared to random modulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{content of}} visual working memory (VWM) affects the {{processing}} of concurrent visual input. Recently, it has been demonstrated that stimuli are released from interocular suppression faster when they match rather than mismatch a color that is memorized for subsequent recall. In order to investigate {{the nature of the}} interaction between visual representations elicited by VWM and visual representations elicited by retinal input, we modeled the perceptual processes leading up to this difference in suppression durations. We replicated the VWM <b>modulation</b> of <b>suppression</b> durations, and fitted sequential sampling models (linear ballistic accumulators) to the response time data. Model comparisons revealed that the data was best explained by a decrease in threshold for visual input that matches the content of VWM. Converging evidence was obtained by fitting similar sequential sampling models (shifted Wald model) to published datasets. Finally, to confirm that the previously observed threshold difference reflected processes occurring before rather than after the stimuli were released from suppression, we applied the same procedure to the data of an experiment in which stimuli were not interocularly suppressed. Here, we found no decrease in threshold for stimuli that match the content of VWM. We discuss our findings in light of a preactivation hypothesis, proposing that matching visual input taps into the same neural substrate that is already activated by a representation concurrently maintained in VWM, thereby reducing its threshold for reaching visual awareness...|$|R
