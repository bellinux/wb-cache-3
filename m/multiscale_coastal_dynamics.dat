40|$|Coastal erosion forms a {{major source}} of the sediment, organic carbon and {{nutrient}} flux into the arctic basin. Recent studies indicate that sediment input resulting from the erosion of ice-rich, permafrost-dominated coasts might be equal to or greater than river input. The program Arctic <b>Coastal</b> <b>Dynamics</b> (ACD) has been developed to improve our understanding of circum-arctic <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> as a function of environmental forcing, coastal geology, geocryology and morphodynamic behavior. Under this framework a circum-arctic Geo Information System (GIS) has been developed, which is applied to display generalized information on coastal characteristics and to analyse coastal material fluxes. The coastal GIS is based on a digital elevation model, which was constructed from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean, and permafrost parameters adopted from the Circumpolar Active-Layer Permafrost System. A segmentation of the Laptev Sea coastline was performed as a first step towards a GIS-based quantification of the sediment and total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes resulting from coastal erosion...|$|R
40|$|Although recent {{advances}} in data collection and numerical modeling have greatly extended our skill in predicting coastal hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes, the influence of mixed sediments or temporally varying sediment characteristics on <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> has largely been ignored. We hypothesize {{that not only is}} the influence of sediment heterogeneity significant, but that it is also important, in that heterogeneous sedimentary environments comprise approximately 80 % of the world’s non-rocky coastal regions. A literature review of relevant findings strongly suggests that coastal processes within heterogeneous sedimentary environments, defined as areas with sediments comprised of mixed grain sizes (poorly sorted), spatial regions with diverse sediment properties (patchy), and/or areas where sediment characteristics change rapidly over time (dynamic), can greatly differ from those in more uniform (either sand or mud) environments.

40|$|For the {{calculation}} of turbulent mixing in the bottom boundary layer, we present simple analytical tools for the mixing velocity wm and the mixing length lm. Based on observations of turbulence intensity measurements, the mixing velocity wm is represented by an exponential function decaying with z. We suggest two theoretical functions for the mixing length, a first lm 1 obtained from the k-equation written as a constant modeled fluctuating kinetic energy flux and a second lm 2 based on von Kármán's similarity hypothesis. These analytical tools {{were used in the}} finite-mixing-length model of Nielsen and Teakle (2004). The modeling of time-mean sediment concentration profiles C(z) over wave ripples shows that at the opposite of the second equation lm 2 which increases the upward convexity of C(z), the first equation lm 1 increases the upward concavity of C(z) and is able to reproduce the shape of the measured concentrations for coarse sand.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{proposes a}} method, {{based on the}} use of spatial data and aerial {{photographs}} to analyse long term evolution of the coastline along the Gâvres - Penthièvre beach system extending over more than 50 km (Southern Brittany; France). Spatial data layers include: air photograph measurements of coastline position through time, sediment cover, coastline morphology and bathymetry. These were combined with current data derived from both field and modelled data to digitise the limits of sediment cells. Aerial photographs analysis also provides data about the location and the density of anthropogenic features established along the coastline through time. All these data were compiled in a personal geodatabase and a series of both spatial and geostatistical analyses were carried out to assess their spatial relationships. Spatial analyses aim at identifying spatial associations between the type of site evolution (erosion polygon vs accretion polygon) and the characteristics of the coastline (type of sediment cell sites / low density of human pressures / high density of human pressures). Statistical analyses aim at assessing the statistical dependency between variables defining the spatial associations. The results enable identification of at least two different dynamics controlling coastline movements. At a regional scale <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> are mainly related to incident wave propagation. Over more local areas, interrelationships between <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> and increasing concentration of anthropogenic features partly explain coastline variations.

In this context, {{the understanding of}} the way people perceive the <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> and their exposure to risk is essential for the land use management and Integrated Coastal Zone Management. To get the perception of coastal population, this research was based in a risk map proposed by Water Institute (1999) that classifies the Portuguese territory in three categories of risk: low, mean and high. A questionnaire was applied to the dwellings owners in coastal risk areas of Praia de Esmoriz, Praia de Cortegaça, Furadouro, Torreira, Praia da Barra, Costa Nova do Prado and Praia da Vagueira, during the summer season, in 2006. The questionnaire has as main objectives: coastal risks social perception; <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> social perception; identification of territorial and environmental changes in the coastal areas; identification of socio-environmental conflicts. A total of 418 questionnaires were completed which corresponds to 10 % of the dwellings at risk in the study area. Almost all of respondents recognize the shoreline retreat and would accept having their houses relocated if it were confirmed that there home was in fact in danger, however the inquired population confirms to feeling safe near the sea. In other words, there is negligence of the coastal risks.

Many protective works have been implemented and / or under construction since 1989 and up to the present time. Erosion is not the only problem facing the area but also, the accumulation of sediments inside the inlet is also taking place because of the littoral drift and the absence of the outflow of water from Rosetta branch. This paper aims to reach a new condition of stability of Rosetta Promontory by using boundary jetties to reduce <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> at the outlet. Moreover the effect of the angle of the western jetty was investigated to reach suitable position of it. This target is achieved by using a hydrodynamic model Coastal Modeling System (CMS).

A zonation {{of the state of the}} shallow portions of the meadows down the submerged beach profile was identified. Zone a, from the shoreline to the breaking limit, is naturally critical for the development of the meadow. Zone b, from the breaking limit to the closure depth, is subjected to natural and human impacts.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} eolian {{transport}} {{importance for the}} morphological behavior of a 20 Km stretch {{on the coast of}} Ceará between the Ceará river mouth and the Cumbuco Beach. The research consisted of the comparison between the sand volume involved in the coastline migration between 1974 and 2001 and the dune formation potential that is based on the relationship developed by the formed angle between the coastline position and the eolian transport dominant direction. The resulting material volume from the coastline migration was calculated by multiplying the advanced or retreated area by the sum of the active berm height and the closing depth. The dune formation potential, calculated for each studied segment, demonstrated (1) to keep an excellent correlation with the measured volumes for the coastline migration and (2) that most of the segments have been submitted to a sedimentary deficit potential caused by the wind, excluding a few stretches where there is a beach feedback tendency by the eolian transport, through a ‘bypass’ process. The results have showed that the eolian activity may be fundamental for the coastline equilibrium, reinforcing, this way, the idea that the works involving the <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> need the eolian transport study so that they may appropriately represent the <b>coastal</b> <b>dynamics</b> of the studied area...|$|R

Circumpolar-level support for coordinated monitoring activities in the Arctic is hampered by the international nature of scientific, indigenous, industrial and particularly governmental interests there. The International Polar Year (IPY, 2007 - 2009) provided a springboard for creating, expanding and coordinating such networks. One of four projects supported by the International Permafrost Association (IPA) focused on the circumpolar arctic coastal zone and led the IPY cluster on coastal observatories. The Arctic Circumpolar Coastal Observatory Network (ACCOnet) focused its IPY activities on network design and the definition of sites and monitoring activities.
