Keynes is interpreted as treating classical theory as the valid theory of allocation but {{this type of}} theory is of limited relevance for <b>macroanalysis.</b> The productive sector {{is characterized by the}} utilization mode of activity regulated by the nonallocative multiplier process.

Analysis of exchange structure—interactional acts involving information exchange and stance marking—suggests that translanguaging triggers interactionally-rich comments that are oriented towards information exchange and negotiation for meaning on topics of language and culture.

The conditions under which it is possible to exchange some ICS parameters to others are defined. The effectiveness of ICS with conformed subsystems and with principal and providing subsystems is analyzed. The results enable to formalize the main system-information analysis problems, related to the efficiency assessment. Thus it is possible to consider the frequency - quantum characteristics or the frequency - quantum abilities and to assess the effectiveness and relative efficiency index, considering such system characteristics.

40|$|This <b>macroanalysis</b> of {{manufacturing}} employment density distribution {{patterns in the}} United States from 1947 to 1982 supports {{the hypothesis that the}} nation's hierarchical system of cities has served to sort geographically manufacturing operations {{on the basis of the}} marginal returns that could be derived from different size urban centers. As a consequence of this sorting process, nonproduction workers have become more concentrated in large urban centers whereas production workers have become more concentrated in smaller settlements. With the greater number of large urban centers in the Northeast and East North Central regions, nonproduction workers have become more concentrated in the Manufacturing Belt and production workers more concentrated in other regions of the country. The process has helped foster the development of a mosaic of geographically bifurcated labor markets among the larger and smaller urban centers throughout the country. The research suggests that the role of the urban hierarchy in the redistribution {{of manufacturing}} employment was a historical stage in the geographic expansion of development and that its influence has begun to wane. ...|$|E

Fifty students were randomly assigned, with equalizing restrictions on sex and race, to each of the two science classes for each grade level. Both groups at a particular grade level worked with identical materials under very similar physical plant conditions. Prior to the study, the participating teachers were involved in a 6 -week workshop designed to train them to exhibit both student-structured learning in science (SSLS) and teacher-structured learning in science (TSLS) behaviors and used the revised Science Curriculum Assessment System (SCAS) Classroom Interaction Categories-Teacher Behaviors, developed and modified by Matthews, Phillips, and Good.

" may not seem obvious, especially {{in view of the}} fact that so much of our recent socially grounded educational inquiry has been conducted within a qualitative or interpretive paradigm. In this chapter, I attempt to make as strong a case as possible for the importance of quantitative methods in understanding the social organization of learning. I want to argue that both at the level of <b>macroanalysis</b> (considering the effects of different levels of social organization, such as the district, school, and classroom) and at the level of microanaly sis (examining relations among individuals in their primary social settings), quantitative methods can help us achieve important insights and under-standing about the nature, causes, and consequences of social relations. Schooling is a complex process because teachers, students, and administrators operate in a diverse set of social contexts. 1 Although they may appear to be iso-lated in their classroom practices (Cusick, 1983; Hargreaves, 1993; Lortie, 1977), teachers are affected by their social contexts, as they are influenced by others' orientations to teaching and classroom practices (e. g., Rowan, 1990; Trent, 1992...|$|E
40|$|Background: Advanced age {{contributes}} to clinical manifestations of many retinopathies and represents a {{major risk factor}} for age-related macular degeneration, {{a leading cause of}} visual impairment and blindness in the elderly. Rod photoreceptors are especially vulnerable to genetic defects and changes in microenvironment, and are among the first neurons to die in normal aging and in many retinal degenerative diseases.

Methodology/Principal Findings: To discover aging-associated adaptations that may influence rod function, we have generated gene expression profiles of purified rod photoreceptors from mouse retina at young adult to early stages of aging (1. 5, 5, and 12 month old mice).

40|$|Folk metal is a music genre {{originated}} from heavy metal music. For many artists and fans, folk metal {{is more than}} just music: {{it is a way of}} revitalising tradition. Folk metal is then a genre which is closely related to individual’s cultural identities. As part of popular culture, heavy metal has been investigated for instance in the fields of cultural studies and psychology. Andrew Brown investigates how heavy metal emerged as subject for academic research. Deena Weinstein approaches heavy metal as culture and behaviour that is shared by individuals from different cultural backgrounds. However, subgenres like folk metal have not yet been explored in depth by academics. Analysing folk metal’s nuances in specific national contexts would provide further knowledge on national cultures and identities. One example of folk metal reflecting elements of national culture is Finnish folk metal. The bands whose works belong to this genre usually draw from Finnish culture to compose their works, which usually feature stories from a variety of traditional sources such as the epic book Kalevala. Such stories are then transposed into new media, disseminating the artists’ concept of Finnishness. By applying Henry Jenkins' transmedia theory and Matthew Jockers' <b>macroanalysis,</b> this study will focus on how bands make use of traditional narratives to build Finnish culture to their fans via lyrics and Facebook pages. It has been concluded that Finnish artists not only base their works on traditional sources, but also collectively reshape their tradition through and for their fans...|$|E

This thesis looked at traffic crashes in the emirate of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to establish the current situation in road safety and ways of improving it. A global overview of road safety literature revealed that standards of road safety vary widely by region. Key indicators like fatality rate and risk (Jacobs et al, 2000) {{were found to be}} higher in most neighbouring Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) countries (10 - 25 fatalities/ 100, 000 pop., 3 - 5 fatalities/ 10, 000 motor vehicles) than in the best-performing Western countries (6 fatalities/ 100, 000 pop., 1 fatality/ 10, 000 motor vehicles). Interventions and countermeasures to tackle specific road safety issues were reviewed from international studies. Countermeasures were chosen with consideration for the local situation in Dubai within the categories of Human, Environmental and Vehicle factors. Examples of selected measures include offending driver punishment (Human), Electronic Stability Control (Vehicle) and central barriers (Environment). These measures were mostly studied in different environments to those in Dubai so the aspect of knowledge transfer between areas of different cultural and environmental conditions was discussed. Data from real world injury crashes (as collected by Dubai Police and the Roads & Transport Authority) over twelve years (1995 2006) were subject to <b>macroanalysis</b> in SPSS to identify the main issues over the past decade. 18, 142 crashes involving 30, 942 casualties and 48, 960 vehicles were analysed at the outset.

Such analysis provides a quantitative and objective approach to the understanding of art, and can expand on the ‘traditional’ subjective way fine art has been examined, appreciated, and studied in the past few hundred years” (Shamir, 2013). While software has been shown to accurately sort artists into schools of art identified by art historians, and to show similarities between artists, and to authenticate paintings of questionable provenance, the question remains as to how <b>macroanalysis</b> can be effectively used to yield new insights into art history, artists, and artworks. Subjecting digital images of paintings to algorithmic analysis is not without its pitfalls. Current software cannot gauge irony, subversion, scale, and computers cannot easily recognize more abstract depictions and what they represent, for example. In addition, previous approaches have had difficulty creating an output that is easily understood in art history terms. In this paper, we explore the particular case of Fernand Léger and his influences, using a new program developed at LTU to test and measure standard approaches to this artist’s work. Scholars have noted unequivocally that “Léger’s personal brand of cubism has little in common with Picasso and Braque. ” Léger himself publically allied himself with Cezanne, Rousseau, and Cendrars.

This was done, in part, in order to discover whether or not, as hypothesized, socialization determines attitude and/or behavior. The principal purpose, however, was to provide a case study of political leadership in Zaïre that could prove useful in cross-national research concerning political elites. Significant use was made of the quantitative-comparative and structural-functional approaches, but elite, trend, group, recruitment, ambition, conflict, integration and communications theory also played a part in analysis as did, on occasion, other theoretical approaches. MNC leaders, although relatively young and usually having only secondary education, were found {{to be part of a}} highly significant regionally-based national elite which in turn was part of a larger African political elite. The MNC leadership was found to be fragmented and incapable of uniting the country. The leadership was divided into separate attitudinal and behavioral groupings strongly linked to regional differences. These differences resulted primarily from the degree of effective local control exercised by the central government and the degree and nature of the urbanizing or modernizing experience of the MNC leaders, although ethnicity and other social background variables also played a part. A significant conclusion of the study, based on data from forty-one biographical, narrative case studies of MNC leaders and from an aggregate multivariate longitudinal biographical machine analysis of 274 MNC leaders coupled with an examination of historical events, is that social background characteristics do influence political attitude and behavior and that they can be used successfully to predict future trends and events. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the occupations people hold, {{and the social}} classes {{in which they are}} situated, affect {{the way in which they}} form and express opinions. At a theoretical level, it unites the 'deep-structure' <b>macroanalysis</b> of social theory with the individualised microanalysis of how subjects form and express opinions in opinion research, reviving an approach that has not been pursued since early- 20 th-century social research. At a practical level, it responds to several recent and prominent failures of prediction by the opinion polling industry, and asks whether a broader understanding of 'mass opinion' can help avert such failures in future. The thesis argues that opinions are subjects' judgments about their social conditions, based on mental pictures they have of these conditions that combine the values and attitudes they hold with the information they have about their environment. Subjects form opinions based on these pictures via three 'means of thinking'-personality-traits, emotions, and reason-and express them using two kinds of 'means of articulation'-bodily organs and media. The thesis shows how the variety of occupations subjects hold, and the extremity of class differentials between them, introduce substantial plurality into their values and attitudes, the way they acquire information, how they think, and how they articulate themselves. In particular, it highlights the considerable asymmetries between higher- and lower-class subjects regarding: which parts of their social conditions they are experts about, and how far they are influenced by others; whether they think about their conditions more emotionally or with reasoning; and how great a range and quality of opportunities they have to articulate their views. The thesis closes by suggesting that these findings offer opinion researchers and social theorists clear directions for measuring 'mass opinion' in new ways, and potentially emancipating the voices of subjects whose opinions are suppressed in late-modern society...|$|E
40|$|Introduced by: Paul ConwayBeyond CTRL+F: Text Mining Across the Disciplines Conference — Keynote Speaker: In his book Macroanalysis, Matthew Jockers {{argues that}} we have reached a “tipping point. ” Now {{that we have}} so much data digitized, we can use {{techniques}} and methodologies used to explore big data: text mining, topic modeling, machine learning, named entity recognition, etc. Two problems confront digital literary historians of women writers who wish to apply these methodologies. First, the number of women writers who published works before 1800 in Britain and America, as well as the number of their publications that have been preserved, is small compared to men, a problem compounded by how few works by early modern women writers are currently being digitized: roughly 4 % of 307, 000 volumes in the Early English Books Online and Eighteenth-Century Collections Online were written by women writers.   Second, many of the data analysts currently comparing what they call “female writing” to “male writing” propagate rather than interrogate stereotypes about women and women writers. ** Sociologists have worked on such problems, and in this talk, I will outline some of their strategies and discuss how literary critics who wish to perform <b>macroanalysis</b> might make use of them.   Data scientists in the commercial world have worked on the problem of representing minorities “fairly” even when they are represented by a small sample. Thanks to the robust history of feminist theory and criticism, we have the means for generating vocabularies, taxonomies, and ontologies for semantic searching and supervised topic modeling that differ from those generated through big-data techniques that naïvely privilege historically oppressive discourses. Second, the need to shift from quantitative to qualitative analysis (and back again) is augmented when analyzing textual data produced by minorities. I argue that, once again, the concern for social justice enhances intellectual work by effectively demonstrating the inadequacies of claiming “new” discoveries based upon “statistical significance” alone...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to investigate the host responses after 5 -flurouracil (5 -FU) administration and to find the target genes and their relationship with other cytokines in the 5 -FU-induced oral mucositis (OM) mouse model through transcriptomic analysis. Thirty-six 6 to 8 week-old male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the control group and 5 -FU-treated group. In the 5 -FU group, mice received 5 -FU (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on day 1, day 8, day 15, day 22, and day 29, respectively. We evaluated the oral mucosal change under <b>macroanalysis</b> and histological examination at indicated periods, and then applied transcriptomic analysis of gene expression profile and Immunohistochemical stain to identify the target molecules related to 5 -FU-induced OM. The most prominent histological change in this model was observed in the fifth week. The gene expression of Bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein, related sequence 1 (Bglap-rs 1) (- 12. 69 -fold) and Chitinase 3 -like 4 (Chi 3 l 4) (- 6. 35 -fold) were significantly down-regulated in this phase. The quantitative real-time PCR results also revealed the expression levels were 0. 62 -fold in Bglap-rs 1 and 0. 13 -fold in Chi 3 l 4 compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical stain showed significant expression of cluster of differentiation 11 b (p< 0. 01), interleukin- 1 β (p< 0. 001) and tumor necrosis factor-α (p< 0. 05), and down-regulation of Bglap-rs 1 (p< 0. 01) compared with the control group.

40|$|My Bachelor Thesis is a {{comprehensive}} survey about the children´s broadcasts on Estonian Radio in the years of 1946 to 1970. The first paragraph shortly describes the radio as a specific medium and its influences on the children, {{the functions of the}} broadcasts and the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) used in the main analyzation. In the second paragraph I have tried to give background information that would help to put the era´s children´s broadcasts into the contemporary social context – it is described the society´s background by the time as well as the role of journalism in the society. I have also taken a deeper view into the ER´s role and importance amongst the other mediums. Already in the 1960 s the board of Estonian Radio started to get interested in the ratings of their programs. The survey concerning of children´s broadcasts was made in 1967 - its results have shortly been referred in the second paragraph of the current study. The last sub- paragraph of the second main paragraph expands the position of the radio´s editorial desk {{in the structure of the}} ER and also the structural changes that occurred. The most important change for the children´s broadcast editor desk happened in 1953 when the editors of children and youth programmes were separated. In the new structure the children´s programmes were to lead by art editors, youth programmes became a part of the editor desk dealing with political programmes. The third paragraph mainly focuses on methods and description of the material used in the survey. The fourth paragraph gives a clarifying view about the children broadcasts in 1927 - 1970. Although the period from 1927 to 1945 was not the survey objective in my thesis, I have expanded it shortly, considering it impossible to describe the changes that have taken place in the content of radio programs and genres without knowing the previous periods. Periodising is mainly based on a current political situation of every period. The fifth paragraph consists of various parts. In the sub-paragraph I have contemplated the amendment requirements for children broadcasts presented in the Radio Committee board member guidings in 1950 s. The <b>macroanalysis</b> of the programmes divides into 2 macroanalysis´ of two separate periods (1946 to 1957 and 1958 to 1970). In the <b>macroanalysis</b> it has been viewed into programmes´ themes, genres, structure, interpersonal communication with the listener, the functions of programmes and the values and ideals presented in radio broadcasts. Microanalysis is divided into two parts based on the diversity of two different parts. Microanalysis focuses on the variability of vocabulary ja grammar, the our-discourse content, the social identities of the participiants and the themes given by children in the viewed broadcasts. In the last sub-paragraph I have juxtaposed the described era´s broadcasts with the program called „Children´s Sayings” („Lapsesuu”) which is currently in the ER´s programme this season (May 2007). Survey conclusions. The main principles of how to make a radio programme have changed a lot within the years. If the first radio broadcast was often only (starting from 1927) about reading out of fictional texts or playing music, then in the 1960 ´s many qualitative changes happened. The children´s broadcasts transformed into live programmes which were to stimulate the radio listeners to participate in making the radio programmes. The best example of this improvement would obviously be the broadcast „Poiste Klubi” („Boys´ Club”) that first appeared on the programme in 1967. Nevertheless quite good examples can also be the live chess plays, literature contests and quizzes put into the programmes that all required people´s active participation. The functions of the radio broadcasts massively changed in time. The programs in 1946 – 1957 are severely distinguished by the fact that ideological themes were violently forced into every broadcasting programme. The radio programmes from 1957 to 1970 s are rather apolitical, programmes holding an ideological function separate into specific series, educational and entertaining programs and series begin to dominate instead. The natural part of a children´s broadcast was the children´s interviews. In 1960 s it was started to concentrate on children´s participation - it became significant to give an opportunity to children themselves to make and broadcast programmes. The radio organised contests for children to find the radio performers, a few programmes were made where both creators and performers were exclusively children...|$|E

BrownThe introduction of graphing calculators into senior secondary schools and mandating of their use in high stakes assessment makes student expertise in finding a complete graph of a function essential. This thesis investigated the cognitive, metacognitive, mathematical, and technological processes senior secondary students used in seeking a complete graph of a difficult cubic function. A pretest of function knowledge was administered to two mixed ability classes in their final two years of secondary school. Five pairs of experienced users of TI- 83 or 82 graphing calculators from these classes were audio and videotaped solving a problem task. Protocols were constructed and subjected to intensive qualitative <b>macroanalysis</b> and microanalysis using tools developed by the researcher from Schoenfeld’s work. The findings were: (1) all students demonstrated understanding of the local and global nature of functions and the synthesis of these in determining a complete graph; (2) a range of mathematical and graphing calculator knowledge was applied in seeking a global view of the function with their combined application being more efficient and effective; (3) an understanding of automatic range scaling features facilitated efficient finding of a global view; (4) all pairs demonstrated having a clear mental image of the function sought and the possible positions of the calculator output relative to this; (5) {{students were able to}} resolve situations involving unexpected views of the graph to determine a global view; (6) students displayed understanding of local linearity of a function; (7) when working in the graphical representation, students used the algebraic but not the numerical representation to facilitate and support their solution; (8) scale marks were used to produce more elegant solutions and facilitate identification of key function features to produce a sketch but some students misunderstood the effect of altering these; (9) pairs differed in the proportion of cognitive and metacognitive behaviours demonstrated with question asking during evaluation supporting decision making; (10) correct selection of xxi an extensive range of graphing calculator features and use of dedicated features facilitated efficient and accurate identification of coordinates of key function features.

40|$|In 1974, Judge W. Arthur Garrity, {{federal court}} judge in Boston, Massachusetts, found the Boston Public School System guilty of {{intentionally}} maintaining a dual school system, a clear {{violation of the}} law. Judge Garrity ordered immediate 2 ̆ 2 root and branch 2 ̆ 2 desegregation as required by Supreme Court precedent. The process of desegregating the Boston public schools involved mandatory student reassignment, the desegregation of staff, {{and the establishment of}} equity of educational opportunity. ^ Previous studies of the process and the effects of court ordered school desegregation in Boston have focused on the social and political unrest that followed the implementation of the court orders. The purpose of this present study was to discover whether there were other effects of school desegregation on the Boston public schools. Specifically, this study examined the areas of racial balance, school climate, and student achievement from 1974 - 1995. ^ Through a series of in-depth interviews, on-site observations, and analysis of quantitative data, evidence was found to support the thesis that court ordered school desegregation has brought about significant positive changes in the racial balance, the equity of educational opportunity, and the school climate of the Boston public schools. It is hoped that these changes will eventually result in significant increases in student achievement. ^ This study used both <b>macroanalysis</b> and microanalysis to uncover the longterm effects of the desegregation orders and the subsequent two decades of court supervision. Through these analyses, the researcher concluded that, although the first decade following the issuing of the desegregation orders was characterized by a certain amount of disequilibrium, the second decade of the desegregation process involved the evolution of the school system into a higher level of order, equity, and quality of educational opportunities. ^ The {{results of this study suggest}} that court ordered school desegregation was a necessary catalyst that has mandated and maintained the continued evolution of the public schools. Evidence presented in this study also suggests the need to adopt a new paradigm of public education that will promote greater equity of educational opportunity and will result in a less stratified social order. ...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (CMC) and intermetallic materials (e. g., {{single crystal}} nickel aluminide) are high performance materials that exhibit attractive mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. These materials are critically important in advancing certain performance aspects of gas turbine engines. From an aerospace engineer's perspective {{the new generation}} of ceramic composites and intermetallics offers a significant potential for raising the thrust/weight ratio and reducing NO(x) emissions of gas turbine engines. These aspects have increased interest in utilizing these materials in the hot sections of turbine engines. However, as these materials evolve and their performance characteristics improve a persistent need exists for state-of-the-art analytical methods that predict the response of components fabricated from CMC and intermetallic material systems. This need provided the motivation for the technology developed under this research effort. Continuous ceramic fiber composites exhibit an increase in work of fracture, which allows for "graceful" rather than catastrophic failure. When loaded in the fiber direction, these composites retain substantial strength capacity beyond the initiation of transverse matrix cracking despite the fact that neither of its constituents would exhibit such behavior if tested alone. As additional load is applied beyond first matrix cracking, the matrix tends to break in a series of cracks bridged by the ceramic fibers. Any additional load is born increasingly by the fibers until the ultimate strength of the composite is reached. Thus modeling efforts supported under this research effort have focused on predicting this sort of behavior. For single crystal intermetallics the issues that motivated the technology development involved questions relating to material behavior and component design. Thus the research effort supported by this grant had to determine the statistical nature and source of fracture in a high strength, NiAl single crystal turbine blade material; map a simplistic failure strength envelope of the material; develop a statistically based reliability computer algorithm, verify the reliability model and computer algorithm, and model stator vanes for rig tests. Thus establishing design protocols that enable the engineer to analyze and predict the mechanical behavior of ceramic composites and intermetallics would mitigate the prototype (trial and error) approach currently used by the engineering community. The primary objective of the research effort supported by this short term grant is the continued creation of enabling technologies for the <b>macroanalysis</b> of components fabricated from ceramic composites and intermetallic material systems. The creation of enabling technologies aids in shortening the product development cycle of components fabricated from the new high technology materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of electrolyte concentration in nanoliter quantities of fluid {{is a fundamental}} step in the utilization of micropuncture and isolated tubule microperfusion techniques for studying ion transport. A number of methodologies {{have been developed for}} these analyses, including helium glow photometry [1], electron probe microanalysis [2], and atomic absorption spectrophotometry [3]. Because of the significant cost of the equipment for performing atomic absorption spectrophotometry or electron probe microanalysis, and the lack of commercial availability of helium glow photometers, we decided to utilize ion-specific electrodes for the {{measurement of}} sodium and potassium in samples from isolated tubule microperfusion experiments. The application of ion-specific micro-electrodes to the measurement of intracellular ion activity and <b>macroanalysis</b> is well established [4], but the technique has not been widely applied to the analysis of electrolyte concentration in nanoliter droplets, although Garvin has recently developed a flow-through ion-selective electrode apparatus for measurement of potassium concentrations [5]. Since aqueous droplets must be analyzed under oil to prevent evaporation, one problem we had to overcome was the deterioration in the sensitivity of liquid ion exchanger microelectrodes on contact with oil. Other investigators have utilized ion-selective microelectrodes to study intracellular ion activities or ion activities in tubular fluid in situ, circumstances in which the tissue is bathed in an aqueous electrolyte solution rather than mineral oil [6 – 8]. In the case where measurements have been made in aqueous droplets under oil, an ion-selective glass rather than a liquid ion exchanger microelectrode was used [9]. With liquid ion exchangers, we found that the sensitivity of the electrode decreased markedly on contact with mineral oil, probably due to the lipophilicity of the ionophore. Although it is possible to utilize very small tips and holders with sidearms to express contaminated ionophore (S. Agulian, personal communication), we found this technique cumbersome and have adapted the methods described by Vogel et al [10], which utilizes a desilanization step to allow a droplet of aqueous solution to protect the ionophore from oil contamination. We have applied electrodes constructed using this technique to the measurement of electrolyte concentrations in aqueous nanoliter droplets under oil. The equipment for this analysis is relatively inexpensive, available in many microperfusion laboratories, and can be applied to a variety of ions, and therefore the technique may be valuable to a wide spectrum of investigators...|$|E

This descriptive study was conducted in a fourth-grade classroom for an entire school year. Twenty-two students and their teacher were observed during 273 literature discussion group sessions. Literature discussion groups were approached from a collaborative perspective, and students had some choice in book selection. These literature discussion groups supported, but did not replace, the classroom reading program. The study focused on interaction, literature response, and sociocultural factors that affected the dynamics and complexity of the literature discussion group. Literature response was considered from the perspective of Rosenblatt's aesthetic response. Data included videotapes, field notes, conference notes, student literature logs, and transcripts. <b>Macroanalysis</b> was completed by summarizing data from each session into vignettes. A focus group was selected for microanalysis. Microanalysis was completed through a study of one group of eight students for seven sessions while they discussed Maniac Magee. Videotapes were transcribed using a format that enabled overlapping speech and density of the conversation to be visible. Transcripts were first coded for interaction (turn, floor, and topic). Quantitative analysis included creating tables for turn for individual students and in each session. Charts reported number of words and number of turns taken, as well as nature of turn. Transcripts were further coded for literature responses and other factors, such as gender. Findings include five dynamic factors that were visible and were observed to affect the nature of the discussion: (a) agenda, (b) group size, (c) roles and stances, (d) types of talk, and (e) group and relationship building. Reflection and reaction to others' ideas were important factors in sustaining a topic and collaboration. Level of participation did not affect group performance. Barnes' presentational and exploratory talk were present. Some students responded according to gender stereotypes. Teacher modeling was successful in scaffolding students in reflection and collaboration, and students perceived a need for the teacher to be present at discussions. Students used "talk around the edges" to construct meaning and to control the group discussion. Small groups developed within the larger groups to investigate and research information, to collaborate and develop support, and to create a counter discussion. Students were more likely to respond when they felt safe to do so. The "safe space" was created by nature of talk and shared experience...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the arena of {{activity}} around access to {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) and its relationship with gender and the discipline of Multimedia in UK universities. With education as a field of research, the thesis aims at providing a model which assists students to be better equipped to design accessible and inclusive design processes and products. The arena of access has been increasingly important in recent decades exemplified by policies that aimed to provide "universal access". Existing concepts of access have unsystematically focused on physical, economic and ergonomic considerations. This thesis reports on a study that uses a number of theoretical tools to conceptualise this complex area. Feminist Epistemology offers the tools to examine and understand gender and technology, and to inform the framework of study. Technological Determinism (TD) and Social Constructionism (SCOT) theories provide the theoretical base to study access in the context of new technologies, specifically in the Multimedia sector. The research was qualitative and was conducted using documentary analysis, questionnaires and interviews. The research design moved from macro to micro levels. In the first stage a theoretical framework was developed which mapped current understandings of the concepts. As well as a literature review, this stage also included distribution and analysis of questionnaire responses from 180 students and 5 tutors from 3 UK universities. This <b>macroanalysis</b> focused on the study of organisational understandings of access, gender and Multimedia in the chosen educational institutions. The second stage of the research was concerned with the structural shaping the discourses deployed within it. Interviews were conducted with 24 students and 5 tutors. This microanalysis used Grounded Theory as a research tool and focused on individual understandings of access, gender and Multimedia in the selected multimedia courses. The analysis of research data confirms that there is a compartmentalised understanding of access to ICTs within university-based Multimedia education. Access {{is often referred to as}} physical and economic access to equipment. User involvement in the design process is often impeded by current institutional structures and designers' individual attitudes, and this affects the accessibility of the product. Gender dynamics are at play but are often ignored within the design process. Essentialist values also influence the construction of those gender dynamics. Multimedia applications do not fully explore interactivity and the use of multiple platforms is largely ignored. The thesis challenges current understandings of access by bringing attention to a more gender balanced approach by proposing a new model, "creative access". This model encourages a gender aware approach to processes and products, and supports the creation of a working environment that uses multimedia applications as tools to transform current physical, economic, social and cultural boundaries...|$|E
