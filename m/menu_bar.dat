5|$|There are two {{versions}} of the PowerBook100's QWERTY layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63keys and an international ISO version with 64keys. The caps lock key on the PowerBook100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System7 operating system software includes an extension file that causes an icon of the international caps lock symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> when Caps Lock is active.|$|E
5|$|System 6's Apple menu {{cannot be}} used to launch {{application}}s. The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E

50|$|The <b>menu</b> <b>bar's</b> {{purpose is}} to supply a common housing for window- or application-specific menus which provide access to such {{functions}} as opening files, interacting with an application, or displaying help documentation or manuals. <b>Menu</b> <b>bars</b> are typically present in graphical user interfaces that display documents and representations of files in windows and windowing systems but menus {{can be used as}} well in command line interface programs like text editors or filemanagers where drop-down menu is activated with shortcut key or combination.|$|R
25|$|In Visual Studio 2012 RC, a {{major change}} to the {{interface}} {{is the use of}} all-caps <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces, and to provide added structure to the top <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> area. The redesign was criticized for being hard to read, and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand out better. Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro apps. However, there exists a Windows Registry option to allow users to disable the all-caps interface.|$|E
25|$|Apple has {{continued}} to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the <b>menu</b> <b>bar.</b> Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.|$|E
25|$|In January 1981, Steve Jobs {{completely}} {{took over}} the Macintosh project. Jobs {{and a number of}} Apple engineers visited Xerox PARC in December 1979, three months after the Lisa and Macintosh projects had begun. After hearing about the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC from former Xerox employees like Raskin, Jobs negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The final Lisa and Macintosh operating systems use concepts from the Xerox Alto, but many elements of the graphical user interface were created by Apple including the <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> pull-down menus, and the concepts of drag and drop and direct manipulation.|$|E

25|$|The first commercially {{available}} {{computer with a}} GUI was the 1979 PERQ workstation, manufactured by Three Rivers Computer Corporation. In 1981, Xerox eventually commercialized the Alto {{in the form of}} a new and enhanced system – the Xerox 8010 Information System – more commonly known as the Xerox Star. These early systems spurred many other GUI efforts, including the Apple Lisa (which presented the concept of <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> and window controls) in 1983, the Apple Macintosh 128K in 1984, and the Atari ST with Digital Research's GEM, and Commodore Amiga in 1985. Visi On was released in 1983 for the IBM PC compatible computers, but was never popular due to its high hardware demands. Nevertheless, it was a crucial influence on the contemporary development of Microsoft Windows.|$|E
2500|$|The {{option in}} <b>Menu</b> <b>Bar</b> to display battery life using [...] "Time" [...] {{is no longer}} offered. Instead, the only option is to display battery [...] "Percentage". However, battery time can still be viewed in the {{dropdown}} by clicking on the battery icon.|$|E
2500|$|The 770, {{like all}} Nokia Internet Tablets, runs Maemo, {{which is similar}} to many {{handheld}} operating systems, and provides a [...] "Home" [...] screen—the central point from which all applications and settings are accessed. The Home Screen is divided into areas for launching applications, a <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> and a large customisable area that can display information such as an RSS reader, Internet radio player, and Google search box for example. Maemo is a modified version of Debian.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft Project 98 was {{the first}} to use Tahoma font in the <b>menu</b> <b>bars</b> and to contain Office Assistant, like all Office 97 applications. It was the last version to run on Windows NT 3.51. Project 98 SR-1 was a major service release {{addressing}} several issues in Project 98.|$|R
5000|$|Themes: Formerly {{known as}} [...] "Personas". Strictly modify certain {{elements}} of the user interface.

They may change the text and background color as well.|$|R
50|$|The TOS {{operating}} {{system for the}} Atari ST would display <b>menu</b> <b>bars</b> {{at the top of}} the screen like Mac OS. Rather than being 'pulled-down' by holding the mouse button, the menu would appear as soon as the pointer was over its heading. This was done to get around an Apple patent on pull-down menus.|$|R
2500|$|The {{address bar}} has been {{modified}} {{to present a}} breadcrumbs view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the Back button or pressing the up button. This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to [...] "Back" [...] and selecting any folder {{from a list of}} previously accessed folders. It makes the [...] "Up One Level" [...] button obsolete so that is removed. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow {{to the right of the}} last item, or to click in the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files. When items are grouped, clicking the group header selects all items under that group. Multiple groups of files can also be selected by clicking the group headers while holding down Ctrl.|$|E
2500|$|WinAMP 0.92 was {{released}} as a freeware in May 1997. Within the standard Windows frame and <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> {{it had the}} beginnings of the [...] "classic" [...] Winamp GUI: dark gray rectangle with silver 3D-effect transport buttons, a red/green volume slider, time displayed in a green LED font, with track name, MP3 bitrate, and [...] "mixrate" [...] in green. There was no position bar, and a blank space where the spectrum analyzer and waveform analyzer would later appear. Multiple files on the command line or dropped onto its icon were enqueued in the playlist.|$|E
2500|$|Notification Center can be {{accessed}} by clicking the icon in the {{right corner of the}} <b>menu</b> <b>bar.</b> When open, the user can click a button to tweet, post status updates to Facebook, or view all notifications in the sidebar pane. Swiping up will reveal the option to disable Notification Center for one day. Many settings of Notification Center can be customized under the [...] "Notifications" [...] pane in System Preferences. Each application can have three ways to display notifications: none, banners, and alerts. Options to toggle the app icons and sounds are also available. Users can click and drag an app in the pane to change the order the applications are displayed within Notification Center.|$|E
50|$|The Ximian group {{became part}} of Novell, and in turn made and {{continued}} several contributions to GNOME with applications such as F-Spot, Evolution and Banshee.The GNOME desktop used the slab instead of the classic double-panelled GNOME <b>menu</b> <b>bars</b> from openSUSE 10.2 to openSUSE 11.4. In openSUSE 12.1 slab was replaced with the upstream GNOME Shell and GNOME Fallback designs.|$|R
50|$|The {{graphical}} {{user interface}} of HotJava Views was quite novel in that it dispensed {{with some of the}} common features of GUIs in order to simplify the interface. <b>Menu</b> <b>bars</b> and overlapping, resizable windows were eliminated and a simple Selector icon bar was used to switch between applications. Other third-party Java applications could be added to the Selector.|$|R
50|$|XRC, or XML Resource, or XML Based Resource System is a {{cross-platform}} XML-based {{user interface}} markup language used by wxWidgets. XRC allows {{graphical user interface}} elements, such as dialogs, <b>menu</b> <b>bars</b> and toolbars, to be stored as XML, which can be loaded into the application at run-time or translated into a target programming language and compiled.|$|R
2500|$|Following Hancock's plan, {{development}} of System 7.5 continued, {{with a number}} of technologies originally slated for Copland being incorporated into the base OS. Apple embarked on a buying campaign, acquiring the rights to various third-party system enhancements and integrating them into the OS. The Extensions Manager, hierarchical Apple menu, collapsing windows, the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> clock, and sticky notes—all were developed outside of Apple. Stability and performance were improved by Mac OS 7.6, which dropped the [...] "System" [...] moniker in favor of [...] "Mac OS". Eventually, many features developed for Copland, including the new multithreaded Finder and support for themes (the default Platinum was the only theme included) were rolled into the unreleased beta of Mac OS 7.7, which was instead rebranded and launched as Mac OS 8.|$|E
2500|$|Chromium 13.0 was {{released}} on 26 April 2011, with 13.0.748.0 as the initial version. Early versions of Chromium 13 included a menu button to enable users to switch between multiple Google profiles, multi-selection of tabs and an improved omnibox engine. This version also included several minor GUI changes, including a slightly lightened <b>menu</b> <b>bar.</b> By early May 2011 the results of Google's attempts to reduce the file size of Chromium were already being noted. Much of the early {{work in this area}} concentrated on shrinking the size of WebKit, by removing Wireless Markup Language (WML), the Image Resizer, datagrids and the Android build system. The largest Chromium nightly build was 35.3 MB on 15 April 2011, but this was reduced to 29.9 MB by 20 April 2011. Later builds of Chromium and Chrome in mid-May 2011 introduced the optional [...] "compact navigation view", aimed at mobile device users. This view combined the tab and URL/menu bars into one bar, by making the URL bar hide when not in use, thus saving 30 pixels of vertical space.|$|E

25|$|Office 2007 {{introduced}} a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, which uses ribbons and an Office menu instead of <b>menu</b> <b>bars</b> and toolbars. Office 2007 also introduced Office Open XML file formats as the default file formats in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. The new formats are intended to facilitate the sharing of information between programs, improve security, {{reduce the size of}} documents, and enable new recovery scenarios.|$|R
50|$|Many {{changes to}} the user interface, such as a {{transparent}} <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> new icons, and a 3D Dock. As well as this, the Apple icon is now black instead of blue. R.L. Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized a number of changes to Leopard's user interface, including the transparent <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> and the new folder icons. Decreased transparency of the <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> along {{with the ability to}} disable the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> transparency were added with the 10.5.2 release on February 11, 2008.|$|E
50|$|There is {{only one}} <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> so the {{application}} menus displayed {{are those of the}} application that is currently focused. Therefore, for example, if the System Preferences application is focused, its menus are in the <b>menu</b> <b>bar,</b> and if the user clicks on the Desktop which {{is a part of the}} Finder application, the <b>menu</b> <b>bar</b> will then display the Finder menus.|$|E
5000|$|The Firefox button groups {{the menus}} in Firefox 4. It is {{displayed}} by default on the Windows 7 and Windows Vista operating systems. It can be displayed on other operating systems by selecting [...] "Toolbars" [...] from the View menu and unchecking [...] "Menu Bar". The <b>Menu</b> <b>bar</b> can be restored by selecting [...] "Options" [...] from the Firefox button menu and checking [...] "Menu Bar". Certain menu items, such as [...] "Page Info" [...] and [...] "Import" [...] (for importing bookmarks and other browser data), {{are not available}} from the Firefox button menu but remain available from the <b>Menu</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>Menu</b> <b>bar</b> can be displayed temporarily by pressing and releasing the Alt key. Selecting a <b>Menu</b> <b>bar</b> command or pressing the Alt key again dismisses the <b>Menu</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apple {{experiments}} in GUI {{design for the}} Lisa project initially used multiple <b>menu</b> <b>bars</b> anchored {{to the bottom of}} windows, but this was quickly dropped in favor of the current arrangement, as it proved slower to use (in accordance with Fitts's law). The idea of separate menus in each window or document was later implemented in Microsoft Windows and is the default representation in most Linux desktop environments.|$|R
