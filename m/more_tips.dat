5000|$|A {{full-length}} {{documentary film}} called A Nightmare in Las Cruces {{was released on}} the 20th anniversary of the massacre. It uses actual crime scene video, pictures and interviews with family members. Filmmaker Charlie Minn hopes it will [...] "move someone {{to come forward with}} fresh information and break the case". Since its release, <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> have been reported to the local police.|$|E

50|$|When Beethoven was {{finished}} studying with Albrechtsberger {{he decided to}} get a few <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> and pointers, so to speak, from Haydn. From there Beethoven possibly studied with Antonio Salieri, but this is unknown as a fact. It is also quite possible that Beethoven went off on his own to make a living, and only then returned after he had a stable career.|$|E
50|$|If one {{is calling}} and leaving voice messages, include time of {{availability}} for callbacks. There is {{nothing worse than}} a callback coming to one when one is not available. Use the telephone as a great communication tool. Be polite and always put oneself in the other person's position. For <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> on making business calls and leaving enticing messages see Harlan J Brown's book on Telephone Participation.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} {{positive}} reciprocity is that waitresses who smile broadly receive <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> than waitresses who present a minimal smile. Also, free samples {{are not merely}} opportunities to taste a product but rather invitations {{to engage in the}} rule of reciprocity. Many people find it difficult to accept the free sample and walk away. Instead, they buy some of the product even when they did not find it that enjoyable.|$|E
5000|$|Cirith Ungol {{was based}} on Tolkien's design, but Richard Taylor felt it was [...] "boring", and {{redesigned}} it with <b>more</b> <b>tipping</b> angles. The interior set, like Minas Tirith, was built as a few multiple levels that numerous camera takes would suggest composed a larger structure. The miniature was sprayed with phosphorescent paint and lit from below with black lights to create its unearthly glow.|$|R
30|$|Caucasians have <b>more</b> {{positive}} <b>tip</b> {{values and}} Africans, more positive torque values, with greater proclination of the incisors.|$|R
3000|$|... (Oliveira et al. 2012) {{conducted}} drilling {{experiments on}} bovine bone with twisted stainless steel and ceramic drills {{to find out}} the relation between the thermal changes and drill wear. They found that temperature increased with the drilling depth and thickness of cortical bone. Their investigations suggested that depth was the predominant factor influencing the temperature variation in bone drilling. Further, it was concluded that stainless steel drill bit had <b>more</b> <b>tip</b> wear as compared to the ceramic drill bit.|$|R
50|$|Customers and {{employees}} represent {{the two groups}} that regularly inhabit the servicescape. Their perceptions of the environment are likely to differe, because each comes to the space with different purposes and motivations. For example, a waiter in a restaurant {{is likely to be}} pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means <b>more</b> <b>tips.</b> Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.|$|E
50|$|Team Challenge 4: This season's Restaurant Takeover {{took place}} at Dinah's Family Restaurant in Culver City, California. The judges {{selected}} the two team captains themselves from among the cooks who had not previously been team captains: Christine and Willie. The teams would be boys versus girls, with captains as expediters, but both teams could choose {{a member of the}} opposite sex to join them. Christian and Victoria were chosen to switch places. Christine's Red Team received <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> with $87 compared to $82 for Willie's Blue Team, ensuring them safety from the pressure test.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Mitchell and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) {{are at a}} {{bar with}} friends, and Cameron thinks that the {{waitress}} is flirting with him. Mitchell tells him that she only tries to get <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> since {{it is clear that}} Cam is obvious gay and everyone can see that. Cam is offended by that and makes a bet with Mitchell that he can get a woman's phone number at the bar. Cam approaches a woman named Katie (Leslie Mann) and manages to take her number, something that Mitchell and their friend can not believe.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from its relatives, by its flat leaf ends (not convex like Haworthia emelyae) which have <b>more</b> rounded <b>tips,</b> and a grey colour.|$|R
50|$|The shinogi can {{be placed}} near {{the back of the}} blade for a longer, sharper, <b>more</b> fragile <b>tip</b> or a <b>more</b> {{moderate}} shinogi {{near the center of the}} blade.|$|R
30|$|Race and {{ethnicity}} {{have a strong}} influence on values of tip, torque and in-out. This is translated as a <b>more</b> positive <b>tip</b> in Caucasian subjects and a more positive torque in those of African descent (greater proclination of the incisors). Finally, {{with respect to the}} values reported by Andrews, we found a tendency to <b>more</b> positive mean <b>tip</b> (except for at the upper second molars and lower incisors) and less negative torque in the posterior sectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{organism}} dimension {{refers to}} {{the two groups of}} people that make up the service encounter - customers and employees. Both groups inhabit the same physical environment, yet their perceptions of it may vary because each comes to the space for different reasons. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means <b>more</b> <b>tips.</b> Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.|$|E
50|$|The bead must be {{measured}} {{and cut to}} size; care is taken not to bend or warp it. In places where more than one corner meets; the bead's ends are cut at an angle and the 2 or <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> are placed as close together as allowable; touching but not overlapping. The bead is completely covered with plaster {{as well as the}} rest of the wall and the plaster also helps to hold it firm. The finished product leaves only a small exposed metal strip at the protrusion of the corner which gets covered when the wall is painted. This leaves a clean, straight looking corner.|$|E
5000|$|The FBI {{has also}} posted billboards {{throughout}} the country {{as an attempt to}} gain information from the public.

50|$|Clearance cairns {{constructed}} using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance {{may appear}} superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger {{and they are}} <b>more</b> randomly <b>tipped</b> rather than hand placed.|$|R
2500|$|Minas Morgul, the Staircase and Tower of Cirith Ungol {{as well as}} Shelob's Lair were {{designed}} by Howe, with the Morgul road using forced perspective into a bluescreened miniature. Howe's design of Minas Morgul was inspired {{from the experience of}} having a wisdom tooth pulled out: in the same way, the Orcs have put their twisted designs on to a former Gondorian city. Cirith Ungol was based on Tolkien's design, but when Richard Taylor felt it as [...] "boring", it was redesigned with <b>more</b> <b>tipping</b> angles. The interior set, like Minas Tirith, was built as a few multiple levels that numerous camera takes would suggest a larger structure.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, Christian Dior {{introduced}} the wide-brimmed Breton - {{also known as}} the padre hat - for its resemblance to ecclesiastical headgear. Unlike the <b>more</b> traditional <b>tipped</b> back Breton, this model was worn flat on the head.|$|R
50|$|In the servicescape model, a {{moderator}} {{is anything}} {{that changes the}} standard stimulus-response emotional states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the mediator explains the response behaviour, typically in terms of internal responses (cognitive, emotional and physiological responses). The consumer's response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational {{factors such as the}} purpose or reason for being in the environment. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means <b>more</b> <b>tips.</b> Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.|$|E
50|$|In another example, the hypha {{generates a}} vector field {{parallel}} to the hyphal axis, and the tips tend to turn parallel to that field. After <b>more</b> <b>tips</b> turn in the same direction, their hyphae form a stronger directional field. In this way, {{it is possible to}} observe spontaneous orientation of growing hypha in a single direction, which simulates the strands, cords and rhizomorphs produced by many species of fungi in nature.The parameters under which the model operates can be changed during its execution. This allows a greater variety of structures to be formed (including mushroom - like shapes) and may be supposed to simulate cases where the growth strategy depends on an internal biological clock.The Neighbour-Sensing model explains how various fungal structures may arise because of the â€˜crowd behaviourâ€™ of the community of hyphal tips that make up the mycelium.|$|E
