50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{sympathetic}} nervous system responds to the emergency of the closed larynx. Among other things, it constricts much of the body's vasculature. This vasoconstriction increases the blood pressure against which the left ventricle <b>must</b> <b>pump,</b> and may cause enough backpressure to ripple back through the left ventricle, into the left atrium, and into the pulmonary vasculature. This additional pressure on the blood in the lungs' blood vessels exacerbates the edema described above.|$|E
50|$|The Auerglass Organ is a two-person {{tracker action}} pump organ {{conceived}} by Tauba Auerbach and Cameron Mesirow (also known as Glasser) and constructed by Parson's Pipe Organs in Canandaigua, NY. Each player has a keyboard with alternating notes of a four octave scale. The instrument cannot be played alone because each player <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> to supply wind {{to the other}} player’s notes. Auerbach and Mesirow composed and performed {{a piece of music}} on the Auerglass in 2009. The instrument is now in residence at Future-Past studio in Hudson, New York.|$|E

50|$|The left-to-right {{shunting}} {{of blood}} results in abnormally high blood flow and pressure {{directed to the}} right heart circulation, gradually leading to maladaptive changes that ultimately result in pulmonary hypertension. Increased right-sided blood volume and pressure causes a cascade of pathologic damage to the delicate pulmonary capillaries, causing them to be incrementally replaced with scar tissue. Scar (dead lung tissue) does not contribute to oxygen transfer, therefore decreasing the useful volume of the pulmonary vasculature. The scar tissue also provides less flexibility and compliance than normal lung tissue, causing further increases in pulmonary blood pressure, and the weakened heart <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> harder to continue supplying the lungs, leading to damage of more capillaries. It is because of this maladaptive response that {{at the onset of}} Eisenmenger's syndrome, the damage is considered irreversible, even if the underlying heart defect is corrected after the fact.|$|E
50|$|The {{mass flow}} through the engine is {{determined}} by the rotation rate of the engine, multiplied by the displacement of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed -RPM- in a vehicle or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see variable displacement). Restricting the input flow reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of engine drag (see engine braking), as the engine <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).|$|E
50|$|The loss of {{hemoglobin}} {{was initially}} {{believed to be}} an adaptation to the extreme cold as the lack of hemoglobin and red blood cells decreases blood viscosity, which is an adaptation that has been seen in species adapted to cold climates. However, current analysis {{has shown that the}} lack of hemoglobin, while not lethal, is not adaptive. Any adaptive advantages incurred by reduced blood viscosity are outweighed by the fact that icefishes <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> much more blood per unit of time so as {{to make up for the}} reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of their blood. The high blood volume of icefishes is itself evidence that the loss of hemoglobin and myoglobin was not advantageous for the ancestor of the icefishes. Their unusual cardiovascular physiology, including large heart, high blood volume, increased mitochondrial density, and extensive microvasculature, suggests that icefishes have had to evolve ways of coping with damages to their impaired oxygen-binding and transport systems.|$|E

50|$|Two broods {{generally}} hatch {{each year}} throughout the United States, one {{in early spring}} and one in late summer. The moths eclose and then <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> their wings with fluid (hemolymph) to extend them. The females emit pheromones, which the male can detect through his large, plumose antennae. Males can fly for miles to reach a female. After the moths mate, the female spends {{the majority of the}} remainder of her life laying eggs, while the male may mate several more times. Adults of this family of moths have vestigial mouths, meaning their mouth parts have been reduced. Because of this, they do not eat and only live as adults for less than one week.In captivity, this moth is much more difficult to breed than other American saturnids such as the cecropia, promethea, or luna. Kept in a cage, the male and female tend to ignore each other, unless a food plant (particularly oak leaves) is present.|$|E

5000|$|In medicine, {{nitroglycerin}} {{is used as}} {{a medicine}} for angina pectoris, a painful symptom of ischemic heart disease caused by inadequate flow of blood and oxygen to the heart and as a potent antihypertensive agent. Nitroglycerin corrects the imbalance between the flow of oxygen and blood to the heart. [...] At low doses, nitroglycerin will dilate veins more than arteries, thereby reducing preload (volume of blood in the heart after filling); this is thought to be its primary mechanism of action. By decreasing preload, the heart has less blood to pump which decreases oxygen requirement since the heart doesn't have to work as hard. Additionally, having a smaller preload reduces the ventricular transmural pressure (pressure exerted {{on the walls of the}} heart), which decreases the compression of heart arteries to allow more blood to flow through the heart. At higher doses, it also dilates arteries, thereby reducing afterload (decreasing the pressure against which the heart <b>must</b> <b>pump).</b> Improved myocardial oxygen demand vs oxygen delivery ratio leads to the following therapeutic effects during episodes of angina pectoris: subsiding of chest pain, decrease of blood pressure, increase of heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension. Patients experiencing angina when doing certain physical activities can often prevent symptoms by taking nitroglycerin 5 to 10 minutes before the activity.|$|E

40|$|The {{systemic}} circulation offers larger {{resistance to}} the blood flow than the pulmonary system. Consequently, the left ventricle (LV) <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> blood with more force than the right ventricle (RV). The question arises whether the stronger pumping action of the LV {{is due to a}} more efficient action of left ventricular myosin, or whether it is due to the morphological differences between ventricles. Such a question cannot be answered by studying the entire ventricles or myocytes because any observed differences would be wiped out by averaging the information obtained from trillions of myosin molecules present in a ventricle or myocyte. We therefore searched for the differences between single myosin molecules of the LV and RV of failing hearts In-situ. We show that the parameters that define the mechanical characteristics of working myosin (kinetic rates and the distribution of spatial orientation of myosin lever arm) were the same in both ventricles. These results suggest that there is no difference in the way myosin interacts with thin filaments in myocytes of failing hearts, and suggests that the difference in pumping efficiencies are caused by interactions between muscle proteins other than myosin or that they are purely morphological...|$|E

40|$|Bright AGN {{frequently}} show ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with outflow velocities vout ~ 0. 1 c. These outflows may be {{the source}} of AGN feedback on their host galaxies sought by galaxy formation modellers. The exact effect of the outflows on the ambient galaxy gas strongly depends on whether the shocked UFOs cool rapidly or not. This in turn depends on whether the shocked electrons share the same temperature as ions (one temperature regime; 1 T) or decouple (2 T), as has been recently suggested. Here we calculate the Inverse Compton spectrum emitted by such shocks, finding a broad feature potentially detectable either in mid-to-high energy X-rays (1 T case) or only in the soft X-rays (2 T). We argue that current observations of AGN do not seem to show evidence for the 1 T component. The limits on the 2 T emission are far weaker, and in fact {{it is possible that the}} observed soft X-ray excess of AGN is partially or fully due to the 2 T shock emission. This suggests that UFOs are in the energy-driven regime outside the central few pc, and <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> considerable amounts of not only momentum but also energy into the ambient gas. We encourage X-ray observers to look for the Inverse Compton components calculated here in order to constrain AGN feedback models further.

40|$|For {{many rural}} communities, {{treating}} domestic wastewater efficiently and cost-effectively is a challenging task. Environmental issues, financing of construction costs, and the bottom-line {{cost to the}} consumer complicate this effort. Increasingly stringent discharge standards {{have resulted in a}} growing number of permit violations from small, “conventional ” treatment systems. Many rural communities have discovered that their existing systems (e. g., facultative lagoons) provided excellent service in the past but have become obsolete due to new discharge standards. These communities simply cannot afford to own and operate the highly sophisticated tertiary treatment facilities these new regulations require. As a result, funding agencies have looked more favorably to “regional” solutions that can achieve consistent, high-quality discharge. In most cases, the regional solution is a centralized treatment facility to which surrounding communities pump their sewage. In many instances, communities <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> extremely long distances to reach the regional treatment facility. This means that communities, and, therefore, funding agencies, are putting most of their money into pumps and piping instead of treatment. What small rural communities need is a decentralized wastewater treatment system that is inexpensive to construct, simple to operate, and achieves consistently high levels of discharge quality, even with small flows. Having such a system would allow a paradigm shift whereby funding agencies could support decentralized treatment and regional management of numerous decentralized treatment systems...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} in {{domestic}} pig breeding {{has been to}} {{increase the size of}} litters resulting in variation in birth weight of piglets. Pig breeding has also resulted in increased body muscle mass. Muscles with the same size can consist either of large number of thin muscle fibres or small number of thick muscle fibres. Larger body muscle content means that in living animal the heart <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> blood to larger muscle mass than earlier. Our interest in {{this study was to investigate}} the relationship between the pigs birth weight and (i) growth performance and carcass composition, (ii) the size of organs, and (iii) the mean muscle fibre cross-sectional area at slaughter. The study consisted of twenty pigs slaughtered at the age of 165 ± 2 days. The day after the slaughter, the carcass composition was determined by dissecting the chilled carcass into lean, fat, bones, and skin and organs were weighed. The average cross sectional area of muscle fibres was determined from three fast-twitch muscles longissimus dorsi, semimembranosus, gluteus superficialis, and two slow-twitch muscles infraspinatus and masseter. The birth weight of pigs ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 2 kg. We found no clear relationships between the birth weight and the pigs growth performance from birth to slaughter. When the birth weight increased the heart weight at slaughter increased as well (P < 0. 01). The heart weight was higher in those pigs with high carcass weight (P < 0. 05) and with the high weight of total muscle mass in the carcass (P < 0. 001). The cross sectional area of muscle fibres in M. longissimus dorsi (P < 0. 05), M. semimembranosus (P < 0. 10), and M. gluteus superficialis (P < 0. 05) was larger in those pigs with low birth weight compared to those found in pigs with high birth weight. ...|$|E
