This limit also meant that the reactors had to be very large in order to reach any given power level, which was further amplified by the use of gas for cooling, as the low thermal capacity of the fluid required very high flow rates.|$|R
40|$|A diverse {{range of}} wastes are {{generated}} from reprocessing spent light water reactor (LWR), advanced gas cooled reactor (AGR) and magnesium alloy (<b>Magnox)</b> <b>clad</b> uranium <b>fuels.</b> Much of this waste has a high beta gamma activity due {{to the presence of}} activation products and residues of spent fuel. As the processes for treatment and storage of the waste have evolved, so has the radiometric instrumentation used to monitor it. The requirements of national regulators and repository operators are becoming increasingly stringent in terms of the degree of characterisation of waste products prior to ultimate disposal. BNFL Instruments Ltd has developed several generations of radiometric instrumentation to produce accurate and reliable measurements on current arisings of the waste as it is generated. These systems use high integrity software to generate a valid inventory for individual waste products as well as providing useful process control information and ensuring criticality safety. Similar measurement systems are also required for the characterisation of historic wastes which will soon be retrieved from storage facilities. These measurements present a greater challenge due to the highly variable nature of the materials and the length of storage (up to 40 years). Solutions have been developed based on the operational experience gained from process measurements. All systems are designed such that they are capable of providing fully reproducible and meaningful measurements within a plant environment...|$|R

This short note {{traces the}} {{events that led to}} the unsymmetric rank one formula known as the “good Broyden ” update [5, 6], which is widely used within derivative-free {{mathematical}} software for solving a system of nonlinear equations. I left University in 1956 with an indifferent degree in Physics and took up a post with the English Electric Company in Leicester. The company was involved in the design and construction of nuclear reactors and I was employed as a computer programmer. One of the problems with which I was concerned was the solution of systems of differential equations. These equations were used in the performance calculations of the reactors and modelled their behaviour as time passed, and some of the favoured methods of solution were the “predictor-corrector ” methods. They worked roughly as follows. Given a temperature distribution at time t they would calculate the equivalent distribution at time t C t where t was a small time increment. This calculation would then be repeated many times {{in the hope that the}} computed temperature would subside before the <b>Magnox</b> <b>cladding</b> of the <b>fuel</b> rods melted.

A combination of the COSMO continuum solvation model and one or two shells of explicit water molecules is employed. Inclusion of only a single explicit solvation shell is unsatisfactory; open regions are present in the strontium coordination shell which would not exist in real aqueous complexes, and many optimised structures possess unavoidable energetic instabilities. Incorporation of a second shell of explicit waters, however, yields energetically minimal structures without open regions in the first strontium coordination shell. The most stable systems with one, two or three hydroxide ions are all 6 -coordinated with a distorted trigonal antiprismatic geometry, whereas systems with four OH− ions have a most stable coordination number of five. Transformation, via a proton transfer mechanism, from one coordination mode to another (e. g. from a system with two hydroxides bound directly to the strontium to one in which a hydroxide ion migrates into the second coordination shell) is found to be energetically facile. It is concluded that the most likely strontium-hydroxide complexes to be found in high pH aqueous solutions are mono- and dihydroxides, and that these coexist...|$|R

While the San Onofre 1 plant has maintained this record, the Connecticut Yankee station has experienced a number of fuel element failures since 1977. Consequently, emphasis has been placed on cladding behavior for anomalous operation experienced by the Connecticut Yankee reactor prior to its first observed coolant activity increase. In order to predict <b>cladding</b> behavior, a <b>fuel</b> performance code (STRESS) has been developed with the capabilities of analyzing long term cladding creepdown behavior, cladding conditioning, and behavior during up-power ramping and power maneuvers.

Since the middles of the 60 ’s decade the General Atomics, supplier of the TRIGA reactor, discontinued the fabrication of such aluminum <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements. In order to upgrade the IPR-R 1 reactor power, nine stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements were purchased in 1971. One of these fuel elements was instrumented in the centerline with three type K thermocouples. On December 2000, four of these stainless steel <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> elements were placed into the core allowing to uprate the nominal power to 250 kW steady state. In 2004 the instrumented fuel element (IF) was inserted into the core hottest position, predicted by neutronic calculations. The IF stayed in this position up to 2007, allowing heat transfer investigations in several operating powers, including the maximum power of 250 kW. During this time it also monitored the core temperature in all operations.

These assemblies house <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> pellets containing enriched fuel. Irradiation studies of these assemblies in the NASA Plum Brook Reactor will provide data required for the desigi of thermionic converter reactors being considered by NASA. Three major objectives were defined at the initiation of this project at Battelle. These were (1) to provide containment vessel assemblies for irradiation studies, (2) to identify the best fuel dispersion/cladding combination for the fueled pellets, and (3) to identify and optimize the most promising fabrication technique to the extent necessary to provide reproducible specimens. In addition to these major objectives, other goals were defined in relation to supporting studies required for the successful conclusion of this program. The approach for accomplishing these objectives involved the cooperation of various research and research support groups at Battelle. These groups contributed to the overall program by involvement in the following areas: (1) Preparation or procurement of various types of UO{sub 2 } fuel particles; (2) Application of tungsten coating to the fuel particles; (3) Development of various powder-consolidation techniques for the fuel form including use of explosive methods and hot isostatic pressing; (4) Selection and evaluation of high-temperature claddings for the fuel form; (5) Development of techniques for cladding application to the fuel form; (6) Evaluation of candidate systems by thermal cycling; (7) Fabrication of irradiation containment vessels and the associated components; and (8) Conduction of appropriate supporting studies associated with welding and brazing of the containment vessel components.

The <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> integrity SL is set such that no significant fuel damage is calculated to occur if the limit is not violated. Because fuel damage {{is not directly}} observable, a stepback approach is used to establish an SL. such that the MCPR {{is not less than}} the limit specified in Specification 2. 1. 1. 2. MCPR greater than the specified limit represents a conservative margin relative to the conditions required to maintain <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> integrity. The <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> is one of the physical barriers that separate the radioactive materials from the environs. The integrity of this cladding barrier is related to its relative freedom from perforations or cracking. Although some corrosion or use related cracking may occur during the life of the cladding, fission product migration from this source is incrementally cumulative and continuously measurable. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> perforations, however, can result from thermal stresses, which occur from reactor operation significantly above design conditions. While fission product migration from cladding perforation is just as measurable as that from use related cracking, the thermally caused cladding perforations signal a threshold beyond which still greater thermal stresses may cause gross, rather than incremental, cladding deterioration. Therefore, the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> SL is defined with a margin to the conditions that would produce onset of transition boiling (i. e [...] MCPR = 1. 00). These conditions represent a significant departure from the condition intended by design for planned operation.
