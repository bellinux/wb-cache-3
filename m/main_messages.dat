40|$|Modern {{sponsored}} search auctions {{are derived}} from the Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction. Although the GSP auction is not truthful, results by Edelman, Ostrovsky, and Schwarz [7] and Varian [13] give senses in which its outcome is equivalent {{to that of the}} truthful and welfaremaximizing VCG mechanism. The first <b>main</b> <b>message</b> of this paper is that these properties are not unique to the GSP auction: there is a large class of payment rules that, when coupled with the rank-by-bid allocation rule, induce sponsored search auctions with comparable guarantees. The second <b>main</b> <b>message</b> is that the GSP auction is “optimally simple”, subject to possessing a welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium, when the complexity of a payment rule is measured using the dependencies between bids and slot prices...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1945-1948 Zvi {{continues}} to write stories with the <b>main</b> <b>messages</b> of Jewish Holocaust and World War II. This activity is ever risky and the Stalin regime withholds {{as much information}} on Jewish war suffering due to increasing antisemitism in the Soviet Union.

An {{example of this is}} found in the story [...] "Shaddai" [...] (1945) where a talisman with that word is a key device in the plot. Other characters in stories of this time return to the faith of their forefathers when faced with war and terror.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} publication was loosely {{put together}} and hastily printed by Doubleday, Page. Nevertheless, it sold well in 1927 and has remained in print ever since. In 1994, Ray Silverman, a Swedenborgian minister and literary scholar, thoroughly revised and edited My Religion, organizing the eight unwieldy {{sections of the}} first edition into twelve distinct chapters with subheadings to clarify their contents.

Other revisions included modernization of several words and phrases, substitution of inclusive language where appropriate, correction of spelling and typographical errors, alteration of punctuation to conform to modern standards, and emendation of a few historical inaccuracies. Extra paragraph breaks were added and a very few passages that distracted from the <b>main</b> <b>messages</b> were delicately pruned.
