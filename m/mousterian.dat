5|$|Chipped {{stone tools}} found at Zemun {{show that the}} area around Belgrade was {{inhabited}} by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools belong to the <b>Mousterian</b> industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{for human}} {{occupation}} of the Zagros reaches back into the Lower Palaeolithic, {{as evidenced by the}} discovery of many cave-sites dating to that period in the Iranian part of the mountain range. Middle Palaeolithic stone tool assemblages are known from Barda Balka, a cave-site south of the Little Zab; and from the Iranian Zagros. A <b>Mousterian</b> stone tool assemblage – produced by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans – was recently excavated in Arbil. Neanderthals also occupied the site of Shanidar. This cave-site, located in the Sapna Valley, has yielded a settlement sequence stretching from the Middle Palaeolithic up to the Epipalaeolithic period. The site is particularly well known for its Neanderthal burials. The Epipalaeolithic occupation of Shanidar, contemporary {{with the use of the}} Kebaran stone tool assemblage, is the oldest evidence for anatomically modern human {{occupation of the}} Great Zab basin. The following Protoneolithic, or Natufian, occupation is contemporary with the oldest occupation of the nearby open-air site Zawi Chemi Shanidar. M'lefaat on the Khazir River (a tributary to the Great Zab) was a small village of hunter-gatherers dating to the 10th millennium BCE that was contemporary with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A in the Levant. An archaeological survey of the Citadel of Arbil, in the plain south of the lower course of the Great Zab, has shown that this site was continuously occupied at least from the 6th millennium BCE upward.|$|E

These deposits, generally ignored, are perfectly suitable material for micro-chronological study of hominine activities in a site. In Grotte Mandrin (Mediterranean France) microscopic observation revealed parietal sooted crusts kept track of many occupations, which can be linked with archaeological units. Minimum Number of Occupations and occupations chronicles can be built out of these crusts. MNO, usually high, attest of the cumulative nature of each archaeological unit. This pioneering study shows that sooted concretions analysis provides high temporal resolution archaeology and allows here to rethink the MP/UP transition with an unmatched temporal resolution.

40|$|In Central-Southern Italy several cave sites yielded {{deposits}} {{dating back}} to MIS 3 and containing a Mousterian/Uluzzian/Proto-Aurignacian sequence. Changes within these sequences are synthetically examined {{on the basis of}} the main stratified sites. Topics like subsistence strategies, raw material procurement, territory exploitation, production and behavioural activities and migratory movements are discussed. The Uluzzians can be considered, in many respects, economically and behaviourally closer to the Proto-Aurignacians than to the <b>Mousterians.</b> This pattern fully agrees with the recent attribution to AMH of two deciduous teeth from the Uluzzian layers of Grotta del Cavallo (Lecce, Southern Italy) (Benazzi et al., 2011). Such a new insight directly involves the problem of the origin of the Uluzzian techno-complex. By integrating archaeological, genetic and demographic data, the hypothesis of a dispersal from an East African source into Europe, through the so-called Southern route, is proposed. As for Southern Italy, the available data allow the authors to assume that relationships between the indigenous Neandertals and the newcomers were most probably sporadic, given the possibly low demographic density of these populations and the limited time span of co-existence...|$|R
25|$|Mode 3 {{technology}} emerged {{towards the}} end of Acheulean dominance and involved the Levallois technique, most famously exploited by the <b>Mousterian</b> industry. Transitional tool forms between the two are called <b>Mousterian</b> of Acheulean Tradition, or MTA types.

Within the 15-metre (50 ft) terrace was developed Acheulean. Originally reported as Early <b>Mousterian</b> but since changed to Levalloisean, other implements were located in the 10-metre (30 ft) terrace. The 4.5- and 3-metre (15-10 ft) terraces saw a more developed version of the Levalloisean, also initially reported as an Egyptian version of <b>Mousterian.</b> Finally, tools of the Egyptian Sebilian technology and an Egyptian version of the Aterian technology were also located.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoot marks, {{witnesses}} of past human activities, {{can sometimes}} be noticed in concretions (speleothem, travertine, carbonated crust, etc.) formed in cavities. We demonstrate here that these deposits, generally ignored in archaeological studies, {{turned out to be}} a perfectly suitable material for micro-chronological study of hominin activities in a site. At the Grotte Mandrin (Mediterranean France), thousands of clastic fragments from the rock walls were found in every archaeological level of the shelter. Calcareous crusts containing soot deposits are recorded on some of their surfaces. They appear in thin section as thin black laminae. Microscopic observation of these crusts revealed that they kept track of many occupations. We show that is possible to link them with the archaeological units identified during the excavation. Minimum Number of Occupations (MNO) can be built out of these sooted crusts. MNO are usually high and attest to the cumulative nature of each archaeological unit. They are witnesses of each occupation of hominin groups in each archaeological level of the cave. This study also shows that, in Grotte Mandrin, a very short time separates the first Middle/Upper Paleolithic transitional groups' occupations from those of the last <b>Mousterians.</b> The research perspectives on soot deposits are diversified and raise the possibility of studying multiple aspects of past human life, and in this case, to rethink the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition, with an unmatched temporal resolution.

40|$|This podium {{presentation}} won {{the best}} student presentation award (sponsored by the Journal of Human Evolution) Full presentation (15 minutes) International audienceSoot deposits trapped in concretions (speleothems, travertines, carbonated crusts, etc.) are witnesses of human occupations in cavities. We developed an analytical methodology whereby soot deposits {{can be counted}} and their position in concretion can be documented, allowing identification of seasons of occupation in the cavity. These researches show that sooted concretions analysis enables the development of high temporal resolution archaeology, just like dendrochronology does for more recent periods. There is a real possibility for extending this pioneering study to cavities {{of all ages and}} areas, from Lower Palaeolithic, with the first traces of fire, to medieval or even modern times. Results have different implications depending on the concerned contexts. One of the major areas of application is hominine’s mobility study, since sooted concretions {{turned out to be a}} perfectly suitable material for micro-chronologic studies with an unexpected high temporal resolution. At the Grotte Mandrin rock shelter (Drôme, France), thousands of clastic fragments from the walls were found in each archaeological level. Their surfaces sometimes wear calcrete crusts containing soot deposits, which appear as thin black laminae. Microscopic observation of these crusts revealed that they kept track of many hominine occupations. It is possible to link them with the archaeological units identified during the excavation. The MNO (Minimum Number of Occupations) are usually high and correspond to each archaeological layer. They attest of the cumulative nature of those units and provide data on the mobility level of the past hominine groups whom occupied the rock shelter. The positions of soot films in concretions with annual lamination can also provide information about the dynamics of occupation of the cavity by past societies. This study shows also that a very short time separates the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transitional groups’ occupations from those of thelast <b>Mousterians</b> in Grotte Mandrin. The research perspectives on soot deposits are diversified and raise the possibility to study past human groups, and in this case to rethink the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition with an unmatched temporal resolution. Presentation will focus on methodological questions, first results in Grotte Mandrin and their implications...|$|R

25|$|Nearly 4000 lithic tools {{have been}} {{recovered}} from Okladnikov Cave. <b>Mousterian</b> artefacts are found throughout all seven layers.

25|$|Nucleiform bifaces—It is {{difficult}} to distinguish a true biface from a core with modified edges that was occasionally used as a tool.

25|$|In {{the four}} {{divisions}} of prehistoric stone-working, Acheulean artefacts {{are classified as}} Mode 2, meaning they are more advanced than the (usually earlier) Mode 1 tools of the Clactonian or Oldowan/Abbevillian industries but lacking the sophistication of the (usually later) Mode 3 Middle Palaeolithic technology, exemplified by the <b>Mousterian</b> industry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mousterian</b> {{deposits}} {{found at}} Gorham's Cave, which {{are associated with}} Neanderthals in Europe, have been dated to as recently as 28,000 to 24,000 BP, leading to suggestions that Gibraltar {{was one of the}} last places of Neanderthal habitation. Modern humans apparently visited the Gibraltar area in prehistoric times after the Neanderthal occupancy.|$|E
25|$|Along with stone, {{clay and}} animal parts, wood {{was one of}} the first {{materials}} worked by early humans.

25|$|Kebara 2 (or KMH2) is a 60,000 year-old Levantine Neanderthal mid-body male skeleton. It was {{discovered}} in 1983 by Ofer Bar-Yosef, Baruch Arensburg, and Bernard Vandermeersch in a <b>Mousterian</b> layer of Kebara Cave, Israel. To the excavators, its disposition suggested it had been deliberately buried, though like every other putative Middle Palaeolithic intentional burial, this has been questioned.|$|E
25|$|Okladnikov Cave {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied Paleolithic sites in the Altai-Sayan region. A rich <b>Mousterian</b> stone industry, dating to between 33,000 and 44,000 years ago, was discovered, as well as several highly fragmented hominin fossils. Along with a few other Neanderthal sites in the Altai-Sayan region, Okladnikov Cave contains fossil evidence for one of the most easterly confirmed sites with Neanderthal presence.|$|E
25|$|The apogee of {{hand axe}} {{manufacture}} {{took place in}} a wide area of the Old World, especially during the Riss glaciation, in a cultural complex that can be described as cosmopolitan and which is known as the Acheulean. The use of hand axes survived the Middle Palaeolithic in a much smaller area and were especially important during the <b>Mousterian,</b> up {{to the middle of the}} Last glacial period.|$|E
25|$|Hand axes {{found in}} Africa come {{from both the}} Aterian culture of North Africa and the Stillbay culture from East Africa. Both these cases relate to <b>Mousterian</b> cultures, {{although}} they are relatively late and have their own style, {{at the end of}} the so-called African Middle Stone Age. In both cases a variety of objects are found, triangular, oval and other leaf-point. Hand axes and unifaces also came from other cultures.|$|E
25|$|Misliya Cave, {{southwest}} of Mt. Carmel, has been excavated by teams of anthropologists and archaeologists from the Archaeology Department of the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University since 2001. In 2007, they unearthed artifacts indicative {{of what could}} be the earliest known prehistoric man. The teams uncovered hand-held stone tools and blades as well as animal bones, dating to 250,000 years ago, {{at the time of the}} <b>Mousterian</b> culture of Neanderthals in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Paleolithic stone tool industry, the Oldowan, began around 2.6million years ago. It contained {{tools such}} as choppers, burins, and stitching awls. It was completely replaced around 250,000 {{years ago by the}} more complex Acheulean industry, which was first conceived by Homo ergaster around 1.8–1.65million years ago. The Acheulean implements completely vanish from the archaeological record around 100,000 years ago and were replaced by more complex Middle Paleolithic tool kits such as the <b>Mousterian</b> and the Aterian industries.|$|E
25|$|Older hand axes were {{produced}} by direct percussion with a stone hammer {{and can be}} distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. <b>Mousterian</b> hand axes {{were produced}} with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border. An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe {{can be made from}} a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Excavation of {{this site}} has {{resulted}} in the discovery of four layers of stratigraphy. Level I has produced evidence for eighth to third centuries BC use by Phoenicians. Below that, level II produced evidence for brief Neolithic use. Level III has yielded at least 240 Upper Paleolithic artefacts of Magdalenian and Solutrean origin. Level IV has produced 103 items, including spear-points, knives, and scraping devices that are identified as <b>Mousterian,</b> and shows repeated use over thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} study in 1925, Paolo Graziosi {{attributed}} the figurine to the Upper Paleolithic. His conclusion was {{in contrast with}} the mainstream opinion at the time, when most of the Italian academics didn't recognize an Italian Upper Paleolithic, rather opting for a direct transition between the late <b>Mousterian</b> and the Neolithic periods. Indeed, a group of archaeologists led by Ugo Antonielli, the Director of the Pigorini Museum, compared the figurine with others Venuses dated to the Neolithic, concluding that the Venus of Savignano must have been dated to the Neolithic too.|$|E
25|$|Some 590 worked flint {{artefacts}} {{consisting of}} number of handaxes (pointed, subcordiform, cordiform, ovate and bout coupé forms), three cores {{and a number}} of retouched, utilised and waste flakes were individually recorded with over 1,000 pieces of microdebitage recovered from the 0.50 m2 spit units. A number of the handaxes and flakes were found in direct association with bones and/or tusks. The artefacts are generally fresh and relatively sharp with minimal abrasion or post-depositional edge damage. Typologically the assemblage falls within the <b>Mousterian</b> of Acheulean Tradition (MTA) facies of the Middle Palaeolithic.|$|E
25|$|Accelerator mass {{spectrometry}} (AMS) dating gives dates for level IV of between 33 and 23 thousand {{years before the}} present (kyr BP)—the researchers felt that the uncertainties at this time depth made calibration impractical. They suggest occupation until at least 28 kyr BP and possibly 24 kyr BP. No fossil remains have been found that would allow identification pointing to either Neanderthal or anatomically modern human inhabitants, nor associated with findings of a modern human in a site at nearby Abrigo do Lagar Velho, Portugal of 24,500 years ago who may have featured Neanderthal genetic admixtures, although <b>Mousterian</b> culture normally is identified with Neanderthals in Europe.|$|E
25|$|A {{hand axe}} (or handaxe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two faces {{that is the}} longest-used tool in human history. It is usually made from flint or chert. It is {{characteristic}} of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (<b>Mousterian)</b> periods. Its technical name (biface) {{comes from the fact}} that the archetypical model is generally bifacial Lithic flake and almond-shaped (amygdaloidal). Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} archaeological {{artifacts in}} Iran {{were found in}} the Kashafrud and Ganj Par sites that are thought to date back to 100,000 years ago in the Middle Paleolithic. <b>Mousterian</b> stone tools made by Neandertals have also been found. There are more cultural remains of Neandertals dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period, which mainly have been found in the Zagros region and fewer in central Iran at sites such as Kobeh, Kunji, Bisitun Cave, Tamtama, Warwasi, and Yafteh Cave. In 1949, a Neanderthal radius was discovered by Carleton S. Coon in Bisitun Cave. Evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods are known mainly from the Zagros Mountains in the caves of Kermanshah and Khorramabad and a few number of sites in the Alborz and Central Iran. During this time, people began creating rock art.|$|E
25|$|Working {{with a soft}} hammer {{allows a}} knapper greater control of the knapping and reduces waste of the raw material, {{allowing}} the production of longer, sharper, more uniform edges that will increase the tool's working life. Hand axes made with a soft hammer are usually more symmetrical and smooth, with rectilinear edges and shallow indentations that are broad and smooth {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish where one flake starts and another ends. They generally have a regular biconvex cross-section and the intersection of the two faces forms an edge with an acute angle, usually of around 30°. They were worked with great skill and therefore they are more aesthetically attractive. They are usually associated with periods of highly developed tool making such as the Micoquien or the <b>Mousterian.</b> Soft hammer manufacturing is not reliable as the sole dating method.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} {{resources}} {{consumed by the}} Neanderthals seems to have remained constant throughout the 100,000 years of their occupation, as did their tools; as they did not face changes to their local environment, they {{had no need to}} develop new technologies, unlike the northern Neanderthals. This technological stasis is clearly visible from the artefacts found in Gibraltar. The newest Neanderthal tools to have been found there are virtually identical to the oldest, all exclusively being examples of the <b>Mousterian</b> type of flint tools that were first developed around 300,000 years ago. The Neanderthals even used the same hearth in Gorham's Cave for over 8,000 years. Animal bones from the vicinity show that the Neanderthals used the caves for cooking and butchery, as is apparent from the presence of bones which are burnt or have cut marks from Neanderthal stone knives.|$|E
25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated <b>Mousterian,</b> as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E
