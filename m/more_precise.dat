5|$|Although Fleming did not {{date the}} event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have {{identified}} different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put {{the events of}} Dr. No in 1956; Griswold is <b>more</b> <b>precise,</b> and considers the story {{to have taken place}} in February and March of that year.|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming {{provides}} no dates within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole.

5|$|Between 1979 and 1981, it was {{estimated}} that Mups are encoded by a gene family of between 15 and 35 genes and pseudogenes in the mouse and by an estimated 20 genes in the rat. In 2008 a <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> number of Mup genes in a range of species was determined by analyzing the DNA sequence of whole genomes.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} theory {{increased}} {{through the end of}} the 1940s. Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, now known as the Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron. These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.|$|E
5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to defend. A {{defending}} mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake. Thus, the defender needs to be <b>more</b> <b>precise,</b> which in turn {{can lead to a}} time advantage for the attacker.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} counting techniques, {{for example}} counting cosets, yield <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> statements about finite groups: Lagrange's Theorem states {{that for a}} finite group G the order of any finite subgroup H divides the order of G. The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.|$|E
50|$|CHKO Beskydy was {{declared}} on 5 March 1973 {{to protect the}} unique natural features of the area, namely well-preserved primeval forests, species rich meadows and pastures and pseudo-karst elements but also the aesthetic value of the area which is typical for its diversity of habitats developed over the centuries of human settlement: ridge-top meadows and pastures and hamlets scatterd throughout the area. Many rare and protected plants and animals {{can be found in}} CHKO Beskydy: there has been a stable population of lynxes and bears and wolves regularly cross from Slovakia. As declared the area is 1160 km2, though <b>more</b> <b>precised</b> figure 1196.96 km2 was obtained using GIS resources.|$|R

5|$|Visible light waves {{oscillate}} {{faster than}} microwaves, and therefore optical clocks can be <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> than caesium atomic clocks. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt {{is working on}} several such optical clocks. The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate. The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E

40|$|Platelet {{counting}} {{is a daily}} basic hematological {{analysis of}} crucial interest in many clinical situations. Historical manual techniques (phase-contrast microscopy) {{have been replaced by}} automated techniques (impedance or optical analyzers) <b>more</b> rapid and <b>precise.</b> <b>More</b> recently, flow cytometry techniques using labeled monoclonal antibodies have been proposed as reference techniques. Nevertheless, pre-analytical and analytical variables should be respected to obtain reliable results and avoid validation pitfalls...|$|R
30|$|Coupled {{electrophysiological}} {{recording and}} transcriptome analyses {{on the same}} single neurons provided much <b>more</b> <b>précised</b> information on gene transcription programs of neurons with very specific electrophysiological functional properties. Such “patch-seq” technology effectively assisted identification of gene programs underlying neuronal maturation as judged by electrophysiological characteristics. It is comforting to discover that our cultured neurons derived from various human stem cell populations revealed a similar maturation program as that revealed by comparing human adult and fetal neurons in the brain, which indirectly reflected neuronal maturity. The 39 genes especially the 10 or so above highlighted genes may be particularly useful {{in the future to}} serve as generic biomarkers for evaluation of neuronal maturity.|$|R
5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> finished product.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{accepts a}} 32-bit floating-point number as the input and stores a halved value for later use. Then, treating the bits representing the floating-point number as a 32-bit integer, a logical shift right by one bit is performed {{and the result}} subtracted from the magic number 0x5F3759DF. This is the first approximation of the inverse square root of the input. Treating the bits again as a floating-point number, it runs one iteration of Newton's method, yielding a <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> approximation.|$|E
5000|$|This {{structure}} was later named an MPEG program stream: [...] "The MPEG-1 Systems design is essentially {{identical to the}} MPEG-2 Program Stream structure." [...] This terminology is <b>more</b> popular, <b>precise</b> (differentiates it from an MPEG transport stream) and will be used here.|$|R
50|$|The “defensive complex” {{southwest}} of Bubach {{is all that}} remains of a mediaeval motte-and-bailey castle. Anything <b>more</b> historically <b>precise</b> than that about this place is unknown. It is, however, a nearly square castle hill measuring roughly 30 × 30 m girded by a round wall.|$|R
50|$|Software {{has been}} {{described}} as Slick's attempt to assimilate with the techno-pop artists of the period. Guitar use is largely replaced by synthesizers and electric drums. Slick's trademark wailing vocals and improvising is replaced by <b>more</b> short, <b>precise</b> bursts. The album failed to chart.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} scientific {{models of}} the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at {{the centre of the}} Universe. Over the centuries, <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{galaxy is}} {{inclined}} an estimated 77° {{relative to the}} Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> distances and radial velocities are required.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{intelligent}} homes are quite common; these homes gather information through certain sensors {{to monitor the}} environment, control the appliances and helps in communing with the outer world. The use of this technology brings <b>more</b> <b>précised</b> work environment although it would make our system more composite. These technologies coalesce to share information among them so that the system becomes more efficacious. The owner can control the devices by sending the command through a network or through telephone. This paper describes the feasibility to control home appliances in much simpler way based on the certain parameters such as Motion detection of humans, illumination, humidity, Temperature, fire, leakage of gases and smoke etc. The system configuration will assure reliability and complete protection to the user...|$|R

50|$|The term {{arrondissement}} can {{be roughly}} translated into English as district. A <b>more</b> etymologically <b>precise,</b> but less allegorical, definition would be encirclements, from the French arrondir, to encircle. Because no single translation adequately conveys the layered {{sense of the}} word, the French term is usually used in English writing.|$|R
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|During that period, general {{relativity}} remained {{something of a}} curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""). Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed {{general relativity}}'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, making Einstein instantly famous. Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations. Ever <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.|$|E
5|$|Dyer {{continued}} to box regularly in New York State losing to Frankie Notter in June and then recording a draw with George Ashe in July. Dyer {{appears to have}} forgone fighting for over a year, but {{then returned to the}} ring in July 1917, both contests held at the Rochester Airdome. He was given his first win since arriving in America in his encounter with Willie Langford but this was followed by another loss, this time to Bryan Downey. On 28 September 1917, Dyer fought in Boston, Massachusetts, facing local fighter Tommy Robson, in which the referee declared a draw. His next fight, against Frankie Maguire in Pennsylvania, was given to Dyer by the Philadelphia Record after the fight went the distance. Dyer's next fight was against Lew Williams, which was given to Williams by the New York Evening Telegram, though The New York Sun believed Dyer shaded the match with <b>more</b> <b>precise</b> punching.|$|E
50|$|Graduated {{cylinders}} {{are often}} {{used to measure the}} volume of a liquid. Graduated cylinders are generally <b>more</b> accurate and <b>precise</b> than laboratory flasks and beakers, but they should not be used to perform volumetric analysis; volumetric glassware, such as a volumetric flask or volumetric pipette, should be used, as it is even <b>more</b> accurate and <b>precise.</b> Graduated cylinders are sometimes used to measure the volume of a solid indirectly by measuring the displacement of a liquid.|$|R
