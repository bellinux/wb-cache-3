5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|Known {{material}} of Dermotherium includes {{a handful of}} jaw fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted lower third incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2). The tentatively referred <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> species from Pakistan includes a single M2.|$|E

500|$|Because of its derived and {{specialized}} morphology, {{the relationships of}} Seorsumuscardinus are obscure. However, it shows some similarities with Muscardinus, a genus which includes the living hazel dormouse, and may share a common ancestor with it, such as the earlier fossil genus Glirudinus. All three {{are part of the}} dormouse family, which includes many extinct forms dating back to the early Eocene (around 50 million years ago), as well as a smaller array of living species. The generic name Seorsumuscardinus combines the Latin seorsum, which means [...] "different", with Muscardinus and the specific name alpinus refers to the occurrence of S.alpinus close to the Alps.

500|$|Unlike {{almost every}} other sf {{magazine}} on the market, Other Worlds was edited and published by the same person, which meant there were no constraints on Palmer's editorial policy. [...] He attempted to find new and daring material, {{and in the early}} years of the magazine, he obtained some of the better stories being published. [...] Mike Ashley, a historian of science fiction, cites Eric Frank Russell's [...] "Dear Devil"; [...] "Portrait of a Narcissus" [...] by Raymond F. Jones; [...] "Way in the Middle of the Air", one of Ray Bradbury's [...] "Martian Chronicles" [...] stories; and two stories by A.E. van Vogt: [...] "Enchanted Village", one of van Vogt's best-liked stories, and [...] "War of Nerves", part of his Voyage of the Space Beagle series. [...] Fritz Leiber contributed [...] "The Seven Black Priests", one of his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, and E.E. Smith, who had become famous for his space operas, switched to fantasy with [...] "Tedric", which appeared in the March 1953 issue. [...] Poul Anderson and Gordon R. Dickson contributed [...] "Heroes Are Made", the first in their Hoka series, and Palmer obtained fiction from other well-known writers such as Fredric Brown and Wilson Tucker. [...] Partly because of competition from the newly-launched Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Palmer was unable to obtain enough <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> quality to fill the magazine, and most of the remaining stories were unremarkable space adventures. [...] Ashley comments that the stigma of the Shaver Mystery clung to Palmer and damaged the magazine; and suggests that much of the best-quality work in Other Worlds was due to the influence of Mahaffey, who in Ashley's opinion [...] "had excellent taste in fiction". [...] A high point of the non-fiction pieces was a series of articles by L. Sprague de Camp, abridged from his book Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, which ran from 1952 to 1953. [...] The covers were attractive, often with artwork on both covers, by well-known artists such as Malcolm Smith, Robert Gibson Jones, Harold McCauley, and Hannes Bok.Science Stories maintained the same high quality of artwork. [...] The first issue, dated October 1953, was painted by Bok, who also did the interior illustration for Jack Williamson's story based on the cover. [...] The remaining three covers were by Virgil Finlay, Albert A. Nuetzell, and Jones; Wendy Bousfield, an sf historian, considers the last one the best, and also singles out the last issue's interior illustrations, all by Finlay, for praise. [...] The writing was not up to the standard of the artwork, with Jack Williamson and Mack Reynolds the only two authors whose reputation has lasted. [...] A lower page count meant less non-fiction material and readers' departments (such as letters) in Science Stories than in Other Worlds, but Palmer found space for cartoons and advertisements for his own books, such as The Coming of the Saucers, written with Kenneth Arnold.|$|E

2500|$|Whitney Houston {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics upon its release.

[...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail commented that although some [...] "arrangements frequently border on formulaic but such ballads as Saving All My Love for You, Greatest Love Of All, and Hold Me {{are some of}} the loveliest pop singing on vinyl since the glory days of Dionne Warwick." [...] Lacey added, [...] "Houston has a silky, rich, vibrant voice that moves between steely edges, or curls sensuously around the notes." [...] Los Angeles Times complimented Houston on her excellent vocal ability, writing, [...] "neither the frequently listless arrangements nor the sometimes mediocre <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> debut LP hides the fact that Houston is a singer with enormous power and potential" [...] on their reviews for 1985's releases.|$|E

2500|$|Documents of {{a private}} nature were {{certainly}} written {{in a much more}} running hand, as the sample from one of the oldest Arabic letters written with Hebrew letters (possibly the 10th century) clearly shows in the papyrus, in [...] "Führer durch die Ausstellung", Table XIX., Vienna, 1894, (compare Figure 3, column 4). However, since the preservation of such letters were not held to be of importance, <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> nature from the earlier times is very scarce, and as a consequence the development of the script is very hard to follow. The last two columns of Figure 3 exhibit the Ashkenazi cursive script of a later date. The next to the last is taken from a manuscript of Elias Levita. The accompanying specimen presents Sephardi script. In this flowing cursive alphabet the ligatures appear more often. They occur especially in letters which have a sharp turn to the left (ג, ז, כ, נ, צ, ח), and above all in נ, whose great open bow offers ample space for another letter (see Figure 2).|$|E
2500|$|The {{second or}} {{so-called}} Spanish redaction (Mahadurat Aspamia) {{exists in a}} manuscript in the Vatican library, and has been edited by A. Hildesheimer {{in the collection of}} the Mekitze Nirdamim (Berlin, 1888–92). The <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> recension is much richer and more comprehensive, since it contains many passages from the Talmud, mnemonic introductory words ("simanim"), the order of the weekly lessons, and, most important of all, legal decisions of the Geonim, usually indicated by the term [...] "shedar" [...] (="he sent"), which are lacking in the earlier redaction. The first gaon of whom a [...] "teshubah" [...] is mentioned in this recension is Yehudai Gaon; the last, Tzemah ben Paltoi (d. 890). A. Epstein has concluded, accordingly, that this redaction was made, or rather finished, about the year 900, in some place where the Jews were in close literary correspondence with the Babylonian seminaries. This was either in Spain or in northern Africa—probably in Kairwan, the center of Talmudic studies at that time. Evidence in favor of Kairwan is supplied by a passage in the Halakhot Gedolot (ed. Hildesheimer, p.175), which mentions a usage as being common among the [...] "Bene Afrika"; for it is known that [...] "Afrika" [...] frequently connotes Kairwan.|$|E
2500|$|After {{touring the}} world in 2007, the band had a short hiatus {{in order to work}} on their next studio album.

Shears stated on the band's website there was a possibility that none of these songs would appear on the album, as the band was less than satisfied with most of them. This was confirmed to be the case when the track list was revealed. Drummer Paddy Boom was absent at these gigs and it was later announced that he had amicably parted from the band. The band had come into contact with drummer Randy [...] "Real" [...] Schrager, who was known from his work on the downtown New York scene, playing with bands such as Jessica Vale and The Act.

60|$|This {{experiment}} was baseball. In {{order to give}} the thing vogue from the start, and place {{it out of the}} reach of criticism, I chose my nines by rank, not capacity. There wasn't a knight in either team who wasn't a sceptered sovereign. As for <b>material</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sort, there was a glut of it always around Arthur. You couldn't throw a brick in any direction and not cripple a king. Of course, I couldn't get these people to leave off their armor; they wouldn't do that when they bathed. They consented to differentiate the armor so that a body could tell one team from the other, but that was the most they would do. So, one of the teams wore chain-mail ulsters, and the other wore plate-armor made of my new Bessemer steel. Their practice in the field was the most fantastic thing I ever saw. Being ball-proof, they never skipped out of the way, but stood still and took the result; when a Bessemer was at the bat and a ball hit him, it would bound a hundred and fifty yards sometimes. And when a man was running, and threw himself on his stomach to slide to his base, it was like an iron-clad coming into port. At first I appointed men of no rank to act as umpires, but I had to discontinue that. These people were no easier to please than other nines. The umpire's first decision was usually his last; they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him home on a shutter. When it was noticed that no umpire ever survived a game, umpiring got to be unpopular. So I was obliged to appoint somebody whose rank and lofty position under the government would protect him.|$|E
