25|$|Separate {{insurance}} contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or {{other kinds of}} contracts) were invented in Genoa in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates.

The Dutch would normally be able to charge far lower rates, because they needed far smaller crews to man their more efficient ships.|$|E

This {{establishment}} {{was a popular}} place for sailors, merchants, and ship-owners, and Lloyd catered to them with reliable shipping news. The coffee house soon became recognised as an ideal place for obtaining marine insurance. The shop was also frequented by mariners involved in the slave trade. Historian Eric Williams notes: [...] "Lloyd's, like other insurance companies, insured slaves and slave ships, and was vitally interested in legal decisions as to what constituted 'natural death' and 'perils of the sea'." [...] Lloyd's obtained a monopoly on <b>maritime</b> <b>insurance</b> related to the slave trade and maintained it until the early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|... banchi a minuto ("small" [...] or retail [...] "bank"): {{the most}} obscure of the three, they {{were sort of}} {{combinations}} of lenders and pawnbrokers. They dealt in, among other things, bullion, installment sales of jewels and loans secured by jewels, and currency exchange. None of the surviving records mention anything but time deposits (for the purposes of raising capital), so they generally did not offer demand accounts and maintain the interest by lending out a portion of the deposits. Such banks did lend without security, though; one example of a banco a minuto (run by Bindaccio de' Cerchi) invested heavily in purchasing future interest payments from the Monte (Monte delle doti, a [...] "seven percent dowry fund" [...] founded in the 1340s by the state of Florence), loans to the Monte Comune, <b>maritime</b> <b>insurance,</b> and speculation in horse races. The Medici bank was not a banco a minuto, although between 1476 and 1491, Francesco di Giuliano de' Medici (14501528) was involved in two that dealt heavily in jewelry (one of whose partnership contracts explicitly state that as a goal, though the more successful one dealt in all sorts of luxuries like Spanish tuna).

5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S.

London has also been a centre for arbitration on <b>maritime</b> issues, and <b>insurance.</b> However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the frequency, circumstances, and causes of occupational accidents aboard merchant ships in international trade, {{and to identify}} risk factors for the occurrence of occupational accidents as well as dangerous working situations where possible preventive measures may be initiated. Methods: The study is a historical follow up on occupational accidents among crew aboard Danish merchant ships in the period 1993 – 7. Data were extracted from the Danish <b>Maritime</b> Authority and <b>insurance</b> data. Exact data on time at risk were available. Results: A total of 1993 accidents were identified during a total of 31 140 years at sea. Among these, 209 accidents resulted in permanent disability of 5 % or more, and 27 were fatal. The mean risk of having an occupational accident was 6. 4 / 100 years at sea {{and the risk of}} an accident causing a per-manent disability of 5 % or more was 0. 67 / 100 years aboard.

40|$|Electronic {{business}} has brought many success stories {{as well as}} failures. Intermediaries are a particularly interesting application domain: on the one hand, they are given opportunities by electronic business to reinvent their value logic, while on the other they are threatened by opportunities for customers and suppliers to deploy electronic business to do business directly. Designing for Acceptance addresses the acceptance of electronic intermediaries by studying {{the design of the}} exchange. For example, should a web catalogue provide price information and should it consider an extension with transaction functionality? Developing the right exchange design is a complex undertaking because of the many design options and the interests of multiple actors that need to be taken into account. Four cases were studied: Tapestria (interior fabrics), SeaQuipment (<b>maritime</b> products), Meetingpoint (<b>insurances)</b> and Voogd & Voogd (insurances). The results are an exchange design model and patterns that are derived from numerous case lessons and are supported by insights from theories on electronic intermediaries, acceptance and business design. The exchange design model offers a systematic insight into generic exchange design themes that are relevant to the interests of customers, intermediary and suppliers. Exchange design patterns discuss specific trade-offs with respect to one or more themes. This study contributes to current knowledge by providing support for balancing interests in exchange design beyond simple prescriptions like "creating win-win situations". The exchange design themes and patterns are convenient instruments that offer constructive support for developing a vague electronic business idea into a concrete service concept.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} and analyse the types and circumstances of all natural and non-natural deaths among seamen on board Danish merchant ships. METHODS: Data on 147 cases {{were obtained from}} <b>maritime</b> authorities, an <b>insurance</b> company, shipping companies, hospitals, death registers, and death certificates in the period from 1986 - 93. RESULTS: The 53 natural deaths were dominated by cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. Insufficient treatment on board {{was identified as a}} contributing factor for death in some cases. Medical advice was not always sought and the advice given was in some cases insufficient. 73 fatal accidents were identified. The incidence of accidents of 5. 29 / 10, 000 person-years was 11. 5 times higher than the incidence of 0. 46 / 10, 000 for the Danish male workforce ashore. 23 accidents (31 %) were due to maritime casualties and 26 (36 %) were occupational accidents. The remaining 24 (33 %) were accidents during off duty hours including six self intoxications. Rough weather, inadequate awareness of safety, lack of use of personal protection devices, and inexperience were associated with many of the fatal injuries directly related to work. Alcohol played a major part in 12 out of 18 fatal injuries occurring during off duty hours. CONCLUSIONS: The maritime workplace was identified as a high risk workplace and in many aspects differs from the conditions ashore. Acute diseases and serious injuries pose special risks to seamen {{because of a lack of}} direct access to professional medical care at sea. Primary prevention of certain diseases is needed and possible. Improved training, improved systems of work, improved safety awareness, and greater use of personal protection devices are needed to prevent fatal injuries. Medical training of ships' officers providing medical care on board and specific training of doctors giving medical advise to ships should be improved to meet the needs...|$|R
