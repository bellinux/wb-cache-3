40|$|Objective. To {{introduce}} new methodology is assessing recreational water quality use and associated effects on Health Background. There {{is a need}} to develop rapid assessment of bacterial water quality. To this end many statistical models have been published mostly using-environmental variables to predict concentrations of a particular FIO. The majority of these statistical models have used Multiple Least squares regression in which the major indicator of the goodness of fit of these models have largely depended on the R 2 value, which to date have been quite low. Since Beach management decisions have to be dichotomous in nature (Open/Close Beach) we explored the use of the Multiple logistic model in relation to the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Lease</b> Squares approach. Methods. 668 samples were utilized in this analysis. 10 major environmental variables and several FIO’s were collected on each sample date. Both types of models were run on these data. Results. Our Best Multiple Least Squares Regression was computed with a R Square value of 0. 26, while the Multiple Logistic Regression Model yielded a maximum Sensitivity of 72. 9 % and a maximum Specificity of 65. 9 % at a cut point = 0. 1. A backward selection routine was used in both the Logistic and Least Squares Model. Conclusion. Since the Logistic regression yields a much less nebulous goodness of fit statistic coupled {{with the fact that the}} Beach Managers decision is a dichotomous one, more attention should be paid to research using the Multiple Logistic Model.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, it is {{interesting}} to analyze and evaluate the case of <b>multiple</b> <b>leasing</b> sub-networks and/or <b>multiple</b> sources of spectrum owners. In the developed analysis of the present paper, a state variable is used to represent the number of users in each considered sub-network (i.e., the number of RUs, PUs, and SUs is represented by state variables l, m, and n, respectively). For the case of <b>multiple</b> <b>leasing</b> sub-networks and/or <b>multiple</b> sources of spectrum owners, the teletraffic analysis can be extended by using one additional state variable to identify the number of users in each additional sub-network: either leasing sub-network or any other considered source of spectrum owner. To determine state transition rates, it is necessary to know the system state, arrival rates to each sub-network, and users’ departure rates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a commonly existing {{problem in a}} <b>multiple</b> <b>leases</b> reservoir and tries to solve it using a boundary element method approach. The developed Boundary Element Method (BEM) formulation in calculating the productivity of well or clusters of wells located arbitrarily in an irregularly shaped reservoir was employed in this study to detennine the total oil production for each operator that share a single reservoir. In this example application, two operators of equal area shared one circular oil reservoir. Different operator or section of the reservoir is assigned with different drilling pattern. The section that is developed with a four-spot drilling pattern produces 19 % more oil compared to the section developed with a five-spot pattern. The case of adding injector wells into the system is also presented. Results showed {{that the difference between}} four-spot and five-spot patterns in term of oil production is less pronounce when injector wells were introduced to the system...|$|R

500|$|Offa was {{a generous}} {{patron of the}} church, {{founding}} several churches and monasteries, often dedicated to St Peter. Among these was St Albans Abbey, which he probably founded in the early 790s. He also promised a yearly gift of 365 mancuses to Rome; a mancus was a term of account equivalent to thirty silver pennies, derived from Abbasid gold coins that were circulating in Francia at the time. Control of religious houses was {{one way in which}} a ruler of the day could provide for his family, and to this end Offa ensured (by acquiring papal privileges) that many of them would remain the property of his wife or children after his death. This policy of treating religious houses as worldly possessions represents a change from the early 8th century, when many charters showed the foundation and endowment of small minsters, rather than the assignment of those lands to laypeople. In the 770s, an abbess named Æthelburh (who may have been the same person as Offa's daughter of that name) held <b>multiple</b> <b>leases</b> on religious houses in the territory of the Hwicce; her acquisitions have been described as looking [...] "like a speculator assembling a portfolio". Æthelburh's possession of these lands foreshadows Cynethryth's control of religious lands, and the pattern was continued in the early 9th century by Cwoenthryth, the daughter of King Coenwulf.|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the progress {{made in the}} first year of a collaborative project between researchers at Kajima and two CUREe institutions, Caltech and Stanford University. The project is part of Year 2 and Year 3 of Phase ill of the CUREe-Kajima Joint Research Program. The goal of this two-year CUREe-Kajima project is to develop quantitative methodologies and a prototype software package to implement a decision support system (DSS) which can be used by corporate management to enhance the recovery of their business after a disruptive earthquake. In developing this DSS, it is necessary to specify the type of business to which it is to be applied. In the first-year of this project, the focus was on a corporation which owns <b>multiple</b> <b>leased</b> office buildings that have suffered, or may suffer, damage during an earthquake. The core problem that was addressed of determining an optimal strategy for repairing the buildings is also relevant to any company that owns facilities. The basic objective of the project is to show how a DSS can be developed which could be used by management to make better decisions in restoring the state, or health, of their business after an earthquake. It is envisaged that the DSS could be used by the managers of a company to perform complex "what if" analyses to evaluate alternative recovery strategies and to determine the best one, based on post-earthquake information and economic and other constraints. In addition to its use after a damaging earthquake, the DSS could also be used prior to any earthquake to investigate which mitigation actions and planning efforts should be more effective in enhancing the business recovery process...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that cache {{consistency}} mechanisms designed for stand-alone proxies do not scale to {{the large number of}} proxies in a content distribution network and are not flexible enough to allow consistency guarantees to be tailored to object needs. To meet the twin challenges of scalability and flexibility, we introduce the notion of cooperative consistency along with a mechanism, called cooperative leases, to achieve it. By supporting #-consistency semantics and by using a single <b>lease</b> for <b>multiple</b> proxies, cooperative <b>leases</b> allow the notion of leases to be applied in a flexible, scalable manner to CDNs. Further, the approach employs application-level multicast to propagate server notifications to proxies in a scalable manner. We implement our approach in the Apache Web server and the Squid proxy cache and demonstrate its efficacy using a detailed experimental evaluation. Our results show a factor of 2 : 5 reduction in server message overhead and a 20 percent reduction in server state space overhead when compared to original leases albeit at an increased interproxy communication overhead...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-There are two {{key issues}} that prevent Application Service Providers (ASPs) from fully {{leveraging}} the cloud “advantage. ” First, in modern enterprise and Internet-based application environments, a separate middlebox infrastructure for providing application delivery {{services such as}} security (e. g., firewalls, intrusion detection), performance (e. g., SSL off loaders), and scaling (e. g., load balancers) is deployed. In a cloud datacenter, the ASP {{does not have any}} control over the network infrastructure, thus making it hard for them to deploy middleboxes for their cloud-based application deployments. Second, modern services virtualize the application endpoint. A service can no longer be statically mapped to a single end host. Instead, the service is partitioned and replicated across multiple end hosts for better performance and scaling. In enterprise datacenters, service requests are intercepted by an application-level routing service (APR) in the data plane and dynamically mapped to the correct service partition and the best (e. g. least loaded) instance of that partition. However, although multi-cloud (or Inter-cloud) environments allow ASPs to globally distributed their applications over <b>multiple</b> cloud datacenters <b>leased</b> from <b>multiple</b> cloud providers, ASPs need support of a globally distributed APR infrastructure to intelligently route application traffic to the right service instance. But, since such an infrastructure would be extremely hard to own and mange, it is best to design a shared solution where APR could be provided as a service by a third party provider having a globally distributed presence, such as an ISP. Although these requirements seem separate, they can be converged into a single abstraction for supporting application delivery in the cloud context. A sample design of this abstraction is OpenADN, presented here. ...|$|R
30|$|Several {{refunding}} mechanisms between WSP and FHs are {{investigated in}} the past few years. Chen et al. early propose a framework of utility-aware refunding [8], where WSP provides the certain refunding to motivate FHs to open their resource for macro users then FHs decide the resource allocation among femto and macro users. A Stackelberg game is formulated to maximize the utilities for both WSP and FHs. Shih et al. present an economic framework based on the game theoretical analysis [9], where the FHs determine the proportion of femtocell resources they will share with public users, while WSP maximizes its benefit by setting the ratio of the revenue distributed to FHs. Yang et al. show the refunding mechanism for small cell networks with limited-capacity backhaul [10], in which small cell holders receive refunding as incentives to serve guest users with their remaining backhaul capacity. WSP decides individualized refunding and interference constraints to different small cell holders; meanwhile, each small cell holder serves guest users in a best-effort manner while maximizing its own utility. Li et al. show a rate-based pricing framework within which the macro BS provides profit to motivate femto BSs to adopt hybrid access policy and guarantee transmission rates of associated users [11]. Ford et al. study a model where third parties provide backhaul connections and lease out excess capacity to WSP when available [12], presumably at significantly lower costs than guaranteed connections. Multi-leader multi-follower data offloading game is investigated in [13], where macro BSs propose market prices and accordingly small cells determine the traffic volumes they are willing to offload. Shen et al. propose an auction mechanism to establish the hybrid access [14], where femto access points (FAPs) decide their bids independently by maximizing their own utilities. After receiving the bids, the macro BS searches the winner FAP and optimizes the number of offloaded macro users. The compensation is paid by the macro BS to the winner FAP for serving the additional macro users. A price discount strategy for WSP to promote the hybrid access mode of femtocell is developed in which WSP provides a price discount in exchange for the FHs to share part of their resource with macro users [15]. An interference management scheme for the two-tier femtocell networks is studied [16], where the macro BS protects itself by pricing the interference from the femtocell users. Price bargaining between femtocell users and macrocell exists so as to maximize the revenues and protect the QoS requirements. Zhu et al. design an incentive mechanism in which WSP pays the small cell service providers for the shared radio resource [17]. A hierarchical dynamic game framework is proposed in which an evolutionary game is used to model and analyze the service selection of users in the lower lever while a Stackelberg differential game is formulated where WSP and small cell service providers act as the leader and followers, respectively. A utility gain framework where each femtocell reserves a fraction of resource to macro users and gets a gain from WSP is proposed [18]. A learning mechanism allows both WSP and FH to choose the best strategy to reach a win-win situation. Iosifidis et al. present a market where WSPs <b>lease</b> <b>multiple</b> FAPs and each FAP can concurrently serve traffic from multiple WSPs [19]. An iterative double-auction mechanism is designed to ensure the maximization of differences between offloading benefits of operators and offloading costs of FAPs. Zhang et al. propose an incentive method where macro BS allocates a portion of subchannels to FAP for spurring the FAP to serve macro users [20]. The FAP allocates the subchannels and power to maximize the femtocell network utility and the throughput of the served macro users. Yang et al. propose a bargaining cooperative game where spectrum leasing is used as the incentive mechanism to motivate small cell working as the relays [21]. Macrocell leases some of its dedicated spectrum to the selected relay small cell, and then cooperative bargaining strategy between the relay small cell and the macrocell is formulated to enhance the system spectral efficiency and balance the capacity. In [22], Liu et al. propose an opportunistic user association in multi-service HetNets, where the opportunistic user association is formulated as an optimization problem which can be solved by Nash bargaining solution (NBS).|$|R
