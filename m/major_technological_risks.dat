40|$|Abstract. In {{this study}} the {{potential}} of Earth Observation techniques for <b>major</b> <b>technological</b> accidents analysis is presented and a GIS platform is proposed {{for the support of}} <b>technological</b> <b>risk</b> management. This GIS tool is based on the detection and space-time monitoring of the produced plumes by integrating moderate and high resolution satellite imagery and in-situ vector data. The Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) on board the NOAA satellites has been used for the detection of fire {{as well as for the}} detection and monitoring of plumes caused by <b>major</b> <b>technological</b> accidents. The detection algorithms have been presented in previous studies for past accidents in Europe. AVHRR images, were adjusted to the broader area of Athens (Greece) in order to develop a <b>major</b> <b>technological</b> accident scenario based on real plumes. This scenario was used to present the functionality of the developed GIS platform for the support of decision making during the crisis, as well as for the assessment of the accident’s impact to natural and human environment...|$|R
40|$|A risk {{review of}} a fuel {{cell-based}} distributed co-generation (FC-Based DCG) system was conducted to identify and quantify the <b>major</b> <b>technological</b> system <b>risks</b> in a worst-case scenario. A risk review entails both a risk assessment and a risk analysis of a designed system, and {{it is part of}} risk engineering. Thorough literature reviews and expert interviews were conducted in the field of fuel cells. A thorough literature review of the risk engineering field was also conducted. A procedure for a risk review of the FC-Based DCG System was developed. The representative system design was identified by the current DCG design technology. The risk assessment was carried out, identifying the system components and potential failure modes and consequences. Then, using probabilities of failure for the various system components, the risk associated with a particular system design was determined. A Monte Carlo simulation on the total system reliability was used to evaluate the potential for system failure at a time of 1 hour, 5 hours, 10 hours, 50 hours, 100 hours and 500 hours of continuous operation. The original system was found to be acceptable at the initial times, but after 100 hours was predicted to fail. The components which consistently contribute significantly to the overall system risk are the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the nickel-metal foam flow fields. A revised system was analyzed with the reliability of the MEA and the Ni-foam set to 100 %. After the revision, the components which contributed significantly to the system risk were the pumps. Simulations were run for several alternative systems to provide feedback on risk management suggestions. The risk engineering process developed with the design approach for this research is applicable to any system and it accommodates the use of many different risk engineering tools...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{risk in the}} French social {{sciences}} over the past 10 years draws upon a tradition of policy studies. Following an earlier period during which research focused on <b>major</b> catastrophes and <b>technological</b> <b>risks,</b> studies moved on to {{a broader range of}} collective risks. Emphasis was placed on the social construction of risks by social movements, NGOs, experts and counter-experts, whistleblowers, private firms and public administrations. Among these studies, two separate approaches can be observed. A first strand of research focused on how existing risks became public problems, i. e., why and how among the many risks which surround us, some became major issues while others did not. This led to specific interest for processes of problem-building and agenda-setting. In these processes, the role of organizations was closely scrutinized. A second strand of research focused on how existing public problems became framed as risks, i. e., the way in which an issue already on the agenda came to acquire new attributes which, by stressing a number of uncertainties and establishing links with other controversial issues, turned it into a risk. From the sum results of these two strands, a general framework of analysis for the study of risks emerges, which stresses the dynamic nature of their construction processes, the political nature of the controversies which accompany risks on the public agenda, the dimensions of lack of familiarity and control in the risks that emerge, and the crucial importance of debates over calculating the risks...|$|R

40|$|The <b>risk</b> of <b>technological</b> {{accidents}} from man-made {{and natural}} hazards is increasing {{as a result}} of industrialisation, population growth that leads to more urbanisation and community encroachment on natural-hazard areas, and climate change. The last few years have seen <b>major</b> <b>technological</b> accidents, with significant social, environmental and economic impacts that have had repercussions around the globe. Examples include the explosions at chemicals warehouses at Tianjin Port in 2015, the Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami, and the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in 2010. There is no overarching framework for the reduction of <b>technological</b> <b>risks,</b> and disaster risk reduction initiatives have not commonly addressed this type of risk. With the Sendai Framework for Action, the importance of technological hazards has been recognised and an all-hazards approach to disaster risk reduction is promoted. This includes dangerous situations arising from manmade activities caused by human and organisational error, mechanical failure and natural hazards — so-called Natech risk. Prevention and preparedness for these risks, and for environmental emergencies in general, also has implications for sustainable development. There are many hazardous industrial activities that provide society with important goods and services (e. g. chemical processing, oil and gas transport and some forms of electricity production). For the purpose of this report, three examples of <b>major</b> <b>technological</b> hazards were selected and the state of play in the management of the associated risks is discussed: (1) chemical accident risks due to the relatively frequent occurrence of accidents, (2) nuclear risks due to the potential for major cross-border consequences, and (3) Natech risks {{as an example of a}} multihazard cascading risk.

40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{are crucial}} drivers of economic, social, and environmental progress. While innovations lead {{the evolution of}} our societies and permeate all domains of human life, they also pose significant risks both to humans and the environment. Law and regulation are expected to enable innovation, {{while at the same}} time protecting society from unintended consequences. However, assessing new <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> confronts deep uncertainty and limited knowledge. In contrast to simple risks (e. g. car accidents), <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> (such as risks stemming from new health technologies, nanotechnology, biotechnology, or robotics as discussed in this special issue) cannot be calculated according to traditional technocratic models, namely as a statistically foreseeable function of probability and effects.

30|$|The resolutely {{operational}} approach {{adopted by}} the CRISSIS program faced three challenges. First of all, it {{has been difficult to}} convince local representatives to organize a crisis exercise locally. While the first exercise, which took place in Paris in March 2015, did not pose any major issues as its stakes were lower (low-intensity exercise, remote location, framework exercise only, involving only two technical staff members and the Director General of municipal services as observers), organizing the second proved markedly more complex. As this exercise needed to take place locally and involve large numbers of Council members and municipal staff, we were initially faced with a clear reluctance on their part. Eventually, only two Council members (two Deputy Mayors) did take part in the exercise, along with about twenty administrative and technical staff members. The 2004 Law for the modernization of civil security (Act 2004 – 811 of 13 August 2004) states that any municipality where at least one <b>major</b> natural or <b>technological</b> <b>risk</b> has been identified must organize at least one crisis exercise per year (DGSCGC, 2008). However, as highlighted by the French Committee for Civil Defense in its 2012 report (Haut Comité Français pour la Défense Civile (HCFDC) 2012), very few municipalities actually comply with this obligation. This reluctance {{may be due to the}} lack of municipal resources, or perhaps to the fear of being evaluated and judged. In this respect, a lot of educational work is needed to convince potential participants that the objective of such exercises is not to evaluate individuals but systems and procedures, in order to improve them and make them easier to memorize. Only when the exercise was completed did participants finally drop their guard and admit to its usefulness.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} technological risks; {{more specifically}} {{risks associated with}} emerging technologies. Emerging technologies are characterized by complexity and uncertainty, which makes natural scientific risk conceptions insufficient when approaching the field of risk as a whole. Thus, discussions on risks have broadened not only to regard risks as ‘physical real’, but to consider the significance of risk perceptions as well, thus considering risks as constructions. This {{has led to an}} acknowledgement of the co-existence of risk conceptions emphasizing that risk is not an unambiguous concept but dependent on interpretations and the context. The thesis operates with the following research question: Considering the challenges of complex-ity and uncertainty facing emerging technologies, and the co-existence of risk conceptions; what should be taken into account when approaching and dealing with <b>technological</b> <b>risks?</b> The research question is approached through a literature study where different theoretical perspectives on the field of risk are discussed. The purpose of the thesis is to examine emerg-ing technologies, <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> and the co-existence of risk conceptions. The thesis sets out to scrutinize the preconditions of co-existing risk conceptions through a discussion on uncertainty and complexity within the field of natural science. Then the different characteris-tics of risk conceptions are discussed by juxtaposing contradictory risk approaches. Acknowl-edging complexity, uncertainty and the co-existence of risk conceptions as a precondition of emerging technologies highlight that the context in which <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> materialize is important to address in order to obtain a more consistent view of the field. Based on these indications, the thesis turns to a discussion on how contemporary society is approaching and dealing with emerging technologies and <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> through a critical review of the methods and approaches approved and employed in the processes of risk management. Conclusively, re-thinking of risk management is emphasized as necessary whenever emerging technologies and <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> are the objects of analysis. Subsequently, a discussion on this re-thinking of risk management leads to a presentation of five guidelines (inclusiveness, pro-activity, contextualization, reflectivity and transparency) pointing out factors and features that should be incorporated when approaching and dealing with emerging technologies and <b>technological</b> <b>risks.</b> Although the thesis discusses the approach and managing of emerging technologies and <b>technological</b> <b>risks</b> at a very general level, these general discussions are addressed in a more specific context; the emerging field of nanotechnology. The field of nanotechnology empha-sizes that emerging technologies are being characterized by complexity and uncertainty. Furthermore, approaching the field of nanotechnology illustrates the co-existence of different risk conceptions and exemplifies how, in particular, the communication about the technology influences and shapes these different risk conceptions. As such, the field of nanotechnology is characterized by a multiplicity of expectations all contributing to the shaping and influencing of the further development of the technology...|$|R

40|$|Experts {{typically}} accuse {{lay people}} of “emotional” responses to <b>technological</b> <b>risk</b> {{as opposed to}} their own “rational” judgment. This attitude is in tune with risk perception research that qualifies lay people’s responses in terms of bias. By contrast, cognitivists argue that emotions are judgments or that they are assessable as rational or irrational. But this {{does not account for}} the “raw”, bodily and passive aspect of emotional experience. A Jamesian view of emotions as bodily changes may deliver that, but at the cost of downplaying the role of practical rationality. In this paper I develop an account that neither conflates emotions with judgment nor separates them entirely. I argue that emotions can be at the same time passive and overwhelming and rationally connected to our beliefs, concerns, and commitments within a judgmental constellation. This view takes seriously people’s so-called “gut reactions” to <b>technological</b> <b>risk</b> as being potentially rationally related to, but not identical to, judgmental elements. It recognizes the possibility of actively changing our attitude to risk if we judge that there are good reasons to do so, but appreciates that if sometimes <b>technological</b> <b>risk</b> strikes us with fear and horror, that experience teaches us much about what we judge to be important. ...|$|R
