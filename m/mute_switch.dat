5|$|There {{are four}} {{physical}} {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a <b>mute</b> <b>switch,</b> with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.|$|E
5|$|The first-generation iPad {{features}} an Apple A4 SoC, which comprises a 1GHz processor, 256MB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. There are four physical {{switches on the}} iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but iOS 4.2 changed it to a <b>mute</b> <b>switch,</b> moving the rotation lock function to an onscreen menu. In the iOS 4.3 update, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute. Unlike its successors, the first-generation iPad has no cameras.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the plastic}} band houses {{metallic}} buttons for the volume controls and sleep/wake button. The six {{holes in the}} Bumper enable access to the <b>mute</b> <b>switch,</b> dock connector, headphone jack, speaker, and microphones.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to design and {{construct}} a mains powered stereo power amplifier with minimal overall dimensions, equipped with a mute and tone/volume control circuit. The usage of an integrated power amplifier circuit was required. The circuit solution {{is based on a}} DC controlled integrated tone and volume control circuit LM 1036, power amplifier TDA 7262 and a number of supporting circuits for <b>mute</b> <b>switching</b> and temperature protection. An assembled sample of amplifier has 2 x 20 watts of output power, SNR 83, 7 dB and a flat frequency response within the range of 3 dB for inputs from 16 to 20 000 Hz...|$|R
50|$|Not all {{telephone}} headsets {{are compatible}} with all telephone models. Because headsets connect to the telephone via the standard handset jack, the pin-alignment of the telephone handset may {{be different from the}} default pin-alignment of the telephone headset. To ensure a headset can properly pair with a telephone, telephone adapters or pin-alignment adapters are available. Some of these adapters also provide <b>mute</b> function and <b>switching</b> between handset and headset.|$|R
25|$|For older {{models of}} telephones, the headset {{microphone}} impedance {{is different from}} that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound amplification for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, <b>mute</b> function and <b>switching</b> between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or AC adaptors.|$|R
50|$|A product {{teardown}} by iFixit {{showed that}} the design of this iPad is nearly identical to the iPad Air {{except for a few}} differences: the addition of Touch ID, the lack of the physical <b>mute</b> <b>switch,</b> the microphone holes are smaller and there is only a single row of speaker holes.|$|E
50|$|Due to the redesign, {{this device}} is {{incompatible}} with cases that would otherwise work with the iPad Mini 2 or iPad Mini 3. To compensate for this, Apple released a Smart Cover and Silicone Case for the Mini 4, {{which can be used}} separately or together as a fully protective case. Unlike the iPad Air 2, there is no leather Smart Case made by Apple for the device. There is also a <b>mute</b> <b>switch</b> removal like the iPad Air 2 due to its thinness.|$|E
50|$|Ball was rereleased {{exclusively}} via Club Nintendo {{to celebrate}} the 30th anniversary of Game & Watch, with the Club Nintendo logo on the back. Unlike the original release, this version includes a <b>mute</b> <b>switch.</b> For members of the Japanese Club Nintendo, after an announcement in November 2009, it was shipped in April 2010 to Platinum members. For members of the North American Club Nintendo, it was available for 1200 coins from February 2011. For members of the European Club Nintendo, it was available for 7500 stars from November 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Artist Series Steve Bailey Jazz Bass VI (introduced in 2009 and {{discontinued}} in 2011) {{featured a}} select alder body, a quartersawn maple neck with an asymmetrical profile, a 9.5” to 14” compound-radius two-octave ebony fingerboard, {{a pair of}} custom 6-string Jazz Bass pickups, a recessed Stratocaster jackplate, 18-volt active electronics, an onboard <b>mute</b> <b>switch,</b> onboard active 2-band EQ, a heavy-duty fully adjustable Fender locking convertible modular bridge and Bailey’s initials {{on the back of}} the headstock. It was offered in 3-tone sunburst and black, in fretted http://www.fender.com/products//search.php?partno=0197401306 and fretless versions http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0197400300.|$|E
50|$|The AU-11000 has {{features}} such as a logarithmic volume control, a 3-position level-set muting, a -20db <b>mute</b> <b>switch,</b> 3-position high & low filters, 3-Band Linear Bass/Midrange/Treble controls, 3 optional frequency settings for Bass & Treble controls, 3-position Tone Selection, A & B Speakers, Tape Input/Output control, 5-position mono-stereo selector switch, Tuner input, 2 Auxiliary inputs, 2 phono inputs, 2 rear 'always on' power outlets and 1 switched power outlet that {{is controlled by the}} units main power switch.
