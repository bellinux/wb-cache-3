25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in experimental technologies allow scientists to follow biochemical processes on a single-molecule basis, which provides much richer information about chemical dynamics than traditional ensemble-averaged experiments but also raises many new statistical challenges. The paper provides the first likelihood-based {{statistical analysis of}} the single-molecule fluorescence lifetime experiment designed to probe the conformational dynamics of a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hairpin molecule. The conformational change is initially treated as a continuous time two-state Markov chain, which is not observable and must be inferred from changes in photon emissions. This model is further complicated by unobserved <b>molecular</b> Brownian <b>diffusions.</b> Beyond the simple two-state model, a competing model that models the energy barrier between the two states of the DNA hairpin as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process has been suggested in the literature. We first derive the likelihood function of the simple two-state model and then generalize the method to handle complications such as unobserved <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusions</b> and the fluctuating energy barrier. The data augmentation technique and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are developed to sample from the posterior distribution desired. The Bayes factor calculation and posterior estimates of relevant parameters indicate that the fluctuating barrier model fits the data better than the simple two-state model.

40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{membrane distillation}} (MD) as an emerging desalination technology {{to meet the}} global water challenge, development of membranes with ideal material properties is crucial. Functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were anchored to nanofibres of electrospun membranes. Covalent modification and fluorination of CNTs improved their dispersibility and interfacial interaction with the polymer membrane, resulting in well-aligned CNTs inside crystalline fibres with superhydrophobicity. Consideration for the chemical/physical properties of the CNT composite membranes and calculation of their theoretical fluxes revealed the mechanism of MD: CNTs facilitated the repulsive force for Knudsen and <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusions,</b> reduced the boundary-layer effect in viscous flow, and assisted surface diffusion, allowing for fast vapor transport with anti-wetting. This study shows {{that the role of}} CNTs and an optimal composite ratio can be used to reduce the gap between theoretical and experimental approaches to desalination...|$|R
500|$|Particularly {{since the}} mid-1960s {{there have been}} {{advances}} in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the transport of water within plant tissues), [...] the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, {{and the rate of}} photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. Frederick Campion Steward pioneered techniques of micropropagation and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones.

40|$|A coupled map is {{suggested}} to investigate various spatial or temporal designs in biology: Several cells (or tissues) in an organ are considered as connected {{to each other}} in terms of some <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusions</b> or electrical potential differences and so on. The biological systems (groups of cells) start from various initial conditions for spatial designs (or initial signals for temporal designs) and they evolve in time in terms of the mentioned interactions (connections) besides some individual feedings. The basic aim of the present contribution is to mimic various empirical data for the heart (in normal, quasi-stable, unstable and post operative physiological conditions) or brain (regular or irregular; for epilepsy) signals. The mentioned empirical data are borrowed from various literatures which are cited. The suggested model (to be used besides or instead of the artificial network models) involves simple mathematics and the related software is easy.

2500|$|The famous text [...] "The {{chemical}} {{basis of}} morphogenesis," [...] written in 1952 by mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing advocated for various biological models based on <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of nutrients. However, a diffusive model of vascular development {{would seem to}} fall short {{of the complexity of}} capillary beds and the interwoven network of arteries and veins. In 2000, Fleury proposed that instead of diffusive molecules bearing responsibility for the branching morphogenesis of the vascular tree, a long-range morphogen may be implicated. In this model, a traveling pressure wave would act upon the vasculature via shear stress to rearrange branches into the lowest-energy configuration by widening vessels carrying increased blood flow and rearranging networks upon the initiation of fluid flow. It is known that mechanical forces can have a dramatic impact on the morphology and complexity of the vascular tree. However, 난these forces have comparably little impact on the diffusion of nutrients, and it therefore seems unlikely that acquisition of nutrients and oxygen plays a significant role in embryonic vascular remodelling.|$|E

40|$|Projected {{scenarios}} {{for the proposed}} Yucca Mountain repository include significant periods of time when high relative humidity atmospheres will be present, thus the reaction processes of interest will include those known to occur under these conditions. The ideal natural analog for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository would consist of natural borosilicate glasses exposed to expected repository conditions for thousands of years; however, the prospects for identifying such an analog are remote, but an important caveat for using natural analog studies is to relate the reaction processes in the analog {{to those in the}} system of interest, rather than a strict comparison of the glass compositions. In lieu of this, identifying natural glasses that have reacted via reaction processes expected in the repository is the most attractive option. The goal {{of this study is to}} quantify <b>molecular</b> water <b>diffusion</b> in the natural analogs obsidian and tektites. Results from this study can be used in assessing the importance of factors affecting <b>molecular</b> water <b>diffusion</b> in nuclear waste glasses, relative to other identified reaction processes.

40|$|Within {{the domain}} of {{molecular}} communications, researchers mimic the techniques in nature {{to come up with}} alternative communication methods for collaborating nanomachines. This work investigates the channel transfer function for <b>molecular</b> communication via <b>diffusion.</b> In nature, information-carrying molecules are generally absorbed by the target node via receptors.

Focussing on recent advances in the implementation of MR methods in reaction engineering we consider MR measurements yielding information at two quite different length-scales: first, the ability of MR relaxometry and diffusometry to study <b>molecular</b> adsorption and <b>diffusion</b> processes within the pore space of heterogeneous catalysts; second, the use of micro-imaging and MR flow imaging to critically evaluate the closure relationships and boundary conditions used in numerical simulations of catalytic reactor operation...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> often simply called diffusion, is {{the thermal}} motion of all (liquid or gas) {{particles}} at temperatures above absolute zero. The rate {{of this movement}} {{is a function of}} temperature, viscosity of the fluid and the size (mass) of the particles. Diffusion explains the net flux of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move, but since there is no concentration gradient the process of <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion</b> has ceased and is instead governed by the process of self-diffusion, originating from the random motion of the molecules. The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform. Since the molecules are still in motion, but an equilibrium has been established, the end result of <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion</b> is called a [...] "dynamic equilibrium". In a phase with uniform temperature, absent external net forces acting on the particles, the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing.|$|E

5000|$|Intravoxel {{incoherent}} motion (IVIM) imaging is {{a concept}} and a method initially introduced and developed by Le Bihan et al. to quantitatively assess all the microscopic translational motions that could contribute to the signal acquired with diffusion MRI. In biological tissue, these motions essentially are <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of water and microcirculation {{of blood in the}} capillary network (perfusion). The concept introduced by D. Le Bihan is that water flowing in randomly oriented capillaries (at the voxel level) mimics a random walk (“pseudo-diffusion” [...] ) (Fig.1). [...] It is responsible for a signal attenuation in diffusion MRI, which depends on the velocity of the flowing blood and the vascular architecture. Similarly to <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> the effect of pseudodiffusion on the signal attenuation depends on the b value. However, the rate of signal attenuation resulting from pseudodiffusion is typically an order of magnitude greater than <b>molecular</b> <b>diffusion</b> in tissues, so its relative contribution to the diffusion-weighted MRI signal becomes significant only at very low b values, allowing diffusion and perfusion effects to be separated.|$|E
