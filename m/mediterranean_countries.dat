5|$|In {{the section}} on sweets, David {{comments}} that throughout the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries,</b> the more complicated sweets are very often bought from pâtisseries; the few recipes she gives are for simple, traditional sweets made at home, such as torrijas (also called pain perdu) and cold orange soufflé. The jams, chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as pears and plums.|$|E

5|$|In France, saffron {{production}} {{became very}} important in the 17th and 18th centuries, reaching a few tons. By then, saffron farming had spread throughout the entire Kingdom. Saffron was especially grown in Albigeois, Angoumois, Gascony, Gâtinais, Normandy, Périgord, Poitou, Provence, and Quercy. Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century, possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops, to particularly cold winters, and to competing market from the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries,</b> but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries.</b> Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
25|$|The European Union remains Tunisia's first trading partner, {{currently}} {{accounting for}} 72.5% of Tunisian imports and 75% of Tunisian exports. Tunisia {{is one of}} the European Union's most established trading partners in the Mediterranean region and ranks as the EU's 30th largest trading partner. Tunisia was the first <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>country</b> to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union, in July 1995, although even before the date of entry came into force, Tunisia started dismantling tariffs on bilateral EU trade. Tunisia finalised the tariffs dismantling for industrial products in 2008 and therefore was the first <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>country</b> to enter in a free trade area with EU.|$|R

5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries,</b> particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Anatolian conifer and {{deciduous}} forests is an ecoregion {{which covers}} {{most of the}} Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey, while the Caucasus mixed forests extend across {{the eastern end of}} the range. The region is home to Eurasian wildlife such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, lesser spotted eagle, Caucasian black grouse, red-fronted serin, and wallcreeper. The narrow coastal strip between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, which contain some of the world's few temperate rainforests. The Turkish pine is mostly found in Turkey and other east <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries.</b> Several wild species of tulip are native to Anatolia, and the flower was first introduced to Western Europe with species taken from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries.</b> In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries.</b> By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccording to the recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and {{its target}} for the {{large-scale}} increase of nearly-zero energy buildings, nowadays a challenging task {{is the definition of}} standard high performing building types depending on location and specific climate conditions. The widespread replicability of nZEB types on the current real estate market could implement nZEB design scenarios attractive and affordable for construction companies and private investors. In particular, this research focuses on the definition of replicable HVAC system configurations with different features and efficiencies starting from a reference building located in a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>country.</b> The configurations were applied to CorTau House, an nZEB under construction in Piedmont Region, a typical situation of European <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>country</b> where both winter and summer loads, together with humidity, have to be carefully controlled. Building envelope and HVAC system design were matched in order to optimize energy performance and indoor thermal comfort. The HVAC configurations, able to meet nZEB targets and to ensure optimal indoor comfort conditions, were combined with a performing building envelope, made of local construction materials, in order to assess which of them is more energy effective and economically viable. Cost-optimal types were identified and prospective replicability on building market was speculated. Finally, differences between private investor's and company construction's perspectives were discussed...|$|R
30|$|At first sight, {{one could}} say that the extent of underreporting of income by the Spanish {{self-employed}} workers would be above the estimates found for USA, Sweden or UK. This view would be supported firstly by the fact that tax morale in Spain is not so strong as in other OECD countries (Alm and Torgler 2006). And secondly, as <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>country,</b> the Spanish self-employment rate is higher than in north European countries (Torrini 2005), and this makes more difficult and costlier the control of such income source by tax authorities.|$|R
