5|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> {{objection}} {{was raised}} in the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as magnetic monopoles. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, {{in the same way that}} it drives the geometry to flatness.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E
25|$|Some {{condensed}} matter systems contain effective (non-isolated) <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> quasi-particles, or contain {{phenomena that}} are mathematically analogous to magnetic monopoles.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{searches}} for <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> {{can be placed}} {{in one of two}} categories: those which try to detect preexisting <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> and those which try to create and detect new <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Magnetism in bar magnets and {{electromagnets}} {{does not}} arise from <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles.</b> There is no experimental evidence that <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> exist.|$|R
50|$|High energy {{particle}} colliders {{have been}} used to try to create <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles.</b> Due to the conservation of <b>magnetic</b> charge, <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> must be created in pairs, one north and one south. Due to conservation of energy, only <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> with masses less than the center of mass energy of the colliding particles can be produced. Beyond this, very little is known theoretically about the creation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> in high energy particle collisions. This is due to their large magnetic charge, which invalidates all the usual calculational techniques. As a consequence, collider based searches for <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> cannot, as yet, provide lower bounds on the mass of <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles.</b> They can however provide upper bounds on the probability (or cross section) of pair production, as a function of energy.|$|R
25|$|Some {{condensed}} matter systems {{propose a}} structure superficially {{similar to a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole,</b> known as a flux tube. The ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole, but since they move independently, they can be treated for many purposes as independent <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> quasiparticles. Since 2009, numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles, but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another.|$|E
25|$|Salam had a {{prolific}} research career in theoretical and high-energy physics. Salam {{had worked on}} theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the 1930s. Salam introduced chiral symmetry {{in the theory of}} neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions. Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin, who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector electrodynamics), and the renormalisation of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction. In 1961, Salam began to work with John Clive Ward on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction, subsequently obtaining SU(2) × U(1) model. Salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the Goldstone's theorem, that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry. In 1960, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form in electroweak theory, and thus theorised the Standard Model. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> and the C-violation, thus he formulated the magnetic photon.|$|E
500|$|The first partial {{derivatives}} {{of the delta}} function are thought of as double layers along the coordinate planes.

The evolution of <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopoles</b> is studied from the topological properties of a three-dimensional vector field.

500|$|In {{experimental}} condensed matter physics, external {{magnetic fields}} act as thermodynamic variables {{that control the}} state, phase transitions and properties of material systems. [...] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a method by which external magnetic fields are used to find resonance modes of individual electrons, thus giving information about the atomic, molecular, and bond structure of their neighborhood. NMR experiments {{can be made in}} magnetic fields with strengths up to 60 Tesla. [...] Higher magnetic fields can improve the quality of NMR measurement data. Quantum oscillations is another experimental method where high magnetic fields are used to study material properties such as the geometry of the Fermi surface. [...] High magnetic fields will be useful in experimentally testing of the various theoretical predictions such as the quantized magnetoelectric effect, image <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole,</b> and the half-integer quantum Hall effect.|$|E

2500|$|Dirac {{established}} the most {{general theory of}} quantum mechanics and discovered the relativistic equation for the electron, which now bears his name.

He {{was the first to}} develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or [...] "elementary" [...] particles today, work that is fundamental {{to our understanding of the}} forces of nature.

2500|$|Many early {{scientists}} {{attributed the}} magnetism of lodestones to two different [...] "magnetic fluids" [...] ("effluvia"), a north-pole fluid {{at one end}} and a south-pole fluid at the other, which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative electric charge. However, an improved understanding of electromagnetism in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained by Ampère's circuital law, not <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> fluids. Gauss's law for magnetism, one of Maxwell's equations, is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist. Nevertheless, it was pointed out by Pierre Curie in 1894 that magnetic monopoles could conceivably exist, despite not having been seen so far.|$|E
2500|$|Guth {{decided to}} solve this problem by {{suggesting}} a supercooling during a delayed phase transition. This seemed very promising for solving the <b>magnetic</b> <b>monopole</b> problem. By the time they came up with that, Guth had gone to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for a year, but Guth had been talking to Henry Tye back and forth. Tye suggested that they check that {{the expansion of the universe}} would not be affected by the supercooling. In the supercooled state, a false vacuum is produced. The false vacuum is a vacuum in the sense that it is state of the lowest possible density of energy; it is false in the sense that it is not a permanent state of being. False vacuums decay, and Guth was to find that the decay of the false vacuum at the beginning of the universe would produce amazing results, namely the exponential expansion of space. [...] This solved the monopole problem, since the expansion dilutes the monopole density.|$|E
