500|$|When {{considering}} the theological {{meaning of the}} event, some authors have interpreted the darkness as a period of mourning by the cosmos itself at the death of Jesus. Others have seen {{it as a sign}} of God's judgement on the Jewish people, sometimes connecting it with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in the year 70; or as symbolising shame, fear, or the <b>mental</b> <b>suffering</b> of Jesus. Fitzmyer compares the event to a contemporary description recorded in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which recounts [...] "unlawful acts against the gods, from which we believe the very sun turned away, as if it too were loath to look upon the foul deed".|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{a younger}} {{generation}} of Japanese Americans, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, began {{what is known as}} the [...] "Redress Movement," [...] an effort to obtain an official apology and reparations from the federal government for incarcerating their parents and grandparents during the war. They focused not on documented property losses but on the broader injustice and <b>mental</b> <b>suffering</b> caused by the internment. The movement's first success was in 1976, when President Gerald Ford proclaimed that the internment was [...] "wrong," [...] and a [...] "national mistake" [...] which [...] "shall never again be repeated".|$|E
2500|$|In California, for example, {{recovery}} for non-economic damages {{are limited to}} $250,000. [...] According to the Supreme Court of California, [...] "noneconomic damages compensate the plaintiff for 'pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damage [...]' Section 1431.2, subdivision (b)(2) similarly defines noneconomic damages as 'subjective, non-monetary losses including, but not limited to, pain, suffering, inconvenience, <b>mental</b> <b>suffering,</b> emotional distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, injury to reputation and humiliation.'‚Äù Tort reform supporters argue that states have enacted such laws {{in order to keep}} health care costs low, in addition to helping curb medical malpractice litigation. However, according to the Supreme Court of California, the state's non-economic damages caps are [...] "not a legislative attempt to estimate the true damages suffered by plaintiffs, but rather an attempt to control and reduce medical malpractice insurance costs by placing a predictable, uniform limit on the defendant's liability for noneconomic damages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emotions Anonymous views {{mental and}} {{emotional}} illness as chronic and progressive, like addiction. EA members find they [...] "hit bottom" [...] when {{the consequences of their}} {{mental and emotional}} illness cause complete despair. Twelve-step groups symbolically represent human structure in three dimensions: physical, mental, and spiritual. The illnesses the groups deal with are understood to manifest themselves in each dimension. The First Step in each twelve-step group states what members have been unable to control with their willpower. In some cases the emphasis is on the experience in the physical dimension; in AA the First Step suggests admitting powerlessness over alcohol, in Overeaters Anonymous (OA) it is powerlessness over food. In other groups the First Step emphasizes the experience in the mental dimension; in NA the First Step suggests admitting powerlessness over addiction, in EA (as well as Neurotics Anonymous), it is powerlessness over emotions. Emotions Anonymous focuses on deviant moods and emotions, not just a craving for mood alteration. The subjective experience of powerlessness over one's emotions can generate multiple kinds of behavioral disorders, or it can be a cause of <b>mental</b> <b>suffering</b> with no consistent behavioral manifestation (such as affective disorders).|$|E

60|$|Amongst {{these was}} the Treatise of the <b>Mental</b> <b>Sufferings</b> of Christ--the {{book of the}} Blessed Battista of Varano, Princess of Camerino, who founded the convent of Poor Clares in that city--a book whose almost blasphemous {{presumption}} fired the train of my earliest misgivings.|$|R
50|$|The Archconfraternity of Holy Agony is a lay {{association}} for giving special honour to the <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings</b> of Christ during His Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.

5000|$|Dukkha (Sanskrit duhkha) means [...] "unsatisfactoriness, suffering, pain". The dukkha {{includes}} {{the physical and}} <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings</b> that follows each rebirth, aging, illness, dying; dissatisfaction from getting what a being wishes to avoid or not getting the desired, or because all forms of life are impermanent and without any essence.|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of psychiatric morbidity {{in patients with}} pulmonary tuberculosis is significantly high. Depressive Neurosis is the commonest among them.

The real happiness which comes through realizing God is worth all physical and <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings</b> in the universe. Then all suffering {{is as if}} it were not. The {{happiness of}} God-realization is self-sustained, eternally fresh and unfailing, boundless and indescribable; and it is for this happiness that the world has sprung into existence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Forget them not; It is {{food that}} you are not content with {{although}} you eat everyday. It is speech that you cannot deliver properly although you speak everyday. It is Dhamma (Universal Truth) that you do not realize although it exists really. <b>Mental</b> <b>sufferings</b> cause physical ones. Without a calm mind, your soul and body cannot be in harmony. You should try your best to keep your mind calm. Have mindfulness whatever you do.|$|R
60|$|The Czar, {{after an}} {{interval}} of great suspense and solicitude, {{during which he}} seems to have endured much <b>mental</b> <b>suffering,</b> confirmed the judgment of the council, and a day was appointed on which Alexis was to be arraigned, in order that sentence of death, in accordance with it, might be solemnly pronounced upon him.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} I stepped forward {{so that the}} light fell on me. The old gentleman on the couch rose with some {{difficulty}} and bowed with much courtesy.

60|$|No severe or {{prolonged}} bodily illness {{followed this}} incident of the red- room; it only gave my nerves {{a shock of}} which I feel the reverberation to this day.

60|$|Reginald Lowestoffe was bustlingly officious and good-natured; but, {{used to live}} a scrambling, rakish {{course of}} life himself, he had not the least idea {{of the extent of}} Lord Glenvarloch's <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings,</b> and thought of his {{temporary}} concealment as if it were merely the trick of a wanton boy, who plays at hide-and-seek with his tutor.

60|$|The king sent a {{commission}} to take her examination. At the same time, he urged her, by the persons whom he sent, to confess her guilt, promising her that, if she did so, her life should be spared. She, however, protested her innocence with the utmost firmness and constancy. She begged earnestly {{to be allowed to}} see the king, and, when this was refused, she wrote a letter to him, which still remains, and which expresses very strongly the acuteness of her <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Year by year I {{find myself}} {{more and more}} in a minority. One by one my {{literary}} friends enter into this charmed aristocratic circle; after which one hears no more from them regarding the middle-classes. At once they set to work to describe the <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings</b> of Grooms of the Bed-chamber, the hidden emotions of Ladies in their own right, the religious doubts of Marquises. I want to know how they do it--"how the devil they get there." [...] They refuse to tell me.|$|R
60|$|Slowly, painfully I hobbled to {{the plow}} and drove my {{team to the}} house. Although badly burned, my <b>mental</b> <b>suffering</b> was so much greater that I felt only part of it.--Leaving the horses at the well I hobbled into the house to my mother. She, I knew, would sympathize with me and shield me from the just wrath of my father who was away, but was due to return {{in an hour or}} two.|$|E
60|$|Of {{a rather}} {{turbulent}} description, it would seem; for her nightcap had been knocked {{off in the}} scuffle, and {{she was on her}} knees upon the floor, making a strange revelation of blue and yellow curl-papers, straggling locks of hair, tags of staylaces, and strings of it's impossible to say what; panting for breath, clasping her hands, turning her eyes upwards, shedding abundance of tears, and exhibiting various other symptoms of the acutest <b>mental</b> <b>suffering.</b>|$|E
60|$|That same afternoon, Lady Bellamy ordered out the {{victoria}} with the fast trotting horse, {{and drove to}} the Abbey House.

His face was pale, and contorted by <b>mental</b> <b>suffering,</b> and, as soon as he recognized Lady Bellamy, he made an effort to escape. She stopped him.|$|E

60|$|Fitzpiers's <b>mental</b> <b>sufferings</b> and {{suspense}} led him {{at last to}} take {{a melancholy}} journey to the neighborhood of Little Hintock; and here he hovered for hours around {{the scene of the}} purest emotional experiences that he had ever known in his life. He walked about the woods that surrounded Melbury's house, keeping out of sight like a criminal. It was a fine evening, and on his way homeward he passed near Marty South's cottage. As usual she had lighted her candle without closing her shutters; he saw her within as he had seen her many times before.|$|R

60|$|This was {{my first}} ghost. Once again have I seen a ghost.

If you {{measured}} by <b>mental</b> <b>suffering</b> it was like a hundred years; a longer time than all my life has been since. No, certainly, it was {{not so much as a}} minute. The hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died out in their dry throats, and then suddenly a voice spoke, a deep voice muttering calmly. It called upon me to turn round.|$|E

[...] I cried inwardly, as {{the night}} lingered and lingered--as my {{bleeding}} patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or <b>mental</b> <b>suffering,</b> or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.|$|E

Before night his doubt whether {{he may not be}} responsible for some inconceivable part in the catastrophe which is the talk of the whole neighbourhood is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs. Snagsby's pertinacity in that fixed gaze.
