40|$|The paper {{describes}} a bioeconomic {{model of the}} western and central Pacific tuna fisheries in which three <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> exploit four main tuna species following migratory paths through the Exclusive Economic Zones of 12 Pacific Island nations. The results of the model suggest that the net value of the fisheries can be increased substantially by reducing the overall amount of fishing effort and altering the balance of effort towards gear types which exploit older age classes of fish.

40|$|Gill-netting and rotenoning {{have been}} used for {{assessing}} and monitoring fish stock abundance in Volta Lake. The lake and the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> used on it have been described. Before a gill-net sampling plan was set up, a preliminary survey was undertaken which largely determined the final form of the plan. An investigation {{as to whether or not}} the lake was being overfished concluded that it was being underfished. Commercial and experimental catch data analyses disclosed that the adults of the small species were being little utilized. Commercial sized species were also not being harvested according to their apparent proportion in the population. Production is presently fluctuating between approximately 37, 000 and 40, 000 tonnes. A high correlation between commercial and experimental catch was realized. Developments which have followed in the wake of stock assessment and monitoring studies include: introduction of monofilament nylon net, development of a special scoop net to permit mass harvest of clupeids after they have been attracted to light, and the design of a larger canoe which would help to extend the fishery into open water. New regulation and management policies will have to be formulated in the light of new findings before a rational exploitation of all the species can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} (Caretta caretta, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most {{abundant}} sea turtle species in the Mediterranean Sea, where commercial fishing {{appears to be the}} main driver of mortality. So far, information on sea turtle bycatch in Italy is limited both in space and time due to logistical problems in data collected through onboard observations and on a limited number of vessels involved. In the present study, sea turtle bycatch in Italian waters was examined by collecting fishermen’s information on turtle bycatch through an interview-based approach. Their replies enabled the identification of bycatch hotspots in relation to area, season and to the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> The most harmful fishing gears resulted to be trawl nets, showing the highest probabilities of turtle bycatch with a hotspot in the Adriatic Sea, followed by longlines in the Ionian Sea and in the Sicily Channel. Estimates obtained by the present results showed that more than 52, 000 capture events and 10, 000 deaths occurred in Italian waters in 2014, highlighting a more alarming scenario than earlier studies. The work shows that in case of poor data from other sources, direct questioning of fishermen and stakeholders could represent a useful and cost-effective approach capable of providing sufficient data to estimate annual bycatch rates and identify high-risk gear/location/season combinations...|$|E
40|$|This {{data set}} {{includes}} {{the biological and}} environmental data {{for all of the}} species collected during the DP 01 (May 2015) and DP 02 cruises (August 2015). The <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> used was a 10 -m 2 Multiple Opening Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). The MOCNESS was fitted with 6 nets which were opened according to the following depth scheme: net 0 from the surface to 1500 m, net 1 from 1500 - 1200 m, net 2 from 1200 - 1000 m, net 3 from 1000 - 600 m, net 4 from 600 - 200 m, and net 5 from 200 m to the surface. Two trawls were conducted at each station sampled to capture diel vertical migration information; one during daylight hours between 9 am- 2 : 30 pm CDT, and the other at 9 pm- 2 : 30 am CDT. A dipnet and a neuston net were also used to collect sargassum and other animals from the surface for genetic and stable isotope analyses. A table of the taxonomic hierarchy used in the nekton database will be included with references to those scientific names recently updated which are not yet reflected by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (www. itis. gov). The MOCNESS sensor data and ship data collected during cruise DP 01 are available in GRIIDC datasets R 4. x 257. 226 : 0002 and R 4. x 257. 226 : 0003 respectively and for cruise DP 02 in GRIIDC datasets R 4. x 257. 226 : 0006 and R 4. x 257. 226 : 0011 respectively...|$|R
50|$|The Me 210's <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> {{followed}} some of {{the design}} philosophies that had resulted from the main change in the earlier Ju 88's <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> design, where each <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> had a single gear strut that twisted through 90° during retraction, to bring the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> wheel resting atop {{the lower end of}} the main strut when retracted rearwards into the wing. Unlike the Ju 88, however, the Me 210's <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> wheels were inboard of the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> struts when fully extended, while the Ju 88's were outboard of the struts.|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{indicators}} {{calculated from}} landings data have been extensively {{used to evaluate}} the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems. However, few studies have tested the possible effects of gear and spatial aggregation of landings data on different ecological indices over a long-term period. To do this, we applied the Marine Trophic Index (MTI) and Fishing in Balance (FiB) index to Greek landings data disaggregated by gear and area for the period between 1928 and 2010. Aggregated data showed an increase in MTI due to expansion of fisheries that was also confirmed in most of the disaggregated analysis conducted by fishing subareas and <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> On the other hand, disaggregated landings by gear and area provided additional insights: while aggregated landings showed no decline in MTI, disaggregated landings showed that 63 % of cases indicated an increase in MTI while 11 % showed a decline. When small pelagics and other species were excluded, these values changed to 42 % and 24 %, respectively. Thus, disaggregated data permitted the identification of ecologically meaningful critical situations with decreasing MTI, as has been observed in shallow enclosed gulfs in close proximity to large cities and/or for the main fishing grounds exploited for long periods by seiners (purse and beach). Moreover, disaggregating landings data by gear increased the ability of explaining observed trends, avoiding masking (averaging) effects and accounting for differential development and adaptability of different gear...|$|E
40|$|A {{universal}} multi-function {{leaf spring}} <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> {{was designed for}} light aircraft. The <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> combined with the leaf spring, skidding, and wheels enables it {{to have a good}} takeoff and landing performance on various grounds such as the hard, snow, grass and sand grounds.

5000|$|On most World War II single-engined fighter {{aircraft}} (and {{even one}} German heavy bomber design) with sideways retracting <b>main</b> <b>gear,</b> the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> that retracted into the wings {{was meant to}} be raked forward, towards the aircraft's nose in the [...] "down" [...] position for better ground handling, with a retracted position that placed the main wheels at some angle [...] "behind" [...] the <b>main</b> <b>gear's</b> attachment point to the airframe - this led to a complex angular geometry for setting up the angles for the retraction mechanism's axis of rotation, with some aircraft, like the P-47 Thunderbolt and Grumman Bearcat, even mandating that the <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> struts lengthen as they were extended down from the wings to assure proper ground clearance for their large four-bladed propellers. One exception to the need for this complexity in many WW II fighter aircraft was Japan's famous Zero fighter, whose <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> stayed at a perpendicular angle to the centerline of the aircraft when extended, as seen from the side.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a bioeconomic model is {{developed}} {{for a commercial}} fishery with multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> {{in the case of}} two independent fish species. Where most bioeconomic fishery models focus on either multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> or multiple species (mostly predator-prey relationships) this model combines both aspects for four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> and two independent fish species. The objective of the paper is to find the optimal allocation of four <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> per period to obtain the highest net benefits while harvesting at a sustainable rate. This is done by developing a discrete time LP-model for a sole owner fishery, given a Total Allowable Catch for the two fish species. The model is applied to the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation commercial fishery in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay (Ontario, Canada).

40|$|Abstract. Motorcycle is invented so {{far more}} than 100 years. Because of having the {{advantages}} of light weight, cheap and fast-moving, motorcycle becomes the most popular traffic vehicle. Traditionally, the power systems of motorcycles are internal combustion engines. Recently, due to the reason of energy-saving, and carbon reduction, the engine in motorcycle is substituted by electric motor. Hence, due to the reason of pollution-free, electric motorcycle {{become more and more}} popular in city traffic. Planetary gear trains can be used as the transmission systems for electric motorcycles. The purpose of this work is to do the kinematic design of three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions for electric motorcycles. First, according to the train value equation of planetary gear train, The reduction ratio equations of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions can be derived. Then, based on these reduction ratio equations, the kinematic design of three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmission is accomplished. Based on the proposed methodology, all three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions can be synthesized...|$|R
