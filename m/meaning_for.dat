5|$|A {{total of}} 36 sports, 51 {{disciplines}} and 364 medal events were contested in these Games. Basque pelota {{was the only}} sport dropped from the last games. Golf (after being added to the Olympic program for 2016) also made its Pan American Games debut. Canoe slalom, the only Olympic discipline never to have been held at the Games, also made its debut, <b>meaning</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time the}} entire Olympic sports program was contested. Furthermore, both canoe disciplines had C-1 events for women for the first time. Women's baseball and women's rugby sevens also made their debuts, with men's softball returning to the program, after last being contested in 2003. A total of 19 sports (the most ever) were direct or indirect (such as opportunities to gain qualification times) qualifiers for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of <b>meaning</b> <b>for</b> most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, {{in the sense that the}} convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical <b>meaning.</b> <b>For</b> example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E

5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no <b>meaning</b> <b>for</b> the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper <b>meaning</b> <b>for</b> the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

40|$|In highly evolved culture, {{discourse}} {{is made up}} of complexes of implicit and explicit inter-textual relations, which form the <b>meanings</b> <b>for</b> new signifiers. <b>Meanings</b> <b>for</b> common abstract nouns are derived from the modeling of typical situations in everyday narratives. However at a further level of abstraction, models of discourses, which themselves contain abstract concepts, provide <b>meanings</b> <b>for</b> what are called “hyper-abstract” nominals. Here a certain limit is reached, and it is argued that this diachronic, onomasiological process provides a constraint on the notion of “unlimited semiosis. ” This constraint has both natural and ethical aspects.
