Five days later, <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months.

5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> in the 1950s.|$|E

In 1926, his father became {{a researcher at}} the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic,</b> and the family moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where Alvarez attended Rochester High School. He had always expected to attend the University of California, but at the urging of his teachers at Rochester, he instead went to the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1932, his master's degree in 1934, and his PhD in 1936. As an undergraduate, he belonged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. As a postgraduate he moved to Gamma Alpha.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses.

The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> and the University of Minnesota sued {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments {{in favor of the}} United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> {{noted that}} it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them to pay back taxes. In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury {{announced}} that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 million annually, or $3,100 a year for a resident earning $50,000 a year (and equivalent amount for the resident's employer).|$|E

5|$|Yang and Hunt {{distance}} themselves from {{each other as they}} keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic,</b> Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic,</b> but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.|$|E

In 1913, he was posted to the NWMP Headquarters in Regina to assist in the organization of the Criminal Investigation Branch. In August he was granted a leave of absence {{when he went to the}} <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> at Rochester to undergo surgery to repair an undisclosed rupture and remove his appendix.

5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon.

He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E
50|$|The hair {{perforation}} test, {{also known}} as an in vitro hair perforation test, is a laboratory test used to help distinguish the isolates of dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and its variants.

The <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic's</b> mycology laboratory has identified five common dermatophytes; Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton tonsurans.|$|R
