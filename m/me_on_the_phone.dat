5000|$|Beginning in 1968, Lynch {{became a}} major {{contributor}} to Topps' Wacky Packages and Garbage Pail Kids, plus other Topps humor products. In 2002, he recalled his creative working methods and procedures with Len Brown and others at the Topps' Product Development Department: I would get a phone call from Len Brown or Art Spiegelman telling me {{it was time for me}} to do some roughs for a new series of Wacky Packages. I would usually submit a dozen roughs at a time. Len would tell <b>me,</b> usually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> which food conglomerates I could not parody, based on cease and desist letters from prior series. I had a master list of taboo companies - and this would be added to, by phone, until a new master list would be compiled and sent to me. In those days I had a pretty good working knowledge of who made what, though. So I would give Len a verbal list of maybe 20 or so products, of which he would pick a dozen. Sometimes he would suggest products, sometimes he would come up with <b>the</b> gag title <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and I would add to it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rough. Sometimes Spiegelman, or Bhob Stewart, or Woody Gelman would <b>phone</b> <b>the</b> assignment to me. In the 80s, Mark Newgarden would <b>phone</b> <b>the</b> assignment to me. In the 90s Ira Friedman would <b>phone</b> <b>the</b> assignment to me. But mostly it would be Len. I think in the 60s I got $8 a rough. By the 70s it had gone up to $20 a rough. By the 80s it was $125 a rough, and so on. What I got for a rough always remained the same amount in actual buying power. It has gone up with inflation, though. One rough pays about the same as a week's worth of groceries. Always has - and always will. Anyway - after I had some idea of the initial dozen products that I would parody, I would go to the supermarket and buy these products. Sometimes I would get ideas for additional products as well - and Topps would reimburse me for this cost of the actual products when I would send them the receipt along with my bill, which I would enclose with each batch of roughs. These roughs were done in India ink and colored with Magic Markers. I would just send them in by regular mail, and I didn't bother to retain Xerox copies of them until the mid-1970s when the drugstore down the block from my house installed a pay Xerox machine. I was living in Chicago then. I would only go to Brooklyn to meet with the Topps guys once every six months or so. Usually this was to work on a vast variety of other Topps and Bazooka projects. Wacky Packages was just one of the countless series in development then, only one in ten of which would ever see the light of day.|$|R

5000|$|Attending the University of Toronto, Kenner studied under Marshall McLuhan, {{who wrote}} the {{introduction}} to Kenner's first book Paradox in Chesterton, about G. K. Chesterton's works. Kenner's second book, The Poetry of Ezra Pound (1951) was dedicated to McLuhan, who had introduced Kenner to Pound on June 4, 1948, during Pound's incarceration at St. Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, D.C., where Kenner and McLuhan had driven as a detour from their trip from Toronto to New Haven, Connecticut. (Pound, who became a friend of Kenner's, had suggested the book be titled The Rose in the Steel Dust.) Later, Kenner said of McLuhan, [...] "I {{had the advantage of}} being exposed to Marshall when he was at his most creative, and then of getting {{to the far end of}} the continent shortly afterward, when he couldn't get <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> all the time.
