40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} the {{increasing}} medicalization {{of birth and}} the surge in Caesarean sections {{in order to examine}} how this phenomenon relates to the dominant modernization discourse on women's lives in contemporary Turkey. We analyze women's modes of resistance and conformity to medicalization of birth through qualitative data from 15 focus groups of Turkish women as well as from physicians and <b>midwives.</b> <b>We</b> found out that Turkish women generally submit to medicalized birth, despite unpleasent experiences of hospital birth. We argue that the discourse of modernization and traditional patriarchy both play a role in women's submission to medicalization of birth; and we demonstrate the patterns through which these discourses collaborate in establishing the meaning of childbirth in Turkey. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|Compromised {{babies are}} {{routinely}} immediately {{separated from the}} umbilical cord {{in order to be}} resuscitated. The benefits of delayed cord clamping are numerous and apply as much, if not more, to the non-breathing baby, thus it is important to ask ‘does early cord clamping cause harm?’ The evidence suggests that early cord clamping can cause bradycardia in the baby and create the need for resuscitation. Invasive measures such as drugs and volume expanders are not required as frequently when delayed cord clamping is practised. Allowing the placenta to perform its role in the resuscitation means that oxygen supply continues, despite the failure to achieve effective respiration immediately. There appears to be no adverse psychological affects for the mother and birth partner if adequate midwifery support is provided.

40|$|Drawing on an {{exploratory}} qualitative case study investigating everyday practices within an antenatal clinic in rural Uganda, this paper investigates {{the dynamics of}} consent and counselling within a prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programme, {{from the perspectives of}} various health professionals involved at different stages of the PMTCT trajectory. The paper contributes to the existing literature by focusing not on clients' views but, rather, by elucidating how different cadres of health workers view and practice the human rights principles of informed consent and opting out, that are reflected in Uganda's HIV testing policies. By investigating the roles and responsibilities of community counsellors, post-test counsellors, and <b>midwives,</b> <b>we</b> illustrate how the practice of counselling in PMTCT is influenced by two hegemonic discourses: the health of a child should be protected, and the health worker knows best. As a result, a directive form of counselling in PMTCT settings, with its focus on the health of the baby, silences women's right to opt out of HIV tests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the impact on}} adult health status of expansion in access to midwifery services. In the early 1990 s the Government of Indonesia began the Village Midwife (Bidan Desa) program to train midwives {{and place them in}} villages and townships throughout Indonesia. We use data from the 1993 and 1997 rounds of the Indonesia Family Life Survey. Between 1993 and 1997, the fraction of IFLS communities with a Village Midwife more than quadrupled, increasing from 10 % to almost 45 %. The statistical models that we estimate address the issue of non-random placement of midwives by examining change in health status as a function of whether the community gained (or lost) a Village <b>Midwife.</b> <b>We</b> measure health status as Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a standard measure of adult nutritional status. Our results show that for women under 50, increases in BMI were significantly more likely among those who lived in communities that gained a Village Midwife. Gaining a village midwife appears to have had no impact on men’s health status or on the health status women over 50 as a group.

40|$|The art of midwifery {{must be one}} of {{the oldest}} of {{acquired}} skills. In prehistoric times, the more experienced women assisted and comforted their younger relatives during parturition. There are scattered references to midwives in ancient literature, including the Bible. In Genesis 35 : 17 we learn that Rachel’s death was the result of “ hard labour”. One should congratulate the midwife who delivered Sarah of a son at the age of 90 years - Genesis 17 : 17. Midwifery stagnated during the Middle Ages due, partly to the ignorance of the midwives as well as to a lack of knowledge of human anatomy coupled with the accepted teaching of the ancients, which was regarded as the ultimate authority. Great advances in the art and science of midwifery have occurred since the Middle Ages, amounting to a revolution in thought and practice. Less than 100 years ago, in 1898, in W. S. Playfair’s “Science and Practice of Midwifery” no mention was made of any form of antenatal examination or even of the testing of urine for albumin.

The preconceptional and prenatal period is considered as the ideal teaching moment for smoking cessation counseling, therefore women should be informed about benefits of smoking cessation programs. Purpose The national campaign in Belgium, in which counseling was partially reimbursed, had little success with pregnant women. Therefore we want to examine if gynecologists and midwives know the risks of smoking {{during pregnancy}}, what their attitudes are regarding smoking cessation and what they advise their clients. Method We used a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with gynecologists and <b>midwives.</b> <b>We</b> used content analysis to interpret the transcribed verbatim and to extract emergent themes and codes. In order to control subjectivity in analysis triangulation was used. Ethics approval was received from the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Ghent. Written informed consent was obtained prior to the interview and participants were assured of confidentiality.

40|$|Background: The {{village midwife}} {{is a central}} element of Indonesia’s {{strategy}} to improve {{maternal and child health}} and family planning services. Recently there has been concern that the midwives were not present in the villages to which they had been assigned. To {{determine the extent to which}} this was the case we conducted a field-based census and survey of village midwives in three districts in West Java Province, Indonesia.

40|$|Background/Aims: There {{is clear}} and {{important}} evidence that upright positions {{in the first stage}} of labour reduces the duration of labour, the risk of caesarean birth and the need for epidural. Despite this evidence, conventional hospital labour management continues to restrict mobility and confine women to birthing beds. The aim {{of this study was to}} find evidence based, new and innovative ways of promoting the use of upright and mobile positions for women who labour in conventional hospital settings. Methods: A literature review was conducted. The areas of focus included the reasons why, where, when and how promoting freedom of movement for women during labour could be achieved. Gaps and trends in research knowledge were considered. Strategies to overcome the theory-practice gap were developed for consultation and implementation. Results: Results indicate that optimising freedom of movement for women in labour requires a twopronged approach. Firstly, research evidence must inform birth policies and guidelines. Secondly, policies and guidelines must inform labour ward design and midwifery intrapartum care. Each stage is equally important, as freedom of movement for women in labour can be restricted because of intrapartum policy and/or environment and/or care. Conclusion: As <b>midwives,</b> <b>we</b> are obliged to inform women of the benefits to themselves and their babies of being upright and mobile during labour. In order to optimise freedom of movement for women during labour, we must actively promote and implement mobility-friendly birth policies and practices in our conventional labour ward settings...|$|R
40|$|Night {{shift work}} has been thought {{to play a role}} in the {{etiology}} of chronic diseases through a disruption of the circadian rhythm, decreased synthesis of melatonin and sleep deprivation. Our aim was to review the epidemiological studies on the association between night shift work and some pathologies in nurses and <b>midwives.</b> <b>We</b> reviewed publications available in the MEDLINE database and published before June 2012, describing the cross-sectional (almost two thirds of all papers) and cohort studies. In total, we identified 26 original papers, including 5 epidemiological studies addressing diseases or disorders of the digestive system, 3 - metabolic syndrome, 2 - diabetes type 2, 9 - cardiovascular diseases and CVD risk factors, 5 - obesity/overweight, 2 - menstrual disorders and 3 - poor pregnancy outcomes. The analysis of the literature indicates that night shift work of nurses and midwives is most strongly associated with a higher risk of obesity/overweight. In each of the five studies, which we identified this association was observed (confirmed by the statistical significance of the results), also after adjustment for confounders. The results for diabetes type 2 and disorders of the menstrual cycle are also suggestive. Epidemiological data on the other disorders or pathologies discussed in this article seem to be less certain - their results are inconsistent or their number is too small to draw definite conclusions. Further epidemiological studies of nurses and midwives working on night shifts and prospective observations in particular are recommended to find out whether potential association between the night work and discussed health issues is causal.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the potential of private practitioners (PP) in TB control in Jogjakarta by assessing their load of TB suspects and case-management practices. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of {{a random sample of}} 164 PP, weighted to the local proportions of specialists, general practitioners (GP), nurses and <b>midwives.</b> <b>We</b> investigated their knowledge of directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS), whether they see TB suspects, whether they refer such patients and how they possibly diagnose and treat TB. RESULTS: We sampled 174 PP, of which 164 (94. 3 %) completed the interview. Most PP (63. 4 %) reported to have seen TB suspects in their private practice, and 62. 8 % were also employed in a DOTS facility. Specialists saw on average 18 suspects, GP 11 suspects, and nurses-midwives three suspects in a year. Many PP (45. 2 %) always relied on National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP) services for diagnosis. Fewer PP (41. 5 %) used, by themselves, diagnostic procedures complying with the NTP guidelines. The majority (63. 6 %) always referred confirmed cases for treatment, mainly (71. 4 %) to NTP services. Most PP (72. 7 %) who treated TB patients themselves did not prescribe the NTP standard regimen. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the TB case load per PP is low in Jogjakarta, where the NTP already involves public and private hospitals besides public health centres.

A general introduction to the geographical and socio-economic situation of the choosen area and an exposition of the complicated structure of the medical profession before 1865 are followed by a survey of the information provided by the two main sources used for this study; the annual official lists of all persons admitted to medical practice and the annual reports of the governmental medical commission about the state of medicine in this area. These dates have been complemented with biographical and local historical details. Of this group of 21 medical doctors, 178 non-graduated doctors and surgeons and 45 <b>midwives,</b> <b>we</b> studied the geographical distribution, the factors influencing their practice (the service as naval surgeons, the keeping of second-dispensaries, the holding of other social positions), the age distribution of the several professional groups, their social position, family relations, educational background, and the main activities in their daily practice, i. e. the obstetrical practice, the supply of medicaments, the vaccination and their surgical work.

With our fieldwork we got the chance, through Tromsø Mine Victim Resource Centre (TMC) and Dr Margit Steinholt, to interview midwives and pregnant women in a rural area of Cambodia. Our study evolved to investigate nutrition during pregnancy, with the aim of surveying the participants’ knowledge of nutrition during pregnancy and what their sources were for this knowledge. We also wanted to inquire if there was a difference between the pregnant women’s knowledge and action, and if so, what factors could explain this discrepancy. Material and methods: We conducted a qualitative study interviewing eleven participants; four midwives and seven pregnant women. We used an interpreter, translating between English and Khmer, the mother language in Cambodia. During the interviews we used both structured and semi-structured interview techniques. The interviews were recorded and later transcribed. Results and conclusion: Our findings showed that the knowledge of nutrition during pregnancy amongst the midwives evolved around essential groups of food and the importance of eating from all these groups. For the pregnant women there was a greater variation in their knowledge, ranging from eating the same as before getting pregnant to having a focus on a varied nutrition and taking precautions. There was a wide range of sources for the pregnant women’s knowledge other than the <b>midwives.</b> <b>We</b> discovered that there was a discrepancy between the pregnant women’s knowledge and their application of it.

Conclusions Compared to an earlier survey in an adjacent province, the village midwives in these three districts were younger, had spent less time in the village and a higher proportion were permanent civil servants. A high proportion had moved in the previous year with most moving to a health center or another village. The decision to move, as well as the mix of services offered, seems to be largely driven by opportunities to increase their private practice income. These opportunities are greater in urban areas. As urbanization procedes the forces drawing village midwives away from the village are certain to strengthen. This will require a reassessment of the original service model embodied in the village midwife concept and a new approach to reducing maternal mortality. </p...|$|R

The 2 ̆ 7 Watching your Weight in Pregnancy 2 ̆ 7 project, being delivered by the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, got underway in December 2011 to address the rising levels of obesity across the southern area. It also aims to reduce the impact that obesity can have on the health of women and their unborn children during pregnancy and birth. Two pilot programmes are currently underway in the Kilkeel area teaching both antenatal and post natal women that feeling good about yourself and your baby is important during pregnancy. The programmes provide information about managing weight during and after pregnancy and include advice on good nutrition along with opportunities to take part in appropriate physical activities. As part of the project, there have also been training sessions for midwives in the Southern HSC Trust on healthier eating and physical activity during pregnancy. Patricia McStay, Southern Trust Head of Midwifery, explained why there was a need for this project: "Every woman wants a healthy baby and we are supporting the women to improve their own health and wellbeing. We have been seeing increasing numbers of women who are overweight or obese at their first contact with the <b>midwife.</b> <b>We</b> want to support these women to manage their weight gain in pregnancy to reduce the risk of experiencing health complications such as high blood pressure, and diabetes in pregnancy.

40|$|Post partum {{haemorrhage}} (PPH) and retained placenta are {{the most}} common serious abnormalities encountered during the third stage of labour. PPH {{is one of the most}} common causes of mortality in childbirth, particularly in developing countries. The incidences of PPH and retained placenta have decreased with the use of synthetic oxytocin and controlled cord traction (CCT). Weather such treatment is valuable is open to question because of the lack of clinical and physiological studies. Unfortunately, oxytocic drugs are not available to about half the women of developing countries, who do not deliver under the care of a trained <b>midwife.</b> <b>We</b> know that sucking stimulates uterine contractions in lactating women. This effect is probably mediated by the high plasma oxytocin levels that occur during preparations for breast-feeding and again within 3 min of the start of sucking. Traditional birth attendants (TBAs) do not have the skill to administer injectable oxytoxics. It has become the practice in some TBA training programmes to teach that the risk of PPH can be reduced if the mother puts her baby to the breast immediately after delivery. Objective: To determine the effect of sucking immediately after childbirth on the length of 3 rh stage and amount of bleeding in the first day. This is a semi-experimental study. It was done in Tehran'e Mirzakochak hospital. 100 women received oxytocin intramuscularly and 120 women were placed in sucking group. Then the lenghth of 3 rd stage and amount of bleeding in the first day was compared between two groups. Results: The duration of the third stage and number of pads different between oxytocin group and sucking group (4. 42 vs 6. 08 min) and (10. 58 vs 11. 72 number). As for the, parity, gestational age, maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressure, infant weight and hight, the results showed no significant difference between the groups. As for the, maternal age, the results showed differed significantly between the groups. As for the gestational age, the results of the research showed that between the gestational age and the duration of the third stage, there was a reverse correlation in multipare women.

40|$|Background: Spatial {{accessibility}} {{indices are}} increasingly applied when investigating inequalities in health. Although most studies are making mentions of potential errors {{caused by the}} edge effect, many acknowledge having neglected to consider this concern by establishing spatial analyses within a finite region, settling for hypothesizing that accessibility to facilities will be under-reported. Our study seeks to assess the effect of edge on the accuracy of defining healthcare provider access by comparing healthcare provider accessibility accounting or not for the edge effect, in a real-world application. Methods: This study {{was carried out in}} the department of Nord, France. The statistical unit we use is the French census block known as 'IRIS' (Ilot Regroupe pour l'Information Statistique), defined by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. The geographical accessibility indicator used is the "Index of Spatial Accessibility" (ISA), based on the E 2 SFCA algorithm. We calculated ISA for the pregnant women population by selecting three types of healthcare providers: general practitioners, gynecologists and <b>midwives.</b> <b>We</b> compared ISA variation when accounting or not edge effect in urban and rural zones. The GIS method was then employed to determine global and local autocor-relation. Lastly, we compared the relationship between socioeconomic distress index and ISA, when accounting or not for the edge effect, to fully evaluate its impact. Results: The results revealed that on average ISA when offer and demand beyond the boundary were included is slightly below ISA when not accounting for the edge effect, and we found that the IRIS value was more likely to deteriorate than improve. Moreover, edge effect impact can vary widely by health provider type. There is greater variability within the rural IRIS group than within the urban IRIS group. We found a positive correlation between socioeconomic distress variables and composite ISA. Spatial analysis results (such as Moran's spatial autocorrelation index and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation) are not really impacted. Conclusion: Our research has revealed minor accessibility variation when edge effect has been considered in a French context. No general statement can be set up because intensity of impact varies according to healthcare provider type, territorial organization and methodology used to measure the accessibility to healthcare. Additional researches are required in order to distinguish what findings are specific to a territory and others common to different countries. It constitute a promising direction to determine more precisely healthcare shortage areas and then to fight against social health inequalities...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the most frequent nursing diagnoses and interventions in physiological newborn. First aim was to map the most frequent nursing diagnoses at physiological newborn ward in hospital Nemocnice České Budějovice a. s. Two hypotheses were proposed. H 1 : The most frequent nursing diagnosis in physiological newborn is ineffective breast-feeding. H 2 : Nursing diagnoses in physiological newborn will differ in connection to the type of delivery. The second aim was to learn how the nurses and midwives decide on nursing diagnoses, aims and interventions. The research question posed for this aim was: How are nursing diagnoses, aims and nursing interventions decided in physiological newborns? A combination of qualitative and quantitative research was used in order to obtain quality data. Its collection was conducted through nursing documentation analysis and in-depth half-structured interviews. This research was conducted in March 2015 at Physiological newborn ward at hospital Nemocnice České Budějovice a. s. The interviews were analysed by open coding using pen and paper method. Individual codes were collected into subcategories and then categories. The first research group comprised of 5 paediatric nurses and 1 midwife working at the physiological newborn ward of České Budějovice hospital aged 26 to 46. The second research group consisted of 107 physiological infants born either naturally or by caesarean section. The answers of the respondents show their general knowledge about nursing diagnosis but also about some shortcomings in their de termination. Insufficient knowledge was found regarding stating aims and interventions due to the midwives and nurses trusting predefined nursing diagnoses, aims and interventions most often used at the ward and usually choose from them. Nursing diagnoses were also found the same for infants born to first-time mothers and multigravidas and the generally most frequent diagnosis is ineffective breast-feeding. Obtained results can serve as basis for simplification of working with nursing diagnoses and preventing making mistakes in the determination. Considering the insufficiencies in determination of nursing diagnoses, aims and interventions found in the nurses and <b>midwives,</b> <b>we</b> suggest they use this work as model basis. The research results also show that the most frequent nursing diagnosis is ineffective breast-feeding. A form for expecting mothers, that can simultaneously function as educational material was created {{as a response to the}} results. We hope this form will enable easier determination of nursing diagnoses and interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the techniques of midwife by tracing the practicing midwives who have lived for Taisho, Showa, Heisei. The method of investigation is to have interview. The results are as follows. The techniques of midwife during the pregnancy, the intrapartum period, and the puerperal period are accepted absolutely today. The current of the criticism for controlled delivery at present hospital and the revolution for natural delivery supposes that delivery advances physically and naturally. <b>We</b> <b>midwives</b> should support natural delivery, establishment the feed on mother s milk, and childrearing and so on, to demonstrate the specialty of midwife. And in the end, we think ［Giving Birth and Being Born as a Human］ is guaranteed. 本論文の目的は、大正、昭和、平成と生きた開業助産婦の軌跡をたどることによって、助産技術を考察した。研究方法は、面接による聞き取り調査を行った。その結果、妊娠期、分娩期、産褥期における助産技術は、現代にもまったく通ずるものであった。現代の病院管理分娩への批判、自然分娩への回帰などは、分娩が生理的で自然に進むものであるという前提ありきの流れである。われわれ助産師は、正常で自然な分娩への援助、そして母乳栄養確立への援助、育児援助など、助産師の専門性を発揮するための援助を確実にしなければならない。そのことがひいては「人として産み、生まれること」の保障をもたらすことにつながると考える...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Work related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{are common in}} midwiferypractice which requires extensive labor-intensive tasks. Therefore midwives are prone to{{musculoskeletal disorders}}. This study aims at investigating the risk factors and musculoskeletalsymptoms among in <b>midwives.</b> Method: <b>we</b> conducted this cross-sectional study in Hamedan, western Iran. Active Midwives(n= 134) {{were asked to complete}} the questionnaires (demographic and a version of the Nordicquestionnaire) if they had at least 1 year experience in practice and were not pregnant during theprevious year. 102 Midwives completed the questionnaires. Data were analysed by SPSS v. 10 software. Results: 66. 7 % of the Midwives reported some musculoskeletal symptoms, of whom 54 % waswork related. The most common musculoskeletal symptoms were low back pain (50 %), shouldersand wrists (46 %). There were significant associations between musculoskeletal symptoms andmarital status (p< 0. 001), duration of employment (p< 0. 02), shift work (p< 0. 0001), work place(p< 0. 002) and hours per month spent for performing tasks (p< 0. 01). However, there was nosignificant association between the symptoms and age, BMI, and the number of childbirth. 51. 9 %of Midwives required treatment, 33. 3 % missed work for seven days or more and 22. 2 % changedtheir work place.

40|$|The {{mentoring}} of new {{researchers and}} caregivers by senior nursing and midwifery professionals {{is vital to}} continue delivering quality health outcomes for patients, according to Chair of Clinical Nursing at Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s Fremantle Campus, Professor Leanne Monterosso. Professor Monterosso says there is an expectation for up-to-date health practice from consumers, health care funders and insurance providers, with nurses and midwives needing to possess a broad skills set to make critical patient-related decisions. Professor Monterosso addressed these points and others while delivering an oration titled Nursing and Midwifery Research: changing lives, changing practice at the third Biennial Nursing and Midwifery Oration Series at St John of God Murdoch Hospital, Western Australia. The event {{was sponsored by the}} Department of Health in partnership with St John of God Health Care and The University of Notre Dame Australia. The oration covered several important topics including research initiatives undertaken in neo-natal health care, the partnerships between tertiary institutions and health care providers in training and mentoring student nurses and midwives, and the complex nature of palliative care and the care options available to patients and their families regardless of the outcome from the initial diagnosis. Professor Monterosso said the impact of work undertaken by nurse and midwife researchers could lead to improved patient care and quality of life outcomes, an evidence base for nursing and midwifery curricula and clinical guidelines, and the training and support of the next generation of clinical nurses, researchers and educators. 2 ̆ 2 Within the private tertiary and health care sectors in WA, St John of God Health Care and The University of Notre Dame Australia, whilst still fledgling research institutions, are demonstrating strong leadership by increasing their commitment to research across nursing, medical, surgical and mental health with the aim of improving patient outcomes, 2 ̆ 2 Professor Monterosso said during her oration. 2 ̆ 2 As researchers, our objective is not only to improve the outcomes for patients and their families, but to ensure they receive the best care possible. 2 ̆ 2 We are constantly reminded, and acutely aware, that patients have a right and expectation to receive the best evidence based care – that is; the right treatment, at the right time, in the right place. 2 ̆ 2 Nursing and midwifery research does make a difference. It changes practice and changes lives. As nurses and <b>midwives,</b> <b>we</b> must embrace our profession, change it, improve it and make our mark upon it. 2 ̆ 2 Students studying the Bachelor of Nursing course at Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s Fremantle Campus are required to undertake more than 400 hours of clinical practice each year in a variety of hospital, community and private health care settings under the guidance of registered professionals.

40|$|Amphibian chytridiomycosis, {{caused by}} the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is an {{emerging}} infectious disease that widely threatens amphibian biodiversity. However, population-level outcomes following {{the introduction of the}} pathogen are highly context dependent and are mediated by a broad suite of biotic and abiotic variables. Here, we examine the effect of the introduction of Bd on native island populations of the IUCN red-listed amphibian species Alytes muletensis, the Mallorcan <b>midwife</b> toad. <b>We</b> show that the outcome of pathogen introduction is not only dependent on biotic factors, but is also dependent on environmental factors that vary across local scales. Our experimental infections confirm that the genotype of Bd occurring on Mallorca is hypovirulent in A. muletensis when compared against the lineage found occurring on mainland Iberia. Long-term population data show that A. muletensis populations on the island are increasing overall, but trends in highly infected populations are conflicting. We use mathematical models and field data to demonstrate that this divergence in population response to infection can be explained by local environmental differences between infected sites, whereas pathogen genetics, host genetics, and intrinsic epidemiological dynamics driven by fungal load {{are less likely to be}} the cause of these differing population trajectories. Our results illustrate the need to take into account the appropriate environmental scale and context when assessing the risk that an emerging pathogen presents to a naïve population or species. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.

40|$|Background & aim: Perinatal {{mental health}} {{problems}} have been demonstrated to impact upon maternal, and fetal/child outcomes. Despite the global evidence and a policy-driven responsibility for identification of these problems, research demonstrates that student midwives/midwives lack knowledge and confidence to assess, identify, and manage them. A similar context is evident for learning disabilities, despite the holistic care philosophy of midwifery. A brief assessment tool to identify knowledge and confidence defecits and strengths within a holistic care framework could support curriculum development. This study sought to develop a Perinatal Mental Health Awareness scale and evaluate its psychometric properties in student <b>midwives.</b> Methods: <b>We</b> employed a cross-sectional and exploratory instrument development and evaluation design to determine the measurement veracity of the new scale. Results: The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, revealing three subscales mapping onto (i) mental health symptoms, (ii) physical/medical issues and (iii) learning disability. Results indicated a clear differentiation in scores across the subscales, indicating comparative deficits in mental health domains. Conclusion: Our findings facilitate confidence in the psychometric robustness of the measure. The scale enables student midwives to assess and compare different domains of midwifery practice, in line with a holistic model of midwifery care. A focus on physical health in midwifery education appears to disadvantage knowledge and confidence for managing {{mental health problems}} in a midwifery context. This valuable finding highlights the potential need for curriculum rebalancing. The measure offers the opportunity to assess and develop curriculum/training provision and monitor the effectiveness of subsequent curricular developments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} 10 years, Australia's {{spontaneous}} vaginal birth rate has decreased approximately 1 % {{each year and}} the caesarean section rate has increased approximately 1 % each year. This trend has serious implications {{for the health of}} women and babies. As <b>midwives</b> <b>we</b> are the caretakers of normal birth and therefore partly responsible for its decline and the solution to its decline. Although antenatal education is in a potentially powerful position to promote normal birth, a structured review conducted as part of this thesis found that it does not realise that potential. Currently framed in pathogenesis, antenatal education in particular and maternity services in general, are in need of reframing. The theory of salutogenesis may offer a new lens as it focuses on health rather than illness. Sense of coherence is the cornerstone of salutogenesis and is a predictive indicator of health. What is unclear is the role pregnant women's sense of coherence plays in their birthing outcomes. This study explored associations between pregnant women's sense of coherence, their pregnancy choices, their anticipated labour choices, their labour and birthing outcomes as well as factors associated with modification to sense of coherence from the antenatal to postnatal periods. Methods: After a comprehensive review of the literature, questionnaire development and psychometric tool testing and modification, a longitudinal survey was conducted where eligible women completed a questionnaire before the 30 th week of pregnancy (Phase One) and approximately 8 weeks after birth (Phase Two). Eligible women were less than 30 weeks pregnant with a single fetus, could read and write in English and lived in the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. Phase One provided information on women's sense of coherence scores, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores, Support Behaviour Inventory (SBI) scores, pregnancy choices including care proVider, planned place of birth, planned birth type and anticipated epidural use and demographics. Phase Two provided information on women's sense of coherence scores, EPDS scores and their labour and birthing outcomes. Findings: 1074 women completed Phase One representing a 61. 3 % response rate. 753 women completed Phase Two representing a 70. 1 % retention rate between phases. Compared to women with low sense of coherence, women with high sense of coherence were older, reported fewer pregnancy conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, were less likely to have depressive symptoms, were more likely to feel well supported, were less likely to experience a caesarean section and more likely to experience an assisted vaginal birth. Sense of coherence was not associated with women's pregnancy choices. Higher EPDS scores, lower sense of coherence and greater satisfaction with birth were associated with an increase in women's sense of coherence from the antenatal to the postnatal period. Decreased birth satisfaction and experiencing epidural anaesthesia in labour and assisted vaginal birth were associated with a decrease in sense of coherence from the antenatal to the postnatal period. Conclusion: Strong sense of coherence in pregnant women halved the likelihood of experiencing caesarean section compared to women with low sense of coherence. Sense of coherence is a modifiable predictor of women's childbearing health and was found to be raised by birth satisfaction and lowered by birth dissatisfaction and labour interventions. These important findings add to the limited body of knowledge about sense of coherence and childbearing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDomestic {{violence}} in pregnancy {{is a significant}} health concern for women around the world. Globally, {{much has been written}} about how the health sector can respond effectively and comprehensively to domestic violence during pregnancy via antenatal services. The evidence from low-income settings is, however, limited. Sri Lanka is internationally acknowledged as a model amongst low-income countries for its maternal and child health statistics. Yet, very little research has considered the perspectives and experiences of the key front line health providers for pregnant women in Sri Lanka, public health <b>midwives</b> (PHMs). <b>We</b> address this gap by consulting PHMs about their experiences identifying and responding to pregnant women affected by domestic {{violence in}} an underserved area: the tea estate sector of Badulla district. Over two months in late 2014, our interdisciplinary team of social scientists and medical doctors met with 31 estate PHMs for group interviews and a participatory workshop at health clinics across Badulla district. In the paper, we propose a modified livelihoods model to conceptualise the physical, social and symbolic assets, strategies and constraints that simultaneously enable and limit the effectiveness of community-based health care responses to domestic violence. Our findings also highlight conceptual and practical strategies identified by PHMs to ensure improvements in this complex landscape of care. Such strategies include estate-based counselling services; basic training in family counselling and mediation for PHMs; greater surveillance of abusive men's behaviours by male community leaders; and performance evaluation and incentives for work undertaken to respond to domestic violence. The study contributes to international discussions on the meanings, frameworks, and identities constructed at the local levels of health care delivery in the global challenge to end domestic violence. In turn, such knowledge adds to international debates on the roles and responsibilities of health care professionals in responding to and preventing domestic violence...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{significant}} IR issues through the year was the Organisation's rejection of phase two of Sustaining Progress. However, as it was accepted by ICTU, to which we are affiliated as an Organisation, we decided, following consultation with members and activists, to accept the majority will of ICTU. This whole area is under constant review. In particular our legitimate demands for a 35 ·hour week, {{the removal of the}} pay anomaly which resulted in registered nurses being paid significantly less than less qualified healthcare workers, and our substantive claim for parity with other degree level health professionals remain alive, active and our major priority. In the past year we finally saw engagement, with health service management, on the implementation of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD). This directive, which will significantly change the attendance patterns of NCHDs, has the potential to radically alter the working practices of clinical nurses and <b>midwives.</b> In 2004 <b>we</b> only began this process but I know this issue, which involves examination of the extended role, scope of practice {{and the role of the}} healthcare assistant, will be a second priority issue in 2005.

40|$|Objectives: To {{present the}} {{conflicts}} in birth deliveries assisted by nurse midwife and propose ways to minimize them. Methods: We researched the historical evolution of childbirth and {{the actions that}} were necessary for the training of professionals. Codes of Ethics of Nursing and Medicine, the current law, basic books of obstetrics and gynecology, articles from medical and nursing journals, with Lilacs and Medline as data sources; laic texts and others from non-governmental organizations (NGO) were surveyed. Conflicts were identified in birth deliveries by nurse <b>midwife,</b> for which <b>we</b> propose ways of acting. Results: The analysis of research material shows that the time of delivery, initially at home and afterwards in institutions, brought interventionism in this activity; that social and human aspects of birth and delivery were minimized and birth delivery changed into medical act. We found a strong link between the focus in humanization at child delivery and its assistance by nurses. Conclusions: We conclude that even with legal and ethical support the delivery care by nurse midwife {{is a source of}} conflict between the health team, particularly with regard to the limits of performance of the nurse and doctor. Such conflicts must be identified and discussed in the institutions and they should invest in teamwork and have clear protocols defining boundaries of responsibility...|$|R

40|$|PRINCIPLES: The {{prevalence}} of early postpartum mental health conditions is high. Midwives {{and other health}} professionals visiting women at home may identify mothers at risk. This seems crucial given decreasing trends of length of hospital stay after childbirth. This study aimed to identify predictors of maternal mental distress in a midwifery home care setting. METHODS: Using the statistical database of independent midwives' services in Switzerland in 2007, we conducted a matched nested case-control study. Out of a source population of 34, 295 mothers with midwifery home care in the first ten days after childbirth, 935 mothers with maternal distress and 3, 645 controls, matched by <b>midwife,</b> were included. <b>We</b> analysed whether socio-demographic, maternal and neonatal factors predict maternal mental distress by multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Infant crying problems and not living with a partner were the strongest predictors for maternal distress, whereas higher parity was the most protective factor. Significantly elevated risks were also found for older age, lower educational levels, breast/breastfeeding problems, infant weight gain concerns, neonatal pathologies and use of midwifery care during pregnancy. A lower likelihood for maternal distress was seen for non-Swiss nationality, full-time employment before birth, intention {{to return to work}} after birth and midwife-led birth. CONCLUSION: The study informs on predictors of maternal mental distress identified in a home care setting in the early postpartum period. Midwives and other health care professionals should pay particular attention to mothers of excessively crying infants, single mothers and primipara, and assess the need for support of these mothers...|$|R
40|$|Maternity care is an {{integrated}} care process, {{which consists of}} different services, involves different professionals and covers different time windows. To measure performance of maternity care based on clients' experiences, we developed and validated a questionnaire. We used the 8 -domain WHO Responsiveness model, and previous materials to develop a self-report questionnaire. A dual study design was used for development and validation. Content validity of the ReproQ-version- 0 was determined through structured interviews with 11 pregnant women (≥ 28 weeks), 10 women who recently had given birth (≤ 12 weeks), and 19 maternity care professionals. Structured interviews established the domain relevance to the women; all items were separately commented on. All Responsiveness domains were judged relevant, with Dignity and Communication ranking highest. Main missing topic was the assigned expertise of the health professional. After first adaptation, {{construct validity of the}} ReproQ-version- 1 was determined through a web-based survey. Respondents were approached by maternity care organizations with different levels of integration of services of <b>midwives</b> and obstetricians. <b>We</b> sent questionnaires to 605 third trimester pregnant women (response 65 %), and 810 women 6 weeks after delivery (response 55 %). Construct validity was based on: response patterns; exploratory factor analysis; association of the overall score with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), known group comparisons. Median overall ReproQ score was 3. 70 (range 1 - 4) showing good responsiveness. The exploratory factor analysis supported the assumed domain structure and suggested several adaptations. Correlation of the VAS rating and overall ReproQ score (antepartum, postpartum) supported validity (r = 0. 56; 0. 59, p< 0. 001 Spearman's correlation coefficient). Pre-stated group comparisons confirmed the expected difference following a good vs. adverse birth outcome. Fully integrated organizations performed slightly better (median = 3. 78) than less integrated organizations (median = 3. 63; p< 0. 001). Participation rate of women with a low educational level and/or a non-western origin was low. The ReproQ appears suitable for assessing quality of maternity care from the clients' perspective.
