5|$|Despite {{the dangers}} from the intense hurricane, {{evacuations}} in Bluefields {{were met with}} resistance and disbelief from residents. In <b>Managua,</b> 70,000 people were evacuated to safe areas. In the remaining areas of Nicaragua, 300,000 people were evacuated. In Costa Rica, a total of 55,000 people were evacuated.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 1931, Lexington, {{which had}} been near Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, was ordered to aid {{survivors}} of an earthquake that devastated <b>Managua,</b> Nicaragua. By the following day, the ship {{was close enough to}} launch aircraft carrying supplies and medical personnel to <b>Managua.</b> During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Lexington and Saratoga were able to launch a massive airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932 without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Lexington was assigned to Black Fleet, defending Hawaii and the West Coast against Blue Fleet and Saratoga. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently ruled sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers shortly afterward. Lexingtons aircraft were judged to have badly damaged two of Blue Fleet's battleships.|$|E

It passed over the northern portion of Lake Nicaragua, passed over <b>Managua,</b> and entered the Pacific Ocean near Leon on October 23. Joan remained a hurricane or tropical storm during its entire passage over Central America, and was a minimal tropical storm when it reached the Pacific. As per the policy at the time, Joan was renamed Miriam.|$|E

Canopy rides provide a {{panoramic}} view of <b>Managua's</b> old downtown where only a few buildings survived the 1972 earthquake. Encouraged by the country's improved economy, <b>Managua's</b> downtown underwent reconstruction beginning in the mid-1990s. Thus, many new governmental buildings, apartment complexes, shopping malls, green squares, leafy promenades, lake tours, restaurants, entertainment venues, broadened avenues, monuments, and fountains, have sprung up awakening the metropolis' heart after a long surreal dream since 1972. Also, many pre-Columbian artifacts have been found in and around Tiscapa, adding to <b>Managua's</b> pre-Columbian legacy.|$|R

5|$|Lexington and Saratoga {{were used}} to develop and refine carrier tactics {{in a series of}} annual {{exercises}} before World War II. On more than one occasion these included successfully staged surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Lexingtons turbo-electric propulsion system allowed her to supplement the electrical supply of Tacoma, Washington, in a drought from late 1929 to early 1930. She also delivered medical personnel and relief supplies to <b>Managua,</b> Nicaragua, after an earthquake in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shock of}} the {{earthquake}} occurred at 0:16 GMT and was followed by several strong aftershocks. The quake was most widely felt in the Chinandega and León departments of Nicaragua, though it was also felt elsewhere in Nicaragua at El Crucero, <b>Managua</b> and San Marcos and at San José in Costa Rica. It was the strongest seismic event to hit Nicaragua since the earthquake of 1972.|$|E
5|$|In Nicaragua, floods {{from the}} storm forced 3,962 people to {{evacuate}} their houses to 57 shelters, {{many of which were}} schools. Floods affected 11 of the 17 Departments of Nicaragua, which began receding on October 5 as Keith exited the region. The floods caused several landslides and covered roads, which isolated communities. Keith damaged 436 houses in the country and destroyed another 160. There were 12 fatalities due to the storm in Nicaragua, one of whom a boy who was swept away by a fast moving flooded river northeast of <b>Managua,</b> while another death occurred after a man drowned in Lake <b>Managua.</b> A man in the western portions of the country died after stepping on a power lines, which had fallen due to strong winds. Fifty communities were isolated, with at least thirteen of them due to impassable roads. Several neighborhoods in Corinto flooded, forcing the Civil Defense to evacuate 9 families. One house collapsed in Los Ángeles, though its ten occupant escape without injury. After rainfall lashed In Villanueva, Chinandega, for six days, the resultant flooding forced 300 families evacuated, while there was significant losses the corn, beans and plantains crops. An additional 20 families left their homes due to flooding in Poneloya. About 15 families in the port city of Puerto Sandino were evacuated after the El Contrabando river overflowed. Another 18 homes were flooded in the region of Salinas Grandes. About 52 fled Troilo after at least 11 homes flooded.|$|E

5|$|Moving ashore in Nicaragua a {{month after}} Tropical Storm Bret's passage, Gert caused {{excessive}} rainfall over already saturated regions. Despite striking the Atlantic coast, the storm produced the largest amounts of precipitation over northern and Pacific coastal areas. A maximum of 17.8in (452mm) fell at Corinto; other significant totals include 17.6 in (447mm) at Chinandega and 17.5in (444mm) at León. The capital of <b>Managua</b> recorded 9.8in (249mm) of rain during the event. Sustained winds from the storm reached no more than 40mph (65km/h) upon landfall near Bluefields, though they downed trees and power lines and generated high waves of up to 12feet (3.7m) offshore.|$|E
5|$|Nicaragua's president, José Santos Zelaya, {{wanted to}} revoke {{commercial}} concessions granted to American companies, and American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan Estrada. Nicaragua was in debt to foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling that an alternate canal route {{fall into the}} hands of Europeans. Zelaya's elected successor, José Madriz, could not put down the rebellion as U.S. forces interfered, and in August 1910, the Estrada forces took <b>Managua,</b> the capital. The U.S. compelled Nicaragua to accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops to begin the United States occupation of Nicaragua, which lasted until 1933.|$|E

By November7, airlifts from <b>Managua</b> were able to bring roughly 60tons (54tonnes) of supplies to natives living along the Coco River. Additionally, plans for a four-month operation to supply the Miskito Indians with food were implemented. In attempts to lessen the effects of disease and famine, 5,000tons (4,536tonnes) of food was planned to be distributed in the region during this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Sandra produced unseasonably heavy rains across parts of Central America, leading to flooding. In Nicaragua, flooding affected 55homes and destroyed 1, primarily in <b>Managua.</b> A total of 56families required evacuation. Local officials blamed the flooding on trash-clogged drains. Five {{people were injured}} in the Nueva Segovia Department when an ambulance crashed on a foggy, rain-slicked road. A landslide in Cucuyagua, Honduras, destroyed a home killing a 25-day-old baby and injuring four others. In Nueva Esparta, El Salvador, two people drowned after being swept away by the swollen El Amatal River. Flooding in Ozatlán killed one person and inundated homes in Jiquilisco, prompting the evacuation of 14families.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, {{the governments}} of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for {{international}} aid. Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. A second appeal was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1million in medicine and other supplies. The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3million in international relief. The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that {{this would not be}} enough. The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines which costs $5.1million. The U.S. Embassy in <b>Managua</b> provided $25,000in donations. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.|$|E
25|$|<b>Managua's</b> {{progress}} came to {{a sudden}} halt after it suffered a second major earthquake on December 23, 1972, which destroyed 90% of the city's downtown and killed more than 19,120 people. Infrastructure was severely damaged and rehabilitation or restoration of buildings was nearly impossible. At the time, <b>Managua's</b> limited resources had to be directed to other disaster relief purposes. <b>Managua's</b> {{ability to cope with}} the disaster was also limited. Surviving fire squadrons and ambulance companies were not able to handle the skyrocketing demand for their services. Some buildings burned to the ground, while the foundations of others simply gave way. Not able to rebuild quickly, the city directed emergency workers to clear away much of the city's ruins quickly while burying the deceased in mass graves. Residences, government buildings and entire avenues were demolished. Escaping the city center, earthquake victims found refuge in the outskirts of the city. To add insult to injury, corruption within the Somoza regime which allocated part of the relief funds hindered the reconstruction of the city's center which remains somewhat isolated {{from the rest of the}} capital.|$|R
40|$|In {{a famous}} essay {{entitled}} ‘An Illness Called Managua’, the Nicaraguan poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra {{contended that the}} city was paradigmatically ‘the reflection of [Nicaraguan] society, of its grace and its bitterness, of its vice and its beauty, of its history and its community’. [1] <b>Managua’s</b> recent development also provides a perspective on the dramatic transformations that the country has undergone over the past decades: from corrupt dictatorship through popular insurrection and social reconstruction, rapidly choked off by Cold War intervention and economic crisis, to a Miami-style restoration and a new growth model led by narco-trafficking and Free Trade Zones. A study of <b>Managua’s</b> changing morphology and socio-economic trajectory suggests that the city is less an ‘illness’ than a symptom of this pathologized development path...|$|R

5|$|The British {{government}} requested for the United States to send {{vessels to}} assist those {{affected by the}} storm. A number of residents of Belize City were left without food and water supplies. The USS Swan (AM-34), stationed at nearby Trujillo, Honduras, was dispatched to send aid to British Honduras. United States President Herbert Hoover ordered the United States Navy and American Red Cross to cooperate in relief efforts. Both agencies and organizations ordered a United States Marine Corps plane from <b>Managua,</b> Nicaragua, to send $2,500worth of medical supplies to affected areas of British Honduras. Throughout the city, relief kitchens were set up. The Government of British Honduras eventually began burning areas with debris and bodies, to prevent spread of disease. Monrad Metzgen, a lieutenant of the British Honduras Defense Force, became responsible for the rescue of persons trapped, feeding those without shelter, and the burial of the deceased. For his efforts, Metzgen received an Order of the British Empire award from King George V of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Not {{a single}} {{residence}} remained undamaged after the hurricane's passage in Bejucal, San Antonio de los Baños, Santiago de Las Vegas, and Mariel, {{and those that}} were not destroyed were unroofed. Nueva Paz suffered the loss of 110homes, while Madruga lost 100; only five remained standing at <b>Managua,</b> and of the eight left at Quivicán, all were severely damaged. At Jibacoa, only 32of the town's 82residences survived the storm. The seaside town of Guanabo was entirely lost, with floodwaters driving the town to sea and leaving its residents homeless. The hamlets of Mantilla, La Chorrera, and Paula disappeared entirely, while Candelaria was washed away {{with the loss of}} all its structures, of which a majority collapsed under the strength of the storm's powerful winds before being driven out to sea. Most structures in Cayajabos, Boyeros, and Aguacate were flattened, while the villages of Alquízar, Güira de Melena, and Vereda Nueva essentially vanished after the storm passed through. Guatao was entirely destroyed, suffering the loss of its apparently indestructible church, while Quemado wholly vanished and only four houses endured the storm's impacts at San Antonio de los Baños.|$|E
5|$|With a mid-level ridge {{located in}} the Gulf of Mexico, the {{depression}} drifted generally northward through an area of warm water temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status. However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500UTC on May 29 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55miles (85km) southwest of <b>Managua,</b> Nicaragua. Its intensity was set at 45mph (75km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity only slightly more before moving ashore. However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65mph (100km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT. An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very tight ring of convection, and at around 1900UTC on May 29 Alma made landfall near León, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm. The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras. After passing near Tegucigalpa Alma weakened to tropical depression status, and at 1500UTC on May 30 the cyclone dissipated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala. On May 31, after crossing Central America as a low pressure area, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and spawned Tropical Storm Arthur.|$|E
