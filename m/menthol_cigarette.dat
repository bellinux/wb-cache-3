40|$|Abstract The use {{of tobacco}} {{products}} would not continue without {{the initiation of}} their use by youth and adults. Since {{the vast majority of}} cigarette smokers begin smoking by age 25, understanding the role of <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> in the initiation of smoking in youth (under the age of 18) and young adults (aged 18 – 25) is especially relevant. Data demonstrate that <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are disproportionately used by youth and young adults. This review seeks to examine what role, if any, menthol plays in the initiation of cigarette smoking. Overall, there is a paucity of data on this topic. The data that do exist suggests that youth who have smoked for less than 1 year are more likely to smoke <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> than youth who have smoked for more than 1 year. A lack of data prevents further conclusions on the role of <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> in the initiation of smoking. </p...|$|R

50|$|Menthol {{cigarettes}} are constructed similarly to non-mentholated cigarettes, with menthol added {{at any of}} several stages during the manufacturing process. Menthol may be derived from distilled corn mint oil, or produced synthetically. While trace amounts of menthol may be added to non-mentholated cigarettes for flavor or other reasons, a <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarette</b> typically has at least 0.3% menthol content by weight. Lower-tar menthol cigarettes may have menthol levels up to 2%, {{in order to keep}} menthol delivery constant despite the filtration and ventilation designs used to reduce tar.|$|E

5000|$|Menthol {{cigarettes}} {{were first}} developed by Lloyd [...] "Spud" [...] Hughes of Mingo Junction, Ohio in 1924, though the idea {{did not become}} popular until the Axton-Fisher Tobacco Company acquired the patent in 1927, marketing them nationwide as [...] "Spud Menthol Cooled Cigarettes".

2500|$|The {{concept of}} cool {{was used in}} this way to market <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> to African Americans in the 1960s. In 2004 over 70% of African American smokers {{preferred}} <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> compared with 30% of white smokers. This unique social phenomenon was principally occasioned by the tobacco industry's manipulation of the burgeoning black, urban, segregated, consumer market in cities at that time. According to Fast Company some large companies have started 'outsourcing cool.' They are paying other [...] "smaller, more-limber, closer-to-the-ground outsider" [...] companies to help them keep up with customers' rapidly changing tastes and demands.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced by Brown and Williamson {{tobacco company}} in 1933, as an {{unfiltered}} 70mm [...] "regular" [...] cigarette, Kool {{was the first}} popular <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarette.</b> Spud cigarettes, introduced in 1927 by the Axton-Fisher Tobacco Company {{had been the first}} <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarette</b> to be distributed and marketed nationwide, but Kool quickly overtook them in sales. Kool enjoyed continued success through the 1950s, when growing public concern about the health risks associated with smoking began take a toll on the Kool brand. Brown and Williamson responded to these concerns by releasing filtered varieties of Kool - first an 85mm [...] "king-sized" [...] filtered version in the 1960s that was followed by a 100mm or [...] "long" [...] filtered version in the 1970s. The 1980s saw the introduction of Kool lights and it was also during this decade that the Kool brand began to lose some marketshare to other menthol brands, such as Newport. In 2003, Brown and Williamson was purchased by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, {{and as a result of}} this merger, Kool became a Reynolds brand. Soon after, Kool's iconic green and white pack, virtually unchanged for some 70 years, was overhauled and the original unfiltered Kool cigarette was discontinued around this same time. However, the changes did little to boost sales, as Kool continued to lose ground to Newport and other menthols. On June 12, 2015, the Kool brand became the property of Imperial Tobacco Company due to a merger between Reynolds American (R.J. Reynolds parent company) and the Lorillard Tobacco Company.|$|E
5000|$|On April 12, 2010 Indonesia filed {{a formal}} {{complaint}} with the World Trade Organization stating the ban on kreteks in America amounts to discrimination because menthol cigarettes are exempt from the new regulation. Trade Ministry Director General of International Trade Gusmardi Bustami has stated that the Indonesian government has asked the WTO panel to review US violations on trade regulations, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement. The TBT Agreement is of special importance as it defines clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as [...] "like products". Claims of discrimination are enhanced when noting that 99% of kreteks were imported from countries other than the United States (chiefly Indonesia), while menthol cigarettes are produced almost entirely by American tobacco manufacturers. Indonesia's case is further strengthened by comparing {{the number of young}} kretek smokers in America with the number of young <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarette</b> smokers. According to US health reports, 43% of young smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, which accounts for nearly 25% of the total cigarette consumption in the United States. Young smokers habituated to kreteks, however, account for less than 1% of cigarette consumption in the US, and <1% of the total cigarettes sold in the US. On April 4, 2012, the WTO ruled in favor of Indonesia's claim, though it is unclear how this will affect U.S. law.|$|E
5000|$|Scialoja, {{working his}} first {{kidnapping}} case, and Deputy Public Prosecutor Fernando Borgia clash over where the kidnappers are based. Scialoja believes {{the crime was}} perpetrated by local Romans. He builds his case on matching <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarette</b> stubs being found both next to the Olivetti lorry and in the kidnappers' van, {{as well as a}} motorcycle stolen in Rome that gets fined outside a phone booth in Tuscany. Borgia finds this evidence tenuous and believes that the gangs in Rome are too small and factious to accomplish a kidnapping of the magnitude of the Baron's; he instructs Scialoja to follow the Sardinian lead. The Rosellini family announces that they will pay only a one billion lire ransom; Libanese, acting alone, rejects this offer, as he wants to get at least five billion; more fighting erupts between the gangs until Freddo says that they should ask for two billion lire. After taking care of Cannizzaro brother who had killed the baron, the gangs begin their plan to pick up the ransom. Despite interference by the Gemito brothers (colleagues of Terribile) and a last ditch effort by Scialoja, the gangs manage to collect the ransom of two billion. Libanese makes a proposal to the collective gang members: to retain only twenty million each and reinvest the remainder in a [...] "joint project" [...] to take control of illicit activity throughout Rome, inspired by the methods of the Mafia in Sicily and the Camorra in Naples.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although much {{is known}} about smoking {{cessation}} behavior, {{the vast majority of}} research has not assessed menthol as an independent factor. The objective of this review is to assess the effects, if any, that use of <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> has on smoking cessation success in adults and youth. A total of 20 articles are included in this review. Although some studies have found that menthol smokers have less success in quitting smoking, others fail to find significant differences between menthol and non-menthol smokers. Some clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of various cessation treatments have suggested that menthol smokers have poorer outcomes, however two secondary data analysis studies (which used the same original dataset) failed to find any difference in success rate associated with particular treatments. Although there is some suggestion that smoking <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> is associated with worse cessation outcomes, differences are not always found. However, if there was a difference, it was always in the direction of worse outcomes for menthol smokers. Given that Black/African American smokers prefer <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> more than White smokers, possible interactions with race/ethnicity are discussed. </p...|$|R
50|$|The bill bans flavored cigarettes, {{including}} cloves, cinnamon, candy, {{and fruit}} flavors, {{with a special}} exception for <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Because Philip Morris is the largest producer of cigarettes in the United States and the bill would {{have the effect of}} eliminating potential competition, the bill has been nicknamed the Marlboro Monopoly Act of 2009. Philip Morris strongly supports FDA regulation. The exemption was reportedly influenced by the Congressional Black Caucus. The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee provisioned under the bill is to submit a recommendation on <b>menthol</b> <b>cigarettes</b> to the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services no later than one year after its establishment.|$|R
