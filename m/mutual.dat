40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy {{currently}} {{allows the}} support of agricultural insurance, with a particular focus on <b>mutuals.</b> This article analyses the experience of <b>mutuals</b> in the Netherlands over the past 20 years. A total of nine <b>mutuals</b> are reviewed, some operating on a purely private basis, others receiving some form of public support. Results illustrate that <b>mutuals</b> are well equipped to insure risks that are uninsurable in the commercial market. This {{is especially true for}} animal and crop disease risks. <b>Mutuals</b> are furthermore able to fulfil the EU conditions for receiving premium support hence opening up the opportunity for farmers to insure against multi-peril weather risks. Experience has however demonstrated that <b>mutuals</b> are not always successful, even with substantial public support. Lack of members caused several <b>mutuals</b> to be discontinued only a few years after their foundation. In order to secure the benefits of <b>mutuals,</b> it is shown {{that there is a need}} to carefully balance size of risk, affordability of premiums, financial robustness and solidarity. These issues are even more important in the case of <b>mutuals</b> providing income stabilisation tools as these have the added responsibility of data and (classified) market information management...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between firm efficiency and choice of organizational form using a seven year panel data set of 586 life insurers. Our study window is from 1985 to 1991. We began the study with two questions in mind: "Do stocks and <b>mutuals</b> use different production technologies?" and "Are stocks and <b>mutuals</b> equally efficient or is one form relatively more efficient than the other?". Using some cost and error structure tests that resemble those found in recent efficiency studies, we find evidence that stocks and <b>mutuals</b> have distinctive cost structures and production technologies. Results also show that efficiency varies with organizational form, with stocks being more scale efficient than <b>mutuals</b> but <b>mutuals</b> being more X-efficient than stocks. ...|$|R

5|$|Early in 1952, General Tire {{purchased}} the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations {{and the rights}} to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post). Most importantly, as far as the future of the <b>Mutual</b> Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of <b>Mutual.</b> That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from <b>Mutual.</b> As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined. <b>Mutual</b> might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, WOR's {{official}} city of license {{was changed}} to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in <b>Mutual</b> had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to <b>Mutual.</b> In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved {{the sale of the}} Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its <b>Mutual</b> shares—to the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving <b>Mutual</b> {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On a Country Road, a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, <b>Mutual</b> had begun airing <b>Mutual</b> Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, <b>Mutual</b> launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of <b>Mutual.</b> The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. <b>Mutual</b> Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|In January 1937, {{ownership}} of WAAB was consolidated {{with that of}} another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial. Yankee flagship WNAC had been an affiliate of CBS Radio, changing affiliation to NBC Red later in 1937 when CBS purchased WEEI in that city. The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the <b>Mutual</b> affiliate roster. WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of The Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK. Within a few years, this new Ohio participant {{would become one of}} the network's central members, a shareowner in <b>Mutual.</b> By the end of 1938, <b>Mutual</b> had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, <b>Mutual</b> shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS. The total of 104 affiliates put <b>Mutual</b> not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, {{and the fact that the}} lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of entertainment, <b>Mutual</b> built on the {{incomparable}} success of The Shadow. WGN's Chicago Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast {{for the first time}} in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. Chicago Theater of the Air would run on <b>Mutual</b> through March 1955. <b>Mutual</b> provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months <b>Mutual</b> had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, <b>Mutual</b> launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, <b>Mutual</b> aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, reprising their roles from the Universal film series. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to <b>Mutual</b> from September 1947 through June 1949. The Mysterious Traveler, a proto–Twilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on <b>Mutual</b> from December 1943 until September 1952.|$|E
