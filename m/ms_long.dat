25|$|The type of {{modulation}} used {{is normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK is used on the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 <b>ms</b> <b>long</b> and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA time slots in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as time-division multiplexing. Small guard periods are used between time slots. Regardless of the modulation method being used, communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at 25 kilobaud.|$|E

50|$|M. alcathoe has the highest-frequency {{echolocation}} call of any European Myotis. In open terrain, {{the call}} has an average duration of 2.5 ms, {{but it may}} be up to 4 <b>ms</b> <b>long.</b> At the beginning, its frequency is around 120 kHz, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53 kHz. It terminates at around 43 to 46 kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive. In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66 ms, respectively. The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.|$|E

50|$|Opus permits trading-off reduced {{quality or}} {{increased}} bitrate {{to achieve an}} even smaller algorithmic delay (5.0 ms minimum). While the reference implementation's default Opus frame is 20.0 <b>ms</b> <b>long,</b> the SILK layer requires a further 5.0 ms lookahead plus 1.5 ms for resampling, giving a default delay of 26.5 ms. When the CELT layer is active, it requires 2.5 ms lookahead for window overlap to which a matching delay of 4.0 ms is added by default to synchronize with the SILK layer. If the encoder is instantiated in the special restricted low delay mode, the 4.0 ms matching delay is removed and the SILK layer is disabled, permitting the minimal algorithmic delay of 5.0 ms.|$|E
