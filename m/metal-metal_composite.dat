In these experiments, <b>metal-metal</b> <b>composites</b> consisting of a matrix of Mg or Mg- 12 wt%Li- 2 wt%Nd were produced by infiltrating a 10 - 20 % dense steel wool with the molten matrix alloy.

A <b>metal-metal</b> <b>composite</b> armoured with twisted (spiral-shaped) wires is a particularly attractive option. We propose such a design that can be realised by twisting of a pre-assembled metallic matrix with embedded reinforcing fibres. An analytical model was developed to predict the torsional behaviour and the torque-twist requirements in the twisting stage to fabricate such a metal-metal hybrid material. Also, a semianalytical multi-shell model was developed based on the upper bound theorem to estimate the plastic deformation behaviour of the hybrid material under axial compression. Samples of commercially pure Cu as the metallic matrix and stainless steel fibres as the reinforcing components were fabricated. A fair agreement of the experimental torque vs. twist data for torsional deformation and compressive load vs. stroke data of the compression test with the model predictions was found.

40|$|Some of {{the current}} trends in cold spray include the {{production}} of <b>metal-metal</b> <b>composite</b> coatings; however, the deposition mechanisms of mixed powders are often vaguely understood. In this study, single component 316 L stainless steel and Fe coatings, as well as composite 316 L/Fe coatings, were deposited through cold spray and the deposition efficiencies (DE) were measured. The composite coatings featuring various feedstock fractions were produced using a dual powder feeder setup. Splat tests were then performed on the as-polished coatings to investigate the deposition behavior of each component powder on the previously deposited layers. Bond ratio (BR) was determined from the splat tests to correlate with DE. Results show that the 316 L powder has a better DE than Fe; whereas the DE of 316 L/Fe mixed powder increases with increasing the mixture feedstock Fe fraction. The BR was found to correlate well with the DE of both single component and mixed powders. For the individual deposition behavior of the component powder, the BR of 316 L monotonically decreases on the composite coating with an increasing Fe fraction; while the BR of Fe plateaus at a relatively high value regardless of the composite coating composition, which results in the overall increase of mixture DE.

At Peak Werkstoff GmbH, Germany 12 wt%Ti particles were co-injected into an atomised Al alloy droplet spray and co-deposited to form a ∼ 300 kg billet. The microstructure comprised refined equiaxed α-Al grains (∼ 5 μm), spherical Si particles (∼ 5 μm) and uniformly distributed Ti particles (∼ 80 μm).

Au DMMC’s were found to have good thermal stability compared to conventional cold-worked Au interconnection wires.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a switch, relay or circuit breaker is to open and close an {{electrical}} circuit as desired by the user and sometimes in order to safeguard the application from failures like overload and short circuit. The circuit breaker {{is an essential part}} of the protection system of every electrical network, from common household to automotive and industrial networks. The electrical contact material is an indispensable component of a circuit breaker which unlike an expendable fuse can be re-used for several cycles of opening and closure. In order to comply with the safety protocols framed by the Underwriters Laboratories (UL), these contact materials have to satisfy a set of stringent ‘properties’ depending on their switching application, i. e. operating voltage and current. Historically, contact materials are <b>metal-metal</b> or metal-ceramic <b>composites</b> which tend to incorporate multiple properties of distinct materials and provide a compromise between several irreconcilable ‘switching properties’. In this work, Ag-WC and Ag-W contact materials have been investigated, where a conductive soft metal like silver is integrated with a refractory material without losing its intrinsic properties, due to the negligible solid and liquid solubility of the two compounds. The framework of the thesis is based on the processing-microstructure-property relationship of these materials and their dependence on the composite composition. These materials are processed via powder metallurgical routes and are densified into a solid compact by more traditional methods, which are commonly known in industry as ‘press-sinter-infiltration’ and ‘press-sinter’. These densified compacts are further brazed on a copper substrate and incorporated inside a circuit breaker. In this work, this traditional method has been scrutinized and compared with a novel approach of simultaneous spark plasma sintering of such a composite contact material and in-situ bonding it to a copper substrate. The microstructure of these materials has been altered by varying the particle size of the starting powders and the milling method. Moreover, the microstructure also has a strong dependence on the composite composition. The composition was varied between the prescribed ranges of Ag and WC by changing the starting powder compositions and by altering the sintering shrinkage prior to infiltration. Transition metals like Ni, Co, Fe and Cu were alloyed in small amounts and the role of Ni was studied extensively. Amongst the properties important for contact materials, the two most relevant switching properties which have been studied in this context are the arc-erosion resistance and the electrical contact resistance. Ag-WC contact materials have an excellent arc-erosion behavior compared to other silver based contact materials, thus the primary objective was to improve the contact resistance without compromising the arc-erosion resistance of these materials. These properties were investigated in a break-only model switch at the Technical Materials division of Umicore AG & Co. KG in Hanau, Germany. Since the processing-composition-microstructure-property corners of the materials tetrahedron are strongly correlated, specific combinations of microstructures and compositions have been highlighted in this work. The results allow the reader to define and select the composition and processing method of arc-resistant Ag-W/WC contact materials demonstrating a low electrical contact resistance in order to avoid unnecessary heating of electrical appliances. nrpages: 193 status: publishe...|$|R
