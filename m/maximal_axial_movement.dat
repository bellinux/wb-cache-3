40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of the <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> and the angle of curve (in degrees) on fatigue of nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) ProFile’ rotary endodontic instruments. Ni-Ti ProFile’ rotary instruments (Maillefer SA, Ballaigues, Switzerland), 25 mm long in the range of ISO size 15 to 40 with two tapers (0. 4 and 0. 6) were evaluated. They are divided in two groups: the instruments with <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> and those without <b>axial</b> <b>movement.</b> The system used to test the fatigue is maintained in mechanical conditions as close as possible to the clinical situation. The <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> is in the order of 2 mm in corono-apical direction with a frequency of 1 Hz. The concave radii incorporating a notched V-form for guiding the instruments were: 5; 7, 5 and 10 mm. The rotary system is mounted on an electric handpiece and rotated at 350 rpm speed as recommended by the manufacturers. The instruments are rotated until their separation, and the time, in seconds, is recorded. Statístícal evaluation is undertaken using a two-way t-test to identify significant differences between variables in the study (p < 0, 05). We found significant statistical difference (p< 0, 05) between Ni-Ti engine drive ProFile’ instruments incorporating an <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> and the instruments without <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> with the same radius of curvature, size and taper. The incorporation of the <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> increases significantly the life-span of the ProFile’ rotary instruments. This should reduce the risk of the instrument separation during the endodontic treatment</p...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: There is a {{need for}} prodromal markers to {{diagnose}} Parkinson's disease (PD) as early as possible. Knowing that most patients with overt PD have abnormal nocturnal movement patterns, we hypothesised that such changes might occur already in non-PD individuals with a potentially high risk for future development of the disease. METHODS: Eleven patients with early PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage </= 2. 5), 13 healthy controls and 33 subjects with a high risk of developing PD (HR-PD) were investigated. HR-PD was defined by the occurrence of hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra in combination with prodromal markers (eg, slight motor signs, olfactory dysfunction). A triaxial accelerometer was used to quantify nocturnal movements during two nights per study participant. Outcome measurements included mean acceleration, and qualitative <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> parameters, such as duration and speed. RESULTS: Mean acceleration of nocturnal movements was lower in patients with PD compared to controls. Frequency and speed of <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> did not differ between patients with PD and controls, but mean size and duration were lower in PD. The HR-PD group did not significantly differ from the control group in any of the parameters analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, patients with PD had an overall decreased mean acceleration, as well as smaller and shorter nocturnal <b>axial</b> <b>movements.</b> These changes did not occur in our potential HR-PD individuals, suggesting that relevant <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> alterations during sleep have either not developed or cannot be detected by the means applied in this at-risk cohort...|$|R

50|$|The rollers {{act as the}} “threads” of the nut assembly, causing <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of the {{rotating}} screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation spins the rollers, which spin the bearing ring, dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|R

Dye penetrant examination revealed cracks at about 4. 5 mm from the pinhead in 27 pins out of the 60 pins received for investigation. Microstructural examination and fractographic studies indicated that the cracks had initiated by fatigue, at the deformation mark at the disc/labyrinth ring interface, possibly due to <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of the labyrinth ring.

50|$|In axial compensation, {{the thermal}} {{expansion}} of {{a straight line}} section between two fixed points is absorbed by an axial expansion joint.

40|$|Lamellipodia {{have been}} induced to form within the reticulopodial {{networks}} of Allogromia laticollaris by being plated on positively charged substrata. Video-enhanced, polarized light, and {{differential interference contrast}} microscopy have demonstrated the presence of positively birefringent fibrils within these lamellipodia. The fibrils correspond to the microtubules and bundles of microtubules observed in whole-mount transmission electron micrographs of lamellipodia. Microtubular fibrils exhibit two types of movements within the lamellipodia: lateral and <b>axial</b> translocations. Lateral <b>movements</b> are often accompanied by reversible lateral associations between adjacent fibrils within a lamellipodium. This lateral association-dissociation of adjacent fibrils has been termed 'zipping' and 'unzipping'. Axial translocations are bidirectional. The <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> of the microtubular fibrils can result in the extension of filopodia by pushing against the plasma membrane of the lamellipodia. Shortening, or complete withdrawal, of such filopodia is accomplished by the reversal of {{the direction of the}} <b>axial</b> <b>movement.</b> The bidirectional streaming characteristic of the reticulopodial networks also occurs within the lamellipodia. In these flattened regions the streaming is clearly seen to occur exclusively in association with the intracellular fibrils.
