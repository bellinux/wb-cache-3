5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man <b>must</b> <b>lead.</b> When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

30|$|Using Eg 8 _V 2, we {{also studied}} the {{influence}} of environmental conditions on the final concentration of thiols in wines obtained by fermentations of synthetic and natural grape musts. We found that lipid addition (phytosterols[*]+[*]Tween 80 or Tween 80 alone) leads {{to an increase in}} the final concentration of 3 MH in both cases (Figs.  2, 3 b). Moreover, in natural grape must, we also found that the higher the initial lipid concentration is, the higher the final 4 MMP concentration (Fig.  3 a). Pinu et al. (2014) previously showed that adding linolenic acid (four times the initial concentration) to a <b>must</b> <b>leads</b> to a doubling of the 4 MMP content and a 17 % increase in the 3 MH content. The increase in the amounts of 3 MH and 4 MMP released as the lipid concentration is increased could be explained by the antioxidant properties of lipid nutrients (Landolfo et al. 2010). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that adding antioxidant molecules (120  mg/kg SO 2) to the grape <b>must</b> <b>leads</b> to an increase in final thiol concentrations (Saharan et al. 2010).|$|R

25|$|In 1900 Lorentz {{tried to}} explain gravity {{on the basis of}} the Maxwell equations. He first {{considered}} a Le Sage type model and argued that there possibly exists a universal radiation field, consisting of very penetrating em-radiation, and exerting a uniform pressure on every body. Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles would indeed arise, if it is assumed that the incident energy is entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the other Le Sage models, because the radiation must vanish somehow and any absorption <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> to an enormous heating. Therefore, Lorentz abandoned this model.|$|E
25|$|Science and {{religion}} {{are based on}} different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations {{must be based on}} evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science {{and religion}} are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.|$|E

Because of the lower yield of grape musts {{and the difficulty of}} processing, ice wines are significantly more expensive than table wines. They are often sold in half-bottle volume (375 ml) or the even smaller 200ml bottle. New World wineries in particular sometimes bottle 200 ml and 50 ml gift packages.|$|R

25|$|The graph {{structure}} theorem for minor-closed graph families states that, for {{any such}} family F, the graphs in F can be decomposed into clique-sums of graphs {{that can be}} embedded onto surfaces of bounded genus, together with a bounded number of apexes and vortices for each component of the clique-sum. An apex is a vertex that may be adjacent to any other vertex in its component, while a vortex is a graph of bounded pathwidth that is glued {{into one of the}} faces of the bounded-genus embedding of a component. The cyclic ordering of the vertices around the face into which a vortex is embedded must be compatible with the path decomposition of the vortex, in the sense that breaking the cycle to form a linear ordering <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> to an ordering with bounded vertex separation number. This theory, in which pathwidth is intimately connected to arbitrary minor-closed graph families, has important algorithmic applications.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall {{described}} {{his approach to}} the economy as [...] "National Economics", expressing the view that [...] "politics <b>must</b> <b>lead,</b> and not be led by, economic forces". His approach rejected economic liberalism {{because it did not}} serve [...] "the national interest", although still saw advantages in a capitalist system, looking favourably on individual enterprise. He called on capitalist elements to be combined with socialist ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy. He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an autarky which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition. This attitude was heavily informed by the corporatist system that had been introduced in Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy.|$|E

[...] Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped {{negotiate}} an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} campaign, eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. He spent much of Mexico City fight in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city, while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.|$|E

Robotic in nature, each Transformer {{has the ability to}} {{transform}} from their robot mode to an alternate form, such as a tank or jet. [...] The Transformers are engaged in total civil war with one another. A group of evil Transformers form a splinter group separate from the main faction. Known as Decepticons, they follow Megatron, their powerful and ruthless leader. The main faction, known as the Autobots, follow the command of Zeta Prime. However, Zeta Prime is killed, leaving behind an inexperienced leader, Optimus, who <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> the Autobot forces to prevent Megatron from corrupting the planet, itself a Transformer, with Dark Energon. The Decepticon story is told in the first five chapters of the game, with the Autobot story directly following it. Players may choose to start either campaign first regardless of chronological order.|$|E
500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E
500|$|In private {{discussions in}} 1939, Hitler {{declared}} Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland's obliteration {{was a necessary}} prelude for that goal. The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany's Lebensraum. Offended by the British [...] "guarantee" [...] on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, [...] "I shall brew them a devil's drink". In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for {{the launch of the}} battleship [...] on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an [...] "encirclement" [...] policy. Poland was to either become a German satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the Reich's eastern flank and prevent a possible British blockade. Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939. On 3 April, Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ("Case White"), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August. In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler's rush to war was his fear of an early death. He had repeatedly claimed that he <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> Germany into war before he got too old, as his successors might lack his strength of will.|$|E

500|$|In September 1757 Pownall {{travelled}} to New Jersey {{to attend}} the funeral of Governor Jonathan Belcher, and stopped in New York to meet with Loudoun. [...] The commander-in-chief was upset that the Massachusetts General Court had not fully implemented a variety of demands he had made, and he held Pownall responsible. [...] Pownall objected to the interference {{of the military in}} civilian affairs, the threat of which Loudoun used to implement his agenda, maintaining that it was necessary for the governor to lead, not drive, the provincial assembly. [...] The meeting was acrimonious, and Loudoun afterward wrote a letter to London harshly criticising Pownall's position, calling his ideas on governance [...] "high-handed". [...] Loudoun encountered opposition in the General Court (the provincial assembly) to a demand that British troops be billeted with civilians in Boston, and threatened to march additional troops into the province and take housing by force. [...] Pownall requested that the General Court accede in some way to Loudoun's demands, eventually signing a bill authorizing the quartering of troops in inns and other public spaces. [...] This bill was unpopular, and Pownall was negatively cast in the local press as supportive of Loudoun and his policies. [...] Pownall's exchanges with Loudoun, however, show that he was keenly aware of the colonists' position: [...] "the inhabitants of this province are intitled to the natural rights of English born subjects ... the enjoyment of these rights ... will animate and encourage them to resist ... a cruel, invading enemy". [...] He was equally clear on the relationship between the royal governor and his assembly: [...] "a governor must endeavour to lead those people for he cannot drive them and <b>must</b> <b>lead</b> them step by step as he can gett [...] footing." [...] He was so committed to these ideas that he offered to resign; however Loudoun encouraged him to remain in the post. [...] Pownall would later author portions of the 1765 Quartering Act, a Parliamentary bill whose implementation was widely resisted in the colonies.|$|E
