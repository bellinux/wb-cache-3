40|$|ABSTRACT. Among a small {{collection}} of Polypla-cophora from the Hans-Georg Müller {{collection at the}} Bavarian State collection we recognized an undescribed species of Leptochiton Gray, 1847, which is described herein. The species is minute (2. 1 mm) and shows a strong sculpturing of roundish granules. The species’ small size, long intersegmental spicules, and the high tail valve with a concave postmucronal slope, easily separates this species from its congeners. In addition, based on the new material, {{we are able to}} raise the number of chiton species identified in Sri Lanka to 24, although three of them require further study. The former known species are compiled to <b>make</b> <b>an</b> easy <b>tracing</b> of the Sri Lanka chiton fauna possible. Within this evaluation we transferred the species Tonicia pecti-noides Sykes, 1903 and Tonicia ceylonica Leloup, 1936 to the genus Lucilina, following the concept of Schwabe et al. [2008]. Besides the new species, Rhys-soplax maldivensis (E. A. Smith in Gardiner, 1903) and Acanthochitona leopoldi (Leloup, 1933), were the first time mentioned from Sri Lanka.

40|$|This report {{contains}} a degree project {{made by the}} mechanical engineering students Lennart Andersson and Daniel Jansson. The project has performed in assignment by SOMAS Valves AB in Säffle. SOMAS are leading in development on control and on/off valves. To maintain this position they always want to improve their products. One way in this development is valves that are more tightened. The purpose with our project was to investigate another seat design on a HiCo (High Cobalt Alloy) seat to a SKV 150 PN 25 valve and compare this to an original HiCo seat. By modifying the seat on a ball valve we want to achieve a valve that leaks lesser then a valve whit original seat. At {{the same time the}} maneuver torque should be retained or better and the wear should not be worse. The project begins with a theoretic investigation of valve forces, maneuver torque and seat design. A manufacturing drawing was made in Pro ENGINEER and handed over to SOMAS AB for manufacturing. Four seats are made in the new design and will be compared with four original seats about maneuver torque, tightened and wear. The idea to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> {{in the middle of the}} seat was that it would tighten earlier. Water under pressure is pressed against the valve to test its resistance of leaking, the leaking is measured by a measure glass. The modified seats leaks more then the original seats, even though, according to the theory they should have a higher seat force. Even the maneuver torque is higher on the modified seats, but this increase is not a problem. All seats was tested to watch their resistant to wear, to test this, a valve mounted with seats is opened and closed 600 times (about 3 hours). Because of the short wear time it’s hard to see and validated wear, but on the after coming pressure test the valve is more tightened. A reason to leaking is the tolerances between the seats and the ball. The reason why the modified valve seat leaks more is probably that the lathe area functions as a channel for the medium. The medium which passes the first tightened area can easier find a new way to pass the second tightened area. The conclusion is that the new seat design is nothing to go further with, but there are proposals for a new seat design...|$|R

We follow the Tag KEM/DEM paradigm of hybrid encryption systems and extend it to multi-receiver scenario. We define Tag-BroadcastKEM/DEM and construct a secure Tag-BroadcastKEM from a CCA secure PKE and target-collision resistant hash function. We will then use this Tag-BroadcastKEM together with a semantically secure DEM to give a generic construction for Hybrid Public Key Broadcast Encryption. The scheme has <b>a</b> black box <b>tracing</b> algorithm that always correctly identifies a traitor. The hybrid structure makes the system very efficient, both in terms of computation and communication cost. Finally we show a method of reducing the communication cost by using codes with identifiable parent property. ...|$|R

From this curve densities at various specified wave lengths were obtained. Using the Eastman IB sensitometer H and D curves were obtained throughout the wave length interval of interest. From these curves a difference in exposure, Δlog Hλ, is obtained: Δlog Hλ= log HD - log Hλ where log HD is the irradiance required to give a density of 1. 00 and Hλ the irradiance of the same wave length in the spectrograph. The spectral radiancy ratio Rλ/Rλmax obtained from the black body radiation curve for the source is corrected by the Δlog Hλ value log H = Δlog Hλ + log Rλ/Rλmax The {{spectral sensitivity}} S, is the reciprocal of H. A special spectrograph was designed and built for this work. It was designed to use a concave grating so that glass elements would not interfere with wave lengths below the 4000 Angstrom point.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{analytic}} properties {{of a certain}} cubic Dirichlet series associated to a metaplectic form f over the cubic cover of GL_ 2. Such a sum generalizes the work of Shimura in studying a similar quadratic Dirichlet series for a half-weight modular form f. Shimura connects the analytic properties of his Dirichlet series to the L-function of a holomorphic modular form via a converse theorem. This connection, and its higher cover generalizations, has been given the name: Shimura's correspondence. Even assuming Shimura's correspondence for the cubic cover of GL_ 2, the analytic properties of our cubic Dirichlet series are intractable. However, using Langlands's beyond endoscopy idea and analytic number theory, we get nontrivial analytic continuation of the series. Specifically, we obtain an asymptotic for a spectral sum of these cubic Dirichlet series plus an error term. Assuming a certain uniformity hypothesis we can get analytic properties of an individual cubic Dirichlet series of a metaplectic form. In particular we show the cubic series has analytic continuation to (s) > 9 / 7 +ϵ, for any ϵ with at most a pole at s= 3 / 2 if the metaplectic form f is the residual Eisenstein series. A key tool needed in studying this series is an identity relating cubic exponential sums to Kloosterman sums.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{report is}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{a detailed description of}} an automatic haze recorder. An introductory haze discussion is included to facilitate the overall evaluation of the program. Although there is a wealth of experimental data for ground-to-ground haze measurements. there exist only fragmentary data for the air-to-ground case. The data of Waldram, and Carman and Carruthers comprise the known extent of published aerial haze studies which are statistically based on a series of programmed flight-test measurements. Even in these cases the number of flights was small. It is therefore essential to the formation of a statistical model of the atmosphere that extensive flight measurements be made over various conditions and up to altitudes of 40000 ft. The automatic haze recorder consists basically of an airborne telephotometer and its associated equipment: the telephotometer itself, an indexing mount~ a recording assembly, and a control assembly and starting box. Each of these items is described in detail. The base of the telephotometer consists of a device which rotates a right prism about an axis normal and concentric to one of its faces. The telephotometer is mounted on the floor of an aircraft in such a manner that this prism assembly extends below the bottom skin of the aircraft, and that the axis of the prism rotation is maintained parallel {{to the surface of the}} earth. The upwelling light from a 15 ° cone entering the prism is reflected along its axis of rotation and, by means of a fixed right prism into the photometric system. In this manner the rotating prism scans a path 15 ° wide, which stretches beneath the aircraft from horizon to horizon. In the photometric system the upwelling light is projected through an appropriate filter onto a photomultiplier tube. The output of this tube is read directly as the vertical deflection of an oscilloscope which is mounted in the recording assembly. The horizontal deflection of this scope is made proportional to the scanning angle by a gear-driven potentiometer. In this manner the scope <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of upwelling intensity vs angle for a given set of conditions. Each scope trace, together with other pertinent data, is photographed by the recording assembly. The indexing mount rotates the telephotometer, and thus the scanning plane, about the vertical axis. The control assembly, once started, automatically cycles the overall system in the following manner. A blue record, then a green record, then a red record are separately photographed at the indexing mount setting (azimuth) of 0 °. Then the mount turns the instrument to an azimuth of 45 ° and the above three records are made again. This sequence is repeated at settings of 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 135 °, 90 °, and 45 °. The head is then returned to 0 °, and the assembly is again ready for another cycle. The lapsed time of the complete cycle is somewhat less than 1 / 3 of a minute. The instrument has been constructed and successfully laboratory-tested. It has had only a single, preliminary flight test, but on this the performance equaled or exceeded the design expectations. Proposals for future flight-test programs are discussed...|$|R
