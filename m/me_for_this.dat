500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are you sure they want <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> episode because I can't seem to find me?' And then I get to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E
500|$|Then on 3 May, despite legal {{warnings}} by {{the police}} before his rally, Raj issued a diktat to his supporters to take action whenever they encountered [...] "injustice". At a rally at Shivaji Park, he said, [...] "That north Indians are living in Mumbai is because of our mercy. Let it be known". He told MNS leaders to shed their complacence and advised his supporters to [...] "take action" [...] whenever they felt necessary. He warned that North Indians who did not speak Marathi and did not respect Marathi culture would be driven away. Raj dared the police in his speech by saying, [...] "Arrest <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> if you can". After analysing the speech amidst demand for action against the MNS chief a senior police official quoted it was [...] "difficult to find an explicit threat or provocation" [...] {{in the text of}} his speech to initiate strong legal action against him and [...] "it seems he [...] consulted legal experts before making the speech".|$|E
2500|$|When Youell was in {{the police}} car, he asked Tillman Johnson, [...] "Mr. Johnson, {{what do you think}} they'll do to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this?</b> Will they give me the chair?" [...] Johnson responded with, [...] "You won't get much. Maybe five or ten years. They don't give you the {{electric}} chair for stealing cars." [...] Swinney then said, [...] "Mr. Johnson, you got me for more than stealing cars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{proprietor}} isn't {{going to}} stand this, you know,' Mr Pancks would proceed. 'He don't send <b>me</b> here <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> Pay up! Come!' ...|$|R
60|$|Isaac. Well, perhaps he'll save time, {{and marry}} us both together--or I'll be your father, and you shall be mine. Come along--but you {{are obliged to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> all <b>this.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, sir," [...] said Nehemiah Holdenough, who, {{listening}} {{with some}} impatience, began to guess in whose company he stood--"Pardon <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> unto <b>this</b> I have a warrant to speak." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Roosevelt {{addressed}} the Congress in person on March 1, 1945, {{about a month}} before his death, he made public reference to his disability for almost {{the first time in}} 20 years. [...] "I hope that you will pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> unusual posture of sitting down," [...] Roosevelt began, [...] "but I know you will realize that it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{foreword}} to his book, Huygens wrote: [...] "It {{should be}} said, also, {{that for some}} time {{some of the best}} mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally I have found that my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs." [...] (cited by [...] ). Thus, Huygens learned about de Méré's Problem in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascal's; so that before his book went to press in 1657 he knew about Pascal's priority in this subject.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{thought he}} would have loved <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> but he only replied in an uncomfortable, uncoming-on voice, 'Oh, you would, would you?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Jörgen Elofsson: [...] "It was a truly {{emotional}} moment <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> getting <b>this</b> {{chance to}} play {{a small part of}} the Royal Wedding I will be forever grateful and very proud." ...|$|R
30|$|When I {{first used}} marihuana, {{it was the}} first time in two years that I felt some {{happiness}} inside. I just sat against the wall, feeling so amazed I could feel this well. I just forgot about all the shit. It remains drugs of course, but it really had an impact on <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> was the moment that changed everything. Feeling good seemed possible all of a sudden.|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} had time to examine this subject fully, but I have great {{confidence}} I am right. You must not think of offering <b>me</b> pay <b>for</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said Nicæus, with a {{thoughtful}} air. [...] "My letters did not prepare <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> 'Tis sudden! Is Amurath {{himself in the}} field?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May not my bower-maiden, Rose Flammock, or my tire-woman, Dame Gillian, Raoul's wife, {{remain in}} the {{apartment}} with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> night?" [...] said Eveline.|$|E

6000|$|... "Upon my word, Marlow," [...] I cried, [...] "what are you {{flying out}} at <b>me</b> <b>for</b> like <b>this?</b> I wouldn't use an ill-sounding word about women, but what right have you {{to imagine that}} I am looking for gratitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Straight--I don't {{know what}} {{straight}} is! It must be right {{to cling to}} my own brother in his noble poverty. Oh! that he should imagine <b>me</b> caring <b>for</b> <b>this</b> horrid, horrid state and grandeur!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But {{what is to}} pay <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{coming and}} re-coming?' said the driver petulantly. 'Is the boy mad? Last {{time it was a}} dancing-girl. This time it is a priest.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It sure beats country {{places and}} {{bungalows}} at Menlo Park," [...] he communed aloud; [...] "and if ever I get the hankering for country life, it's <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> every time." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My colleagues {{would kill}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> saying <b>this,</b> but historians are {{increasingly}} {{conscious of the}} fact that we can't write history. What we can write about is the way in which people see history and think history happens." [...] Hutton on history, 2007.|$|R
6000|$|... "Helène," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are making}} me very happy, {{but there is}} one thing which I must ask you, and which you must forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> asking. <b>This</b> {{entanglement}} of which you speak {{has nothing to do with}} Mr. Sabin?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "First" [...] said he, [...] "always keep {{in sight}} of <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> purpose, watch me all the time, when we are stepping, and keep before, rather than behind, when we are walking.|$|E
