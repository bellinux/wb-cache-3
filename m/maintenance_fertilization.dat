Soil water erosion is low in the no-tillage management system, being influenced by the amount and form of lime and fertilizer application to the soil, among other factors. The aim was to evaluate {{the effect of the}} form of liming, the quantity and management of fertilizer application on the soil and water losses by erosion under natural rainfall. The study was carried out between 2003 and 2013 on a Humic Dystrupept soil, with the following treatments: T 1 - cultivation with liming and corrective fertilizer incorporated into the soil in the first year, and with 100 % annual <b>maintenance</b> <b>fertilization</b> of P and K; T 2 - surface liming and corrective fertilization distributed over five years, and with 75 % annual <b>maintenance</b> <b>fertilization</b> of P and K; T 3 - surface liming and corrective fertilization distributed over three years, and with 50 % annual <b>maintenance</b> <b>fertilization</b> of P and K; T 4 - surface liming and corrective fertilization distributed over two years, and with 25 % annual <b>maintenance</b> <b>fertilization</b> of P and K; T 5 - fallow soil, without liming or fertilization. In the rotation the crops black oat (Avena strigosa), soybean (Glycine max), common vetch (Vicia sativa), maize (Zea mays), fodder radish (Raphanus sativus), and black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris). The split application of lime and mineral fertilizer to the soil surface in a no-tillage system over three and five years, results in better control of soil losses than when split in two years. The increase in the amount of fertilizer applied to the soil surface under no-tillage cultivation increases phytomass production and reduces soil loss by water erosion. Water losses in treatments under no-tillage cultivation were low in all crop cycles, with a similar behavior as soil losses...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the ninth year of the Dutch IMPHOS field trial IB 0013 are presented. In 1999 spring barley was grown. The first stages {{of the growth of}} spring barley were {{positively}} affected by phosphorus fertilization. The more phosphorus was given, the better the crop responded. The soil structure was rather poor. Phosphorus fertilization could not compensate the yield loss due to the poor soil structure. The heterogeneity of the crop did not allow for robust comparison of the different treatments. At final harvest phosphorus fertilization had increased the grain yield but the maintenance treatments (M) were similar in grain and straw yields or in uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen. The treatment without phosphorus fertilization yielded 89. 3 % of theM treatments. In this situation <b>maintenance</b> <b>fertilization</b> of spring barley is profitable. Based on the average total phosphorus uptake by spring barley, the maintenance phosphorus fertilization for the next crop, i. e. sugar beet in 2000, is set at 13. 7 kg of P per ha (M treatment = 31. 4 kg of P 2 O 5 per ha). Phosphate fertilization increased the phosphorus status of the soil, but the differences are small. Compared to the results of 1998 the phosphorus status of the soil layer 0 - 25 cm declined for all four treatments due to the relatively low quantities of fertilizer that were used in 1998 and 1999...|$|E

The experiment {{was carried out in}} a greenhouse in a randomized block design with six treatments and five replications. Treatments consisted of a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, with three defoliation heights (50, 65, and 80 cm) and with or without potassium <b>maintenance</b> <b>fertilization.</b> The production characteristics and chemical composition of the forage plant were evaluated. There was no interaction effect between defoliation height and fertilization with or without potassium on any of the analyzed variables, except for mineral content in Mulato II grass. The tillers and leaves number, shoot dry matter, leaf+sheath, root system, and residue were influenced by defoliation heights and potassium fertilization, except for the leaf blades and root dry matter, leaf blade/stem+sheath ratio, and leaves number, which were not influenced by potassium fertilization. Higher shoot dry matter was observed at the heights of 65 and 80 cm; however, comparing these two heights, leaf + sheath dry matter was lower at 65 cm. Regarding the grass’s chemical composition, there was an increase in neutral and acid detergent fiber and indigestible neutral detergent fiber contents as the defoliation height increased, which resulted in lower production of potentially digestible dry matter, which can compromise the potential use of the forage by animals. Among evaluated treatments, Mulato II grass defoliation is recommended for a maximum height of 65 cm. Potassium fertilization increases the yield and the potentially digestible dry matter content of Mulato II grass, even when cultivated in soil with high potassium content...|$|E

40|$|The {{courtship}} {{of ducks}} {{is unusual in}} several aspects. In temperate zones it generally begins very early, usually on the wintering grounds, so courtship is not a manifestation of territorial proclamation and defense {{as is the case}} with many songbirds. Nor, because of its early initiation, is courtship closely correlated with gonad growth and fertilization; rather, pair formation is normally completed prior to the period of maximum gonadal activity. Therefore, reproductive behavior in ducks may be conveniently divided into an early phase of conspicuous displays associated with actual pair formation, followed by the later and less elaborate behavior patterns concerned with pair bond <b>maintenance</b> and <b>fertilization.</b> Two possible advantages of the considerable time lag between pair formation and egg laying are that it decreases the likelihood of uncorrected mismatings between species and, furthermore, provides the female with the protection of a mate to ward off unmated males that might attempt to rape her.

APB, PIP and POP were detected only in SF, while other peptidases were detected in SF and MF. APB, APN-PI and APN-PS were predominant in most tissues in all seasons. Peptidase activities had a common pattern of increment {{during the dry season}} (winter/autumn), which coincides with the mating period (autumn) and LTSS in the female (winter), as well as the reduction of spermatozoa motility and <b>maintenance</b> of <b>fertilization</b> capacity of spermatozoa. The high CAP activity in the soluble fraction of the vagina during winter, compared to summer (time of parturition) and spring, coincides with the relaxation of this tissue. In the soluble fraction, the low PAP- 1 activity of the ductus deferens coincided with its high activity in the vagina during the winter; and the inverse occurred in summer, which is consistent with the physiological process of preserving spermatozoon viability. In conclusion, the studied peptidase activities had seasonal and tissue-specific characteristics, which suggest a relevant role in the reproductive physiology of C. d. terrificus.

At the first stages of crop growth, phosphorus fertilization had {{a positive effect on}} fresh and dry matter yields of biomass. At the final harvest the potato yield was significantly increased by phosphate fertilization. Without fertilization the yield was 87. 7 % of the fertilized treatments. A Pw value of 6 - 9 mg of P 2 O 5 per litre of soil for potato is not sufficient. At this low phosphorus status of the soil potato requires fertilization. Phosphorus fertilization increased the phosphorus content of the potato tops and tubers. Besides, the phosphorus uptake by potato increased after fertilization. The general yield level of the crop was low. This is contributed to the delayed planting date, a sub-optimal supply of nitrogen and possibly the presence of a latent form of fungi disease, Phytophtora infectans. Based on the average total phosphorus uptake by sugar beet on the maintenance treatment (M), the 1999 <b>maintenance</b> phosphorus <b>fertilization</b> for spring barley is set at 8 kg of P per ha.

40|$|Mammalian {{spermatozoa}} are {{not able}} to fertilize an egg immediately upon ejaculation. They acquire this ability during their transit through the female genital tract in a process known as capacitation. The mammalian oviduct acts as a functional sperm reservoir providing a suitable environment that allows the <b>maintenance</b> of sperm <b>fertilization</b> competence until ovulation occurs. After ovulation, spermatozoa are gradually released from the oviductal reservoir in the caudal isthmus and ascend to the site of fertilization. Capacitating-related changes in sperm plasma membrane seem to be responsible for sperm release from oviductal epithelium. Anandamide is a lipid mediator that participates in the regulation of several female and male reproductive functions. Previously we have demonstrated that anandamide was capable to release spermatozoa from oviductal epithelia by induction of sperm capacitation in bovines. In the present work we studied whether anandamide might exert its effect by activating the nitric oxide (NO) pathway since this molecule {{has been described as a}} capacitating agent in spermatozoa from different species. First, we demonstrated that 1 µM NOC- 18, a NO donor, and 10 mM L-Arginine, NO synthase substrate, induced the release of spermatozoa from the oviductal epithelia. Then, we observed that the anandamide effect on sperm oviduct interaction was reversed by the addition of 1 µM L-NAME, a NO synthase inhibitor, or 30 µg/ml Hemoglobin, a NO scavenger. We also demonstrated that the induction of bull sperm capacitation by nanomolar concentrations of R(+) -methanandamide or anandamide was inhibited by adding L-NAME or Hemoglobin. To study whether anandamide is able to produce NO, we measured this compound in both sperm and oviductal cells. We observed that anandamide increased the levels of NO in spermatozoa, but not in oviductal cells. These findings suggest that anandamide regulates the sperm release from oviductal epithelia probably by activating the NO pathway during sperm capacitation...|$|R

The study relied on primary data drawn from a representative sample of tomato growers in the Riyadh and Kharj area. The study showed that: (1) The productivity of the examined greenhouses does not differ significantly as a result of having different cover types or different farm size. However, the only factor which was found to affect productivity levels is the number of cultivations per year. The study showed a significant increase in the don urn productivity of tomatoes when cultivated twice a year (26 tons) as opposed to only (11 tons) when cultivated once a year. (2) The production costs per donum were significantly higher in die case of tow cultivations per year than the case of one cultivation per year (48 thousand Rivals versus 34 thousand Rivals). (3) The farm size was found to possess an impact on these production costs. These costs were reduced from SO thousand Rivals to 42 thousand Rivals per donum when farm size increased from the 10 donums' set to the 10 - 20 donums' set. The costs went down further to 38. S thousand Riyals when the farm size was increased from the 10 donums' set to the over 20 donums' set. This is due to the reductions in the share of die donum of manpower, machinery depreciation, buildings depreciation, <b>fertilization,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> pesticides, and fuels. As a result of the previous findings, die achieved net returns per donum have increased by about 6. 183 thousand Riyals when switching from one cultivation per year to two. Moreover, the incomplete utilization of the whole project capacity (through cultivating die land once a year) resulted in a loss of 12 thousand Riyals per donum. Despite achieving losses in small farms (which are sized less than 10 donums), large farms (over 20 donums) achieved net returns of 11 thousand Riyals per donum. This implies that large farms should expand and cultivate tomatoes twice a year in order to increase productivity and to reduce production costs...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{feedstock}} harvest {{strategies are}} needed to ensure bioenergy production does not irreversibly degrade soil resources. The objective {{for this study was}} to document corn (Zea mays L.) grain and stover fraction yields, plant nutrient removal and replacement costs, feedstock quality, soil-test changes, and soil quality indicator response to four stover harvest strategies for continuous corn and a corn–soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr. ] rotation. The treatments included collecting (1) all standing plant material above a stubble height of 10 cm (whole plant), (2) the upper-half by height (ear shank upward), (3) the lower-half by height (from the 10 cm stubble height to just below the earshank), or (4) no removal. Collectable biomass from Treatment 2 averaged 3. 9 (± 0. 8) Mg ha− 1 for continuous corn (2005 through 2009), and 4. 8 (± 0. 4) Mg ha− 1 for the rotated corn (2005, 2007, and 2009). Compared to harvesting only the grain, collecting stover increased the average N–P–K removal by 29, 3 and 34 kg ha− 1 for continuous corn and 42, 3, and 34 kg ha− 1 for rotated corn, respectively. Harvesting the lower-half of the corn plant (Treatment 3) required two passes, resulted in frequent plugging of the combine, and provided a feedstock with low quality for conversion to biofuel. Therefore, Treatment 3 was replaced by a “cobs-only” harvest starting in 2009. Structural sugars glucan and xylan accounted for up to 60 % of the chemical composition, while galactan, arabinan, and mannose constituted less than 5 % of the harvest fractions collected from 2005 through 2008. Soil-test data from samples collected after the first harvest (2005) revealed low to very low plant-available P and K levels which reduced soybean yield in 2006 after harvesting the whole-plant in 2005. Average continuous corn yields were 21 % lower than rotated yields with no significant differences due to stover harvest. Rotated corn yields in 2009 showed some significant differences, presumably because soil-test P was again in the low range. A soil quality analysis using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) with six indicators showed that soils at the continuous corn and rotated sites were functioning at an average of 93 and 83 % of their inherent potential, respectively. With good crop management practices, including routine soil-testing, adequate <b>fertilization,</b> <b>maintenance</b> of soil organic matter, sustained soil structure, and prevention of wind, water or tillage erosion, a portion of the corn stover being produced in central Iowa, USA can be harvested in a sustainable manner...|$|R

Resumen Debido a que la Instituci?n Educativa T?cnica Agropecuaria (IETA) de Chivat?, ubicada en a 11 Kil?metros de Tunja, capital del departamento de Boyac?, {{cuenta con}} escasos bienes inmuebles y econ?micos para mejorar la producci?n pecuaria con la cual instruye y estimula a sus estudiantes a continuar con sus sistemas productivos campesinos, se observ? la {{necesidad}} de realizar el presente trabajo de grado bajo la modalidad de pasant?a, seg?n el Acuerdo N. 176 de junio 11 del 2014 de la UNAD, con el objetivo principal de mejorar la productividad de los sistemas pecuarios de la granja de dicha Instituci?n, adem?s de realizar un diagn?stico primario para conocer el estado de las instalaciones, producciones y tecnolog?as, presentar y desarrollar un plan de trabajo, y finalmente, cuantificar y evaluar la productividad de las especies criadas. La metodolog?a utilizada se bas? en la observaci?n, medici?n y cuantificaci?n de praderas, instalaciones y recurso humano, ya que a la fecha de inicio de la pasant?a (20 de enero del 2014) no se manten?an animales en la granja evaluada. Los resultados obtenidos se basaron en un diagn?stico inicial donde se detectaron diversas falencias en las instalaciones (aprisco, galp?n y conejera y sistema de riego), en las praderas (abundancia de malezas, compactaci?n del suelo, ausencia de cultivos, falta de riego y mantenimiento de los cultivos instaurados), y en el recurso animal, el cual se encontraba ausente. Posteriormente se realiz? el respectivo plan de mejoramiento y de trabajo, el cual consisti? en la recolecci?n y control de malezas, implementaci?n de cultivos para la alimentaci?n animal, mantenimiento y fertilizaci?n de los cultivos existentes, adecuaciones del sistema de riego, modificaciones y adecuaciones a las instalaciones y dotaci?n de animales a la granja, (ovejas, conejos y pollos de engorde). Finalmente se puso en marcha el sistema productivo de cada una de las especies, logr?ndose producir seis ovinos con la finalidad de cebarlos y comercializarlos; dos producciones de pollo de engorde con lotes de cincuenta y cien pollos respectivamente; y tres conejas y un conejo para la reproducci?n. Las conclusiones m?s relevantes tuvieron que ver con la puesta en marcha de sistema productivos en la Instituci?n Educativa T?cnica Agropecuaria (IETA) de Chivat?, aprovechamiento y mejoramiento de los recursos naturales, f?sicos, econ?micos y humanos con que contaba la granja, seguimientos nutricionales y sanitarios a los animales instaurados y, para el fortalecimiento y aplicaci?n de los conocimientos adquiridos en mi carrera como Zootenista. Professional internship for {{the diagnosis and}} improvement of cattle systems production of the agricultural technical educational institution?s farm of Chivata Due to the Agricultural Technical Educational Institution (IETA) of Chivat?, located 11 kilometers away from Tunja, capital {{of the department of}} Boyac?, has limited real estate and economic to improve livestock production with which instructs and encourages its students to continue with their peasant production systems. It was noted the need to make this graduation work under the modality of internship, according to the UNAD Agreement N. 176 of 2014. With the primary goal of improving the productivity of livestock systems of the farm of that institution. In addition to a primary diagnosis to understand the condition of facilities, production and new technologies, to present and develop a work plan, and finally, quantify and evaluate the productivity of the species bred. A methodology based on the observation was used, measurement and quantification of grasslands, facilities and human resources, since to the start date of the internship (January 20 2014) there were not animals maintained in the evaluated farm. The results were based on an initial diagnosis where several flaws were detected in the facilities (sheepfold, rabbit burrow and irrigation system), in the prairies (abundance of weeds, soil compaction, absence of crops, lack of irrigation and maintenance of the crops in place), and in the animal resource, which was absent. Then it was performed the respective plan of improvement and work, which consisted of the collection and weed control, implementation of crops for animal feed, <b>maintenance</b> and <b>fertilization</b> of existing crops, adaptations of the irrigation system, modifications, and adaptations to the facilities and staffing of animals to the farm, (sheep, rabbits and chickens for fattening). It has eventually been launched the productive system of each of the species, thus achieving the production of six sheep with the purpose of fattening and commercialization; two productions of broiler with lots of fifty to one hundred chickens respectively; and three female rabbits and a male rabbit for reproduction. The most relevant conclusions {{had to do with the}} implementation of productive systems in the Agricultural Technical Educational Institution (IETA) of Chivat?.
