5|$|The Government of Croatia {{decided that}} {{multicast}} (simultaneous analog and digital DVB-T broadcasting of the <b>main</b> <b>channels)</b> was to cease in 2010. The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. The analog broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital switchover on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas {{were left with}} analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or analog TV broadcasts.|$|E

In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris, in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis, or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones. Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally <b>main</b> <b>channels</b> will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel.

Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow will not only compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E

40|$|Biomass of {{phytoplankton}} {{in large}} rivers may be maintained or even increased by inputs from hydraulic "dead zones". In some eutrophic rivers, dead zones can increase water retention time sufficiently {{for the development}} of algal concentrations substantially higher than in the <b>main</b> <b>channel.</b> "Seeding" of the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> may then occur through the interchange of water between dead zones and the <b>main</b> <b>channel.</b> The objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of dead zones in the development of phytoplankton along the moderately eutrophic Rideau River. In the first chapter, I compare the suspended algal communities in dead zones and the adjacent <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> of the Rideau, to evaluate the assumption that dead zones support higher phytoplankton biomass. In the second chapter, I test the assumption that dead zones contribute algal biomass to the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> of rivers. To do this, I examine the relationship between changes in <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> total chlorophyll a and the proportion of dead zone (inferred from the area of shallow macrophyte-dominated water) in 40 reaches along the Rideau, averaging approximately 2 km each.

25|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the river once abounded in flightless moa, predated upon by the Haast's eagle. The river was known by the Māori as Mata-au, meaning current or eddy in an expanse of water. This name, now more {{frequently}} rendered as Matau, is still used for one of the two <b>main</b> <b>channels</b> of the Clutha delta. In the early days of European exploration there was at least one settlement of some 250-300 Māori close to the river's banks. The river takes its European name from Cluaidh, the Scots Gaelic name for the River Clyde in Scotland which runs through Glasgow. During New Zealand's early colonial history it was known as the Molyneux, that name given to it by Captain Cook. During early European settlement, a whaling station was established close to the river's mouth, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area's economy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for {{the determination of}} a dynamic hillslope instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) in concert with a variable saturation excess runoff production model using a grid-based digital elevation model (DEM). The total channel network responsible for routing the runoff produced on the catchment {{is divided into two}} parts: the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network and the hillslope channel network. The hillslope IUH, which routes water from the hillslopes to the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network, is essentially the solution of the linear advection-dispersion routing model weighted by the hillslope travel distance distribution of saturated pixels to the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network. The shape of the hillslope travel distance is found to consist of an initial spike, representing saturated pixels on the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network, and an exponential decay function for those pixels on the hillslope. However, the proportion of saturated pixels on the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network varies with total saturated pixels, causing an inverse change of scale of the spike and the exponential decay part. As the number of saturated pixels changes during a storm event, the hillslope IUH is dynamic. The <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network IUH is also modelled by the linear advection-dispersion model weighted by the normalized width function of the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network. Convolution of the hillslope and <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> network IUHs gives the catchment IUH, which is also dynamically changing with the degree of saturation. It is demonstrated that the direct runoff hydrograph is sensitive to the variation of the degree of saturation within and between storm events...|$|R

40|$|Resonance {{characteristics}} of tidal waves {{in a network}} are investigated with the linearized, one-dimensional shallow water equations. The network comprises a semi-enclosed <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> with an adjacent secondary channel at an arbitrary position. Water motion is forced by a prescribed incoming wave {{at the entrance of}} the <b>main</b> <b>channel.</b> The model is used to compute the ratio of sea surface height amplitude in the presence and absence of the secondary channel. Relevance lies in the possible construction of secondary channels to reduce tidal range in the <b>main</b> <b>channel.</b> When μ= 2 πl∗b/l∗t≳π (l∗b being the length of the <b>main</b> <b>channel,</b> l∗t the tidal wavelength) and friction is weak, it is found that reduction (amplification) of the tidal range occurs for secondary channels located less (more) than a quarter wavelength from the closed end of the <b>main</b> <b>channel.</b> Furthermore, a minimum is observed halfway between the closed end and the nodal point, and a maximum a quarter wavelength further seaward. With increasing friction and/or decreasing length of the <b>main</b> <b>channel,</b> amplitude ratios become less pronounced and depend weakly on the location of the secondary channel. The mechanism responsible for amplification or reduction of the sea surface height in the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> is identified and explained in terms of the forced wave and waves radiating away from the secondary channel...|$|R
