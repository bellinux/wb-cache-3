5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a Lutheran {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} Lutheran church and his early home {{environment}} was strictly religious. Jacob did not receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of formal education. His father died when he was six or seven years old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E
25|$|Antibes and Juan les Pins host {{a number}} of festivals, mainly during the summer months. There's not <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of {{traditional}} cultural festivals in Antibes; most of the festivals focus on music and contemporary activities.|$|E
25|$|In Art History, {{paintings}} showing {{two or more}} females together seldom displayed <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{of potential}} sexual activity between them. When it came to nudity, most women subjects were depicted as dancers or bathers, usually stated as goddesses.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{not being}} intensive, {{there are many}} commons and access lands, {{together}} with an extensive network of footpaths and bridleways including the North Downs Way, a scenic long-distance path. Accordingly, Surrey provides <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of rural leisure activities, with a very large horse population.|$|E
25|$|As built, {{however, the}} class was lacking <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of modern {{appliances}} due to the PRR's conservatism; features missing included a mechanical stoker, power reverse, and a feedwater heater, {{although most of the}} class were later given a stoker and all received power reverse.|$|E
25|$|As Carnegie {{went from}} his retail to {{wholesale}} period of library funding he refined his philanthropical philosophy. Instead of providing funding for large, multi-purpose buildings in larger urban areas {{he began to}} focus on providing more and smaller locales with libraries, communities that may not have had <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of cultural institutions before Carnegie's benefaction.|$|E

25|$|This theory {{states that}} groups of fish may save energy when {{swimming}} together, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that bicyclists may draft {{one another in}} a peloton. Geese flying in a Vee formation are also thought to save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Increased efficiencies in swimming in groups have been proposed for schools of fish and Antarctic krill.|$|E
25|$|The boss of a clan is {{typically}} {{elected by the}} rank-and-file soldiers (though violent successions do happen). Due to {{the small size of}} most Sicilian clans, the boss of a clan has intimate contact with all members, and doesn't receive <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of privileges or rewards as he would in larger organizations (such as the larger Five Families of New York). His tenure is also frequently short: elections are yearly, and he might be deposed sooner for misconduct or incompetence.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{populations have}} been {{established}} in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted {{by the state of}} Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of a commercial fishery, but have {{led to the development of}} a thriving sport fishery.|$|E

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman empire, few {{buildings}} large enough to require <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of vaulting were built for several centuries. In the early Romanesque period, a return to stone barrel vaults was seen for the first great cathedrals; their interiors were fairly dark, due to thick, heavy walls needed to support the vault. One {{of the largest and most}} famous churches enclosed from above by a vast barrel vault was the church of Cluny Abbey, built between the 11th and 12th centuries.|$|E
25|$|VÃ©nus was {{too small}} and too weak for the Royal Navy (RN) to take her in as a sixth-rate frigate or even a post-ship. She was {{designed}} for short-range privateering in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay, rather than the longer-range escort or patrol work of a British sloop. Accordingly, she couldn't stow as <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of stores as the Admiralty needed; reducing her armament, relative to her French establishment, would have permitted her to carry the larger weight of stores she had to carry in RN service.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest of}} the {{mandolin}} orchestras, which has been continuously active since the 1940s, is the Shfeya Orchestra, founded by Moshe Medalia, and today made up of graduates from the Shfeya Youth Village. The village is a boarding school for at-risk junior and senior high-school students. Part of the education includes students working together in small groups, teaching music to one another. There wasn't <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of learning materials when Moshe Jacobson, founder of the music program arrived in 1942. So he wrote text books for the instruments and composed music and songs.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time {{sculpture}} and statues were put to wider uses. The great temples of the Classical era such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, required relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of sculptural innovation. Unfortunately these works survive only in fragments, {{the most famous of}} which are the Parthenon Marbles, half of which are in the British Museum.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Kaurna scholar Georgina Yambo Williams (co-authoring a {{paper with}} Robert Amery), {{provided}} a revised {{origin of the}} town's name. Drawing from her own knowledge and various literary sources from the period of colonisation, she relates that Yankalilla comes from the words yerkandi, meaning to fall to, to join onto, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a disease does, and lya and illa, which means 'place'. Thus 'Yankalilla' is literally 'place of the fallen bits'. This is considered by Yambo Williams to be {{in reference to the}} Dreaming story of Tjilbruke, who carried his dead nephew's disintegrating body from (what is now called) the Sturt River to Yankalilla and then collapsed.|$|E

25|$|De CÃ³rdoba {{was born}} at Montilla {{in what is now}} the {{province}} of CÃ³rdoba, the son of Pedro FernÃ¡ndez de CÃ³rdoba (Count of Aguilar) and his wife Elvira de Herrera. He and his older brother, Alonso, were orphaned when they were young. As the younger brother in a society practicing primogeniture, Gonzalo could not expect <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of inherited wealth or titles, and of his two options â the church or the military â he chose the latter. He was first attached to the household of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, the half-brother of King Henry IV of Castile. After Alfonso's death in 1468 CÃ³rdoba devoted himself to Alfonso's sister, Isabella of Castile.|$|E
25|$|Lanfranc {{was trained}} in the liberal arts, at that time a field in which {{northern}} Italy was famous (there {{is little or no}} evidence to support the myth that his education included <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of Civil Law, and none that links him with Irnerius of Bologna as a pioneer in the renaissance of its study). For unknown reasons at an uncertain date, he crossed the Alps, soon taking up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches, where he taught for three years with conspicuous success. But in 1042 he embraced the monastic profession in the newly founded Bec Abbey. Until 1045 he lived at Bec in absolute seclusion.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} few years he {{continued}} to work on the Missa, composing piano sonatas and bagatelles to satisfy the demands of publishers and the need for income, and completing the Diabelli Variations. He was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the Missa in 1823, three years after its original due date. He also opened discussions with his publishers over the possibility of producing a complete edition of his work, an idea that was arguably not fully realised until 1971. Beethoven's brother Johann began to take a hand in his business affairs, <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Kaspar had earlier, locating older unpublished works to offer for publication and offering the Missa to multiple publishers with the goal of getting a higher price for it.|$|E
