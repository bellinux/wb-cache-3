5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|Although the Interface 2 proved popular, {{the high}} cost of ROM cartridges, {{and the fact that they}} were limited to 16K in size, <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> very few titles were {{released}} in this format.|$|E

5000|$|This {{realization}} focused {{within him}} in a sudden sparkflash computation, and in the clear brilliance of that illumination, the boy Pall understood a profoundness. His life, hitherto a child's plaything, devoid of direction-seemingly! Or had there in fact always been a plan-a plan within a plan within a plan (whatever <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> (whatever <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> (whatever <b>that</b> meant)))?-was now encompassed by a terrible purpose. He knew {{the meaning of the}} word terrible, and he knew {{the meaning of the word}} purpose. And therefore he understood deeply the meaning of [...] "terrible purpose". Unless he, in the solitude of his deeply brain-filled mind, misunderstood this revelation, and was in fact confronted with a [...] "terrible papoose."What could that mean? ...|$|R

5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E
5|$|East of Camerton {{the coal}} is buried beneath newer rock strata, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> mining {{in the area}} was more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|E

5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way tie in the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no bronze was awarded. In athletics, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's high jump event. In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way tie in the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the hot blast furnace process in 1828 <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{religious}} tracts, dictionaries, and teaching guides already {{existed in the}} Xiamen tongue <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the missionaries in Taiwan could begin proselytizing immediately, without the intervening time needed to write those materials.|$|E

5|$|The famous anti-vivisectionist, Frances Power Cobbe {{worked at}} the Red Lodge and lived with Mary Carpenter from 1858-9, but a {{turbulent}} {{relationship between the two}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Cobbe left the school.|$|E

5|$|The global {{nature of}} the war <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> many {{functions}} that were previously vested in the individual Australian state governments had to be placed {{under the control of}} the Commonwealth government. Additionally, the exigencies of the war <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally be able to do. In order to enable this to occur, the War Precautions Act 1914 was introduced in October 1914, providing the Commonwealth government with wide-ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war.|$|E

5|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the Test could not start until midday had passed. The damp {{conditions}} <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> sawdust had to be added in large amounts to allow the players to keep their grip. The humid conditions, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers, with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|The {{readmission}} of the Scottish Football Association to FIFA <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Scotland {{were now}} eligible {{to enter the}} 1950 FIFA World Cup. FIFA advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the 1950 British Home Championship, but the SFA announced that Scotland would only attend the finals if Scotland won the competition. Scotland won their first two matches, but a 1–0 home defeat by England <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the Scots finished as runners-up. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the Scots had qualified by right for the World Cup, but had not met the demand of the SFA to win the Championship. The SFA stood by this proclamation, despite pleas to the contrary by the Scotland players, supported by England captain Billy Wright and the other England players. The SFA instead sent the Scots {{on a tour of}} North America.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided by the results of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
2500|$|A reason {{given for}} the {{discrepancy}} in translation and interpretation of verse 10.18.8, is that one consonant in a word <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> house, yonim agree [...] "foremost to the yoni", was deliberately changed by those who wished claim scriptural justification, to a word <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> fire, yomiagne.|$|R

50|$|In the Indian astronomical tradition, a Yuga is {{a period}} {{consisting}} of 1,577,917,500 civil days. Saturn makes 146,564 revolutions and Mars makes 229,6824 revolutions in a Yuga. So Saturn makes 146,564/1,577,917,500 = 36,641/394,479,375 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Saturn is x, what is <b>meant</b> is <b>that</b> the fractional number of revolutions is x/394,479,375. Similarly, Mars makes 229,6824/1,577,917,500 = 190,412/131,493,125 revolutions in a day. By saying that the residue of the revolution of Mars is y, what is <b>meant</b> is <b>that</b> the fractional number of revolutions is y/131,493,125.|$|R
