40|$|Comparative {{investigations}} of the chemotherapeutic activity of various filaricidal compounds and other anthelmintics were made with Litomosoides carinii infections in Mastomys natalensis, special consideration being given to the microfilaricidal activity of the compounds. Diethylcarbamazine, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-N-methylpiperazide citrate (HOE 28637 a), tetrahydropyranecarboxylic acid-N-methylpiperazide citrate (HOE 29691 a), (Â±) -tetramisole, (-) -tetramisole (levamisole), and metrifonate proved highly effective against microfilariae whereas gentian violet, methylene violet, and the anthelmintics <b>metyridine,</b> disophenol, pyrantel tartrate, methylpyrantel tartrate and parbendazole showed no, or only inadequate, activity. The usefulness of L. carinii infections in M. natalensis is discussed and is recommended {{as a model for}} chemotherapeutic screening tests and for the quantitative evaluation of microfilaricidal activity...|$|E
