40|$|Female rabbits became immunized during {{pregnancy}} to the rabbit blood group factors G or g in {{five out of}} ten instances in which the red cells of the fetuses carried {{one of the factors}} absent in the <b>mother.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> so produced were of low titer and disappeared in all cases within 6 weeks after the birth of the litter. Repeated pregnancies did not result in additive increases in titer. Antibodies to the G-g factors, whether produced by the injection of red cells or by pregnancy, crossed the placenta readily from mother to fetus and were found at birth (and prior to nursing) associated with the red cells and in the serum of the fetuses. The rabbit placenta appeared to be equally permeable to the agglutinating and coating antibodies.

Systemic corticosteroid treatment, in contrast, does not substantially affect pregnancy outcomes, and its use for PG in pregnant women is justified. PG typically reoccurs in subsequent pregnancies.

40|$|For 4 years, we {{determined}} the mode {{and risk of}} mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-I in a prospective cohort of 34 children born to seropositive mothers in Franceville, Gabon. We also determined the prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I/II in siblings born to seropositive <b>mothers.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> to HTLV-I/II were detected by Western blot, and the proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The risk of seroconversion to anti-HTLV-I for the 4 years of follow-yp was 17. 5 %. Anti-HTLV-I/II and proviral DNA were only detected after age 18 months. We observed a seroprevalence rate of 15 % among the siblings born to HTLV-I/II seropositive mothers. Furthermore, we report a case of mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-II infection in a population of HTLV-II-infected pregnant women that is emerging in Gabon. The lack of detection of HTLV-I/II proviral DNA in cord blood and amniotic fluid and, furthermore, the late seroconversion observed in the children indirectly indicate that mother-to-child transmission occured postnatally, probably through breast milk.

40|$|In {{countries}} {{with a high}} transmission rate of rubella the optimal age for universal rubella vaccination of infants is critically dependent upon the rate of loss of maternal antibodies. Few studies have investigated the decay characteristics of such antibodies. Mother:infant pairs were recruited at the Ethio-Swedish Children's Hospital, Addis Ababa, in 1994 / 95. Rubella antibody levels, determined by radial haemolysis, were available for analysis from 1542 Infants aged 0 - 12 months, with 942 repeat measures, and from 846 mothers. Decay in seropositivity was well described by a delayed exponential function. The proportion seropositive at age 6, 9, or 12 months was 6 - 13 %, 1 - 4 %, or 0 - 1 %, respectively, dependent upon assay cut-off level.

50|$|In cats, the {{antibodies}} {{are already}} {{present in the}} queen's blood before parturition. The blood group antigens are similar in structure to the antigen of a common bacteria in the gut of cats leading to antibody formation. Kittens obtain {{the majority of their}} immune response from the colostrum, and are not born with a strong immune response. When they absorb the <b>mother's</b> <b>antibodies</b> against their blood type it causes lysis of the red blood cells leading to anemia. Symptoms include lethargy, weakness, depression, pale mucus membranes, fever, and blood in the urine. Hypoxia may lead to forebrain disease, increased heart rate and respiratory rate, and liver or kidney disease. Animals suffering from this disease must be taken to a veterinarian immediately. Treatment includes fluid support and blood transfusions. The condition is most commonly seen in kitten with type-A blood born to mothers with type-B blood since type-B cats form very strong anti-type A antibodies. The condition is less common (and less severe) in type-B kittens born to type-A mothers.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the causes}} of {{variation}} in host immunity to parasitic infection and the time-scales over which variation persists, is integral to predicting the evolutionary and epidemiological consequences of host-parasite interactions. It is clear that offspring immunity can be influenced by parental immune experience, for example, reflecting transfer of <b>antibodies</b> from <b>mothers</b> to young offspring. However, it is less clear whether such parental effects persist or have functional consequences over longer time-scales, linking a parent's previous immune experience to future immune responsiveness in fully grown offspring. We used free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify long-term effects of parental immune experience on offspring immune response. We experimentally vaccinated parents with a novel antigen and tested whether parental vaccination influenced the humoral antibody response mounted by fully grown offspring hatched the following year. Parental vaccination did not influence offspring baseline antibody titres. However, offspring of vaccinated mothers mounted substantially stronger antibody responses than offspring of unvaccinated <b>mothers.</b> <b>Antibody</b> responses did not differ between offspring of vaccinated and unvaccinated fathers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{compare the}} drop of Chagas {{antibody}} titres between non-infected and congenitally infected newborns treated by two doses of benznidazole, aiming at evaluating the recovery time and giving recommendations regarding serological criteria of recovery. METHODS During a clinical trial, {{the drop of}} Trypanosoma cruzi antibody titres measured by ELISA tests was followed {{during the first year}} of life in congenitally infected newborns treated with different doses of benznidazole and compared to T. cruzi antibody titres in non-parasitaemic newborns. Confirmation of recovery was given by two negative serological tests: Chagas Stat-Pak (R) (CSP) (immunochromatography) and Chagatest (R) v 3. 0 (ELISA). RESULTS In non-parasitaemic infants of infected <b>mothers,</b> <b>antibodies</b> of maternal origin disappeared in < 8 months while in infected infants, T. cruzi antibodies decreased more slowly and disappeared in 9 - 16 months allowing to confirm the recovery. All CSP tests were negative before the ninth month while about 10 % of ELISA tests remained positive at the 12 th month. CONCLUSIONS Recovery may be confirmed in most cases at 10 months. The CSP test was compared to Chagatest (R) v 3. 0 ELISA and appeared to give a reliable response. The decrease rate of antibodies does not depend on treatment modes...|$|R
40|$|Acetylcholine {{receptor}} (AChR) antibodies {{are present}} in around 85 % of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) {{as measured by the}} conventional radioimmunoprecipitation assay. Antibodies that block the fetal form of the AChR are occasionally present in mothers who develop MG after pregnancy, especially in those whose babies are born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. The antibodies cross the placenta and block neuromuscular transmission, leading to joint deformities and often stillbirth. In these <b>mothers,</b> <b>antibodies</b> made in the thymus are mainly specific for fetal AChR and show restricted germline origins, suggesting a highly mutated clonal response; subsequent spread to involve adult AChR could explain development of maternal MG in those cases who first present after pregnancy. In the 15 % of "seronegative" MG patients without AChR antibodies (SNMG), there are serum factors that increase AChR phosphorylation and reduce AChR function, probably acting via a different membrane receptor. These factors are not IgG and could be IgM or even non-Ig serum proteins. In a proportion of SNMG patients, however, IgG antibodies to the muscle-specific kinase, MuSK, are present. These antibodies are not found in AChR antibody-positive MG and are predominantly IgG 4. MuSK antibody positivity appears to be associated with more severe bulbar disease that can be difficult to treat effectively...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Guinea-Bissau we {{conducted}} a randomized trial of OPV 0 versus No OPV 0 to test the effect of not receiving OPV 0 on infant mortality and morbidity. In two subgroups of participants, 6 -week-old children and 6 -month-old children, we investigated the effect of OPV 0 on neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus type 1 and 3. Design: A subgroup of infants randomized to receive OPV 0 or No OPV 0 {{in addition to the}} usual childhood vaccines were visited at home at 6  weeks or 6  months of age, and a blood sample was collected from the child and the mother. Setting: Urban Guinea-Bissau. Main outcome: Geometric mean titers (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies and seropositivity (titer ⩾  1 : 8) for poliovirus type 1 and 3. Results: OPV 0 did not affect the overall seropositivity at 6  weeks or 6  months of age for either polio 1 or 3. In 6 -week-old infants, not receiving OPV 0 was associated with significantly lower GMT for polio 1 and 3 (GMT ratio =  0. 52 (95 % CI =  0. 33 – 0. 79) for polio 1; 0. 44 (0. 28 – 0. 70) for polio 3), the effect being significant in its own right in boys and in children whose <b>mothers</b> had low <b>antibody</b> levels. In contrast, in 6 -month-old infants, not receiving OPV 0 was associated with significantly higher GMT for polio 1 (GMT ratio =  2. 10 (1. 32 – 3. 35)).
