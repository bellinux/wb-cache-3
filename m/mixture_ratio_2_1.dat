Bioassay-guided fractionation using DPPH autobiographic {{analysis of the}} EtOAc soluble fraction of the crude extract resulted in the isolation of agathisflavone (1) and a mixture of quercetin 3 -O-rutinoside (2) and quercetin 3 -O-rhamnoside (3). Characterization of the isolated compounds was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance (<b>1</b> D and <b>2</b> D) and mass spectrometry. The antioxidant activities of the samples were determined using three complementary tests, namely; DPPH-radical scavenging, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The antimicrobial activity of the samples was evaluated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>mixture</b> (<b>ratio</b> <b>2</b> : <b>1)</b> of compounds (<b>2)</b> and (3) was most active in its capacity to scavenge free radicals in the DPPH assay [IC 50 = 0. 96 ± 0. 01 μg/mL] compared to the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction, the ascorbic acid and quercetin standards. The mixture of compounds (2) and (3) exhibited the highest activities in the TAC assay (5332. 00 ± 3. 38 mgAAE/g, 8562. 00 ± 5. 43 mgQE/g) and FRAP assay (15, 136. 00 ± 7. 14 mgAAE/g, 199, 530. 00 ± 94. 12 mgQE/g) compared to the EtOAc fraction. The fractions of the extract showed comparatively better activities against gram-negative than the gram positive ones with the broadest spectrum of activities demonstrated for the ethyl acetate fraction. No inhibitions were obtained against the fungal strains investigated. The isolated compounds from the plant possess essentially inhibitory rather than cidal activities against these organisms with the Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs) > 2. 0 mg/mL in all cases. The mixture of compounds 2 and 3 showed higher activity than compound 1 with the former having MIC as low as 0. 25 mg/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium sporogens, 0. 5 mg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and 1. 0 mg/mL against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia strains investigated while the latter has an MIC of 1. 0 mg/mL against most of the organisms. This study concluded that the extracts and isolated compounds had strong antioxidant and moderate antibacterial activities and could be effective in the management of oxidative stress related diseases.

Moreover, it is found that the concentration of acetic acid is proportional to the amount of cow manure at the beginning (the first day) of mixed fermentation, and the concentration of propionicacid is proportional to the amount of corn straw in medium fermentation stage (the fifth day). In addition, rate-limiting step of biogas production is related to the ratio of cow manure and corn in fermentation material. With the increasing of corn straw proportion, on the 1 st day, it tends to hydrolysis acidogenesis; from the 2 th day to 15 th day, it tends to hydrogen-production acetogenisis; and from the 16 th day to 30 th day, it is hydrolysis acidogenesis.

Methods: the population was studied in 1976 – 1978 resurveyed in 1981 – 1983 and 1991 – 1994 and followed with regard to survival for up to 12 years. Approximately 3, 700 elderly participants {{with a mean age}} of 76 years were availa-ble for analyses. Results: the prevalence of chronic bronchitis was 13. 0 % in women and 18. 6 % in men. Multiple logistic regression yielded the following predictors for chronic bronchitis: male gender (odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval = 1. 1 (0. 9 – 1. 3)), previous smoking odds ratio = <b>1.</b> 7 (<b>1.</b> <b>2</b> – 2. 2), present smoking odds <b>ratio</b> = <b>2.</b> <b>1</b> (<b>2.</b> <b>1</b> – 3. 8), previous exposure to dusts and fumes (odds <b>ratio</b> = <b>2.</b> <b>2</b> (<b>1.</b> 7 – <b>2.</b> 7)), chest infections in childhood (odds <b>ratio</b> = <b>2.</b> <b>1</b> (<b>1.</b> 6 – <b>2.</b> 9)), more than 6 chest infections in previous 10 years (odds <b>ratio</b> = 6. <b>2</b> (4. <b>1</b> – 9. <b>2))</b> and alcohol consumption of more than 3 drinks a day (odds ratio = 1. 8 (<b>1.</b> 3 – <b>2.</b> 3)).

The average S/P <b>ratio</b> was 24. <b>2</b> <b>1</b> f <b>2.</b> 06 and for Dp/Ds <b>ratio,</b> <b>1.</b> <b>2</b> <b>1</b> rt 0. 03. At most, 3 % of sheep within the population had S/P> 50 and 18 % had Dp/Ds<l. Residual correlations indicated a significant association involving between-fibre diameter variation and each of S/p, Dp/Ds and average fibre diameter at mid-sebaceous level, but no association with follicle density...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} component of a high-voltage half reflector impulse radiating antenna (HIRA) is the feed-point lens. Designs are available to feed reflectors which have focal length to diameter ratios (F/D) equal to 0. 25, but the theory for higher F/D ratios has not been available. We develop here the theory for F/D ratios larger than 0. 25. We retain a rotationally symmetric lens; but the lens is now penetrated by an off-axis inner conductor. This conductor is offset such that the charge center follows a ray path, from the input feed, through the lens, which emerges at the specific angle required to obtain the target F/D <b>ratio.</b> <b>2</b> <b>1...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{calculations of}} the noise radiated by a supersonic elliptic jet. The large scale structures in the jet, that are the predominant source of noise in the downstream direction, are modeled as instability waves. The evolution of the instability waves is determined by a local, linear, inviscid analysis. An expression is derived for the acoustic field outside the jet and the far field directivity associated with each instability wave. Calculations are performed for a Mach 1. 5 elliptic jet with aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>2</b> : <b>1</b> and a Mach 2. 0 elliptic jet with aspect <b>ratio</b> <b>2</b> : <b>1</b> and a Mach 2. 0 elliptic jet with aspect ratio 3 : 1. The mean flow development is taken from experimental results. Comparisons are made with far field acoustic measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} wave ignition concept was experimentally studied {{in order to}} verify its suitability for application in baffled sections of a large booster engine combustion chamber. Gaseous oxygen/gaseous methane (GOX/GH 4) and gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (GOX/GH 2) propellant combinations were evaluated in a subscale {{combustion wave}} ignition system. The system included four element tubes capable of carrying ignition energy simultaneously to four locations, simulating four baffled sections. Also, direct ignition of a simulated Main Combustion Chamber (MCC) was performed. Tests were conducted over a range of <b>mixture</b> <b>ratios</b> and tube geometries. Ignition was consistently attained {{over a wide range}} of <b>mixture</b> <b>ratios.</b> And at every ignition, the flame propagated through all four element tubes. For GOX/GH 4, the ignition system ignited the MCC flow at <b>mixture</b> <b>ratios</b> from <b>2</b> to 10 and for GOX/GH <b>2</b> the <b>ratios</b> is from <b>2</b> to 13. The ignition timing was found to be rapid and uniform. The total ignition delay when using the MCC was under 11 ms, with the tube-to-tube, as well as the run-to-run, variation under 1 ms. Tube geometries were found to have negligible effect on the ignition outcome and timing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{prenatal}} exposure to coumarins (acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon) on neurological outcome was assessed in {{a cohort of}} 306 children aged 7 - 15 years. Findings were compared with those in a non-exposed cohort of 267 children, matched for sex, age, and demographic region. We used a neurological examination technique which pays special attention to minor neurological dysfunction (MND), None of the children tvas found to be neurologically abnormal. However, exposure to coumarins during gestation increases the risk for MND in children of school age, odds ratio (OR) 1. 9 (CI 95 1. 1 - 3. 4), predominantly after exposure in {{the second or third}} trimester, odds <b>ratio</b> <b>2.</b> <b>1</b> (CI 95 <b>1.</b> <b>2</b> - 3. 8). We found a dose-response relationship with an odds <b>ratio</b> of <b>1.</b> <b>2</b> (CI 95 <b>1.</b> 0 - 1. 5) per mg coumarin derivative prescribed per day. The results suggest that coumarins have an influence {{on the development of the}} brain which can lead to mild neurological dysfunctions in children of school age.
