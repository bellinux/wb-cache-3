5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis is a label {{applied to}} several {{neurological}} {{conditions in which}} the blood contains <b>misshapen,</b> spiculated red blood cells called acanthocytes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases of}} {{nearsightedness}} {{are recognized as}} due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle, rather than a <b>misshapen</b> eyeball. These are classed as pseudomyopia, of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement.|$|E
5|$|The terete leaves readily {{distinguish}} Isopogon anethifolius {{from other}} members of the genus, which have flat leaves and are greater than 1mm (in) across. On a microscopic level, the supporting ground tissue of I.anethifolius differs from some of its genus by its irregular <b>misshapen</b> sclereids (thick-walled cells that make up part of the ground tissue) and contorted cell body.|$|E
5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to nematodes, the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become <b>misshapen.</b> Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing <b>misshapen</b> lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes <b>misshapen</b> or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up <b>misshapen.</b> Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In both instances, the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his <b>misshapen</b> face, much like the Monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{signs of}} H5N1 in birds range from mild - {{decrease}} in egg production, nasal discharge, coughing and sneezing - to severe, including loss of coordination, energy, and appetite; soft-shelled or <b>misshapen</b> eggs; purple discoloration of the wattles, head, eyelids, combs, and hocks; and diarrhea. Sometimes the first noticeable sign is sudden death.|$|E
25|$|During labour and birth, the infant's skull changes {{shape to}} fit through the birth canal, {{sometimes}} causing {{the child to}} be born with a <b>misshapen</b> or elongated head. It will usually return to normal on its own {{within a few days}} or weeks. Special exercises sometimes advised by physicians may assist the process.|$|E
25|$|The second {{possibility}} is High Sunderland Hall, near Halifax, now demolished. This Gothic edifice was located near Law Hill, where Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838. While {{it was perhaps}} grander than Wuthering Heights, the hall had grotesque embellishments of griffins and <b>misshapen</b> nude males similar to those described by Lockwood in Chapter 1 of the novel.|$|E
25|$|Starkweather {{attended}} Saratoga Elementary School, Irving Junior High School, and Lincoln High School. In {{contrast to}} his family life, Starkweather remembered nothing positive of his time at school. Starkweather was born with genu varum, a mild birth defect that caused his legs to be <b>misshapen.</b> He also suffered from a speech impediment, which led to constant teasing by classmates.|$|E
25|$|The hip {{could have}} major contractions or {{seizures}} from dysplasias. The caput is not deeply and tightly {{held by the}} acetabulum. Instead of being a snug fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are <b>misshapen,</b> causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.|$|E
25|$|The {{abundant}} sori {{are dark}} brown and variable in shape, fusing {{with one another}} as they grow. The sori are covered with firm, white indusia. In wild specimens, they are found beneath the costa (midrib of the pinnae). As a sterile tetraploid hybrid, the spores are seen to be <b>misshapen</b> and abortive under microscopic examination. The species has a chromosome number of 144 (2 × 72) in the sporophyte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, the county {{sponsored}} an archaeological dig {{at the site}} of the Persen House, one of the four at the Crown-John intersection, as part of efforts to restore it and make it a museum. It yielded a number of artifacts, including some <b>misshapen</b> apparent cannonballs. Eight years later, in 2008, after having spent $2 million on the project the county was still unsure what to do with the building. It was hoping to use federal stimulus money to finish the work.|$|E
25|$|The gods fashion {{their home}} on Olympus, and Zeus seduces Hera by {{transforming}} {{himself into a}} cuckoo. Their child is hideous and <b>misshapen,</b> and Hera throws the child out into the sky. At the revelation of his parentage, Hephaestus breaks the brooch, and half is washed to sea. His desire for vengeance are tempered by the realization of Zeus' immense power. The narrative then shifts from Hephaestus and the goddesses to recount concurrent events amongst the Olympians, including the arrival at Olympus of Apollo, Artemis, Athene and Hermes.|$|E
25|$|Mutations causing {{progeria}} are defective in splicing LMNA mRNA, therefore producing abnormal lamin A protein, {{also known}} as progerin. The mutations activate a cryptic splice site within exon 11 of the gene, thereby causing the deletion of the processing site on prelamin A. This results in an accumulation of progerin that is unable to mature into lamin A, leading to <b>misshapen</b> nuclei. Missplicing also leads to the complete or partial loss of exon 11 and results in a truncated prelamin A protein in the neonatal lethal tight skin contracture syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid between A.resiliens and A.heterochroum, Morzenti's spleenwort (A.heteroresiliens), {{is found}} in Florida and the Carolinas. As A.resiliens is {{triploid}} and A.heterochroum is tetraploid, the hybrid is pentaploid and reproduces apogamously. The hybrid is difficult to distinguish from the parental species, being intermediate in morphology; its fertile veins are sometimes less forked than in A.resiliens, its leaves {{tend to have more}} toothed edges, and it bears <b>misshapen</b> sterile spores together with large, globose, unreduced spores. In A.resiliens, the sori are close to the pinna margin; in A.heteroresiliens, they are slightly closer to the margin than to the costa.|$|E
25|$|Priapus' iconic {{attribute}} was his priapism (permanently erect penis); {{he probably}} absorbed some pre-existing ithyphallic deities as his cult developed. He was represented {{in a variety}} of ways, most commonly as a <b>misshapen</b> gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens or at doorways and crossroads. To propitiate Priapus, the traveler would stroke the statue's penis as he passed by. The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.|$|E
25|$|But {{his only}} signed {{pictures}} {{of this period}} are the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 at Berlin, and the Madonna, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet of 1517, at the Louvre, both of which suggest that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Gossaert in the true method of producing pictures full of mythological nude figures and poesies. It {{is difficult to find}} anything more coarse or <b>misshapen</b> than the Amphitrite, unless it is the grotesque and ungainly drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject—the Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin and Venus and Amor (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)—there is more nudity, combined with realism of the commonest type.|$|E
500|$|Dot's old-fashioned {{style of}} dress has been likened to the {{clothing}} collection of Prada's designer, Miuccia Prada. Dot {{has been said}} to have inspired clothing, hairstyles and has been quoted by various fashion professionals as a style icon. She has also inspired catwalk themes, {{such as that of}} aspiring designer Hollie Luxton in 2007, who stated, [...] "I wanted to capture the nostalgia of the bygone days and play with the idea of clothing coming out of the wash <b>misshapen</b> and faded." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert's biographer Jane Stedman {{wrote that}} Pinafore is [...] "satirically far more complex" [...] than The Sorcerer. She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, {{including}} {{the idea of}} gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from [...] "Captain Reece" [...] (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from [...] "General John" [...] (1867). Dick Deadeye, based on a character in [...] "Woman's Gratitude" [...] (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the <b>misshapen</b> misanthrope whose forbidding [...] "face and form" [...] makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense. Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, The Gentleman in Black which includes the device of baby-switching.|$|E
500|$|Big Red Software {{started work}} and had 90% {{completed}} the project, {{which had the}} working title Movieland Dizzy, before the team was told to replace Dizzy with a new character. This was because the creators of Dizzy, the Oliver Twins, disagreed with the direction that Movieland Dizzy was taking the character, after discussions Codemasters agreed. Pete Ranson, Paul's brother, was one of Big Red Software's graphic designers and was given the job of creating a new character. This character began as a <b>misshapen</b> egg, was given fingers, and was given jump animations that lacked Dizzy's bounce. A friend of the Ranson's, having seen the character graphics, stated that [...] "he looked like a Seymour". The name [...] "stuck" [...] and the new character was completed.|$|E
500|$|Carrots {{are grown}} from seed {{and can take}} up to four months (120 days) to mature, but most cultivars mature within 70 to 80 days under the right conditions. They grow best in full sun but {{tolerate}} some shade. The optimum temperature is [...] The ideal soil is deep, loose and well-drained, sandy or loamy, with a pH of 6.3 to 6.8. Fertilizer should be applied according to soil type because the crop requires low levels of nitrogen, moderate phosphate and high potash. Rich or rocky soils should be avoided, as these will cause the roots to become hairy and/or <b>misshapen.</b> Irrigation is applied when needed to keep the soil moist. After sprouting, the crop is eventually thinned to a spacing of [...] and weeded to prevent competition beneath the soil.|$|E
500|$|The Puritan {{leaders of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's {{suffering}} and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God. [...] Winthrop wrote, [...] "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, [...] "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented <b>misshapen</b> opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters." [...] Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, [...] "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!" ...|$|E
500|$|Banksia serrata usually grows as a gnarled and <b>misshapen</b> tree up to 16m (50ft) tall, {{although}} in some coastal habitats it grows as a shrub of 1–3m (3–10ft), and on exposed coastal cliffs it {{has even been}} recorded as a prostrate shrub. As a tree it usually has a single, stout trunk with warty, [...] grey bark up to 3cm (1.2in) thick. Trunks are often black from past bushfires, and ooze a red sap when injured. New growth appears in spring, summer and autumn. New [...] are hairy, remaining so {{for two to three}} years. Leaves are usually crowded together at the upper end of branches, giving the canopy a thin, sparse appearance. The leaves themselves are dark glossy green above and light green below, [...] (rarely up to [...] ) long by [...] (rarely up to [...] ) wide, and oblong to [...] (egg-shaped) in shape. The leaf margins are serrated, except near the base, with lobes between [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|The roughly oval gritsone font at {{the west}} end of the nave, which is from the 12th century, has a zig-zag pattern, and three sides {{decorated}} with a cross. The base of the font, which is rectangular with rounded corners, has <b>misshapen</b> carved human heads at the corners {{and in the middle of}} one side, and a snake on two of the sides. A [...] "P"-shaped sign on the east side of the font may have been added later. [...] St Mary's has a coffin lid dating from the middle of the 13th century, displayed upside down on the north wall of the chancel. It is decorated with a carved cross and a foliage design. One 19th-century visitor noted another three old plain coffin lids on the church floor, with another in the churchyard near the east window. As well as an 18th-century slate plaque on the south wall of the nave, there are also various memorials from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
500|$|The {{symbolism}} in Winesburg, Ohio plays a {{large role}} in allowing for this reorientation. Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose [...] "...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of <b>misshapen</b> feelings, what Dr. Reefy in the sketch 'Paper Pills' calls 'the sweetness of the twisted apples'". The irony of the sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy's own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread into his pockets (itself a symbol of the [...] "ineffectuality of human thought"). Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story [...] "Hands", likewise was [...] "...forever striving to conceal [...] in his pockets or behind his back". [...] For Wing, his hands were [...] "...the very index of his humanity", with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality to sublimated homosexuality. Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, weather conditions and time of day, and events, among other features of the stories.|$|E
500|$|The spores are [...] to {{somewhat}} spindle-shaped with narrowed ends, {{and light}} brownish in color. The {{size of the}} spores varies depending upon the type of asci in which they develop: in one-spored asci they measure 42.5–62.5 by 17.5–30µm; in two-spored asci they are 32.5–50 by 15–25µm; in three-spored asci they are 27.5–45 by 15–25µm; in four-spored asci they are 25–38.5 by 13–28µm; in five-spored asci 28–34 by 22–25µm (all sizes excluding surface ornamentation). The spore walls are 2–3µm thick and are covered with a honeycomb-like (...) network. The cavities of the honeycomb typically have five or six sides, and the corners form spines that are 5–7µm tall by 0.5µm thick. A [...] "microreticulum" [...] appears in some spores when the light microscope objective {{is focused on the}} optical cross section but not on the spore wall surface, or on scanning electron microscopy micrographs of the surface. Young asci range in shape from spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ovoid (egg-shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped); sometimes the base of the ascus is narrowed like a stipe,and measures up to 15 by 7µm. Mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or <b>misshapen</b> from the pressure of crowded spores within. They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, 60–85 by 65–75µm, 1–4-(occasionally 5)-spored, and astipitate (without a stipe) at maturity.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{parents were}} poor tenant farmers {{who worked in}} the tobacco fields as sharecroppers. The family used an outhouse, drew water from a cistern, and did laundry in a {{cast-iron}} tub over an open flame. Their house did not have running water until Robinson was ten years old. When Robinson was born, he was so seriously ill that the doctor was certain he would not survive. He was temporarily paralyzed from birth and his head was <b>misshapen.</b> So likely was Robinson's death that the physician asked Robinson's father Charles for a name for the baby's birth and death certificates. Robinson's parents were young (his mother Imogene was twenty) and they were hoping for a girl. They named the baby [...] "Vicky Gene Robinson" [...] for Charles' father Victor and the baby's mother Imogene. For a long time, Robinson's parents believed the boy would die soon. Much later in life, Robinson's father would tell him he couldn't take any joy in the boy's development because he always thought each step {{was going to be the}} last thing. Robinson's parents were and still are members of a small Disciples of Christ congregation. Robinson describes his childhood as very religious. Robinson had perfect Sunday School attendance for thirteen years.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s, {{before the}} herds were managed by various agencies, many {{conformation}} faults were found—the effects of uncontrolled inbreeding. <b>Misshapen</b> legs, narrow chests, poor bone {{and a lack}} of substance plagued the breed, with many stunted animals not growing above [...] This was partially due to the limited and poor-quality feed found on the islands, although this harsh habitat also allowed only the hardiest and most adaptable ponies to survive. Welsh and Shetland pony blood was added to upgrade the stock, and horses with pinto coloring were introduced to give the herd its common distinctive patterns and contribute to the more horse-like phenotype of the breed. Twenty Mustangs owned by the Bureau of Land Management were introduced in 1939. [...] Arabian blood was added in the hopes of adding refinement and height to the breed, as well as increasing the length of their legs. [...] Arabian stallions were used at two different points within the breed history: one was released with the herd, but did not survive, while another was bred to mares that had been removed from the island for breeding and then returned once in foal. The Chincoteague pony has a similar history to the Shackleford Banker Horse, which comes from the Shackleford Banks off the coast of North Carolina. However, the Shackleford is a more isolated population, with no outside blood added to the island herd.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes from}} the script were cut during filming, {{most of which were}} brief time lapses or {{transitioning}} scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary. One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery. The scene with the town clerk berating Dr. Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be [...] "impatient". He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Dr. Caligari. Another deviation from the script comes when Dr. Caligari first awakens Cesare, {{one of the most famous}} moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Dr. Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's face as he gradually opens his eyes. The original title cards for Caligari featured stylized, <b>misshapen</b> lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time. The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering.|$|E
500|$|Since the episode's initial airing, Blinky {{has been}} {{mentioned}} several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. A reporter for the Lincoln Journal Star compared Blinky to a rainbow trout with two mouths caught in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2005. The fish was mentioned in a National Review article discussing a legislation {{which would make it}} illegal to import, possess or release alive into California any live transgenic fish: [...] "Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of The Simpsons with Blinky, the three-eyed fish that swims by the nuclear-power plant." [...] Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay, which, {{according to a study by}} the University of California, Davis, had a shrunken brain and <b>misshapen</b> body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay. In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant, Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure, [...] "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted." [...] Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay: [...] "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay? Probably not, but local environmentalists are worried that digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago." [...] In his article about the nuclear power plant operator Exelon, Thomas M.
