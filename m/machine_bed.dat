The two functional requirements of <b>machine</b> tool <b>bed</b> for <b>machine</b> tools are high structural stiffness and high damping, which cannot be satisfied simultaneously if conventional metallic materials such as cast iron are employed. Hence {{there is a need}} to replace cast iron with alternate materials. Approach: The objective of this study is to improve the stiffness, natural frequency and damping capability of <b>machine</b> tool <b>bed</b> using a composite material containing welded steel and polymer concrete. Welded steel material has high stiffness but low damping and polymer concrete has high damping but low stiffness. So in this study, a <b>machine</b> tool <b>bed</b> made of sandwich structures of welded steel and polymer concrete is designed and manufactured. Modal and static analyses were conducted numerically and experimentally to determine the modal frequencies, damping ratio, deformation and strain. Results: The results at first mode showed that the natural frequency improved by 24. 7 % and damping ratio was 2. 7 times higher than cast iron. The comparison of strain and deformation also showed significant improvement.

40|$|Abstract — Structural {{materials}} used in a machine tool have a decisive {{role in determining the}} productivity and accuracy of the part manufactured in it. The conventional structural {{materials used}} in precision machine tools such as cast iron and steel at high operating speeds develop positional errors due to the vibrations transferred into the structure. Faster cutting speeds can be acquired only by structure which has high stiffness and good damping characteristics. Clearly the life of a machine is inversely proportional to the levels of vibration that the machine is subjected. The further process is carried out to undergo the deformation, natural frequency and displacement using Static analysis, Modal analysis and Harmonic analysis respectively. Since the bed in machine tool plays a critical role in ensuring the precision and accuracy in components. It {{is one of the most}} important tool structures which tend to absorb the vibrations resulting from the cutting operation. To analyze the bed for possible material changes that could increase stiffness, reduce weight, improve damping characteristics and isolate natural frequency from the operating range. This was the main motivation behind the idea to go in for a composite model involving High Modulus Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite Material (HM CFRP). Though carbon has good strength and stiffness properties but it lacks in damping requirements. On the other hand polymer, though it lacks in strength but it has good damping characteristics and it is used to hold the carbon fibers. This makes it ideal to combine these materials in a proper manner. In this work, a <b>machine</b> <b>bed</b> is selected for the analysis static loads. Then investigation is carried out to reduce the weight of the <b>machine</b> <b>bed</b> without deteriorating its structural rigidity. The 3 D CAD model of the bed has been created by using commercial 3 D modelling software and analyses were carried out using ANSYS.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the new active {{mounting}} of the machine tool drives. The commonly used machine tools are at this time mainly equipped with fix-mounting of the feed drives.

The new active mounting of the machine tool drives allows to fully control the force behaviour that react to the machine body. Thereby the number of excited frequencies on the machine tool bed is significantly reduced.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{requirements}} {{on the economic}} and energy efficiency {{as well as the}} machining accuracy of manufacturing processes lead to the use of innovative materials and production technologies. By deploying mineral casting as a construction material for <b>machine</b> <b>beds</b> the primary energy demand and manufacturing costs on the one hand can be reduced significantly. On the other hand the mechanical and thermal properties of mineral cast allow for an increase in process reliability and productivity of highly dynamic manufacturing processes. However, the hardness and wear resistance of the quartzitic aggregates in the compound have an adverse effect on the machinability of mineral cast with geometrically defined cutting edges. High alternating mechanical loads and abrasive tool wear lead to short tool life and high manufacturing costs. Nevertheless, machining of mineral cast with geometrically defined cutting edges represents a key driver for the design and manufacturing of mineral cast components according to customer specific requirements. The Institute for Machine Tools and Factory Management (IWF) at the Technische Universität Berlin performed comprehensive cutting tests to analyze the general performance behavior of super-hard cutting materials in machining mineral cast.
