For example, the IMA commissioned [...] "Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry Working Group" [...] deals with minerals in the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. The group's scope includes mineral-forming microorganisms, which exist on nearly every rock, soil, and particle surface spanning the globe to depths of at least 1600 metres below the sea floor and 70 kilometres into the stratosphere (possibly entering the mesosphere). Biogeochemical cycles {{have contributed to the}} formation of minerals for billions of years. Microorganisms can precipitate metals from solution, contributing to the formation of ore deposits. They can also catalyze the dissolution of minerals.|$|E

Magnetic <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> characterisation is performed using a variety of magnetic properties that are related to magnetic mineral abundance, magnetic grain size (domain state), oxidation state and magnetic grain interaction. The magnetic methodology extends that based on a conventional set of environmental magnetic measurements. Using a variety of recent sediments, transported from known rock sources (within the UK and Eire), it is demonstrated, using discriminant function analysis, that the magnetic properties of the Fe-oxide inclusions provide a clear distinction of primary provenance. This is both at the large scale in terms of various gneiss, schist and granite sources and also at a smaller scale when considering subdivisions of these sources. Using case studies from the marine Upper Jurassic (Piper Formation) and non-marine Triassic sediments (Otter Bank Sandstone and Foula Sandstone Formations), it is shown that provenance differences, clearly expressed by the results of heavy mineral analysis, are also sensitively displayed by the magnetic <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> data. The provenance classification is based around use of hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Simple statistical tools are developed to determine a least-noisy subset of magnetic parameters, which are most suitable for stratigraphic provenance discrimination.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports a}} study of the microstructures and <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusions</b> {{associated}} with microdiamond-formation in samples of a garnet websterite pod exposed within a mantle-derived peridotite body at Bardane on Fjørtoft, western Norway. This pod is interpreted to have originally comprised a megacrystic assemblage of orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + garnet + Cr-spinel (Cr * » 75) + minor olivine that probably crystallised within a mid-Proterozoic (1651 ± 47 Ma) mantle diapir/plume at conditions of around 1410 oC and 3. 2 GPa. The observed microdiamonds are clearly not part of this early (M 1) paragenesis but formed later, following a deformation-induced fluid infiltration event. The diamond and other carbon-phase <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusions</b> rarely occur in isolation, instead in composite aggregates with other, mostly micro-scale, <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusions</b> that include phlogopite, kalsilite, Cr-spinel (Cr * » 55), magnesite, Ba-Mg carbonate, Fe-Ni sulphide, Cl-apatite, rutile, zircon and monazite. Thus a metasomatic fluid has clearly introduced other elements (such as K, Ba, Ti, Fe, S, P, Cl, Zr, Cl, Th, and Nb) into this peridotite body, in addition to carbon. Back-scattered electron SEM images demonstrate that the introduced suite of <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusions</b> is spatially intimately associated with M 2 generation grains of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, garnet and Cr-spinel (Cr * » 55) that occur both as internally-exsolved phases within deformed and highly-strained M 1 megacrysts and as a coronitic boundary network of grains precipitated between physically-fragmented M 1 megacrysts.

Placer- lode relationships have been established through study of gold alloy compositions and associated <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> assemblages.

40|$|A {{suite of}} {{diamonds}} from eastern Australia, “Group B”, are essentially eclogitic. However, <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> compositions are unlike eclogitic diamonds from other occurrences. Garnets are very Ca-rich (Gr₆₁–₈₄) and clinopyroxenes are mostly diopsidic (16 ± 10 mol% Jd). Other inclusions in these diamonds are SiO₂, titanite, olivine, molybdenite and melilite—a truly unique suite! Garnet and clinopyroxene are not accompanied by indications of fertile mantle conditions. Rather, we find depletions in Fe, Mn, Na, K, coupled with high Ni and Cr in some clinopyroxenes. The chemistry of the garnets and clinopyroxenes suggests affinities with rodingites—metasomatised mafic rocks {{that occur in}} ophiolites. “Group B” diamonds are ¹³C-enriched (δ¹³C=+ 1. 1 ± 1. 3 ‰ (1 S.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{association}} between regions containing orogenic gold mineralization and exploitation of placer gold, although {{in many cases the}} nature of the source mineralization for these placer deposits remains unclear. This study describes a novel approach to evaluating the economic potential of in situ orogenic gold mineralization through characterization of both lode and placer gold mineralogy followed by synthesis of this information with records of both mineral occurrences and historical placer mining. The northern Cariboo Gold District (CGD) in east-central British Columbia, Canada, was chosen as a location for the study because of the gold endowment of the area (1. 2 million oz. of lode gold and between 0. 5 and 3 million oz. of placer gold) and the information available from both placer and lode gold mining. Compositional analysis of 533 gold grains from 21 lode localities and 1, 914 gold grains from 30 placer localities from throughout the CGD has identified four main compositional types in terms of their alloy compositions and associated suite of mineral inclusions revealed in polished section. A distinctive low (4 - 7 %) Ag gold that exhibits a strong Bi association in the <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> suite is geographically limited to the Wells area, where it is recorded in both lode mineralization and its placer expression. Regionally pervasive mineralization yields gold of binary Au-Ag alloy and a simple inclusion suite of sulfides and sulfarsenides. Gold in most large placers in trunk drainages was derived from multiple (mostly small) occurrences of this type. The nature of compositional variation between gold grains liberated from hypogene ore has informed the history of episodic mineralization and suggests multiple stages of gold emplacement at some localities whilst others are dominated by gold deposited in a single stage. The new information from gold grain analysis has been considered in the context of other strands of information. Classification of a placer as either allocthonous or autocthonous informs both interpretation of compositional characteristics of the detrital gold grains and provides information on distance to the hypogene source. <b>Mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> assemblages observed in sample populations of placer gold grains have been correlated with reports of hypogene vein mineralogy described in mineral occurrence records to clarify the geographical extent of specific mineralization types. The compositional range of alloys of different gold types has been compared to historical records of gold production and gold fineness (Au-Ag ratio) to reconstruct the size and distribution of hypogene sources prior to erosion. Synthesis of gold compositional studies with other publically accessible data sets provides a new generic approach capable of evaluating the most attractive targets for future exploration and highlighting compositional signatures of placer gold which relate to undiscovered in situ sources...|$|E

Two sub-types differ in colour absorption spectra, one being unusual in lacking the typical Fe 2 +-Fe 3 + charge transfer effects found in such sapphires. Related trapiche-like corundums (5 %) show higher Cr 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3, possibly due to Fe-Ti oxide exsolution. Vari-coloured, diffuse-zoned and pale blue sapphires (10 %) have higher Cr 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 and colour absorption characteristics intermediate between BGY sapphires and pink to red corundums with elevated Cr 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3. The BGY and trapiche-like sapphires are considered magmatic, the intermediate sapphires magmatic-metasomatic (possibly through interactions with Cr-bearing serpentinite bodies) and the pink to red corundums metamorphic in origin.

Type- 1 garnet cores with high Mn/Ca ratios are interpreted as pre-Alpine relicts, whereas Type- 1 garnet rims, Type- 2 inclusion-rich porphyroblasts and smaller Type- 3 garnets are Alpine. The latter are all characterized by low Mn/Ca ratios and a coexisting mineral assemblage of blue amphibole, high-Si phengite, epidote and quartz. Prograde growth conditions during Alpine D- 1 high-pressure (HP) metamorphism are recorded by a decrease in Mn and increase in Fe (+/-Ca) in the Type- 2 garnets, culminating in peak P-T conditions of 14 - 16 kbar and 500 degreesC in the deepest parts of the Ambin dome. The multistage growth history of Type- 1 garnets indicates a polymetamorphic history for the Ambin and South Vanoise massifs; unfortunately, no age constraints are available. The new metamorphic constraints on the Alpine event in the massifs define a metamorphic T `gap' between them and their surrounding cover (Brianconnais and upper Schistes Lustres units), which experienced metamorphism only in the stability field of carpholite-lawsonite (T < 400 degreesC). These data and supporting structural studies confirm that the Ambin and South Vanoise massifs are slices of `eclogitized' continental crust tectonically extruded within the Schistes Lustres units and Brianconnais covers. The corresponding tectonic contacts with top-to-east movement are responsible for the juxtaposition of lower-grade metamorphic units on the Ambin and South Vanoise massifs...|$|E

The kyanite/sillimanite bearing garnet biotite gneisses contain monazite ages of 938 ± 23 Ma and zirconSHRIMP ages of 945 ± 7 Ma, referring to a Neoproterozoic metamorphism, i. e. similar to the age of the Jinning orogeny in the Yangtze block of southern China. This correlation suggests that the paragneiss has affinities with the Yangtze block (South China block). The Neoproterozoic monazites were found inside coarse grained porphyroblastic garnets containing amphibolite facies <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> assemblages. The kyanite/sillimanite-bearing garnet biotite gneisses also contain early Paleozoic monazite ages of 422 – 425 Ma and 455 – 460 Ma, detected in amphibolite facies mineral assemblages associated with matrix minerals. Using phase equilibrium- and geothermobarometric calculations, PT conditions of 560 – 610 °C/ 5. 8 – 7. 0 kbar and 610 – 675 °C/ 4. 6 – 6. 5 kbar were calculated respectively for both amphibolite facies assemblages. The early Paleozoic ages of 422 – 425 Ma and 455 – 460 Ma were detected in 8 monazite grains from the investigated paragneiss samples. Based on the Y and Eu contents variation of the early Paleozoic monazite domains (measured by EMP), the 422 – 425 Ma monazite ages are interpreted to have formed during an amphibolite facies tectono-metamorphic overprint that post-dates (U) HP metamorphism and can thus be related to exhumation of previously deeply subducted rocks. Alternatively, the 455 – 460 Ma monazite ages are interpreted to represent the age of the prograde subduction zone metamorphism. We conclude therefore that the mineral assemblage of the kyanite/sillimanite-bearing garnet–biotite gneiss (and associated retro-eclogite) was formed during an early Paleozoic subduction/collision event, which involved late Proterozoic (938 – 945 Ma) crystalline basement inliers of minimal mid amphibolite facies grade.

These unusual xenoliths are {{generally considered to}} result from ascending primitive/precursor kimberlite magmas that crystallised in the magma conduit at lithospheric mantle depths. To enhance our understanding of these processes, we investigated the oxide, sulphide and carbonate minerals of a new polymict breccia (DU- 1) from the Bultfontein Dumps (Kimberley, South Africa). Xenolith DU- 1 contains heterogeneous domains of ilmenite-rich breccia surrounded by spinel harzburgite wall rock. The breccia domains also host resorbed Cr-diopside porphyroclasts and occasional Fe–Ni–Co sulphides segregations. Ilmenite occurs as large (up to 5 cm), chemically zoned lenses, associated with minor rutile. The ilmenite has Hf isotope values (initial εHf= 2. 1 – 3. 0) {{in the range of}} South African Group I kimberlites and associated megacrysts. The ilmenite lenses host primary multiphase carbonate-rich, olivine-dominated, phlogopite-dominated and sulphide mineral inclusions. Carbonate-rich inclusions host abundant magnesite and dolomite, with subordinate kalsilite, phlogopite, alkali-carbonates, phosphates and chlorides. The occurrence of carbonate-rich inclusions suggests entrapment of a Ca–Mg-rich alkali-carbonate melt during ilmenite growth. However, geochemical modelling indicates that this melt was not parental to the ilmenite. Instead, it is suggested that the ilmenite (and other cementing phases) crystalised from ilmenite and the other cementing phases crystallised from a S-bearing Ti–Fe–K-rich ultramafic silicate melt, derived from an ascending proto-kimberlite melt, which was modified subsequently by wall rock assimilation and/ or magma mixing, porphyroclast dissolution and crystal fractionation. The alkali-carbonate melt could be the residual liquid after these processes occurred. Alternatively, the ultramafic silicate and alkali-carbonate melts were produced by liquid immiscibility from a silicate-carbonate proto-kimberlite melt. The occurrence of ilmenite inclusions in sulphide segregations, and sulphide inclusions in ilmenite lenses is indicative of late-stage silicate-sulphide liquid immiscibility. The major and trace element concentrations, Hf isotope composition and <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> content of ilmenite are consistent with a genetic relationship between polymict breccia formation and the kimberlite megacryst suite.

40|$|Measurement of {{the remnant}} {{pressure}} sustained by a <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> within a diamond can allow {{calculation of the}} source pressure and temperature conditions of the diamond formation. While Raman spectroscopy (point analyses and 2 D mapping) {{has been the most}} commonly used non-destructive method for measuring this remnant pressure, two new techniques (quantitative birefringence analysis and in situ X-ray diffraction) have recently been developed. In this paper we apply all of these techniques to the study of two diamonds. The first is a diamond twin (macle) from Shandong (China), containing two olivine inclusions. Analysis of the largest inclusion by the birefringence and X-ray techniques returned compatible values for the remnant pressure of 0. 1 - 0. 2 GPa. However, while 2 D Raman mapping of the diamond host qualitatively confirmed the presence of a radial stress field, the low remnant pressures values were too small to be detected by pressure shifts in the olivine's Raman spectrum. The second sample studied was a rounded dodecahedral diamond (unknown origin) containing several coesite inclusions. Its morphology prevented quantitative birefringence analysis or Raman mapping being performed but Raman analyses on three inclusions (2. 2 - 2. 5 GPa) provided similar results to those obtained by X-ray diffraction from a single inclusion (2. 7 GPa); all of these values lie within the range of previous published remnant pressures for coesite in diamond. Calculation of the source pressure and temperature conditions for both diamond samples returned anomalously low values, both below the diamond stability field for a range of mantle temperatures (950 - 1350 degrees C). The reasons for this are due to violations of the fundamental assumptions upon which such studies of these elastic effects in diamond are based. Although previous studies showed that olivine inclusions have the potential to record reasonable formation pressures under favourable conditions, the present study re-iterates the serious concerns of using the coesite-in-diamond geobarometer. It is inferred that, as the remnant pressures in the coesite-diamond pair are so high, there is a high probability that the diamond will undergo some plastic deformation, thus reducing the elastic behaviour and leading to severe underestimation of entrapment pressure. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The petrological {{fabric of}} roofing slate determines the main {{properties}} of the slate as a construction material, such as durability and waterproofing. Roofing slates are rocks derived from the low-grade metamorphism of lutites, with a characteristic lepidoblastic fabric. However, little attention by petrologists {{has been paid to}} the role of this fabric in the behaviour of roofin slates. This work characterizes the fabric and pore system of two roofing slate varieties from Spain, using two different techniques, each with its advantages and disadvantages: X-ray microtomography, useful to find heterogeneities and <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusions</b> on the slate bulk,and mercury intrusion porosimetry, which defines the pore system. The differentiation of <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusions</b> is very useful for predicting the weathering of a slate, while the definition of the pore system may help to understand how the slate will behave during its service life...|$|R

40|$|In eastern Australia, {{diamonds}} {{occur in}} alluvial deposits overlying Phanerozoic basement. The {{origin of the}} diamonds is not known. No feeder pipes of kimberlite or lamproite are known, {{and none of the}} usual diamond indicator minerals occurs in association with the diamonds. Alluvial diamonds from Wellington, Bingara, Copeton, and Airly Mountain in New South Wales form two distinct groups, here termed A and B. Group A diamonds are similar to those found in kimberlites and lamproites globally and are thought to have formed in Precambrian lithospheric mantle. Group B diamonds have unusual characteristics that indicate they formed in a subduction environment. Surface features of diamonds of both groups indicate that all were brought to the surface by magmas. Group A diamonds are similar in primary crystal form, internal structure, <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> composition (mainly peridotitic), and carbon isotopes to diamonds found in kimberlitic and lamproitic hosts in Archean and Proterozoic cratons worldwide. Re/Os ages (3. 4 and 2. 1 Ga; Pearson et al., 1998) of sulfide inclusions in two Group A diamonds constrain the origin of these diamonds to ancient mantle sources. This, along with the nature of the surface abrasion structures and radiation damage, suggests that the Group A diamonds represent an older group of diamonds that have been in secondary collectors for a significant time. If this is so, it is feasible that the Group A diamonds may have been derived from a number of primary sources, including possible sources in Antarctica. Group B diamonds are unlike any other diamond suites worldwide in their combination of shape, surface features, strained and irregular internal structures, ¹³C-enrichment, and Ca-rich eclogitic mineral inclusions. The features are best explained as a product of diamond growth under varying P-T conditions in a high P/T dynamic environment such as a subducting slab. The diamonds may well have formed during arc-continent collision {{at the time of the}} development of the New England fold belt. This would explain why the major known concentration of Group B diamonds is within the New England fold belt at Copeton and Bingara, and is consistent with the Phanerozoic ages for diamond emplacement determined from mineral inclusions. 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This study {{comprises}} the first systematic classification of native gold geochemistry within alkalic porphyry Cu-Au {{systems and the}} placer expression of such systems. The geochemistry and mineral associations of gold from four alkalic porphyry deposits in British Columbia, Canada (Afton, Mount Milligan, Mount Polley and Copper Mountain) have been compared {{to comment on the}} likely detrital gold expression of similar systems globally. Populations of gold grains collected from in situ hypogene mineralization as well as fluvial deposits downstream of these deposits have been characterized in terms of their alloy composition (Au, Ag, Cu, Hg, and Pd) and associated mineral inclusions. These data are combined to generate a ‘microchemical signature’. Gold compositions vary according to the alteration zone within a porphyry system. Previous compositional studies of gold in porphyry systems have focused on the most economically important ore associated with potassic alteration, wherein native gold hosted either by bornite or chalcopyrite comprises tiny blebs (typically 5 - 20 μm), containing detectable Cu in the gold alloy to a maximum of around 5 % but quite variable (2 - 30 wt. %) Ag. The presence of such grains have been confirmed in hypogene ore from the four systems studied, but they {{have been shown to be}} compositionally distinct from detrital gold collected from nearby fluvial placers which exhibit a strong Pd and Hg signature, both in the alloy and as mineral inclusions. Several workers have described late stage veins associated with alkalic porphyries which contain distinctive Pd-Hg bearing minerals in association with other sulphides and sulphosalts. This unusual mineralogy has been observed in the <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> suites of populations of detrital gold grains collected in the environs of the porphyry systems. We conclude that whilst the micron-scale Cu-rich gold grains formed in potassically altered rocks are in general too small to be recovered during routine sediment sampling, those formed in later stage hydrothermal systems are larger, and exhibit a distinctive microchemical signature which may be differentiated from those of gold formed in other mineralizing systems. Consequently, compositional studies of detrital gold could underpin a mineral indicator methodology in the exploration for alkalic porphyry Cu-Au deposits...|$|E
40|$|Microinclusions {{carrying}} high-density fluids (HDFs) with silicic, carbonatitic and saline compositions {{are common}} in fibrous diamonds and represent the medium in which their host diamond grew. Such inclusions have not been documented previously in monocrystaline octahedral diamonds or in the octahedral cores of coated diamonds, allowing a debate on whether such fluids {{are responsible for the}} formation of octahedral diamonds as well. The other notable difference is that all nitrogen in microinclusion-bearing zones resides in A-centers, whereas most octahedral diamonds carry both A and B centers. We report the first finding of HDF microinclusion in an octahedral diamond from Finsch, South Africa and in the core of a coted diamond from Kankan, Guinea. The microinclusions in the Finsch diamond are restricted to two thin layers (approximately 10 mu m), parallel to the (111) face, approximately 20 and 200 mu m from the rim. Cathodoluminescence (CL) reveals concentric zoning and octahedral growth throughout the diamond. The inclusion-rich layers are easily recognized by their weak fluresence. The diamonds carry approximately 800 - 1200 ppm nitrogen. Absorbance of B centers is observed in the inner part (A/B= 5) and between the inclusion rich layers and the rim (A/B= 16). Forty-five inclusions of carbonatitic HDF were analyzed along the inner layer. Their major and trace element compositions and FTIR analyses are highly similar to the ones observed in HDFs from fibrous diamonds. In the octahedral core of the Kankan diamond we found six microinclusions with saline composition. Unlike the case of the Finsch diamond, these inclusions are sporadically scattered, up to approximately 100 mu m away from a sulfide <b>mineral</b> <b>inclusion</b> and were hard to find. Supporting evidence for the involvement of HDF, similar to the ones capsulate in fibrous diamonds, in the formation of monocrystaline diamonds comes from LA-ICP-MS analyses of trace element patterns in monocrystalline diamonds (McNeill et al. 2009) and the sinosuidal REE patterns of garnet inclusions in diamonds (Stachel and Harris, 2008; Weiss et al. 2009). Based on the above observation we have good reasons to believe that microinclusions and HDFs may be found in other octahedral diamonds, extending the role of HDFs to the formation of most natural diamonds. 1 page(s...|$|E
