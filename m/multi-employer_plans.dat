40|$|This article explores union {{attempts}} to control pension fund investment for the debate on financial restructuring in the United States. It puts popular control of finance into comparative and historical perspective and argues that laws and politics help explain why the flow of finance is corporate controlled. First, changes in the legal regime—the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 —put constraints on labor’s ability to influence investment decisions. This is evident when comparing single- and <b>multi-employer</b> <b>plans,</b> where the laws had different consequences. Second, {{attempts to}} reform these laws failed. Had they been successful, Carter’s proposed economic revitalization plan {{in the run-up to}} his failed reelection in 1980 would have created new ways for unions to control and redirect retirement investment for social purposes. The reform failure is treated as a “suppressed historical alternative” through a comparison with a successful reform in Quebec, Canada, which gave unions broad controls over the Solidarity Fund in 1983. The findings suggest, somewhat counter-intuitively, that legal restrictions need to be loosened for democratic control of finance to be possible. For pension funds, more regulations led to more corporate control, not less...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{governance}} of pension funds {{is an important}} topic of academic research and public policy and has significant implications {{for the welfare of}} participants. Here we focus upon the design and governance of defined contribution (DC) pension plans which have become the de facto model of occupational pensions in most countries. The study synthesises the findings of a year-long research project based upon in-depth interviews with the sponsors and managers of leading schemes from around the world. We begin with the dual nature of the governance problem characteristic of DC pension plans, emphasising aspects related to the self-governance of individuals in relation to their long-term interests as well as the ambivalence and conflicts of interest in plan sponsors. With those problems in mind, we focus on the design of DC pension plans and then their governance so as to challenge existing institutions in particular jurisdictions. Our findings have implications for employer-sponsored plans, <b>multi-employer</b> <b>plans,</b> and the public utilities that have been established or proposed that may transcend company-based and industry-based pension institutions. Whereas DC plans were once believed to be simple solutions to burdensome defined benefit liabilities, it is shown that there is nothing simple about a well-designed DC pension plan. In essence, the complexities associated with DB liabilities have been exchanged for complexities in the design and management of DC institutions...|$|E

Moreover, the union's ability and incentive to use pension assets to promote union goals will vary with {{the design of the}} pension. Using panel data on over 36, 000 pension plans drawn from IRS Form 5500 filings, we empirically estimate the effects of unions on risk adjusted returns and find that the union effect on performance varies in ways that are consistent with our priors. In particular, unions have the largest negative effect among <b>multi-employer</b> defined contribution <b>plans</b> and the negative effect of unions can be eliminated by a switch to participant direction. Also, we find that unions improve performance for single employer defined contribution plans. unions, rate of return, pension, defined benefit, defined contribution...|$|R
40|$|The current {{framework}} in Canada in which collectively-bargained, private-sector <b>Multi-Employer</b> Pension <b>Plans</b> (“MEPPs”) operate {{is difficult for}} a number of reasons including: • The Administrator (i. e., the Trustees) has no control over the contribution flow • Industries and employers within industries are subject to economic and business cycles and employers may enter or exit the MEPP relatively easily, leaving the MEPP with long-term obligations • There is pressure to set benefits at levels that anticipate future investment returns and if such returns do not materialize as anticipated there can be severe financial implications for the plan • There are inherent conflicts of interests among classes of members such as active members who continue to be voting union members and retirees and terminated members who are no longer represented by the union The tools available for plan management include: • Governance structure • Plan design • Investment policy • Annuity purchases • Benefit reductions This paper builds on a previous paper entitled “Extending ERM To Multi-Employer Pension Plans” which was presented at the Society of Actuaries 2006 ERM Symposium. In addition to the ideas presented in that work, it discusses the question of whether MEPPs should be subject to solvency funding rules and the viability of a pension benefit protection fund offered by the private sector.

40|$|Today, {{both the}} United States and Canada are {{experiencing}} {{a decline in}} Single-Employer Sponsored Defined Benefit (DB) Pension plans. In some instances, they are being replaced by Defined Contribution (DC) or Individual Account [e. g., 401 (k) ] plans; in other cases, by nothing. It appears that traditional sponsors of DB plans have concluded that their cost (or its variability) {{is larger than the}} rewards (e. g., a loyal work force). At the same time, two stock market meltdowns in less than a decade have indicated to all the frailties of Individual Account DC systems. What we need is a new pension system that brings most of the advantages of the DB and DC plans to the participants, while minimizing their disadvantages. We must also recognize the skill set of the participants (e. g., do not expect a blue collar worker to be an investment professional) and not anticipate or require anomalous markets (e. g., ever-stronger equity returns). Size matters. Larger plans can run at lower per unit expense ratios, and can also achieve entry into a wide variety of investment products (e. g., private placements) not available to a small plan. Larger funds also benefit from risk sharing through “Law of Large Numbers”. The model proposed is a “Jointly Governed Target Benefit Pension plan”. Such plans would have many features in common with today’s Ontario <b>Multi-Employer</b> Pension <b>Plans</b> (MEPPs), the Canada/Quebec Pension Plans (C/QPP), TIAA-CREF in the United States and the Dutch national plan. For the plan sponsor, this is a DC plan. Inherent in the concept are that smaller plans (and even individual plans) could commingle their assets to achieve “size” (e. g. a minimum investment portfolio of $ 10 B). Investment management would be at arm’s length from the plan itself. Target Benefit, Joint Governance, Commingled Assets...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the Canadian pension {{regulatory}} environment and specifically Ontario. It proposes that unrelated employers be permitted to amalgamate their pension plans into a single plan using a multiple-employer structure, provided {{that all of the}} members of the single plan are represented by a union and the union has consented to the arrangement. It provides recommendations on how plans adopting this multiple-employer structure should operate in order to ensure that risks are appropriately allocated among stakeholders and that that there is strong governance. The pension formula would be defined benefit. The basic structure of the plan would be that the participating employers are required to contribute at a negotiated cents-per-hour rate based on the hours worked by covered employees. This would be the only financial obligation of the participating employers. The legal Administrator of the plan would be a joint board of trustees. There are a number of problems with the way in which Canadian <b>multi-employer</b> pension <b>plans</b> that are jointly trusteed and that are of the defined contribution – defined benefit type operate, especially with respect to governance. This paper makes a number of recommendations to improve plan governance, including only selecting independent experts to act as trustees and the compensation of trustees. In order to ensure the security of member benefits, the benefit formula would specify an ultimate benefit. With respect to the ultimate benefit, very conservative investment strategies would be employed and the benefit would be funded on a risk-free basis. Excess benefits would be provided to the extent that plan performance permitted. These excess benefits could be adjusted upward or downward depending on plan performance. This pension design would not be permitted in the current Ontario and Canadian regulatory environment. This report identifies a number of legislative and regulatory changes that would be required. The recommended plan is assessed using the measurement framework developed as part of the Retirement 20 / 20 project. The recommended approach scores very highly with respect to how risks are allocated. It also scores highly on governance. <br/...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{possibility}} of having a [...] "retirement" [...] became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly {{should not have to}} work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintain an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public social security created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s. Unions usually bargained to have employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. <b>Multi-employer</b> retirement <b>plans,</b> set up by collective agreement became known as [...] "Taft-Hartley plans" [...] after the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 required joint management of funds by employees and employers. Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called TIAA, was established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918 with express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. These could be collective and defined benefit schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual [...] "401(k)" [...] plans. These are named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same tax deferral rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a [...] "defined benefit" [...] plan, a 401(k) only contains whatever the employer and employee contribute. It will run out if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have to rely only on minimum social security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 §902 codified a model for employers to automatically enroll their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out. There is no right to an occupational pension, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other [...] "employee benefit" [...] plan.|$|R
40|$|How Readable Are Summary Plan Descriptions For Health Care Plans? • SPDs are {{the primary}} source of health plan information: The summary plan {{description}} (SPD) is {{the primary source of}} information for workers who participate in an employment-based health care plan. This study investigates whether private-sector employers’ SPDs are written so that an average plan participant can identify and read important information contained in the document, as required by federal law. The study collected and tested SPDs for 40 health care plans from a diverse national sample and subjected them to content and readability analyses. • Important information contained in many SPDs is written at a reading level that may be too high for the average plan participant: The study found that the average readability level for important information concerning eligibility, benefits, and participant rights and responsibilities in summary plan descriptions is written at a first year college reading level. The average level of readability for SPDs is higher than the recommended reading level for technical material. Some of the SPDs in the study sample use language written at a 9 th grade reading level. Other SPDs use language written at nearly a college graduate (16 th grade) reading level. • Readability levels do not differ between single-employer health care <b>plans</b> and <b>multi-employer</b> health care plans: The study found no statistically significant differences in readability levels between SPDs for health care plans sponsored by single- and <b>multi-employer</b> health care <b>plans</b> for union workers. The language used for both types of plans tested out at a college reading level. • Fundamental literacy a barrier to health care literacy: According to the U. S. Department of Education, about 43 percent of American adults scored at below basic or basic levels of prose literacy (able to read and understand sentences and paragraphs), and 34 percent scored at below basic or basic levels of document literacy (able to read sentence fragments, such as a medical prescription). Given the rapidly rising share of the immigrant, non-English-speaking U. S. population, a major barrier to health care literacy is the underlying issue of fundamental literacy. • Implications: Findings from this study suggest that fundamental improvements are needed in the readability of written SPDs, and that employers and plan administrators should explore the use of alternative methods of communication to plan participants beyond the written SPD. Also, the trend toward consumer-driven health care plans may make the challenge of communicating information to participants through written SPDs even more difficult, since these plans shift significant responsibility to the participants in the plan for decisions concerning the utilization of health care services. This shift in decision-making responsibility to participants makes it more important than ever that participants understand how their health plan works...|$|R
