5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for <b>marine</b> <b>fishes,</b> whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among <b>marine</b> <b>fishes,</b> where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of <b>marine</b> <b>fishes.</b> There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
40|$|The study {{based on}} time series <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> {{production}} data {{during the period}} of 1983 - 1984 to 2007 - 2008 in Bangladesh. For this growth analysis six deterministic time series models are considered.

The study attempts to provide forecasts of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production in Bangladesh for the year of 2008 - 09 to 2012 - 13. The magnitude of instability in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production was attempted by computing the coefficient of variation (CV) and the percentage deviation from three years moving average values.

For the three components of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production the growth rates were different over different time points. The variation of the growth rates in industrial <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production was - 21. 6 % to 13. 12 %, in artisanal <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production was 2. 39 % to 5. 29 % and in total <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> production was 11. 23 % to 24. 85 % during the study period...|$|R

40|$|It is {{valuable}} {{to study the}} bioavailability of trace metal in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> for their ecological and commercial importance. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the trace metal (Cd, Zn, and Se) biokinetics in two <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> Acanthopagrus schlegeli and Terapon jarbua. Waterborne and dietary metal uptake was examined under different conditions to investigate the effects of chemical and physiological factors on the bioavailability of metals to <b>marine</b> <b>fish.</b> The metal bioaccumulation in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> was predicted by applying the bioenergetic-based kinetic model. The different pattern of metal uptake by <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> from freshwater fish was expressly concerned. <b>Marine</b> <b>fish</b> were found to take up waterborne metal through the gills and the gastrointestinal tracts and the latter one played predominant role. The uptake conformed to the first-order model {{over a wide range}} of ambient metal concentrations. The intestine had higher metal binding affinity and capacity than the gills. The surface-binding metal after short-term waterborne exposure was abundant. The waterborne uptake of trace metals in <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> could be affected by many factors, including Cd and Zn pre-exposure, body size, water composition, and salinity. Ambient salinity influenced waterborne metal uptake, by changing both geochemical and physiological aspects, resulting in the major difference of metal uptake between <b>marine</b> and freshwater <b>fish.</b> The assimilation efficiency of dietary metals was observed to be influenced by the subcellular metal distribution in the preys and the feeding process of the fish. Body size influenced both the assimilation efficiency and ingestion rate significantly. The metal bioaccumulation was a gross result of waterborne and dietary metal uptake and metal efflux in <b>marine</b> <b>fish,</b> which was successfully predicted by the bioenergetic-based kinetic model. Dietary metal dominated the overall metal accumulation; efflux was the key process to the metal homeostasis in <b>marine</b> <b>fish.</b> Body size is also an important factor in metal bioaccumulation, and subsequently, metal trophic transfer in <b>marine</b> <b>fish.</b> The tissue specific and subcellular metal distributions revealed the strategies of <b>marine</b> <b>fish</b> handling trace metals...|$|R

50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>fish</b> {{that are}} sold as {{tropical}} fish are generally sourced from the wild, usually from the coral reefs around the world.

25|$|Rohde and {{collaborators}} {{have shown}} that the number of ectoparasitic species on the gills of different species of <b>marine</b> <b>fishes</b> varies from 0 to about 30, even when fish of similar size and from similar habitats are compared. Assuming that the host species with the largest number of parasite species has the largest possible number of parasite species, only about 16% of all niches are occupied. However, the maximum may well be greater, since the possibility cannot be excluded that even on fish with a rich parasite fauna, more species could be accommodated (recent review in Rohde 2005b). Using similar reasoning, Walker and Valentine (1984) estimated that 12-54% of niches for marine invertebrates are empty.|$|E
25|$|Carangoides is a genus of {{tropical}} to subtropical <b>marine</b> <b>fishes</b> in the jack family, Carangidae.
