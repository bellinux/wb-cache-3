40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is becoming ever more critical due to fading water resources, increasing wastewater disposal expenses and firmer discharge regulations that have lowered permissible contaminant levels in waste streams. The {{ultimate goal of}} wastewater management is {{the protection of the}} environment in a manner commensurate with public health and socio-economic concerns. This project is devoted for the characterization of general parameters of domestic waste water collected from the campus of NIT Rourkela, and study and design of an anaerobic treatment plant, the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor (UASB). The UASB model showed promising results in removal of BOD, heavy metals, pH, turbidity and decrease in <b>microbe</b> <b>content.</b> A laboratory scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor study was done with waste water generated from hostels in NIT Rourkela as substrate. The reactor was fed with waste water in the presence of sludge generated from the same waste water. The substrate was recirculated within the reactor to ensure a continuous steady upflow. Samples were collected from the reactor every week and were analyzed for concentration of various parameters and were plotted against time. Treated waste water found from UASB model reduces turbidity of water decreases from 57. 1 to 37. 6 NTU, pH of treated water increases s from 7. 9 to 8. 9,BOD of treated sample decreases with time from 6. 6 to 1. 5 mg/L, concentration of metals decreases with time as Potassium concentration decreases from 2. 066 to 1. 351 mg/L, Calcium concentration decreases from 2. 391 to 1. 075 mg/L, Zinc concentration decreases from 0. 251 to 0. 162 mg/L, Iron concentration decreases from 0. 517 to 0. 239 mg/L, Copper concentration decreases from 0. 107 to 0. 056 mg/L, Lead concentration decreases from 0. 033 to 0. 202 mg/L, Arsenic concentration decreases from 0. 09 to 0. 048 mg/L, magnesium concentration decreases from 6. 439 to 6. 145 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate an ecological and economic recovery process, which was developed and implemented at Stora Enso Oyj Fine Paper Oulu mill during the period 2000 to 2002. The ECO plant recovers the material called ECO pigment from the effluent treatment sludge and it can be used as a filler in multicoated fine paper production for art printing purposes. The ECO plant process consists of the following process stages. First, there is a separating phase for the recoverable material from fibres and other rejects, which is done with a wire washer. Then the fractionating of the recoverable material is performed with two-stage centrifugal cleaners. Chemical treatment with peracetic acid is used as a preservative and to increase the brightness of the ECO pigment a little. Then the recoverable material is stored in the pigment storage area and dosed to the paper machines as a filler. The rejects from the ECO plant are thickened in belt filter presses and then transferred to the bark storage area, where they are mixed with bark and combusted in a solid fuel boiler. The majority of the particles of the recovered ECO pigment were less than 45 μm; this size of particle accounted for 96. 4 % (on average) according to the studies made between June and December 2002. The use of ECO pigment is not found to cause more web defect problems on the base paper than before, according to the studies of the number of total web defects with the achieved particle size distribution and because the <b>microbe</b> <b>content</b> has been controlled. There are three sources from which the ash content of the base paper is composed after the start-up of the ECO plant, i. e. the broke, the virgin filler and ECO pigment. Therefore the use of ECO pigment partly decreases the need to use virgin filler. The ECO pigment was tested in the coating colour in pilot tests, and based on these results it could be used in the coating colour. The dry solid content of the ECO pigment has to be increased from the present level for the coating application...|$|E

Sensory evaluation was also carried out to compare physical properties of the beer with industrially manufactured lager beer. Erwinia, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Streptococcus, Acetobacter Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter and Aerococcus species were isolated during the production. Pasteurised beer did not contain any <b>microbe.</b> Ethanol <b>content</b> and total acidity increased while pH, specific gravity, apparent extract and total carbohydrate contents decreased during the fermentation of the sorghum wort with final values of 3. 62 %, 0. 16 %, 4. 2, 1. 01600, 2. 70 and 38. 0 mg/l respectively. At 5 % level of significance, the finished lager beer was generally acceptable to the panellists. It scored unsatisfactory in colour and consistency but similar in taste and odour to the industrially manufactured lager beers. Thus, the use of sorghum for the production of lager beer without adjunct could be practised. Key words: Bacteria, biochemical and sensory properties; beer production...|$|R
40|$|Stoichiometric {{relationships}} between consumers and resources in detritus-based ecosystems have received little attention, despite {{the importance of}} detritus in most food webs. We analysed carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) content of invertebrate consumers, and basal food resources in two forested headwater streams (one reference and the other nutrient-enriched). We found large elemental imbalances between consumers and food resources compared with living plant-based systems, particularly in regard to P content, which were reduced with enrichment. Enrichment significantly increased nutrient content of food resources (consistent with uptake of N and P by detritus-associated <b>microbes).</b> P <b>content</b> of some invertebrates also increased in the enriched vs. reference stream, suggesting deviation from strict homeostasis. Nutrient content varied significantly among invertebrate functional feeding groups, orders and, to some extent, size classes. Future application of stoichiometric theory to detritus-based systems should consider the potential for relatively large consumer-resource elemental imbalances and P storage by insect consumers...|$|R

R. albus did not incorporate 14 C into tryptophan during growth in medium containing either labeled serine or labeled shikimic acid. The mechanism of tryptophan biosynthesis from IAA is not known but appears to be different from any described biosynthetic pathway.

40|$|Background: Human milk is {{considered}} the best source of nutrition for all newborns as it contains important growth, developmental and immunological factors. The WHO (2003) recommends exclusive breastfeeding {{for the first six}} months of age, with complementary breastfeeding up to two years and beyond. However, some women experience complications of the breast that lead to early cessation of breastfeeding, which can adversely affect the well being of the developing infant and her own health. Nipple pain is the most commonly cited reason for weaning in the first week postpartum. Nipple pain is also linked to mastitis from milk stasis and possible bacterial infection, although the influence of bacteria is still largely unknown. However, it is known that the presence of bacteria and fungi along with their metabolites contribute to the composition of the milk as the baby receives it. Metabolomics is increasingly being utilised in the dairy industry to determine spoilage as a result of teat trauma and mastitis. Given the current diagnostic application of metabolomics in clinical medicine uses blood and urine samples, it has been proposed as a potential tool for detecting biomarkers and determining compositional changes in human milk. Measuring the composition of milk from human mothers experiencing persistent nipple pain, with or without evidence of trauma, and identifying the influence of this condition on endogenous and exogenous metabolites may determine the relationship between milk composition and nipple pain. Aims: The aims of this study were to source the appropriate human and bovine milk samples; to identify and quantify bacterial and fungal species using traditional culture and microscopy techniques; to measure the effect of nipple pain on the paracellular pathway of the breast by measuring the sodium and potassium concentration and ratio in the milk; to optimise GC-MS methodology for the measurement of milk metabolites; and to use untargeted metabolomics to identify compositional differences in the metabolite profile in human milk from mothers presenting with nipple pain compared to healthy control mothers. Results: Two groups were recruited; a control group of mothers not experiencing nipple pain (n= 22 samples) and a group of mothers experiencing persistent nipple pain during breastfeeding (n= 11 samples); mothers with unilateral nipple pain supplied a milk sample from their affected and non-affected breast (n= 4). The nipple pain group (n= 11) was divided into two subgroups; persistent nipple pain without evidence of trauma (PG) (n= 6) and persistent nipple pain with evidence of trauma (TG) (n= 5). Additionally 9 bovine samples were collected, 3 from healthy cows (control), 4 from cows presenting with mastitis and 2 from a single storage vat, to be used as positive controls throughout the study. All 42 samples were tested for the presence of microbial and fungal species, sodium and potassium concentrations and ratio were determined and untargeted metabolomics analysis of the milk metabolome was performed. Overall there was no significant difference in <b>microbe</b> <b>content</b> between the human control and nipple pain group (1, 623 CFU/ml vs. 1, 503 CFU/ml); the TG subgroup had the highest colony count of 2, 778 CFU/ml. The bovine mastitis group had a higher colony count than the bovine control group, 2, 173 CFU/ml vs. 473 CFU/ml. Coagulase negative staphylococcus ssp. were the most frequently isolated microorganisms and was found in 91 % of human milk samples and 100 % of bovine milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus were identified in one human milk sample from a mother in the PG subgroup and in one bovine sample from a cow suffering from untreated mastitis as well as both pooled bovine vat samples. Streptococcus ssp. And yeast were only found in bovine samples. The TG subgroup had the highest Na+ concentration of the human milk samples (8. 04 ± 2. 40 mM), significantly highly than the control group (4. 32 ± 1. 18 mM; p Untargeted metabolomic analysis found compositional differences between the human control and nipple pain groups, in particular samples from the TG subgroup. Compositional variations between milk from the control and nipple pain subgroups was identified using principal component analysis and PC 4 best represented the differences in metabolite composition between the groups. This result is consistent with the subtlety of the nipple pain condition. A list of the most influential metabolites based on their correlation loadings (explained within 50 - 100 % of the model) was determined. The most influential metabolites with respect to the TG milk samples were included isoleucine, proline, galactose and some as yet unidentified metabolites. Conclusion: As nipple pain is often a precursor to mastitis the results from this study will form a basis for further development using metabolomics as a tool for more efficient detection and treatment of breast infection and inflammation within the nipple and breast...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMeasurement of soil {{components}} such as microbial population, {{minerals and}} obviously {{the content of}} organic carbon play the important roles for the productivity of crops and plants. The present study was attempted to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on soil for its physical (electrical conductivity), chemical (minerals) and microbial flora (bacteria and fungi). A plot of lands was assigned for this study with some already grown plants. This plot was divided into two parts. One part was considered as control, while another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment without physically touching and referred as treated. In the treated soil the total bacterial and fungal counts were increased by 546 and 617 %, respectively {{as compared to the}} untreated soil. Additionally, the conductivity of soil of the treated plot was increased by 79 % as compared to the soil of control plot. Apart from <b>microbes,</b> the <b>content</b> of various minerals were also changed in the biofield energy treated soil. The calcium carbonate content showed 2909 ppm in the control, while in the treated soil it was increased to 3943 ppm i. e.   36 % increased. Various other minerals such as nitrogen and potassium were increased by 12 % and 7 %, respectively as compared to the control. Besides, the level of some minerals such as potassium, iron, and chloride were decreased by 9 %, 23 %, and 41 %, respectively as compared to the control. Apart from chemical constituents of soil, the content of organic carbon was also reduced by 8 % in the treated soil as compared to the control soil. The overall results envisaged that the biofield energy treatment on the soil showed a significant improvement in the physical, chemical, and microbial functions of soil component. Thus, improved the conductance, supportive microbes, minerals and overall productivity of crops. In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used as an alternative way to increase the yield of quality crops by increasing soil fertility...|$|R
50|$|Microbes in the reticulorumen include bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea, and viruses. Bacteria, {{along with}} protozoa, are the {{predominant}} microbes and by mass account for 40-60% of total microbial {{matter in the}} rumen. They are categorized into several functional groups, such as fibrolytic, amylolytic, and proteolytic types, which preferentially digest structural carbohydrates, non-structural carbohydrates, and protein, respectively. Protozoa (40-60% of microbial mass) derive their nutrients through phagocytosis of other microbes, and degrade and digest feed carbohydrates, especially starch and sugars, and protein. Although protozoa are not essential for rumen functioning, their presence has pronounced effects. Ruminal fungi make up only 5-10% of microbes and are absent on diets poor in fibre. Despite their low numbers, the fungi still occupy an important niche in the rumen because they hydrolyse some ester linkages between lignin and hemicellulose or cellulose, and help break down digesta particles. Rumen Archaea, approximately 3% of total microbes, are mostly autotrophic methanogens and produce methane through anaerobic respiration. Most of the hydrogen produced by bacteria, protozoa and fungi is used by these methanogens to reduce carbon dioxide to methane. The maintenance of low partial pressure of hydrogen by methanogens is essential for proper functioning of the rumen. Viruses are present in unknown numbers and do not contribute to any fermentation or respiration activity. However, they do lyse <b>microbes,</b> releasing their <b>contents</b> for other <b>microbes</b> to assimilate and ferment in a process called microbial recycling, although recycling through the predatory activities of protozoa is quantitatively more important.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to characterize the nutritional effects of α-cyclodextrin (ACD) using in vitro, canine, and hamster models. Study 1 evaluated the composition of ACD, validated select fat analysis techniques as related to ACD-fat complexes, and evaluated the gastrointestinal tolerance, total tract nutrient digestibility, and blood lipid profiles of dogs as affected by ACD supplementation. Hydrolysis of ACD showed that it is effectively composed only of glucose. The acid hydrolyzed fat (AHF) method proved to be valid for measuring fat bound to ACD. Intake of ACD was shown to be generally well tolerated by dogs and did not alter body weight (BW), body condition scores (BCS), or fecal scores. Intake of 6 or 12 g ACD daily decreased apparent nutrient digestibility and numerically reduced serum cholesterol concentrations in hypercholesterolemic dogs, but failed to reduce serum cholesterol concentrations in normocholesterolemic dogs. Study 2 evaluated in vitro fermentation characteristics of α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins, and in vivo total tract and ileal nutrient digestibilities, fecal microbiota concentrations, and blood lipid profiles of dogs as affected by ACD supplementation. Maximal in vitro production of total SCFA was lowest for ACD. However, the greatest maximal production of propionate also was noted for ACD. Average daily food intake, BW gain, BCS, and ileal nutrient digestibility were not significantly different among treatments. Total tract nutrient digestibility and fecal dry matter (DM) concentration decreased linearly for treatment groups receiving ACD. Fecal output expressed on an as-is basis, on a DM basis, and on an as-is per g DM intake basis increased linearly (P< 0. 05) with increasing ACD supplementation. Bifidobacteria, Clostridium perfringens, and E. coli concentrations were not different among treatments. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were within normal ranges for dogs and were not different among treatments. Study 3 evaluated apparent nutrient digestibility, cecal SCFA concentrations, cecal microbiota concentrations, blood lipid profiles, bile acid excretion, and liver gene expression of hamsters as affected by ACD and cholesterol intakes. Fecal bile acid excretion was increased by cholesterol intake, but not by ACD intake. Cecum and cecal content weight were increased by ACD intake, whereas cholesterol intake tended to decrease (P= 0. 08) cecal content weigh expressed on a DM basis. Intake of ACD alone resulted in higher propionate concentrations in cecal contents. Total CFU of lactobacilli and total <b>microbes</b> in cecal <b>contents</b> were greater for hamsters fed ACD than for those not fed ACD. Intake of diets containing ACD tended to increase (P= 0. 10) expression of 7 α-dehydroxylase (CYP 7 A 1), whereas intake of diets containing cholesterol resulted in a reduction in expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase. α-Cyclodextrin intake resulted in reduced cholesterol concentrations in serum of normocholesterolemic hamsters, but failed to reduce cholesterol concentrations in dietary-induced hypercholesterolemic hamsters. In summary, ACD intake varied in its ability to affect cholesterol metabolism, nutrient digestibility, fecal characteristics, and hindgut microbiota and fermentation patterns. This variation in response is due to differences in the model used to evaluate it, inclusion level in diet, and matrix where it is supplied. The hypocholesterolemic effect of ACD appears to be a combination of factors including up-regulation of cholesterol degradation through CYP 7 A 1, changes in hindgut fermentation profiles, and, perhaps, changes in hindgut microbiota. However, further research is necessary to define the mechanisms for such up-regulation and microbiota effects on bile acid degradation and excretion...|$|R
40|$|Livestock are {{reared in}} all agroecological zones of Ethiopia under various {{production}} systems. Goats, although {{found in all}} agroecological zones, are popular in the drier environments since they adapt well in harsh condition better than sheep and cattle. Natural vegetation comprised of both woody and herbaceous species provides the feed base year round in such environments. Due to seasonal variations, a marked fluctuation in feed resource exists in quantitative and qualitative terms. The herbaceous particularly the grasses, are faster in deteriorating {{while most of the}} woody (browse) species maintain greenness and are able to provide higher level of crude protein and minerals to animals. In areas where crops and livestock are integrated, crop residues provide substantial amount of feed to animals. However, cereal straws are inherently low in crude protein and high in fibre which results in low intake and digestibility. Thus such feeds cannot even meet maintenance requirement of animals and should be supplemented to enhance their nutritive value. Supplementation with browse foliage and fruits could be a viable alternative in smallholder livestock-crop mixed production systems. The study was comprised of four individual works. In experiment I, nutritional quality of some important browse and grass species collected from Borana rangeland during the hot dry and main rainy seasons were evaluated in terms of chemical composition, in vitro digestibility and in sacco degradability potentials. In experiment II, the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on feed intake, digestibility, ammonia nitrogen concentration, nitrogen balance and body weight gain of Borana goats was evaluated. Goats were fed a basal diet of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay supplemented with either Acacia brevispica or Acacia seyal leaves with or without PEG addition. The concentrate replacement value of Balanites aegyptiaca leaves was evaluated in experiment III. The concentrate was replaced at 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent by Balanites aegyptiaca and feed intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, excretion of purine derivatives and microbial nitrogen supply and average daily body weight gain were evaluated using Arsi-Bale goats fed barley straw as a basal diet. The fourth component of the study was a survey conducted in the southern rangelands to assess the perception of pastoralists towards dry season feed shortage and associated livestock poisoning in the rangeland. The browse foliage had higher crude protein content (> 10 %) during both seasons with higher values in the main rainy season (except for A. seyal). On the other hand, crude protein content of grass species was only slightly above the critical limit required to maintain proper functioning of rumen <b>microbes.</b> The fibre <b>content</b> was lower in the browses and higher in the grasses. The concentration of condensed tannins was variable among the browses ranging between negligible levels to over 30 %. The in vitro and in sacco digestibility values were generally higher for browses, which shows their potential to be used as supplements to poor quality fibrous feeds. Experiment II showed that addition of PEG did not result in significant differences in feed intake, digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and neutral detergent fibre as well as in nitrogen excretion and retention, and average daily weight gain. However, goats receiving PEG had higher crude protein digestibility, ammonia nitrogen concentration, and urinary nitrogen excretion. Goats without PEG addition had higher faecal nitrogen loss. When the type of Acacia was considered, A. seyal supplemented goats had higher feed intake while crude protein digestibility and ammonia nitrogen concentration were higher for A. brevispica supplemented goats. Higher average daily body gain was recorded for A. seyal supplemented goats. Experiment III showed that B. aegyptiaca had a potential to be used as supplement to cereal straw based diets. This was evident from the performance of the animals even when the concentrate was replaced completely by B. aegyptiaca. All animals had positive average daily body weight gain although it was lowest in animals supplemented with sole leaves of B. aegyptiaca. The survey revealed that the pastoralists in the southern rangelands are knowledgeable in allocation of resources, animal husbandry and ethnoveterinary practices. It also showed the concern of pastoralists about the changes in vegetation that favors woody and some unpalatable herbaceous species. Twenty two plants were identified by pastoralists as causes of livestock poisoning when ingested which usually occurs when animals are hungry and thirsty...|$|R
