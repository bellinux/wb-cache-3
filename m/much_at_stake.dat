5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, Curie again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave Curie a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, Curie was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park High School that went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with Curie. According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and Curie was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most highly touted IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good with so <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated Curie 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of years after his 1994 release from prison, Chávez {{maintained}} a position against participation in elections, believing them a fixed game which merely legitimated the established order. This led to a split with his colleague Francisco Arias Cárdenas, who left the MBR-200. In the early years after his release, Chávez considered the possibility of another coup attempt, but with the prospects appearing slim, some advisers, notably Luis Miquilena, urged him to reconsider his scepticism of the elections, arguing that Chávez could potentially win so convincingly that the establishment {{would not be able to}} deny him victory. To find out whether this was the case, Chávez set up teams of psychologists, sociologists, university professors and students to carry out a survey. With their support, grassroots members of the Bolivarian movement polled tens of thousands of people across the country. The results showed that 70% of respondents supported Chávez running for the presidency - and 57% said they would vote for him. Support for the electoral route was strengthened when Arias Cárdenas, as a candidate for Radical Cause, won the Governorship of Zulia State in the December 1995 regional elections. Despite this, the MBR-200 remained divided over electoral participation, and spent a year debating the issue in local, regional and national assemblies. A national congress on 19 April 1997 took from 9 am until 2 am the next day to reach a conclusion, ultimately deciding to launch Chávez' candidacy. Some members of the movement resigned in protest, holding too <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> In July 1997 Chávez registered the new Fifth Republic Movement with the National Electoral Council (the name had to be changed as Venezuelan law did not permit parties to use Simón Bolívar's name). The international media took little interest, citing opinion polls showing 8% support for Chávez.|$|E

2500|$|The UN's {{foremost}} peacekeeping official, Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Alan Le Roy, {{claimed that}} a [...] "humanitarian tragedy" [...] was unfolding in the Congo. Despite the organization's largest peacekeeping force being situated there, {{he claimed that}} [...] "compared to {{the enormity of the}} tasks it is assigned and the vast expanse of the DRC – roughly the size of the United States east of the Mississippi and virtually without infrastructure – this number is actually rather small. Civilians have suffered from intense and often chaotic fighting, driven from their homes, caught in the crossfire and subjected to direct attacks and reprisals by armed groups and undisciplined elements of the national army. MONUC forces cannot serve as a substitute for the Congolese army to fight a war or impose peace; [...] are not an expeditionary or counterinsurgency force. With so <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> the international community simply cannot afford to let the Congo slide into the abyss, the time to act is, and indeed must be, now." [...] Le Roy reaffirmed that more action should be taken until agreements could be reached by the opposing sides. At a conference on December 9 EU ministers remained divided on the issue of sending a [...] "bridging force", citing the stabilizing situation.|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} and tell you that that’s what needs to happen. Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E

2500|$|... – President George Bush {{strongly}} {{condemned the}} assassination, urging her killers {{to be brought}} to justice. Bush condemned the assassination as a [...] "cowardly act by murderous extremists," [...] and encouraged Pakistan to [...] "honor Benazir Bhutto's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life." [...] Bush also offered some strong praise of Bhutto, noting that [...] "she knew that her return to Pakistan earlier this year put her life at risk. Yet she refused to let assassins to dictate the course of her country." [...] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said, [...] "The brutal assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is a tragic setback for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. Her courageous return to Pakistan this year gave hope to all those concerned by efforts to extinguish rule of law there." [...] Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, [...] "It is important, when faced with the violence and loss of innocent life over the last few days, that political leaders show a commitment to resolve but also restraint. Extremists must be brought to justice, but extremism must not undermine commitment to the rule of law, to human rights, and to democracy." [...] At another press briefing at around 13:00 EST on December 27, a State Department spokesman asserted that [...] "some kind of postponement or delay" [...] in Pakistan’s democratic process would be [...] "a victory" [...] for [...] "the extremists" [...] who were responsible for Benazir Bhutto's assassination. He also asserted that [...] "perhaps the best antidote to extremism is the continuation of the democratic process." [...] He called for a [...] "credible and transparent" [...] investigation of the attack, and alluded to the [...] "broad international outrage" [...] about the incident. He also said that Bush spoke with Musharraf at 13:15 EST. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad, while describing Bhutto as a “courageous figure”, said that “The world has <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in the success of Pakistan's democratic institutions. It's a great tragedy because she stood for moderation, for rule of law, for democracy in her country, and her death is a loss for the cause of moderation, democracy, and rule of law for Pakistan. She was clear-headed about the problems of her country, the challenges that she faced — even the security challenges she faced." [...] Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement,"We extend our sincere condolences to the Bhutto family and to the families of others who were killed and wounded in the attack. We condemn in the strongest terms possible this cowardly and murderous attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes reports 71% positive reviews {{based on}} 52 surveyed critics {{and an average}} score of 7.4/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "The ending {{could use a little}} work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling." [...] Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as [...] "the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, that for a while the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "It’s formulaic, yet edgy. It’s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there’s much pleasure in Fincher’s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense {{over long periods of time}} and his sense of humor". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not <b>much</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
