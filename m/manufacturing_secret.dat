50|$|The {{composition}} of Blu Tack is a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secret</b> but {{is described as}} a synthetic rubber compound without hazardous properties under normal conditions. It can be swallowed without harm and is noncarcinogenic. It is non-soluble and is denser than water. The material is not flammable, but emits carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide when exposed to fire or high temperatures.|$|E
50|$|France however, only {{discovered}} the Chinese technique of hard-paste porcelain {{through the efforts}} of the Jesuit Father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles between 1712 and 1722. Louis XIV had received 1,500 pieces of porcelain from the Siamese Embassy to France in 1686, but the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secret</b> had remained elusive. The English porcelain-manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood may also have been influenced by the letter of Father d'Entrecolles and his description of Chinese mass-production methods. After this initial period, {{until the end of the}} 18th century, French porcelain manufactories would progressively abandon their Chinese designs, to become more French in character.|$|E
25|$|In 1712, {{many of the}} {{elaborate}} Chinese porcelain <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets</b> were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles and soon published in the Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires jésuites. The secrets, which d'Entrecolles read about and witnessed in China, were now known and began seeing use in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets</b> for {{porcelain}} <b>manufacturing</b> {{were revealed}} by the Jesuit Father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles in 1712, and openly published in 1735. One ingredient for porcelain was kaolin; the porcelain manufactory of Meißen, near Dresden, was {{taking advantage of the}} first kaolin deposits identified in Europe, but hard-paste porcelain in France had to wait for the first French kaolin, discovered near Limoges later in the eighteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The Bell and Carillon Museum {{is housed}} in a former stagecoach inn. The museum shows {{the history of the}} foundry, <b>manufacturing,</b> {{professional}} <b>secrets</b> and the work of the bell-founders. In addition, there is a unique set of weather-vanes and clocks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1864, Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye, who was {{particularly}} {{involved in the}} project, proposes to the Emperor an ‘historical museum’ project in order to: « provide historians with precise documents {{on the life of}} our Fathers, to invite industrials to ancient <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets,</b> to get the artist to recognise how art was modified (…) » Archives nationales - 20144782/1, Rapport décembre 1865 [...] The first meeting of the committee set up to organize the museum was held on 1 April 1865 in the office of Count Émilien de Nieuwerkerke, superintendent of the École des Beaux-Arts and in charge of imperial museums. Attendees included major figures in archaeology: Alexandre Bertrand - who became the museum’s first director, Édouard Lartet, Louis Félicien de Saulcy and Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes.|$|R
25|$|Although {{originally}} developed in England in 1748 {{in order to}} compete with imported porcelain, bone china is now made worldwide. The English had read the letters of Jesuit missionary Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles, which described Chinese porcelain <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets</b> in detail. One writer has speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly {{have been responsible for}} the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of English porcelain, although this is not supported by researchers and historians. In China, kaolin was sometimes described as forming the 'bones' of the paste, while the 'flesh' was provided by the refined rocks suitable for the porcelain body. Traditionally, English bone china was made from two parts of bone-ash, one part of kaolin and one part china stone, although this has largely been replaced by feldspars from non-UK sources.|$|R
50|$|Jean Boisard (also Boizard) was {{a learned}} Frenchman, who died around 1725. His birth date is not known. He is {{considered}} to be one of founders, in the 17th century, of numismatics, the science or specialized knowledge and collection of medals and coins. He was Counsellor at the French royal “Cour des Monnaies”. In 1692, he published a short treatise on coins, entitled “Traité des Monnaies, de leurs circonstances et dépendances”. In his book (which was reprinted several times during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century), very precise and accurate details were given on alloy and on <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets.</b> As a result, the government forbade its circulation, being afraid that it could be used as a guidebook for counterfeiters. There are still some rare copies available, which are consulted by contemporary specialists of numismatics.|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several {{thousand}} years, groups of people including ancient societies, required methods to secure information. These motivations led to many new innovations in cryptography. The field of cryptography has been studied {{for an extended period}} of time. Within this period of time, the progression of cipher technology shows that knowledge was passed on from each cryptographic generation. The earliest forms of cryptography or data obfuscation were used to protect <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets,</b> trade routes, and military operational secrets during both world wars. With the invention of the Internet and other electronic communications, securing electronic transmissions is becoming more and more necessary and makes cryptography even more relevant. Each generation of cryptographic systems provided a framework to improve upon the next as each generation became obsolete. This paper will provide a detailed view of how cryptography has evolved and how knowledge was gained to meet the security needs of the present...|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 14th century, {{in order to}} gain {{ascendancy}} at sea against Japanese pirates (wokou, also known as waegu in Korean), fire arrows called hwajeon or hwajon were used, which were the predecessor of the singijeon. The Koreans had tried to acquire rockets and gunpowder and their production methods from China. The Chinese, however, regarded the technology of gunpowder as a state secret and restricted access to it and trade in its nitrous raw materials (which could only be found in China). The Koreans therefore sought to acquire the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>secrets</b> of gunpowder for themselves and, in 1374 (~1376), Choe Mu-seon was able to bribe a Han Chinese merchant to obtain the <b>secret</b> formula for <b>manufacturing</b> gunpowder, as well as technical knowledge about Chinese firearm and cannon technology. He also successfully extracted potassium nitrate from the soil and rocks from Japanese trade routes, and developed Korea's first gunpowder.|$|R
5000|$|In United States v. Lange, the EEA {{was used}} to protect a victim company that had learned that Lange, a disgruntled former employee, had been {{offering}} to sell its <b>secret</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes to third parties. The company reported Lange to the FBI, and Lange was arrested and subsequently {{convicted and sentenced to}} 30 months in prison. The case was successful in large part because the company undertook reasonable measures to keep its information secret, including: ...|$|R
5000|$|Tests in 2003 {{claimed that}} the acceleration, rather than being constant, started at a high value and decreased, leading to {{velocities}} at close range which were not as low as expected, about 100fps at 1-foot instead of the calculated 20fps. The testers suggested that the (<b>secret)</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process was designed to achieve this effect. [...] However, independent analysis of those testers' own published data shows that their conclusions were incorrectly calculated. The projectile's acceleration actually started out low and continually increased over the bullet's measured flight.|$|R
2500|$|During World War II a major wartime {{manufacturing}} plant {{was located in}} Chullora. The site once occupied [...] of land surrounded by Rookwood Cemetery, Brunker Road, the Hume Highway and Centenary Drive. The site {{was said to have}} been the largest <b>secret</b> <b>manufacturing</b> plant in Australia which was used for the production of military weapons, plane components, tanks, and ordnance. Over two-thousand men and woman were employed to work at the factory on a daily basis. During the war the factory produced components for 700 Beaufort, 380 Beaufighter and up to 50 Lincoln aircraft. Over 54 ACI tanks were built as well as 60 General Lee tanks that were adapted for use in the Australian Military, as were local jeeps in the 70s. The factory also produced 81 cupola turrets for the British Matilda tanks.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{invasion}} of Normandy in June 1944, Lepe {{was used as a}} <b>secret</b> <b>manufacturing</b> site. Six massive concrete caissons (type B2 Phoenix breakwaters) were built here and later towed across the English Channel where they formed part of the artificial Mulberry harbours after D-Day. Lepe {{was also one of the}} many places on the south coast of England used for the embarkation of troops and equipment for {{the invasion}}. Concrete mats like big chocolate blocks were used to reinforce the shingle beach for heavy traffic. Some of these mats can still be seen today along with pier remnants, bollards and various concrete and brick structures. Lepe was also the point where PLUTO (Pipeline Under The Ocean) left the mainland: it carried fuel across the Isle of Wight and under the English Channel to the Allied forces in Normandy and beyond.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 years ago, Tony Stark and Abe Zimmer {{developed}} powerful {{software that}} was designed to design and program the computers. This software designed a small factory and all of its contents. That factory system in turn developed a computer and software that designed five generations of ever-better and more powerful computer platforms. That fifth generation computer achieved an information density double that of the human brain....and it could think. The computer system could do self-directed projects where it can even write programming while also collating and analyzing any type of data. Using the same revolutionary manufacturing techniques developed for the Iron Man armor, Tony made it the size of a standard desktop PC, calling it H.O.M.E.R. and put it in charge of all of Tony's <b>secret</b> <b>manufacturing</b> projects in Stark Enterprises. H.O.M.E.R. resided in the armory (located in Sub-Level 3) and can project a hologram of himself when interacting with Stark when he came in to check up on the development of his latest armor. When Deathlok breaks into Stark Enterprises, H.O.M.E.R. alerts Tony about this.|$|R
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} {{is a broad}} heading {{used to refer to}} a wide variety of rights associated with inventions, discoveries, writings, artistic works, product designs, and designations of the source of goods and services. Patents and trade secrets are the most important of these sorts of intellectual properties in the field of biotechnology. One aspect of intellectual property that distinguishes it sharply from other forms of property-and for some people makes it harder to justify-is that intellectual properties may be possessed and used by many people simultaneously. This is not so for tangible property. If someone borrows my car, I cannot use it-nor can anyone else-until the car is returned to me, but if someone borrows my <b>secret</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process or my backup copy of my word processor, I can keep on using it while someone else is using it. In fact, no matter how many people I share my word processor with, as long as everybody can make a copy, it is not going to interfere with my ability to keep on using it. This capacity for simultaneous possession by many people is a feature that is common to all sorts of intellectual property, including computer programs, musical recordings, lists of customers, and self-replicating cell lines or genetically engineered organisms. Many people intuitively feel that they are doing nothing wrong when they make unauthorized use of intellectual property as, for example, when they borrow and copy other people 2 ̆ 7 s computer programs...|$|R
50|$|The {{suburb of}} Chullora was {{originally}} {{part of the}} area known as Liberty Plains, which was land given to the first free settlers who arrived in Sydney Cove on 6 January 1793. In the 1950s, many immigrants from Europe were housed in the area. Once established, they moved {{to other parts of}} Sydney. Chullora was the name used for one of the estates in this area. Chullora is an Aboriginal word meaning 'flour'. The recent construction of the Tip Top Bakeries, has perhaps brought the suburbs back to its roots.During World War II, Chullora was selected as the site for a major wartime manufacturing plant. The site once occupied several hundred acres of land surrounded by Rookwood Cemetery, Brunker Road, the Hume Highway and Centenary Drive. The site was said to have been the largest <b>secret</b> <b>manufacturing</b> plant in Australia which was used for the production of military weapons, plane components, tanks, HE Bombs and ordnance.

5000|$|In mid October 1886, Léon Dyonnet and Amyot {{went into}} the corset making business, under the name Dyonnet et Amyot (Léon's wife, Hélène Goullioud ran a corset factory). The {{agreement}} stipulated that [...] " Each contributed $2,000 in capital, was entitled to half the profits, and could withdraw $800 a year for his personal expenses." [...] and Dyonnet was to teach Amyot “ all the <b>manufacturing</b> details and <b>secrets</b> and let him benefit from the experience he had gained in the said production process.” In 1888, the company employed about 60 people. One year later, in late March of 1889, Dyonnet left for Brazil, and Amyot renamed the company Dominion Corset. Amyot would become the sole owner of Dominion in 1897, after two of his sisters (Odile and Mary-Louise) joined but subsequently left the company. The company grew rapidly, with sales more than quintupling over an eight year period (from $21,000 in 1887 to $58,000 in 1891 and $130,000 in 1895.) Dominion Corset expanded in the Saint-Roch ward, eventually buying the factory of Guillaume Bresse. Amyot began to expand into other related industries, starting a paper box company in 1904, and a steel rod company in 1916. In 1910, the company had a value of $500,000. However, the factory was destroyed by a fire in 1911, leading to losses of 250,000. Amyot rebuilt, and sales soared to 1.6 million in 1918, and 2.6 million in 1919. In 1924, Amyot handed over his company to his son, Adjutor.|$|R
