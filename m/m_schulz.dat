500|$|George Joseph Herriman (August22, 1880– April25, 1944) was an American {{cartoonist}} {{best known}} for the comic strip Krazy Kat (1913–1944). [...] More influential than popular, Krazy Kat had an appreciative audience among those in the arts. Gilbert Seldes' article [...] "The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself" [...] was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. The Comics Journal placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Charles <b>M.</b> <b>Schulz,</b> Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Watterson, and Chris Ware.|$|E
500|$|Krazy Kat was {{a primary}} {{influence}} on other cartoonists such as Charles <b>M.</b> <b>Schulz</b> of Peanuts, Bill Watterson of Calvin and Hobbes, and the Italian Massimo Mattioli. [...] Walt Kelly paid homage to Herriman {{in some of}} his Pogo strips. [...] Dr. Seuss expressed fondness for Krazy Kat, and children's literature scholar Philip Nel has detected Herriman's influence in Seuss's works, especially in his zig-zagging, Coconino County-like backgrounds. [...] Multimedia artist Öyvind Fahlström appropriated Krazy Kat in a series of works from 1963 to 1965. [...] Jay Cantor published a postmodern novel in 1987 called Krazy Kat: A Novel in Five Panels, in which the retired Krazy and Ignatz contemplate a comeback in a post-atomic world.|$|E

[...] He served as {{the editor of the}} campus newspaper, The Cooper Point Journal, for which he also wrote articles and drew cartoons. He befriended fellow cartoonist Lynda Barry after discovering that she had written a fan letter to Joseph Heller, one of Groening's favorite authors, and had received a reply.

500|$|Comics and {{cartoons}} are literary genres {{that use}} drawings or graphics, usually {{in combination with}} text, to convey an entertaining narrative. Many contemporary comics have elements of fantasy and are produced by companies {{that are part of}} the entertainment industry. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about superheroes such as Superman are of the first type. Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years [...] of Charles <b>M.</b> <b>Schulz</b> who produced a popular comic called Peanuts about the relationships among a cast of child characters; and Michael Leunig who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate social criticism. The Japanese Manga style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. Caricature uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Charles <b>M.</b> <b>Schulz</b> drew {{an episode}} of his comic strip Peanuts in which Snoopy's {{doghouse}} is wrapped in fabric by Christo. [...] In response, Christo constructed a wrapped doghouse and presented it to the Charles <b>M.</b> <b>Schulz</b> Museum in 2003.|$|E
