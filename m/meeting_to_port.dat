After 26 February 1942, she spent a year escorting convoys from a mid-ocean <b>meeting</b> point <b>to</b> Icelandic <b>ports.</b> On 7 February 1943, she left for Boston and reassignment. During this time, she was given a shipyard overhaul at Boston Navy Yard and converted into an anti-submarine warfare ship.

60|$|Mr. Sapsea has {{improved}} the acquaintance of Mr. Jasper, since their first <b>meeting</b> <b>to</b> partake of <b>port,</b> epitaph, backgammon, beef, and salad. Mr. Sapsea has been received at the gatehouse with kindred hospitality; {{and on that}} occasion Mr. Jasper seated himself at the piano, and sang to him, tickling his ears—figuratively—long enough to present a considerable area for tickling. What Mr. Sapsea likes in that young man is, that he is always ready to profit by the wisdom of his elders, {{and that he is}} sound, sir, at the core. In proof of which, he sang to Mr. Sapsea that evening, no kickshaw ditties, favourites with national enemies, but gave him the genuine George the Third home-brewed; exhorting him (as ‘my brave boys’) to reduce to a smashed condition all other islands but this island, and all continents, peninsulas, isthmuses, promontories, and other geographical forms of land soever, besides sweeping the seas in all directions. In short, he rendered it pretty clear that Providence made a distinct mistake in originating so small a nation of hearts of oak, and so many other verminous peoples.|$|R

50|$|Iterative {{impedance}} is {{a similar}} concept to image impedance. Whereas an iterative impedance is formed by connecting port 2 of the first two-port network <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 1 of the next, an image impedance is formed by connecting port 2 of the first network <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 2 of the next. Port 1 of the second network is connected <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 1 of the third and so on, each subsequent network being reversed so that like ports always face each other.|$|R

5000|$|One {{widely used}} circuit is the {{reflection}} amplifier {{in which the}} separation is accomplished by a circulator. A circulator is a nonreciprocal solid-state component with three ports (connectors) which transfers a signal applied <b>to</b> one <b>port</b> <b>to</b> the next in only one direction, <b>port</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 2, 2 <b>to</b> 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode N is attached through a filter F <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 2, and the output circuit is attached <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 3. The input signal is passed from <b>port</b> 1 <b>to</b> the diode at port 2, but the outgoing [...] "reflected" [...] amplified signal from the diode is routed <b>to</b> <b>port</b> 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance [...] of the input and output transmission lines, usually 50Ω, is matched <b>to</b> the <b>port</b> impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter F is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.|$|R
