2500|$|Vietnamese {{martial arts}} are highly {{developed}} from the country's long history of warfare and attempts to defend itself from foreign occupation. Although most heavily influenced by Chinese martial arts, it has developed its own characteristics throughout the <b>millennia</b> in <b>combination</b> with other influences from its neighbours. Vietnamese martial arts is deeply spiritual due {{to the influence of}} Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and is strongly reliant on the [...] "Viet Vo Dao" [...] (philosophy of Vietnamese martial arts). It is probably most famous for its scissor kicks.|$|R
500|$|Towards {{the turn}} of the <b>millennium,</b> the <b>combination</b> of hard and fast guitar riffs with {{classical}} female lead vocals attracted {{a great deal of attention}} in the metal scene. The new music style of Nightwish quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity; this symphonic metal style was soon dubbed [...] "opera metal". Turunen does not see herself as an opera singer. She has sung excerpts from operas at the Savonlinna Opera Festival, but she stresses that singing opera cannot be performed as a side project. She would need special training to perfectly sing an entire opera without a microphone.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{most of this}} century, we {{have worried}} that we would destroy {{ourselves}} in interhuman conflict. Fortunately, that fear has subsided. Unfortunately, it is rapidly being replaced by a new one. In the upcoming century, we will worry that we may destroy our planet and ourselves with it. We are approaching a new millennium. The challenge of the current millennium has been to pass from the medieval to the modern world, building modern cultures and nations in an explosion of technological development. The challenge of the next millennium will be to contain those cultures within the carrying capacity of the larger community of life on our home planet. For many <b>millennia,</b> diverse <b>combinations</b> of nature and culture worked well enough but no longer. In the last century, our modern cultures began to threaten the stability, beauty, and integrity of Earth, thereby threatening the cultures superimposed on the Earth. On our present course, much of {{the integrity of the}} natural world will be destroyed within the next century. To continue the developmental pace of the last century for another millennium will produce sure disaster. If humans are to be true to our species 2 ̆ 7 epithet, 2 ̆ 2 the wise species 2 ̆ 2 must behave with appropriate respect for life. Such behavior necessarily will involve an interhuman ethics. Will it also involve an interspecies ethics, in which the only moral species discovers that all the others, though not moral agents, deserve moral consideration? Will it involve an Earth ethics that discovers a global sense of human obligation to this inhabited planet, the only such planet we know...|$|R
40|$|Ancient {{and medieval}} {{harbours}} connected via navigable and terrestrial routes {{could be interpreted}} as elements of complex traffic networks. Based on evidence from three projects in Priority Programme 1630 (Fossa Carolina, Inland harbours in Central Europe and Byzantine harbours on the Balkan coasts) we present a pioneer study to apply concepts and tools of network theory on archaeological and on written evidence as well as to integrate this data into different network models. Our diachronic approach allows for an analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of webs of connectivity with a focus on the 1 st <b>millennium</b> AD. The <b>combination</b> of case studies on various spatial scales as well as from regions of inland and maritime navigation (Central Europe respectively the Seas around the Balkans) allows for the identification of structural similarities respectively difference between pre-modern traffic systems across Europe. The contribution is a first step towards further adaptions of tools of network analysis as an instrument for the connection and comparison of data across the projects of Priority Programme 1630.

40|$|The {{communications}} phenomena {{at the end}} of the 20 th {{century were}} the Internet and mobile telephony. Now, entering the new <b>millennium,</b> an effective <b>combination</b> of the two should become a similarly everyday experience. Current limitations include scarce, exorbitantly priced bandwidth and considerable power consumption at higher data rates. Relaying systems use several shorter communications links instead of the conventional point-to-point transmission. This can allow for a lower power requirement and, due to the shorter broadcast range, bandwidth re-use may be more efficiently exploited. Code division multiple access (CDMA) is emerging as one of the most common methods for multi user access. Combining CDMA with time division duplexing (TDD) provides a system that supports asymmetric communications and relaying cost-effectively. The capacity of CDMA may be reduced by interference from other users, hence it is important that the routing of relays is performed to minimise interference at receivers. This thesis analyses relaying within the context of TDD-CDMA systems. Such a system was included in the initial draft of the European 3 G specifications as opportunity driven multipl...|$|R
40|$|MBA thesisThe Johannesburg Central Business District, and {{the retail}} in it, has evolved {{dramatically}} {{during the course}} of its relatively short, but tumultuous history. Having begun with a few small shops serving the young mining town in the late 19 th century, the CBD soon became the hub of retail activity for the city and the commercial heart of the country. By the end of the <b>millennium,</b> a <b>combination</b> of political, economic and social factors had resulted in the decline of the city centre and its retail sector. In an attempt to gentrify the CBD, the city’s stakeholders began to implement a variety of urban renewal strategies. Whilst the face and nature of the CBD had changed from what it once was, it began striving to become a “World Class African City”, rather than its previous contrived efforts at being a “European City in Africa. ” As the renewal strategies started to gain traction, and the CBD began to stabilise, opportunities began presenting themselves for retailers. The CBD remains a hive of activity for a large population, more representative of the national demographic. An opportunity exists for retailers that are able to adapt to the prevailing nature of the CBD and its citizens. The research seeks to identify how retail has evolved in the Johannesburg CBD, in response to the various changes the city has undergone. Various literature sources dealing with the subject is discussed, and 20 retailers were interviewed to gain an insight into the effects that the decline {{of the city and the}} resulting renewal initiatives implemented, have had on the nature and dynamic of retail. The results are aggregated and discussed, with various suggestions presented as to how to the city’s stakeholders may best work together to improve the fortunes of both the city and the retail in it...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{missions}} to Mars, Europe and other {{bodies of the}} Solar system have created a prerequisite to search for extraterrestrial life. The first attempts of microbial life detection on the Martian surface by the Viking landed missions gave no biological results. Microbiological investigations of the Martian subsurface ground ice layers {{seem to be more}} promising. It is well substantiated to consider the Antarctic ice sheet and the Antarctic and Arctic permafrost as terrestrial analogues of Martian habitats. The results of our long-standing microbiological studies of the Antarctic ice would provide the basis for detection of viable microbial cells on Mars. Our microbiological investigations of the deepest and thus most ancient strata of the Antarctic ice sheet for the first time gave evidence for the natural phenomenon of long-term anabiosis (preservation of viability and vitality for <b>millennia</b> years). A <b>combination</b> of classical microbiological methods, epifluorescence microscopy, SEM, TEM, molecular diagnostics, radioisotope labeling and other techniques made it possible for us to obtain convincing proof of the presence of pro- and eukaryotes in the Antarctic ice sheet. In this communication, we will review and discuss some critical issues related to the detection of viable microorganisms in cold terrestrial environments with regard to future searches for microbial life and/or its biological signatures on extraterrestrial objects...|$|R

Code division multiple access (CDMA) is emerging as one of the most common methods for multi user access. Combining CDMA with time division duplexing (TDD) provides a system that supports asymmetric communications and relaying cost-effectively. The capacity of CDMA may be reduced by interference from other users, hence it is important that the routing of relays is performed to minimise interference at receivers. This thesis analyses relaying within the context of TDD-CDMA systems. Such a system was included in the initial draft of the European 3 G specifications as opportunity driven multiple access (ODMA). Results are presented which demonstrate that ODMA allows for a more flexible capacity coverage trade-off than non-relaying systems. An investigation into the interference characteristics of ODMA shows that most interference occurs close to the base station (BS). Hence it is possible that in-cell routing to avoid the BS may increase capacity. As a result, a novel hybrid network topology is presented. ODMA uses path loss as a metric for routing. This technique does not avoid interference, and hence ODMA shows no capacity increase with the hybrid network. Consequently, a novel interference based routing algorithm and admission control are developed. When at least half the network is engaged in in-cell transmission, the interference based system allows for a higher capacity than a conventional cellular system. In an attempt to reduce transmitted power, a novel congestion based routing algorithm is introduced. This system is shown to have lower power requirement than any other analysed system and, when more than 2 hops are allowed, the highest capacity. The allocation of time slots affects system performance through co-channel interference. To attempt to minimise this, a novel dynamic channel allocation (DCA) algorithm is developed based on the congestion routing algorithm. By combining the global minimisation of system congestion in both time slots and routing, the DCA further increases throughput. Implementing congestion routed relaying, especially with DCA, in any TDD-CDMA system with in-cell calls can show significant performance improvements over conventional cellular systems.
