500|$|Diamandis first {{announced}} Electra Heart in August 2011; it {{was initially}} planned {{to become a}} three-piece project inspired by American culture in the 1970s, although it eventually evolved into her second studio album. Diamandis originally planned to release the record as a [...] "side project" [...] under an entity separate from Marina and the Diamonds, although her management disapproved. The track [...] "Living Dead" [...] was the first recorded during its production, and approximately 22 songs were recorded for potential inclusion on the album. She later commented that the record was dedicated to [...] "dysfunctional love", elaborating that [...] "rejection is a universally embarrassing topic and Electra Heart is <b>my</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> that." [...] Diamandis stated that Electra Heart was influenced by Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, and Queen of France Marie Antoinette; she described Madonna as being [...] "fearless" [...] and felt that she showcased {{a desire to be}} a successful artist beyond fame and wealth. Diamandis told Glamour that Britney Spears influenced a [...] "double-sided" [...] theme for the record of both [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "darkness". She described the final product as being [...] "a bit cringe" [...] and reflective of her personal experiences, although noted that its promotional campaign would be [...] "pink and fluffy".|$|E

6000|$|Whatever {{there might}} have been for me of pain or doubt was washed {{straight}} out by the special sensation of seeing how [...] "clever" [...] poor Long not only would have to be, but confidently and actually was; inasmuch as this apprehension seemed to put me in possession of his cleverness, besides leaving me all my own. I made him welcome, I helped him to another cigarette, I felt above all that I should enjoy him; <b>my</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> his overture was, in other words, quickly enough to launch us. Yet I fear I can do little justice to the pleasant suppressed tumult of impression and reflection that, on my part, our ten minutes together produced. The elements that mingled in it scarce admit of discrimination. It was still more than previously a deep sense of being justified. My interlocutor was for those ten minutes immeasurably superior--superior, I mean, to himself--and he couldn't possibly have become so save through the relation I had so patiently tracked. He faced me there with another light than his own, spoke with another sound, thought with another ease and understood with another ear. I should put it that what came up between us was the mere things of the occasion, {{were it not for the}} fine point to which, in my view, the things of the occasion had been brought. While our eyes, at all events, on either side, met serenely, and our talk, dealing with the idea, dealing with the extraordinary special charm, of the social day now deepening to its end, touched our companions successively, touched the manner in which this one and that had happened to be predominantly a part of that charm; while such were our immediate conditions I wondered of course if he had not, just as consciously and essentially as I, quite another business in mind. It was not indeed that our allusion to the other business would not have been wholly undiscoverable by a third person.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me so long, however, since I had been among such boys, or among any companions of my own age, except Mick Walker and Mealy Potatoes, that I felt as strange as ever I have done in my life. I was so {{conscious}} of having passed through scenes of which they could have no knowledge, and of having acquired experiences foreign to my age, appearance, and condition as one of them, that I half believed it was an imposture to come there as an ordinary little schoolboy. I had become, in the Murdstone and Grinby time, however short or long it may have been, so unused to the sports and games of boys, that I knew I was awkward and inexperienced in the commonest things belonging to them. Whatever I had learnt, had so slipped away from me in the sordid cares of my life from day to night, that now, when I was examined about what I knew, I knew nothing, and was put into the lowest form of the school. But, troubled as I was, by my want of boyish skill, and of book-learning too, I was made infinitely more uncomfortable by the consideration, that, in what I did know, I was much farther removed from my companions than in what I did not. My mind ran upon what they would think, if they knew of my familiar acquaintance with the King's Bench Prison? Was there anything about me which would reveal my proceedings in connexion with the Micawber family--all those pawnings, and sellings, and suppers--in spite of myself? Suppose {{some of the boys}} had seen me coming through Canterbury, wayworn and ragged, and should find me out? What would they say, who made so light of money, if they could know how I had scraped my halfpence together, for the purchase of my daily saveloy and beer, or my slices of pudding? How would it affect them, who were so innocent of London life, and London streets, to discover how knowing I was (and was ashamed to be) in some of the meanest phases of both? All this ran in my head so much, on that first day at Doctor Strong's, that I felt distrustful of my slightest look and gesture; shrunk within myself whensoever I was approached by one of my new schoolfellows; and hurried off the minute school was over, afraid of committing myself in <b>my</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> any friendly notice or advance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{theory of}} {{conceptual}} development must provide {{an account of}} the innate representational repertoire, must characterize how these initial representations differ from the adult state, and must provide {{an account of the}} processes that transform the initial into mature representations. In Carey, 2009 (The Origin of Concepts), I defend three theses: 1) the initial state includes rich conceptual representations, 2) nonetheless, there are radical discontinuities between early and later developing conceptual systems, 3) Quinean bootstrapping is one learning mechanism that underlies the creation of new representational resources, enabling such discontinuity. I also claim that the theory of conceptual development developed in The Origin of Concepts addresses two of Fodor’s challenges to cognitive science; namely, to show how learning could possibly lead to an increase in expressive power and to defeat Mad Dog Nativism, the thesis that all concepts lexicalized as mono-morphemic words are innate. A recent article by Georges Rey (Mind & Language, 29. 2, 2014) argues that <b>my</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Fodor’s challenges fail, because, he says, I fail to distinguish concept possession from manifestation and I do not confront Goodman’s new riddle of induction. <b>My</b> <b>response</b> is <b>to</b> show that, and how...|$|R
