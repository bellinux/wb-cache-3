5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of <b>mouldy</b> bread or <b>mouldy</b> wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E

She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat <b>mouldy</b> and smelly, from the basement, and sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill.

5|$|Amidst much {{pomp and}} ceremony, with Justinian and the Patriarch of Constantinople in attendance, the Roman fleet set sail around 21 June 533. The initial {{progress}} was slow, as the fleet spent five days at Heraclea Perinthus waiting for horses and further four days at Abydus {{due to lack}} of wind. The fleet left the Dardanelles on 1 July, and crossed the Aegean Sea to the port of Methone, where it was joined by the last contingents of troops. Belisarius took advantage of an enforced stay there due to a lull in the wind to train his troops and acquaint the disparate contingents with each other. It was at Methone, however, that 500 men died of dysentery caused by <b>mouldy</b> bread. According to Procopius, the responsibility fell on John the Cappadocian, who had cut costs by baking it only once, with the result that the bread went bad. Justinian was informed, but John {{does not appear to have}} been punished. Belisarius took steps to remedy the situation, and the army soon recovered.|$|E

500|$|Paul Dean of Eurogamer {{was less}} forgiving; {{although}} he {{agreed that the}} Workshop compatibility was a good addition and praised {{the players in the}} online community as [...] "remarkably calm and friendly", he thought that the game should have been updated more, citing its [...] "boring campaign" [...] and poorly-aged gameplay mechanics: [...] "It just doesn't play very well, and its flaws are more blatant than ever before". Underscoring his criticisms of the lack of significant changes to the game, he described it as [...] "a <b>mouldy</b> time-capsule that will likely mar your memories of the original".|$|E
500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I'd get {{home from school and}} {{there was nothing in the}} cupboard. I would eat <b>mouldy</b> bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|As Wood's {{working life}} {{took a turn}} for the better, his {{domestic}} life started to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most of Wood's money and, for much of the time, living abroad. She refused to divorce him. The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters. In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood's players recalled, [...] "She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie got him a new evening suit, instead of the <b>mouldy</b> green one, and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human." [...] As Wood was not free to remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to [...] "Lady Jessie Wood" [...] and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood's wife. In his memoirs, Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship.|$|E
500|$|... "Cocoon" [...] was {{received}} with positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Heather Phares called the song [...] "seductively alien". Seth Stevenson from Slate magazine gave a positive review to it, commenting {{that because of}} the song, Björk is [...] "actually at her best either barely murmuring or full-out yelling, and she may be the most stylized vocalist in music today". Michael Cragg from The Guardian commented that [...] "Vespertine is littered with defining moments. While the first single Hidden Place, the choir-assisted Undo and the Matmos collaboration Aurora are among the highlights, it's Cocoon that best represents the album's sense of heavy-lidded, post-coital hibernation". David Fricke from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "the flurry of rhythm" [...] {{at the start of the}} song felt like [...] "the gravity of a spider scurrying across linoleum". Ian Gittins, author of Björk: Human Behaviour - the Stories Behind Every Song, referred to [...] "Cocoon" [...] as the eyes of many of the most significant moments of Vespertine, as well as the most complete display and literal philosophy that the singer had taken for the album. British magazine NMEs Joe Logic was also positive saying, [...] "Soft organs and Rice Krispies (Eh? - Cereal Ed) feature heavily on a very minimalist 'Cocoon', a beautiful love song featuring Bjork whispering sexual lyrics over a track that To Rococo Rot would be proud of". Stephen Dalton from the same publication was less positive, and stated: [...] "Then there is the uncomfortably intimate, tremble-whisper Björk voice of 'Cocoon' where she relates the joy of shutting herself away with her lover with a broken music box and some <b>mouldy</b> old string".|$|E

2500|$|Cork taint is a wine fault mostly {{attributed}} to the compound 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), although other compounds such as guaiacol, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-octen-3-one, 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are also thought to be involved. TCA most likely originates as a metabolite of mould growth on chlorine-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes earthy, <b>mouldy,</b> and musty aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as [...] "corked". As cork taint has gained a wide reputation as a wine fault, other faults are often mistakenly {{attributed to}} it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Roth was commissioned, {{alongside}} {{several other}} artists, {{to paint a}} portrait of the collector and dealer Carl Laszlo to celebrate his fortieth birthday. Roth took a solarized photo of the Swiss collector, and painted over it with processed cheese [...] "in order to get his goat. I thought he would turn blue and green, like cheese." [...] This became the first of his celebrated biodegradable works. In a series of works called Insel ("Island", 1968), for instance, Roth would take a blue panel, cover it in foodstuffs arranged as islands on the background, cover the surface in yoghurt, then cover that in a layer of plaster, leaving the piece to undergo a series of transformations; <b>mouldy</b> stages, bacterial decay, insect attack, and then stability as only nondegradable elements were left.|$|E
2500|$|Amarone {{is unique}} in the wine world. Typically very alcoholic, {{full-bodied}} and ripe-tasting wines are produced in very warm climate regions, where the grapes are able to build up large amounts of sugar while ripening on the vine. Examples of warm climate regions include parts of Australia, California and southern Italy. The Valpolicella region is characterized as a [...] "cool climate region" [...] where acid levels are usually maintained and sugar build occurs more slowly in the vine. Grapes destined for Amarone are the last grapes in Valpolicella to be harvested, getting as ripe as they can before mold and rot set in. The sugars in the grapes are then concentrated by a process of desiccation where they are kept in special drying rooms for anywhere from three to four months. During this time {{over a third of}} the water is removed as the grapes shrivel into raisins. This method (known as passito) produces more concentrated grapes that still maintain the acid balance of a cool-climate grape. Amarones differ from other late harvest wines in that the presence of Botrytis cinerea is actively discouraged, as winemakers attempt to avoid the smoky, <b>mouldy</b> flavors that come with botrytized wine. Extra care is taken in the vineyard to ensure that the grapes are kept dry and harvested before rot can develop.|$|E

60|$|The nuts thus {{left on the}} surface, or buried {{just beneath}} it, are placed in the most {{favorable}} circumstances for germinating. I have sometimes wondered how those which merely fell {{on the surface of}} the earth got planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of the same year partially mixed with the mould, as it were, under the decaying and <b>mouldy</b> leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure they want, for the nuts fall first. In a plentiful year, a large proportion of the nuts are thus covered loosely an inch deep, and are, of course, somewhat concealed from squirrels. One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid of a rake, many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of January, and though some bought at the store the same day were more than half of them <b>mouldy,</b> I did not find a single <b>mouldy</b> one among these which I picked from under the wet and <b>mouldy</b> leaves, where they had been snowed on once or twice. Nature knows how to pack them best. They were still plump and tender. Apparently, they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring they were all sprouting.|$|E
