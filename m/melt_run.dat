40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{to achieve}} deep penetration welding {{of stainless steel}} utilising a 15 kW laserline® diode laser has been studied. This was approached by first characterising the properties of <b>melt</b> <b>run</b> welds on stainless steel 304 L plates and then transferring the gained knowledge to perform the butt welds. The results from the <b>melt</b> <b>run</b> analysis {{indicated that there was}} an increase in penetration and weld width with heat input, i. e. with either increasing the laser power (9 – 15 kW) or decreasing the welding velocity (3 m/min– 1 m/min). <b>Melt</b> <b>run</b> penetrations up to 12 mm were achieved. The increased welding velocity was shown to reduce the solidification grain and subgrain size. Cracks along the weld centreline were observed at the higher heat inputs and sinking at the crowns at the lower. Good <b>melt</b> <b>run</b> welds were obtained at laser powers of 9 – 13 kW and a welding velocity of 1. 5 m/min. Butt welding of 10 mm thick plates was successfully achieved with full penetration {{along the length of the}} weld at a laser power of 12 kW and a welding velocity of 1. 5 m/min. The weld properties were comparable to the corresponding <b>melt</b> <b>run</b> welds using a similar parameter set of laser power and welding velocity. No detrimental subsurface defects were recorded with only the presence of a negligible amount of porosity. Oxidisation on the surface of the cap and sinking towards the end of the weld run was observed. It was demonstrated that high powered diode lasers are capable of deep penetration welding. Keyhole mode welding was achieved and the weld properties are comparable to that of other high energy density welding processes. For welding of plates in the 10 mm thickness range, the results suggested that the more economic high power diode lasers may become a competitor to different laser beam systems which may be more expensive in both procurement and operation...|$|E

Experimental results were then {{used to determine the}} source parameters to be employed in a finite element model (FEM) of the welding process, with particular attention paid to the thermal field induced by the laser beam. A specific procedure, named ‘automatic remeshing technique’, was used in order to minimise the computation time. The aim was to create a reliable numerical model, suitable for the optimisation, in practical cases, of welding processes of these kinds of materials.

X-ray diffraction phase identification and light microscopy confirmed that the weld structure is fully austenitic and dendritic. A hardness increase in the weld bead {{with respect to the}} parent metal occurred and was related to both the microstructural refinement induced by a rapid cooling of the fusion zone and the presence of nanometric scale precipitates observed by TEM in the weld bead. Residual stresses were determined by means of X-ray diffraction, exhibiting tensile stresses, close to the yield strength, in the longitudinal direction in the weld bead, while the stresses were compressive in the transverse direction and in the base material. Tensile tests showed that welded specimens retained strength and ductility values comparable to those of the base material...|$|E

A material that behaves likes a glassy ablator on the surface, {{has a low}} thermal conductivity, is structurally tough, lightweight, and is in some sense reusable, would be desirable for the protective heat shield used on Earth entry vehicles. A material for this purpose has been developed that uses silicon dioxide (fused quartz) in a fibrous packed matrix, forming blocks which can behave as a glassy ablator on the surface when subject to very high surface heat fluxes. These fibrous silicon dioxide blocks are called Reusable Surface Insulation (RSI). The primary constituent of the RSI material is silicon dioxide, but may contain other compounds (e. g. alumina borosilicate) to affect the thermal and physical properties. The research performed in this thesis {{is to determine the}} ablative behavior of ceramic RSI materials in a hypersonic high enthalpy flow that is used to simulate entry into Earth atmosphere. Actual arc jet experiments were performed to measure mass loss, <b>melt</b> <b>run</b> off, and fiber collapse of these materials and compare the experimental results with predicted theoretical values. The tests were performed to ascertain if RSI type materials could be used for entry vehicles proposed in NASA Mars missions. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Electron-beam welding (EBW) is {{commonly}} {{employed in the}} aeroengine industry for the welding of high integrity components, fabricated from high-strength superalloys. For such applications, {{it is important to}} predict distortions and residual stresses induced by the process. <b>Melt</b> <b>run</b> trials have been carried out on nickel-base superalloy Inconel 706 plates using the EBW technique in order to analyse the effects of welding parameters on geometrical characteristics and microstructure of the bead. Butt-welded plates have been then investigated by means of tensile tests, microstructural analysis, and X-ray diffraction measurements. A finite element model of the process has been set up using an uncoupled thermal–mechanical analysis. The heat source was modelled using a superimposition of a spherical and a conical shape heat source with Gaussian power density distribution in order to reproduce the nail shape of the fusion zone (FZ). The parameters of the source were chosen so that the model would match with experimentally determined weld pool shape and temperatures, measured with thermocouples. Subsequently, the thermal analysis was used to drive the non-linear mechanical analysis. The predicted residual stresses were then compared with X-ray diffraction measurements. It was found that the correct thermal and residual stresses prediction is influenced by the shape of the fusion zone, the highest thermal tensile stress arising under the nailhead of the fusion zone where microfissuring can be observed...|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effects of welding and {{material}} variables on the occurrence of porosity in tungsten inert gas arc welding of copper. The experiments were based on a statistical design and variables included, welding current, welding speed, arc atmosphere composition, inert gas flow rate, weld preparation, and base material. The extent of weld metal porosity was assessed by density measurement and its morphology by X-ray radiography and metallography. In conjunction with this the copper-steam reaction has been investigated under conditions of controlled atmosphere arc melting. The welding experiments have shown that the extent of steam porosity is increased by increased water vapour content of the arc atmosphere, increased oxygen content of the base material and decreased welding speed. The arc melting experiments have shown that the steam reaction occurs {{in the body of the}} weld pool and proceeds to an apparent equi 1 ibrium state appropriate to to its temperature, the hydrogen and oxygen being supplied by the dissociation of water vapour in the arc atmosphere. It has been shown conclusively that nitrogen porosity can occur in the tungsten inert gas arc welding of copper and that this porosity can be eliminated by using filler wires containing small amounts of aluminum and titanium. Since it has been shown to be much more difficult to produce sound butt welds than <b>melt</b> <b>runs</b> it has been concluded that the porosity associated with joint fit up is due to nitrogen entrained into tho arc atmosphere. Clearly atmospheric entrainment would also, to a much lesser extent, involve water vapour. From a practical welding point of view it has thus been postulated that use of a filler wire containing small amounts of aluminum and/or titanium would eliminate both forms of porosity since these elements are both strongJy deoxidising and denitriding...|$|R
40|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the technology}} of obtaining high-strength cast iron is application in out-furnace treatment various inoculants containing magnesium. In practice of foundry production spheroidizing master alloys based on ferrosilicon (Fe-Si-Mg type) and «heavy» alloying alloys on copper and nickel base are widespread. The urgent issue is to improve their efficiency by increasing the degree of magnesium assimilation, reduction of specific consumption of additives, and minimizing dust and gas emissions {{during the process of}} spheroidizing treatment of liquid iron. One method of solving this problem is the use of inoculants in a compact form in which the process of dissolution proceeds more efficiently. For example, rapidly quenched granules or «chip»-inoculants are interesting to apply. The aim of present work was to study the peculiarities of production and application of «Chips»-inoculants on copper and magnesium base with additions of yttrium oxide. The principle of mechatronics was used, including the briquetting inoculants’ components after their mixing with the subsequent high-speed mechanical impact and obtaining plates with a thickness of 1 – 2 mm. Spheroidizing treatment of molten metal has been produced by ladle method using «Chips»-inoculants in the amount of 0. 8 %. Secondary graphitization inoculation was not performed. Studies have shown that when the spheroidizing treatment of ductile iron was performed with inoculants developed, the process of interaction of magnesium with the liquid <b>melt</b> <b>runs</b> steadily without significant pyroeffect and emissions of metal outside of the ladle. This generates a structure of spheroidal graphite of regular shape (SGf 5). The presence in the inoculant of yttrium oxide has a positive impact on the spheroidal graphite counts and the tendency of high-strength cast iron to form «white» cast iron structure. Mechanical properties of the obtained alloy correspond to high-strength cast iron HSCI 60. </p...|$|R
50|$|Water {{enters the}} alps as snow or rain. Bogs and frost hollows collect {{the water as}} snow <b>melt</b> and <b>run</b> off. A key element of these bogs is Sphagnum Moss, which acts as a sponge, {{absorbing}} up to twenty times its weight in water. These bogs then release the water over summer, ensuring creeks flow {{throughout most of the}} year maintaining the alps’ creeks and streams. The greatest risk to this system is damage to the Sphagnum bogs. Trampling by feral animals (pigs, cattle, horses, humans) reduces their ability to absorb and then release water; instead of a steady release, water flows increase significantly in spring, leading to erosion and scouring of river beds, and ceases over summer and autumn, leading to localised drought. Fire can remove riparian vegetation, also increasing run-off and erosion.|$|R
