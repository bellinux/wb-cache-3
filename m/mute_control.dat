40|$|The {{growth of}} {{distance}} education course offerings {{is an indication}} of its importance to students; however, criticisms have centered on its lack of ability to provide interaction among participants. This case study qualitatively examined barriers to interaction in an animal genetics course delivered through interactive compressed video (ICV) technology from a major land grant university to five universities in the Northeast. The {{purpose of the study was}} to analyze and describe student perceived barriers to interaction in a distance learning course. Qualitative data collection methodology included face-to-face interviews with students and site facilitators and participant observations to assess interaction among students at all sites. Barriers to interaction centered on social concerns, ICV technical limitations, lack of time, content related issues, camera shyness, site facilitators ' behavior in facilitating interactions, needing more time for processing content, lack of non-verbal clues, distance, and having to press the microphone <b>mute</b> <b>control</b> knob. All ten barriers served as dissatisfiers for students. Recommendations for improving interaction within the course include resolving technical limitations and failures. Course providers should also consider delivering courses using low-cost options such as web-based courses in light of th...|$|E
50|$|Mixer {{controls}} {{are similar to}} that of a mixing console. They consist of volume sliders or rotary controls that represent each individual source, which may be accompanied by balance and <b>mute</b> <b>controls.</b> Most interfaces provide a method of switching between playback (output) sources and recording (input) sources. Additional hardware or software may add other effects such as low-pass filters, distortion and boost controls.|$|R

5000|$|The {{master control}} section {{is used to}} adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer. The master control section has {{sub-group}} faders, master faders, master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls. In addition it may have solo monitoring controls, a stage [...] "talk-back" [...] microphone control (so the sound engineer can talk to the band, who may be some distance away at a live show or who might be separated in an isolation booth in the recording studio), <b>muting</b> <b>controls</b> and an output matrix mixer. On smaller mixers the inputs are on {{the left of the}} mixing board and the master controls are on the right. In larger mixers, the master controls are in the center with input faders and channel strips on both sides.|$|R
40|$|The LM 4550 is {{an audio}} codec for PC systems which is fully PC 99 {{compliant}} and performs the analog intensive {{functions of the}} AC 97 Rev 2. 1 architecture. Using 18 -bit Sigma-Delta A/D’s and D/A’s, the LM 4550 provides 90 dB of Dynamic Range. The LM 4550 was designed specifically to provide a high quality audio path and provide all analog functionality in a PC audio system. It features full duplex stereo A/D’s and D/A’s and an analog mixer with 4 stereo and 3 mono inputs, {{each of which has}} separate gain, attenuation and <b>mute</b> <b>control.</b> The LM 4550 provides a stereo headphone amplifier with an independent gain control and also supports National’s 3 D Sound stereo enhancement and variable sample rate conversion. The sample rate for the A/D and D/A can be programmed separately with a resolution of 1 Hz to convert any rate between 4 kHz– 48 kHz. The LM 4550 features the ability to connect several codecs together in a system to provide up to six channels for surround sound applications. Multiple codec systems can be built using the standard AC-Link format of one serial data stream per codec, or using a unique National Semiconductor feature for chaining codecs together. This chain feature requires only a single data stream to the controller. The AC 97 architecture separates the analog and digital functions of the PC audio system allowing both for system design flexibility and increased performance...|$|E
5000|$|A typical FM {{two-way radio}} carrier squelch circuit is noise operated. It {{takes out the}} voice {{components}} of the receive audio by passing the detected audio through a high-pass filter. A typical filter might pass frequencies over 4,000 Hz (4 kHz). The squelch control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise {{coming out of the}} filter. The audio output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a DC voltage when noise is present. The presence of continuous noise on an idle channel creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage goes away and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio <b>muting</b> <b>control</b> voltage as a [...] "signal present" [...] indication, for example in a repeater the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter.|$|R

40|$|The hardware-inspired volume user {{interface}} model {{that is in}} use across all of today’s operating systems {{is the source of}} several usability issues. One of them is that restoring the volume of a muted application can require an inappropriately long troubleshooting process: in addition to manipulating the application’s volume and <b>mute</b> <b>controls,</b> users may also have to visit the system’s volume control panel to find and adjust additional controls there. The “flat ” volume control model presented in this paper eliminates this and other problems by hiding the hardware-oriented volume model from the user. Using the flat model, users use one slider per application to indicate how loud they want the respective applications to play; the slider then internally adjusts all hardware volume variables necessary to obtain the requested output. By offering a single point of control for each application, the flat model simplifies controlling application volume and restoring muted applications. In our studies, participants completed all four volume control and mixing tasks faster and with less error when using the flat model than when using the existing hardware-oriented volume control model. Participants also indicated a subjective preference for the flat model over the existing model...|$|R

50|$|The guitar {{features}} five knobs {{and three}} switches. The Vo Power knob controls {{the intensity of}} sustain and mute while the harmonic balance knob controls the balance of sustain and mute between the bridge and the neck. Additionally, the guitar offers a knob for piezo blend that combines the piezo bridge pick-up signal into the guitar's output signal. The last two knobs are conventional volume and tone knobs. The mode selector switch switches between full sustain, <b>mute,</b> and <b>controlled</b> sustain mode while the filter toggle switch controls the articulation of the Moog Filter. Last of all, the guitar features a conventional five position pick-up selector.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} AC’97 style mixer scheme, the analog-to-digital {{converters}} {{that allow the}} CPU to receive audio signal can either be connected directly to one {{of each of the}} inputs, or they can be connected to the same summation result that the mixer can provide via the line, aux and mono analog outputs. Therefore, in addition to the above input and output gain controls, a mixer also provides a number of controls for selecting the recording source. The result of this selection is again subject to a <b>mute</b> and gain <b>control</b> before it is digitized.|$|R

50|$|Some {{models of}} Zenith's System 3 line of {{televisions}} {{made from the}} late 1970s to the early 1990s had a feature called the Space Phone by Zenith. It was basically a hands-free speakerphone built into the television set. It used the set's speaker and remote control, {{in addition to a}} built-in microphone. A Space Phone-enabled television would connect to a telephone jack (using a built-in phone cord), and making a call was performed by pressing a button on the remote to activate the Space Phone (which would <b>mute</b> and begin <b>controlling</b> the program audio going to the speaker). The telephone number is dialed using the numeric keys on the remote, which then displays the digits being dialed on-screen (using the on-screen display features of the System 3 line). The user could then converse with another caller hands-free, much like a regular speakerphone.|$|R

40|$|International audienceDue to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) {{mechanism}} {{adopted in}} LTE cellular networks, intra-cell interference is nearly absent. Yet, as these networks {{are designed for}} a frequency reuse factor of 1 to maximize the utilization of the licensed bandwidth, inter-cell interference coordination remains an important challenge. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous cellular networks, {{there is a need}} for scheduling coordination techniques to efficiently distribute the resources and mitigate inter-cell interference. In this paper, we propose a dynamic solution of inter-cell interference coordination performing an optimization of frequency sub-band reuse and transmission power in order to maximize the overall network utility. The proposed framework, based on game theory, permits to dynamically define frequency and transmission power patterns for each cell in the coordinated cluster. Simulation results show significant benefits in average throughput and also cell edge user throughput of 40 % and 55 % gains when performing the frequency sub-band <b>muting</b> and power <b>control.</b> Furthermore, we also obtain a meaningful improvement in energy efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{training}} autistic children to use manual signs were compared. Two children, one mute and one capable of some verbal imitation, {{were taught to}} use signs as expressive labels for pictures of objects. Using an alternating treatments design, speed of sign acquisition was compared across two training conditions in which signs were presented either accompanied by, or without, the corresponding verbal label. In both conditions, the training procedure incorporated reinforcement, modeling, prompting, fading, and stimulus rotation. The efficacy of training in both treatment conditions was demonstrated {{by the use of}} a multiple baseline control across signs, but no clear differences in acquisition speed across conditions were apparent. Posttests conducted to assess stimulus control of signing, and learning of verbal labels when these were present in training, showed that the behavior of the imitative, but not the <b>mute,</b> child was <b>controlled</b> by the verbal stimuli. The implications of the results both for understanding deficits characteristic of autistic children and for developing appropriate language training procedures are discussed...|$|R
