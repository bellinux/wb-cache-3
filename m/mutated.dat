5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} {{temperament}} and {{a reputation for}} intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a sturdy and hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The <b>mutated</b> allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the <b>mutated</b> allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the <b>mutated</b> gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the <b>mutated</b> gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the <b>mutated</b> gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the <b>mutated</b> gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E
5|$|The genes {{often found}} <b>mutated</b> in PanNETs are {{different}} from those in exocrine pancreatic cancer. For example, KRAS mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary MEN1 gene mutations give rise to MEN1 syndrome, in which primary tumors occur in two or more endocrine glands. About 40–70% of people born with a MEN1 mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently <b>mutated</b> include DAXX, mTOR and ATRX.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in the TREM2 gene {{have been}} {{associated}} with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action is that when TREM2 is <b>mutated,</b> white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present.|$|E
5|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and {{provide the basis for}} treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected less frequently. Other genes that are often <b>mutated</b> or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} most {{commonly associated with}} endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a kinase; KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling.

5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and {{saying that it is}} their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being <b>mutated</b> by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the <b>mutated</b> Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing {{that the only way to}} close the portal is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the portal is sealed, and Illusia is restored.|$|E
5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits.

50|$|<b>Mutate</b> is a {{term used}} in Marvel Comics to refer to superhumans who {{acquired}} their superpowers by exposure to some mutagenic compound or energy (either accidentally or deliberately). Unlike Marvel's mutants, <b>mutates</b> require external stimuli to acquire their powers, since <b>mutates</b> are not born {{with the potential to}} manifest powers. Within the Earth X universe, the powers and abilities of Earth's <b>mutates</b> and mutants alike are the direct result of the genetic manipulations of the Celestials in humanity's distant past, who placed dormant genes within one cross-section of humanity, and the active Deviant and Eternal genes in other cross-sections.|$|R

5|$|Cancers can be {{analyzed}} using genetic techniques (including DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry) to determine if certain therapies specific to <b>mutated</b> genes {{can be used to}} treat it. PARP inhibitors are used to treat endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations, specifically, mutations that lower the expression of PTEN. The PARP inhibitor shown to be active against endometrial cancer is olaparib. Research is ongoing in this area as of the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of <b>mutated</b> epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine.

5000|$|Unlike types {{implementing}} the Immutable Wrapper pattern, {{does not need}} to 'cancel out' <b>mutating</b> methods by issuing a [...] "No Operation" [...] instruction, or throwing a runtime exception when a <b>mutating</b> method is invoked.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the island}} nation of Genosha, mutants who were {{discovered}} by the government were often genetically altered by the Genegineer into nearly mindless slaves known as <b>mutates.</b> These Genoshan <b>mutates</b> were permanently sealed into [...] "skinsuits" [...] which recycled bodily wastes into nutrition and prevented sexual contact, and when not working were kept in a concentration camp {{out of sight of}} the public. Though these [...] "mutates" [...] started as mutants, they are considered <b>mutates</b> due to the outside alteration of their abilities; for example, the <b>mutate</b> Jennifer Ransome's genetic potential was for healing, but the Genegineer altered her ability to grow in size and strength instead.|$|R
50|$|FAM76A {{appears to}} have a {{moderate}} rate of mutation when compared to fibrinogen (fast <b>mutating)</b> and cytochrome c (slow <b>mutating).</b> This suggests that FAM76A has been at least somewhat resistant to mutation during the course of evolution.|$|R
5|$|Hsp90 is {{exploited}} by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often <b>mutated,</b> amplified or translocated in malignancy, and Hsp90 works to buffer these cellular stresses induced by malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 {{leads to the}} degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} <b>mutated</b> copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, investigative work in 1999 by a British {{team led}} by {{virologist}} John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital identified the major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples, France, as being {{the center of the}} 1918 flu pandemic. These researchers postulated that a significant precursor virus, harbored in birds, <b>mutated</b> so it could migrate to pigs that were kept near the front.|$|E
50|$|Magneto then {{creates the}} Savage Land <b>Mutates.</b> With the Savage Land <b>Mutates,</b> he clashes with the X-Men and Ka-Zar. Along with Namor, Magneto later attacks New York City. He later fights the Inhumans Royal Family, and battles the Avengers once more.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new purity and side effect {{analysis}} for Java programs. A method is pure {{if it does}} not <b>mutate</b> any location that exists in the program state right before the invocation of the method. Our analysis is built on top of a combined pointer and escape analysis, and is able to determine that methods are pure even when the methods <b>mutate</b> the heap, provided they <b>mutate</b> only new objects. Our analysis provides useful information even for impure methods. In particular, it can recognize read-only parameters (a parameter is readonly if the method does not <b>mutate</b> any objects transitively reachable from the parameter) and safe parameters (a parameter is safe if it is read-only and the method does not create any new externally visible heap paths to objects transitively reachable from the parameter). The analysis can also generate regular expressions that characterize the externally visible heap locations that the method <b>mutates.</b> We have implemented our analysis and used it to analyze several applications. Our results show that our analysis effectively recognizes a variety of pure methods, including pure methods that allocate and <b>mutate</b> complex auxiliary data structures. ...|$|R
