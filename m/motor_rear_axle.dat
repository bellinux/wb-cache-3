50|$|Plastics were {{introduced}} to the rotational molding process in the early 1950s. One of the first applications was to manufacture doll heads. The machinery was made of an E Blue box-oven machine, inspired by a General <b>Motors</b> <b>rear</b> <b>axle,</b> powered by an external electric motor and heated by floor-mounted gas burners. The mold was made out of electroformed nickel-copper, and the plastic was a liquid PVC plastisol. The cooling method consisted of placing the mold into cold water. This process of rotational molding {{led to the creation of}} other plastic toys. As demand for and popularity of this process increased, it was used to create other products such as road cones, marine buoys, and car armrests. This popularity led to the development of larger machinery. A new system of heating was also created, going from the original direct gas jets to the current indirect high velocity air system. In Europe during the 1960s the Engel process was developed. This allowed large hollow containers to be manufactured in low-density polyethylene. The cooling method consisted of turning off the burners and allowing the plastic to harden while still rocking in the mold.|$|R

Also contributing to Reflex's power and performance are unique headlamps and taillamps that integrate solar panels.

40|$|AbstractThe {{calculation}} methods {{for assessing the}} fatigue life of welded structures are gaining increasing importance in many technical applications, since they contribute in the decrease of the development costs and time. In various engineering applications, especially in the commercial vehicle sector with thick and thin components and welds of complex geometry and loading configurations, {{there is still a}} lack of experimentally verified guidelines for the calculation of fatigue life. The present paper shows an advanced procedure for FE modeling and fatigue life calculation of welds based on the Notch Strain Approach. It uses elastic-plastic cyclic material properties and can be applied in early stages of development when prototypes are not available. It can be applied to continuous and non-continuous welds, e. g. ones with pronounced terminations. Due to its local character, it covers both weld toe and root failures. To verify its accuracy, the proposed calculation procedure is applied to serial <b>motor</b> truck's <b>rear</b> <b>axles</b> providing complex 3 D weld geometries subjected to cyclic loading. Calculated lifetime results are compared to experimental ones determined on a test rig. The agreement is satisfactory...|$|R

50|$|Designed in 1988, {{following}} the American Lectra Haul dump truck model, it {{became one of}} the largest earth-hauling trucks in the world. The DAC 120 DE had an empty weight of 90 tonnes, and a maximum capacity of 120 tonnes. It was 10 metres long and 5.4 metres tall over the canopy, with a wheelbase of 3.2 metres. The model was driven by an 8-ton, 65 litre diesel engine, capable of producing 1,040 horsepower (768 kW). This engine powered two Electroputere Craiova electric traction <b>motors</b> in the <b>rear</b> <b>axle.</b> The top speed of the truck was 70 km/h empty and 55 km/h when full.

50|$|The SWS {{characteristics}} were deeply analysed during {{and at the}} end of the testing period, when it had done 80 000 km. In the point of view of the driver, the performance is good and partly better than with a diesel bus. The only additional effort compared to a diesel bus comes from minding of the poles. The electrical braking system is efficient, and therefore the lifetime of the service brakes is longer. The drive <b>motor</b> at the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> is excessively noisy due to vibrations; the same issue concerns on the diesel engine. The heating system and main inverter cooling would need a further development. While the diesel generator ensured the power supply, the extra weight was seen as a drawback. The old and worn cables above the streets caused problems during service.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the vehicle longitudinal velocity is essential for wheel slip control. Estimation of the slope angle in turn is important for real-life fuel economy optimization and improved traction control.

The research object of this work is a hybrid vehicle with an electric <b>motor</b> on the <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> and a combustion engine on the front axle. The wheel torque, which offered by electric motor is used to find out over-slipping wheels.
