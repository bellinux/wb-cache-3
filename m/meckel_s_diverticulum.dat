40|$|Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of massive rectal bleeding in pediatric ages. Because of lack of proper diagnostic method of this disease, it used to be not diagnosed preoperatively. Recently Tc- 99 m pertechnetate has been proven to accumulate in the ectopic gastric mucosa of Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum.</b> And Tc- 99 m scan is to be an important diagnostic method to tell the existence of Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum.</b> In our experience of Tc- 99 m pertecnetate abdominal scan on 14 cases of suspected Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum,</b> we could clearly visualize 2 cases of the diverticulum. We discussed on the proper method and time factor in the actual Tc- 99 m scan from our own experience...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of 3 year old boy with {{diagnosis}} of vascular ring composed of a right sided aortic arch, left sided ligamentum arteriosum and aberrant left subclavian artery originating from a retroesophageal Kommerell%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum.</b> The boy was referred for surgery with symptoms related to local compression; severe dysplasia. At the operation incision was done through the left posterolateral thoracotomy; a ligamentum arteriosum between the Kommerell%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> and the left pulmonary artery was divided, Kommerell%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> resected and left subclavian artery was reconstructed in the fashion of anastomosis of the artery to the left common carotid artery.

40|$|The {{case of a}} 20 month-old {{girl that}} was {{admitted}} to the emergency ward because of worsening of her general condition in the setting of acute non-bloody gastroenteritis is reported. The clinical examination revealed signs of severe dehydration and a prominent tender abdomen. Laboratory evaluation showed leucocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein and severe hypochromic microcytic anemia. Abdominal X-ray revealed diffuse meteorism. The child underwent laparascopic evaluation. A perforated Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> was found. Perforation and anemia due to occult bleeding are unusual presentations of Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum.</b> The differential diagnosis of children presenting with an acute abdomen with special focus on Meckel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Incisional or {{postoperative}} hernia, one of {{the most}} common surgical procedure in general surgery practice, mostly occurs in the first years following abdominal operations. Incarceration or strangulation is a serious complication of these hernias, and mostly requires emergent surgery. Meckel%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum,</b> the most frequent congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, is rarely found within a hernial sac and this unusual condition is called as Littre%u 2019 s hernia. In addition, preoperative diagnosis of this unusual condition is rather difficult and it is almost always first discovered during operation. A small number of cases of strangulated Meckel%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>Diverticulum</b> in an incarcerated ventral incisional hernia have been reported in the literature. Herein, we report a strangulated Meckel%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>Diverticulum</b> through a ventral incisional hernia in a 65 year-old woman who presented with clinical signs of intestinal obstruction...|$|R

40|$|The ectotympanic, malleus and incus of the {{developing}} mammalian middle ear ME are initially attached to the dentary via <b>Meckel</b> <b>s</b> cartilage, betraying their origins from the primary jaw joint of land vertebrates. This recapitulation has prompted mostly unquantified suggestions that several suspected but similarly unquantified key evolutionary transformations leading to the mammalian ME are recapitulated in development, through negative allometry and posterior medial displacement of ME bones relative to the jaw joint. Here we show, using CT reconstructions, that neither allometric nor topological change is quantifiable in the pre detachment ME development of six marsupials and two monotremes. Also, differential ME positioning in the two monotreme species is not recapitulated. This challenges the developmental prerequisites of widely cited evolutionary scenarios of definitive mammalian middle ear DMME evolution, highlighting the requirement for further fossil evidence to test these hypotheses. Possible association between rear molar eruption, full ME ossification and ME detachment in marsupials suggests functional divergence between dentary and ME as a trigger for developmental, and possibly also evolutionary, ME detachment. The stable positioning of the dentary and ME supports suggestions that a partial mammalian middle ear as found in many mammaliaforms probably with a cartilaginous <b>Meckel</b> <b>s</b> cartilage represents the only developmentally plausible evolutionary DMME precurso...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of adult {{intussusception}} {{caused by an}} inverted Meckel's diverticulum. A 24 -year-old man with intermittent abdominal pain was found by abdominal computed tomography to have target sign. We diagnosed intussusception, and couducted emergency surgery. At laparotomy, {{we found that the}} ileum had invaginated into the ascending colon. When the intussusception was relieved with Hutchinson's maneuver, an inverted diverticulum was observed at 80 cm proximal to the ileocecum. The diverticulum was 7 cm in size and was present on the opposite site of the mesentery. Histological findings showed all layers of small intestine and ectopic gastric mucosal tissue in the diverticulum. We diagnosed intussusception due to inverted Meckel' <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum.</b> Inverted <b>Meckel's</b> diverticulum should be considered as a probable cause of intestinal intussusception...|$|R
40|$|Axial torsion and {{gangrene}} of Meckel%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> (MD) causing {{small bowel}} obstruction is the rarest complication of the congenital anomaly. Only 8 cases {{in children and}} approximately 20 cases in adults {{were found in the}} literature. Our case is a 2 -year-old Caucasian male who presented to our pediatric department with gastroenteritis. The following day bilious vomiting and colicky episodic abdominal pain started. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of acute intestinal obstruction or appendicitis. Exploratory laparotomy suggested that 2 peritoneal bands of diverticulum to the mesentery of non-adjacent small bowel were the cause of axial torsion of MD; herniation of small bowels under the bands were observed. Wedge resection of the MD was performed. Complicated MD has no specific value. The preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Early surgery is important for correct diagnosis and for preventing strangulation and gangrene of the bowel...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis-associated {{encephalopathy}} (SEA) is a diffuse brain dysfunction {{secondary to}} the systemic response to infection and is associated with high mortality rate. We report a 4 -year-old boy with SEA. He presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. On {{the second day of}} admission, he developed consciousness disturbance with impaired attention, confusion and delirium. Routine laboratory tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination were normal. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed high-voltage slow wave activity on the right hemisphere with epileptiform discharge. He immediately underwent surgery and a torsed, gangrenous Meckel%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> with extension of ischemia to adjacent small bowel was seen and resected. His consciousness had become normal by the third day and he was discharged without any sequela. To overcome a poor prognosis in patients with SEA, the early recognition of the symptoms of SEA and also appropriate treatment of the underlying cause are essential...|$|R
40|$|Background. Meckel’ <b>s</b> <b>diverticulum</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} congenital anomaly of the small intestine, which mostly causes no health disturbances; however, it can cause serious complications: bleeding, inflammation with perforation and peritonitis, or intestinal obstruction. Patients and methods. A case of major lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding in a previously healthy 18 years old boy is presented. Endoscopic examinations did not reveal the source of bleeding. The technetium 99 scintiscan demonstrated ectopic gastric mucosa in the lower abdomen, and barium small bowel studies depicted a saccular dilatation in the mid jejunum, with mucosal folds alike those in the stomach. At operation in jejunum, 85  cm distally of the Treitz ligament, a quite large diverticulum was found. We resected it within healthy margins and made an end-to-end anastomosis of the jejunum. Conclusions. Meckel’s diverticulum is the commonest cause of a major gastrointestinal bleeding in children. The diagnosis is confirmed on scintiscan, as ectopic gastric mucosa is usually present in the diverticulum. In the adults bleeding is rare; more often intestinal obstruction and diverticulitis are encountered. The removal of a non-diseased incidentally found Meckel’s diverticulum is recommended mostly in infants and young people, considering also local and general conditions of the patient. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fetus-in-fetu (FIF) {{is a rare}} entity {{resulting}} from abnormal embryogenesis in diamniotic mono-chorionic twins, being first described by Johann Friedrich <b>Meckel</b> (1800 <b>s).</b> This occurs when a vertebrate fetus is enclosed in a normally growing fetus. Clinical manifestations vary. Detection is most often in infancy, the oldest reported age being 47. We report {{the case of a}} 4 -day-old girl who was referred postnatally following a prenatal fetal scan which had revealed the presence of a multi-loculated retroperitoneal mass lesion with calcifications within. A provisional radiological diagnosis of FIF was made. Elective laparotomy revealed a well encapsulated retroperitoneal mass containing among other structures a skull vault and rudimentary limb buds. Recovery was uneventful. Here we discuss the difference between FIF and teratomas, risks of non-operative therapy and the role of serology in surveillance and detection of malignant change...|$|R
