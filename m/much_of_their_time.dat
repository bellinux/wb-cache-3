5|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto reclused {{himself in his}} family {{compound}} in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers and rarely making public appearances. Suharto's family spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Because banded sea kraits spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> on land, {{they are}} often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an {{independent}} state, {{it was in}} reality a province of France. Its rulers spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was {{greater than that of}} their own country.|$|E

25|$|Adult ichneumonids feed on a {{diversity}} of foods, including plant sap, nectar and other insects. They spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> active <b>time</b> searching, either for hosts (female ichneumonids) or for emerging females (male ichneumonids).|$|R
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
5|$|Lions spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> resting and are {{inactive}} {{for about}} 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with {{a period of}} socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They {{spend an average of}} two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|The only genus {{that has}} {{retained}} the enlarged ventral scales is the sea kraits, Laticauda, with only five species. These snakes {{are considered to}} be more primitive, as they still spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> on land, where their ventral scales afford them the necessary grip. Laticauda species are also the only sea snakes with internasal scales, i.e., their nostrils are not located dorsally.|$|E
50|$|Blank's films {{focusing}} on musical subjects often spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> running <b>time</b> focusing {{not on the}} music itself but on the music's cultural context, portraying the surroundings from which these American roots musics come.|$|R

5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>times</b> betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|R
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> feeding {{in order to gain}} enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the films}} that {{dropped off the}} list after 1993 were Nobody Waved Goodbye and The Grey Fox. Critic Norman Wilner said this was unsurprising, {{describing}} the two films as [...] "very <b>much</b> products <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time,</b> and they haven’t aged well." ...|$|R
50|$|Between world wars, Werner was a {{constructor}} of a {{truck chassis}} for the PZInż 703 and 713, which were <b>much</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time.</b> He was also a constructor of the first Polish torque converter, and a creator of his own scientific school {{in the field of}} automotive engineering.|$|R
50|$|During {{research}} for {{and testing of}} new designs at Akaflieg Darmstadt the students {{get the opportunity to}} fly gliders in the Akaflieg fleet for recreation, as well as partake in the research flying programmes.

5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and {{only a small part}} at the schools. In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in {{the water}} and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
50|$|Eisenhower {{retired to}} the place where he and Mamie had spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> post-war <b>time,</b> a working farm {{adjacent}} to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 70 miles from his ancestral home in Elizabethville, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. They also maintained a retirement home in Palm Desert, California. In 1967 the Eisenhowers donated the Gettysburg farm to the National Park Service.|$|R

50|$|He {{spent his}} career living in Southern California, {{where he would}} marry and raise his three children. He and his wife spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{vacation}} <b>time</b> traveling throughout Mexico in their motor home, which inspired him to paint hundreds of scenics and portraits of Mexicans. He died in Oceanside, California, following a stroke, on February 11, 1992. He was 80.|$|R
5|$|Sea otters spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, {{but they are not}} known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion {{brothers}} invested <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> {{and efforts}} in establishing Lancaster schools, {{in an effort}} to provide the general population with education. This was considered a revolutionary undertaking by the Ultra-royalists, who did not believe that education should be made accessible for the lower classes. In 1821 Champollion even led an uprising, in which he and a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag. He was charged with treason and went into hiding, but was eventually pardoned.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> {{looking for}} {{food on the}} ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach {{to the head of}} a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E

5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii was {{a fairly}} large rodent, larger than the black rat (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|Relatively isolated, gentry {{families}} spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> visiting family, {{friends or}} neighbours. As a result, hospitality {{was an important}} part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the gentry included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired to entertain the family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the harpsichord, organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of the family who were the chief performers and men were not expected to play the piano in drawing rooms.|$|E
5|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} {{are found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and down past {{the southern part of}} Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea. In the Western Pacific Ocean it can be found near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs. They spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> swimming freely in open waters, generally in schools close to the surface, and can travel long distances in a day.|$|E
50|$|The hill is {{operated}} by a non-profit society known as the Mount Cain Alpine Park Society, {{which is responsible for}} the upkeep of the ski area and its financial operations. All directors are volunteers,and the number of directors changes every year. Directors resign and are voted on each year at the Annual General Meeting held in September. Many other volunteers devote <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time</b> to helping the hill.|$|R
50|$|The garden {{commanded}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the Boyces' {{activity and}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> leisure <b>time.</b> At first, the lantana and blackberry was cleared, however, {{not wanting to}} make too many sudden gaps, not all the camphor laurels, celtis and other exotics were removed. Instead, they were ringbarked and poisoned and let to die where they had sprung up. Seedlings began to sprout, these were then pulled out {{to keep them from}} reinfesting the rainforest.|$|R
