50|$|Menhaden, {{also known}} as <b>mossbunker</b> and bunker, are forage fish of the genera Brevoortia and Ethmidium, two genera of marine fish in the family Clupeidae. Menhaden {{is a blend of}} poghaden (pogy for short) and an Algonquian word akin to Narragansett munnawhatteaûg, derived from munnohquohteau ‘he fertilizes’, {{referring}} to their use of the fish as fertilizer. It is generally thought that Pilgrims were advised by Tisquantum ({{also known as}} Squanto) to plant menhaden with their crops.|$|E
