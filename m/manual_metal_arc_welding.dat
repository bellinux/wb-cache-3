40|$|Welded C-Mn steel {{structures}} are generally {{subjected to a}} {{post weld heat treatment}} (PWHT), consisting in a 100 minute isothermal holding at 600 °C, whose major role is to reduce the residual stresses in the heat affected zone. Nevertheless, an associated decrease of the material sensitivity to Dynamic Strain Aging (DSA) seems to be observed. Since this DSA phenomenon, generally induces a large increase in the ultimate tensile strength and a ductility loss in the 100 - 300 °C temperature range, with a view to practical design, it is important to accurately characterize the beneficial effect of PWHT on DSA. In order to study this influence of PWHT on the DSA in welded joints, tensile tests as well as internal friction tests were performed on C-Mn steels and <b>manual</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welded</b> joints, in the as-welded state or after PWHT.

40|$|Welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} and efficient permanent metal joining processes in the industry. When two plates are joined by welding, a very complex thermal cycle is applied to the weldment. Thermal energy applied results in irreversible elastic-plastic deformation and consequently gives rise to the residual stresses in and around fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ). It is well established fact that structural integrity of components is substantially affected by the residual stresses when subjected to thermal and structural loads. Presence of residual stresses may be beneficial or harmful for the structural components depending on the nature and magnitude of residual stresses. Using finite element based commercially available software, coupled thermal-mechanical three dimensional finite element model was developed by making an approximate geometry of the butt welded joint. Finite element analysis was performed to understand the complete nature of residual stresses in <b>manual</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welded</b> joint of AISI 304 stainless steel plate.

40|$|Dissimilar metal welds (DMWs) {{are widely}} used in steam vessels in thermal power {{stations}} to join low-temperature alloys, such as steels, to high temperature alloys, such as nickel-based alloys. This provides a cost-effective manufacturing solution. However, there {{is a history of}} DMWs failing due to creep in service environments. Many investigations have been performed on weld systems and failures in the traditional 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo (P 22) steels, but fewer have been performed on newer 9 Cr- 1 Mo steels, such as P 91 and P 92. Failures involving these newer steels continue to occur, for reasons which are not thoroughly understood. The factors involved are believed to include system stresses, differences in thermal expansion and microstructural evolution due to interdiffusion across the weld interface. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the chemical and microstructural stability of a range of DMWs involving P 91 and P 92 steels. Much of the work is centred on a 3 -bead <b>manual</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>weld</b> of nickel alloy 625 onto a P 92 substrate.

40|$|Arc-welding {{involves}} the deposition of molten filler metal and the localised input of intense heat. The surrounding parent material and, {{in the case}} of multi-pass welds, previously deposited weld metal, undergoes complex thermo-mechanical cycles involving elastic, plastic, creep and viscous deformations. These processes result in the development of large residual stress gradients around the welded region, which can be particularly detrimental to the structural integrity of plant components. The present study examines aggregated weld bead start and stop stress concentration effects in a three pass slot weld specimen that was designed to represent a multi-pass weld repair (without any original weld). The specimen design comprised a Type 316 L stainless steel base-plate of nominal dimensions (300 × 200 × 25) mm 3 with a 100 mm long by 10 mm deep central slot filled with 3 stringer <b>manual</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>weld</b> beads, laid one on top of another. Residual stresses in three orthogonal directions were measured by neutron diffraction on a plane cutting through the centre of the plate, parallel to the welding direction, to show concentrations of tensile stress at both the weld start and stop positions. The transverse component of residual stress on the same plane in a second, nominally identical, specimen was mapped using the contour method. By applying two independent measurement techniques the residual stress field within the specimen type was determined with an increased level of confidence. Maximum transverse stress values of about 200 MPa at the weld start position and 300 MPa at the weld stop position were found. Peak tensile stresses in the longitudinal direction of 370 and 460 MPa were measured using neutron diffraction at the weld start and stop positions, respectively. The stresses measured by the contour method and neutron diffraction were in reasonable overall agreement with each other. However, the comparisons pointed to the possible presence of cutting artefacts in the contour results...|$|R

40|$|Power quality {{represents}} a crucial issue in low voltage distribution networks. Welding equipments {{are among the}} most polluting loads because of their strong nonlinear behavior and their highly intermittent working cycle with a degree of randomness which causes the phenomenon of voltage flicker. The usual approach to the flicker mitigation consists in the introduction of static VAr compensators connected near to the polluting load. However, in low voltage network it is not always possible to adopt this approach: often the resistance of the conductors is not negligible. This means that even the active power fluctuations may result in a significant flicker contribution. In this paper the Authors will propose a flicker compensation technique which does not require the installation of an external device. It has to be noticed that virtually all the modern welding machine power supplies include a rectifier and a capacitive DC link. Basically, the solution consists in exploiting the energy stored in the DC link capacitance in order to smooth and mitigate the active power fluctuations. The large variations of the DC link voltage (hence of the energy stored in the capacitance) controlled by proper energy storage management logic, allow a short-time peak shaving which results in a consistent reduction of the voltage flicker. Finally, the performance of the flicker reduction system will be evaluated by means of numerical simulations. In particular, the short time flicker severity Pst will be computed considering a mathematical model of a <b>manual</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> (MMA) <b>welding</b> power supply with and without the proposed control strategy...|$|R

As análises microestruturais foram relacionadas com os resultados de ensaios de impacto Charpy nos metais de solda e com os perfis de microdureza Vickers ao longo da junta soldada. Os resultados indicaram maiores percentuais de Ferrita Acicular e maiores valores de resistência ao impacto nos metais de solda e uma menor extensão e granulometria da ZTA, associado ao procedimento de soldagem utilizando processo automatizado com maior velocidade de soldagem. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the heat affected zone characteristics and weld metals microstructure and mechanical properties of API 5 L X 80 steel welded joints, obtained for four different welding procedures using manual and automated processes. For this, plates of this steel were <b>welded</b> by <b>manual</b> Shielded <b>Metal</b> <b>Arc</b> <b>Welding</b> (SMAW) process with interpasses temperatures of 473 e 673 K, and using AWS E 8010 -G electrode as filler metals; robotized Flux Cored <b>Arc</b> <b>Welding</b> (FCAW) process, using AWS E 71 T- 1 C wire and Ar 25 %CO 2 as consumable and mechanized Gas Tungsten <b>Arc</b> <b>Welding</b> (GTAW) process, for the root pass using AWS ER 70 S- 3 and Ar as consumable. The microstructural analysis was related with the weld metals Charpy impact test results and with the welded joint Vickers microhardness profiles. The results indicated that weld metals obtained by automatized welding process presented a shorter and more refined heat affected zone and a weld metal with greatest Acicular Ferrite percentiles which promoted the best results of the impact test...|$|R
