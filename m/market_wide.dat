5000|$|The Mahoning Coal Railroad {{was listed}} on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 1888. But even after it doubled the amount of {{preferred}} stock {{on the market in}} 1890, there was so little stock on the market that it was rarely traded. Indeed, no stock was traded on the open market between July 1896 and November 1910. But the railroad made a great deal of money. According to historian Thomas W. Sanderson, the MCR was the most profitable of the LS&MS' lines as of 1907 due to the immense amount of freight moving in and out of Youngstown and its nearby coal fields and mills. The MCR was also the LS&MS' only link to the rich coal fields and iron foundries of Pittsburgh and Youngstown. It routinely paid dividends of 100 percent of market value for nearly 30 years {{at the start of the}} 20th century. By November 1926, $50 par value MCR stock was trading at $805 a share. When stock did come on the <b>market,</b> <b>wide</b> swings in price occurred. It was trading at $1,000 a share in March 1927, and remained at that level until August 1927. The New York Times called MCR [...] "the outstanding 'blue chip' of the stock market". It continued to be only rarely traded in the 1930s and early 1940s, with the Times declaring it a [...] "stranger to the ticker tape of the New York Stock Exchange" [...] in 1942 and subject to only [...] "infrequent transactions" [...] in 1944. Even as late as 1951, the stock was [...] "infrequently traded".|$|E

Two dimensions of sentiment are examined: stock specific sentiment and <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> sentiment. Using panel regression with firm fixed effects, we show that stock specific sentiment strongly and positively affects stock returns after controlling for firm characteristics. Overall, {{there is a positive}} relationship between <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> sentiment and returns but the relationship does not hold at the country level. For individual countries, we detect substantial country-to-country variations in the influence of <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> sentiment on returns. The evidence also suggests that stock specific sentiment may have a greater influence on returns than market specific sentiment. Furthermore, the effect of investor sentiment on stock returns in emerging Asian markets generally persists after accounting for macroeconomic factors...|$|E

Consistent with empirical evidence, the model predicts a positive relation between <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> stock returns observed prior to the IPO date and the mean initial return, and a positive relation between the mean and the volatility of initial returns.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to consider whether <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> herding occurs intraday. Design/methodology/approach – Using the 1995 Christie and Huang and the 2000 Chang et al. models, the paper tests whether <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> and industry sector herding occurs intraday in the Australian equities market. Findings – Neither <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> nor industry sector herding occurs intraday. Research limitations/implications – Both herding measures focus on one specific type of herding, herding evidenced by changes in the cross-sectional return distribution. Therefore the herding measures are ill suited to capture the effects of period specific abnormally high or low market returns and they can also capture herding of market participants or groups of market participants only in as far as it manifests itself in security specific returns. Originality/value – No previous studies have considered the possibility of intraday herding in equities markets. Even if there is little evidence of herding over longer time periods, market frictions and inefficiencies continue to be exploited at least anecdotally by traders with very short time horizons to the detriment of longer term investors.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{incorporate}} a <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> {{buying and selling}} pressure cost component into a spread decomposition model as spread cost component. Design/methodology/approach – The paper extends a commonly used trade indicator spread decomposition model to include a component common to all stocks of a specialist firm and a <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> component common to all stocks. Findings – Strong evidence is found that specialists consider this common factor cost component when they set bid and ask quotes. Some specialist firms also take {{the next logical step}} and specifically manage their firm wide stock inventories. The common factor is in percentage terms largest for securities with the highest trade frequencies. Research limitations/implications – The relative importance of the common factor spread component decreases as the pricing grid becomes finer, but remains highly significant under the decimal trading regime. Originality/value – This is the first study to document not-security-specific spread cost components that are common to all stocks for which a specialist firm makes markets and to all stocks in the market. Using the model it is shown that <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> uncertainty translates into spreads of individual securities. Bid offer spreads, Financial markets, Securities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} the explained {{part of the}} CDS spread {{changes of}} 31 listed euro area banks according to various risk drivers. The choice of the credit risk drivers is inspired by the Merton (1974) model. Individual CDS liquidity and other market and business variables are identified to complement the Merton model and are shown {{to play an important}} role in explaining credit spread changes. Our decomposition reveals, however, highly changing dynamics in the credit, liquidity, and business cycle and <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> components. This result is important since supervisors and monetary policy makers extract different signals from liquidity based CDS spread changes than from business cycle or credit risk based changes. For the recent financial crisis, we confirm that the steeply rising CDS spreads are due to increased credit risk. However, individual CDS liquidity and <b>market</b> <b>wide</b> liquidity premia played a dominant role. In the period before the start of the crisis, our model and its decomposition suggest that credit risk was not correctly priced, a finding which was correctly observed by e. g. the International Monetary Fun...|$|E
