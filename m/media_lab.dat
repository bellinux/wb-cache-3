5|$|On June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg {{launched}} the NYC <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is {{a consortium of}} Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford. A $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation was used to establish the NYC <b>Media</b> <b>Lab.</b> Each year, the lab will host a range of roundtable discussions between {{the private sector and}} academic institutions. It will support research projects on topics of content format, next-generation search technologies, computer animation for film and gaming, emerging marketing techniques, and new devices development. The lab will also create a media research and development database. Columbia University will coordinate the long-term direction of the <b>media</b> <b>lab</b> as well as the involvement of its faculty and those of other universities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of humanities, arts, and social sciences, MIT economists have been awarded five Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals. Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle {{authored}} seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology. The MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab,</b> founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research, has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.|$|E

5|$|In December 2012, Twitter and Nielsen {{entered a}} multi-year {{agreement}} to produce social TV ratings, which {{are expected to}} be commercially available for the fall 2013 season as the Nielsen Twitter TV Rating. Advertising Age said Twitter had become the new TV Guide. Then in February 2013, Twitter acquired Bluefin Labs for an estimated US$50 million to $100 million. Founded in 2008 at the MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab,</b> Bluefin is a data miner whose analysis tells which brands (e.g., TV shows and companies) are chatted about the most in social media. MIT Technology Review said that Bluefin gives Twitter part of the US$72 billion television advertising market.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the <b>media</b> <b>lab</b> and a hallway with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{has kept}} pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In {{addition}} to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote {{some of the earliest}} interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture. Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee; the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E
25|$|In Fall 2016, the Shed {{also started}} a citywide dance program about social justice issues.

25|$|The Wiesner {{building}} (Building E15) {{houses the}} MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> and the List Visual Arts Center and is {{named in honor}} of former MIT president Jerome Wiesner and his wife Laya. The building is very box-like, a motif that is consistently repeated in both the interior and exterior design evoking a sense of boxes packed within each other.|$|E
25|$|Harple {{has also}} collaborated on several MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> courses and workshops, such as Beyond Smart Cities (2013), Changing Cities: How to Prototype New Urban Systems (2014), and Measuring Urban Innovation. In 2013, Harple devised an {{innovation}} ecosystem stakeholder model called the Pentahelix (Pentalytics), to describe innovative flow in ecosystems, {{which was used}} to develop the Innovation Dynamics platform called Innovation Scope.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> {{experimented with}} {{silkworms}} {{to see what}} they would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures. They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the worms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving directly onto the given shape. Using this knowledge they built a silk pavilion with 6,500 silkworms over a number of days.|$|E

As designed, it is similar to Twitter, but has no advertising, instead relying on user and developer subscriptions. Mixed <b>Media</b> <b>Labs</b> began directly crowd funding, with a goal of $500,000 and about 10,000 backers.|$|R

25|$|In 2000, Negroponte {{stepped down}} as {{director}} of the <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> as Walter Bender took over as Executive Director. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory Chairman. When Frank Moss was appointed director of the lab in 2006, Negroponte {{stepped down as}} lab chairman to focus more fully on his work with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) although he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.|$|E
25|$|In November 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis, Negroponte {{unveiled}} {{the concept of}} a $100 laptop computer, The Children's Machine, designed for students in the developing world. The price has increased to US$180, however. The project is part of a broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit organisation started by Negroponte and other <b>Media</b> <b>Lab</b> faculty, to extend Internet access in developing countries.|$|E
