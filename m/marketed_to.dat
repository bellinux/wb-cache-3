5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships.

This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was <b>marketed</b> <b>to</b> foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E

5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully <b>marketed</b> <b>to</b> Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E
5|$|The American River Division {{is located}} in north-central California, {{on the east side}} of the Great Central Valley. Its {{structures}} use the water of the American River, which drains off the Sierra Nevada and flows into the Sacramento River.

The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed, to both provide water supply for local settlements, and supply it to the rest of the system. The dams also are an important flood control measure. Hydroelectricity is generated at Folsom and Nimbus dams, and <b>marketed</b> <b>to</b> the Western Area Power Administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} was to rationalise the industry to cut costs, and the government offered incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces. At the time, the RAF were looking to replace the English Electric Canberra light bomber in the long-range interdictor role, and the Hawker Hunter in the close air support role, while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet air defence role from the de Havilland Sea Vixen. BAC, through its English Electric subsidiary, had begun developing a new high-performance strike aircraft, the TSR-2, which was intended for long-range, low-level strike missions with conventional and tactical nuclear weapons, as well as tactical reconnaissance. Hawker Siddeley was also developing a new aircraft, based on its P.1127 V/STOL demonstrator. The P.1154 was proposed as a supersonic version that could be <b>marketed</b> <b>to</b> both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles: close air support, air superiority and fleet air defence.|$|E
