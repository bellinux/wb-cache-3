50|$|Margarita <b>Marbler</b> (born July 16, 1975) is {{a retired}} Austrian {{freestyle}} moguls skier, originally from Russia. She's been included in three Winter Olympic Games; at Salt Lake City, Turin and Vancouver. She has competed in both the Moguls and Dual Moguls event, {{as well as the}} Acrobatics and Aerials events. <b>Marbler</b> uses Elan skis, Dalbello Boots and Exel ski poles.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} coaches for the mogul skiers on the US Ski Team, but in April 2012 an article {{reported}} that Cota works primarily {{with only one}} of these US Ski Team coaches: [...] "Cota works pretty much with one coach, Austrian, Harald Marbler." [...] <b>Marbler</b> is the husband and former coach of Austrian mogul skier, Margarita <b>Marbler,</b> a three-time Olympian who has won seven World Cups.|$|E
50|$|Places {{named after}} the stone include Marblehead, Massachusetts; Marblehead, Ohio; <b>Marble</b> Arch, London; the Sea of Marmara; India's <b>Marble</b> Rocks; and the towns of <b>Marble,</b> Minnesota; <b>Marble,</b> Colorado; <b>Marble</b> Falls, Texas, and <b>Marble</b> Hill, Manhattan, New York. The Elgin <b>Marbles</b> are <b>marble</b> sculptures from the Parthenon that are {{on display in the}} British Museum. They were brought to Britain by the Earl of Elgin.|$|R
5000|$|In India, {{there are}} many games with <b>marbles.</b> One simple game with <b>marbles</b> is called [...] "Cara" [...] in which every player puts one or more <b>marbles</b> {{in a long line}} of <b>marbles</b> with each <b>marble</b> being one {{centimeter}} or slightly more, apart from each other. After this, each player throws another <b>marble</b> as far as possible from the line, perpendicularly. In this game, the player whose <b>marble</b> is farthest from the line of <b>marbles</b> gets the first chance to hit the <b>marble's</b> line and subsequent players who get to hit the line have their distance from the line in decreasing order. Any player who hits and displaces a <b>marble</b> in the line of <b>marbles</b> gets to take that and all <b>marbles</b> to the right of it. Usually, <b>marbles</b> in the line are smaller <b>marbles</b> and the players have bigger <b>marbles</b> for hitting the line of smaller marbles.This game needs the playground to be flat and hard and with no loose soil for effecting games of [...] "Cara". The distances of the <b>marbles</b> thrown determine order of players who get to hit the line are anywhere from 10 to 30 meters and may depend on player's desire to hit the <b>marble</b> line first and how much risk they will take so that they would be at some distance and yet be able to hit the line of <b>marbles</b> and get more than 2 <b>marbles.</b> Players have to roll their <b>marbles</b> from a distance to hit the line of <b>marbles.</b> Each player gets to hit the line of <b>marbles</b> only once assuming there are <b>marbles</b> left in the line and every player gets a turn in a order. In a line of twenty <b>marbles,</b> its reasonable to get at least 5 to 20 <b>marbles</b> depending on how skillful somebody is at hitting the line of <b>marbles.</b> When all <b>marbles</b> are taken by players as above the game is restarted with players putting their <b>marbles</b> in the line and trying to win as many <b>marbles</b> as possible.If some <b>marbles</b> are left in the line after each player takes a chance, the players again throw their <b>marbles</b> perpendicularly to this line and start to roll their <b>marble</b> to hit the line according to the above rules. This process is repeated until all <b>marbles</b> are taken in the game.|$|R
50|$|Most of Pickens County's early {{industry}} {{revolved around}} the <b>marble</b> industry. Georgia <b>Marble</b> Company is located in <b>Marble</b> Hill near Tate. The Tate Elementary school is built out of <b>marble.</b> The <b>marble</b> was also {{used to make the}} statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial. Most of the <b>marble</b> is white, but there is also very rare pink <b>marble.</b> It {{is one of the few}} places in the world where pink <b>marble</b> is found. The <b>marble</b> is also used for tombstones for the United States Military.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marbler</b> {{has made}} it to the Winter Olympics three times, all in the Moguls event. She made her Olympic debut in 2002 at the Salt Lake City Olympics. She {{ultimately}} finished in tenth place there. <b>Marbler</b> could not improve on her tenth place finish four years later in Turin, placing seventeenth. She was able to improve on her Salt Lake City result with her Olympic best result, finishing eighth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marbler</b> {{made her}} debut at the International Youth Championship event on March 6, 1994 in Laajavuori, Finland {{in both the}} Aerials and Moguls event.

50|$|Evidently, he {{was buried}} at St Mary of Graces, as a {{contract}} was entered into for Henry Lakenham, a London <b>marbler,</b> to construct his tomb there. This included a military effigy in freestone, resting on a table tomb comprising a marble plinth, a chest of marble ashlar with eight brass shields and a ledger slab with inscription. The monument was still in place in 1533 but presumably destroyed along with the abbey buildings after its dissolution in 1538. A large-scale excavation of {{the site of the}} abbey took place in 1983-8. An analysis of the archaeological and documentary evidence uncovered has been published by the Museum of London.|$|E
50|$|The American {{yellow and}} {{mangrove}} (including golden) warblers differ {{in some other}} reproductive parameters. While the former is somewhat more of an r-strategist, the actual differences are complex and adapted to different environmental conditions. The yellow warbler starts breeding in May/June, while the mangrove warbler can be found breeding all year round. American yellow warblers {{have been known to}} raise a brood of young in as little as 45 days, but usually take about 75 days. The tropical populations, by contrast, need more than 100 days per breeding. Males court the females with songs; an American yellow warbler has been observed to sing more than 3,200 songs in one day. They are, like most songbirds, generally serially monogamous; some 10% of mangrove warbler and about half as many American yellow <b>marbler</b> males are bigamous. Very few if any American yellow warblers breed more than once per year; around one in twenty mangrove warbler females will do so however. If a breeding attempt fails, either will usually try and raise a second brood successfully though.|$|E

5000|$|The Seville {{city council}} made purely {{aesthetic}} {{works in the}} Puerta de Jerez and in the Puerta de la Macarena, for which sent {{a report to the}} king in 1561, which responded satisfactorily, insisting in the general tidying of the same and of its surroundings So that year Pedro Hernández, overseer of the work of the Puerta de Jerez received from Pedro Milanés, a <b>marbler,</b> a stone for the Puerta de la Macarena, which cost 28 ducados. It was also amended the gate in 1630, when was installed a headstone on an ordinance intended to the gatekeepers, so not engaged in their duties out of it; the slab, which is preserved today embedded in the wall of the arch, says: [...] "By provision of the King our lord of 20 September 1630 it banned to the guards not stay off the roads nor any other place to fulfill its obligation or move out of his gate, whose surveillance is subject to mister assistant, being delegated Mr. D. Diego de Ulloa. 1630". Shortly after, during the outbreak of plague that ravaged the city in 1646, six cemeteries were created in which to bury so many dead, settling one of them outside the gate. The gate must be then an object more of the popular culture of the city, as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} playwright Juan Pérez de Montalbán (1602-1638) wrote in the 17th century a comedy in two parts titled La puerta Macarena, displayed in the Corral de la Cruz of Madrid in 1717, and has as inspiration this gate.|$|E
40|$|Guthrie, EmilyPaper {{marbling}} {{looks like}} magic. A <b>marbler</b> uses a brush to sprinkle pigments that float on a heavy solution. After manipulating the colors into a design with combs, the <b>marbler</b> sets {{a paper on}} top of the bath. The pattern reveals itself as the paper is pulled away. This process was shrouded in a level of mystery until the nineteenth century, when manuals and articles in periodicals began to explain marbling methods. A wave of new interest in the craft began in the 1880 s, when authors no longer just broadly claimed to reveal secrets, but provided detailed guidance in conjunction with commercially prepared materials and tools. Hungarian-born <b>marbler</b> and marbling supplier Josef Halfer offered specific, thorough advice in his manual The Progress of the Marbling Art, along with carefully formulated products for sale. Halfer’s approach to supplying scientific precision, adapted to marbling distributors, teachers, and curious audiences in the United States, presented a special kind of demystification for professional bookbinders and novice marblers alike. Through contexts of bookbinding, manuals and lessons, technologies, and alternatives to hand-marbled paper, this study examines how specific instructions mediated a new, more clearly defined relationship between marblers and their materials.

40|$|A {{computer}} system for interactively creating marbling textures {{is built on}} the physical model of the traditional marbling process. The approach generates marbling designs {{as the result of}} color advection in the 2 D flow fields obtained by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations on the GPU with a multigrid solver. Marbling is a traditional art that {{people all over the world}} have loved for centuries. Started in either Turkey or Persia in the 12 th century for decorative purposes, the craft migrated to Europe in the 16 th century, where it became an essential part of bookbinding. Marbled papers ’ intricate patterns decorate the inside covers of fine books; cover the folds, strings, and glue marks of the bindings; and serve as an aesthetic transition from the dark leather covers to the white pages inside. Used as book edges, they prevent erasure and forgery; any pages removed from the book would interrupt patterns. Today, more practitioners of this beautiful art exist than ever before in history—we can see marbling designs on picture frames, note cards, collages, origamis, lampshades, and many other items in our daily lives. The marbling process is characterized by the manipulation of floating pigment, and the transfer of the resulting design onto paper or some other material. It’s not as trivial a task as it seems. With traditional marbling, the design process and the resulting design quality are largely constrained by various physical conditions— such as pigment floatability, liquid viscosity, or even environmental humidity. The resulting designs aren’t directly useable for seamless tiling and the design size is constrained by the size of the trays used to hold the liquid. If the resulting design is not satisfactory, a <b>marbler</b> has to skim all the liquid from the tray and restart the designing process from scratch. This article therefore provides an exploration into the marbling process and shows how we can algorithmically simulate this traditional art. We then present an interactive {{computer system}} for creating various marbling textures...|$|E
