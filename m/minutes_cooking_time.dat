40|$|A {{preliminary}} test {{was conducted to}} investigate the characteristics of linerboard and corrugated medium paper made from durian rind waste. Naturally dried durian rinds were pulped according to Soda-Anthraquinone (Soda-AQ) pulping process with a condition of 20 % active alkali, 0. 1 % AQ, 7 : 1 liquor to material ratio, 120 <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and 170 °C cooking temperature. The linerboard and corrugated medium paper with a basis weight of 120 gsm were prepared and evaluated according to Malaysian International Organization for Standardization (MS ISO) and Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI). The {{results indicate that the}} characteristics of durian rind linerboard are comparable with other wood or non-wood based paper and current commercial paper. However, low CMT value for corrugated medium and water absorptiveness quality for linerboard could be improved in future. Based on the bulk density (0. 672 g/cm 3), burst index (3. 12 kPa. m 2 /g) and RCT (2. 00 N. m 2 /g), the durian rind has shown a good potential and suitable as an alternative raw material source for linerboard industry...|$|E
40|$|Lentils, {{one of the}} cool-season pulses, are {{consumed}} as a staple food in most developing countries. The demand for pulses in western societies is increasing because of its valuable nutritional quality and an increased awareness of health issues. Australia has a good reputation for producing clean low moisture legume products and could increase as market share of lentil production by identifying, developing and promoting good quality varieties. Lentils which are graded as good quality varieties must have a short and uniform cooking time, without 'hard to cook' seed, have the hull stay attached to the seed during cooking, and have a final acceptable taste, texture, flavour and appearance after cooking (Bhatty 1990). Cooking quality {{in this study is}} defined as the maximum force (N) that is required to compress the whole seed cooked product after cooking for a standard period of time. This study aims to develop an objective measurement to determine the cooking quality of lentils and thereby evaluates the relationships between lentil cooking quality and some of its physical and biochemical properties. Four cultivars used (Cassab, Digger, ILL 7180 and Matilda) were grown during 1999 at Mullewa and Pingaring, Western Australia. The relationship between the cooking quality of lentil and water absorption, seed size, seed coat thickness, phytic acid, mineral composition and initial moisture content was investigated. Texture measurement was carried out using the TA. XT 2 i meter {{as an alternative to the}} subjective method "Cooking time test". By comparing the cooking time determined by 'Cooking time test, 220 N was established and suggested as an optimal peak compression force to determine the adequate cooking time for lentils. Both methods showed that 35 <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> was adequate for red lentils (Cassab, Digger, and ILL 7180), and 45 minutes for green lentils ++(Matilda). Cooking significantly reduced the hardness of the seeds (R= - 0. 752 to - 0. 89) and promoted mineral leaching (P < 0. 05). The interaction between environment and genotype had a significant effect on seed size, seed coat thickness, mineral composition (Phytic acid, Ne, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + M+, Fe 2 + and CU 2 +) and hardness (P< 0. 05). Seed coat thickness did not correlated with this rate of water uptake and cooking quality. Growing environments had a greater influence on the cooking quality than genotypes. Lentils grown at Pingaring are generally had a higher in Phyti acid content, better mineral retention and were harder in texture than those grown at Mullewa. The results of this study implicated that the peak compression force (220 N) was identified as an indicator to determine the cooking time of lentil cultivars. Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) is a useful method to evaluate various texture characteristics (hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness, springiness, gumminess and adhesiveness) of lentil cultivars. Cooking quality of lentil is significantly affected by the effect of varieties and growing locations. However, not the various biochemical compositions (phytic acid and minerals) and the thickness of seed coat have no significant effect on the cooking quality of lentil...|$|E

40|$|Sudan {{is almost}} entirely {{depending}} on imports to satisfy its needs of pulp and paper. Out of the total paper consumption (92 %) only 8 % is locally produced. The {{pulp and paper industry}} is looking for unconventional fibrous raw materials for producing different kind of papers and boards. Sudan is endowed with both wood and nonwood lignocellulosic raw materials, all of them are available at the moment due {{to the end of the}} civil war in the South, especially the softwood forests. There must also be a sufficient supply of good quality raw material for running the process throughout the year. It has been shown that nonwood fibrous materials have high biomass production capacity and the pulp yields obtained have in most cases been higher than those from wood species. Nonwood fibres are an important source of raw materials, especially in developing countries. They can be by-product of agriculture such as bagasse and cereal straws, or industrial crops like bamboo, esparto, sisal, flax and hemp. Two bamboo species, Oxytenanthera abyssinica and Bambusa vulgaris together with an industrial by-product, namely bagasse, have been investigated for their potential for producing pulp and paper. The density (for bamboos), fibre dimensions, morphological indices and chemical composition of the raw materials studied were determined. The kraft, kraft-AQ, soda, soda-AQ, AS-AQ and ASAM pulping processes were applied and some of the pulps produced were bleached according to the TCF bleaching methods. The trials to improve the pulp properties included blending of bamboo and bagasse pulps. The average basic density of the two bamboo species was in the range of tropical hardwood of 150 - 1150 kg/m 3 and in the middle for commercial pulpwoods (350 - 650 kg/m 3). The fibre dimensions were microscopically evaluated. The average fibre length of Oxytenanthera abyssinica (1. 5 mm), Bambusa vulgaris (2. 1 mm) and bagasse (1. 7 mm) were in the range of softwood and bamboo (1 - 7 mm). The fibre length of bambusa is considered as long, but that of oxytenanthera is medium-long. The fibre width of the two bamboo species was nearly the same, medium-narrow and of hardwood range (10 - XI 35 μm). According to flexibility coefficients oxytenanthera have higher bonding strength (tensile, burst, double folds). The thicker wall of bambusa (4. 6 μm) compared to that of oxytenanthera (3. 7 μm) indicated a very different morphological indices and behaviour. The narrow fibres of bagasse (8. 4 μm) had wide lumens (5. 2 μm) and thin cell wall thickness (1. 6 μm). Their good flexibility coefficient (62) indicate their ability to collapse easily and to form interfiber bonding important for paper strength. The chemical composition of the raw materials was typical for non-woody plants. They have high ash content, especially silica and low lignin contents. The very good cellulose content of bagasse (54. 8 %) predicted very good to excellent pulp yield. The higher cellulose content (56. 6 %) of oxytenanthera predicted better yields than from bambusa. The overall chemical composition indicates the suitability of alkaline methods for pulping with reasonable alkali charges and predicted good to excellent yields. This was demonstrated by cookings with different alkali charges. Bagasse was pulped easily with alkali charge of 10. 9 - 12. 4 % as Na 2 O for 155 - 160 <b>minutes</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> at maximum temperature of 170 oC to bleachable kappa number. Bamboo cooking was carried out with alkali charges of 17 - 18. 6 % as Na 2 O for 165 minutes at 170 oC The bagasse alkaline sulphite-anthraquinone pulping gave a very high screened yield (57 %) of a bleachable pulp with a very low kappa number, high viscosity, and high initial ISO brightness. The bagasse soda–AQ cooking gave excellent yield of nearly 58 %. The kraft pulp of bamboo was superior to soda and soda-AQ pulps in all strength properties except for the tensile index of bambusa soda-AQ pulp. Addition of anthraquinone in the kraft pulping of bamboo increased the yield and improved the strength properties. The best bamboo cooking results were obtained with the ASAM process, which gave higher pulp yield and superior optical and strength properties than the kraft process. Higher yield, lower kappa numbers, superior viscosity and brightness were obtained at high pulp strength level for the both bamboo species. XII Oxytenanthera AS-AQ pulp was blended with the strongly bonding bagasse AS-AQ pulp in three ratios (10 : 90, 30 : 70, 50 : 50). With all blending ratios the tensile strength of oxy/bag pulp blends was improved, and the values were more or less the same as for 100 % bagasse pulp. On the other hand, the tear index of the blends was improved compared to that of 100 % bagasse pulp, and 50 : 50 blends were with the highest tear strength. TCF bleaching with Q 1 O/PQ 2 P sequence was applied for bagasse soda, soda-AQ and AS-AQ pulps. The bleached pulps reached a final ISO brightness of 71. 6, 74. 1 and 76. 9 % respectively at a kappa number of 1. 6 – 3. 9 and viscosity in the range of 790 - 990 ml/g. The oxytenanthera pulps Kraft and ASAM were bleached with OQ 1 O/PP sequence. Good bleachability for the oxytenanthera pulps was comparatively difficult to attain as it required additional chemical charges due to the high lignin content of the unbleached pulps. The kappa numbers of the kraft and ASAM pulps were reduced from 24. 8 to 6. 6 and from 19. 4 to 8. 0 respectively. The ISO brightness obtained was about 82 % for the both pulps. The viscosity loss for both pulp types and especially for the ASAM pulps was small (from 1024 to 885 g/ml and 1114 to 1054 g/ml respectively). The addition of DTPA at the chelation stages (Q) improved the delignification selectivity, resulting in an increased ISO brightness in both cases. In the final peroxide stage the addition of DTPMPA (0. 05 %) and MgSO 4 had been proved beneficial for successful peroxide bleaching. All raw materials chosen were well suited for obtaining pulp with acceptable to excellent yield with the most suitable pulping process tried, according to their individual characteristics. They could develop into predominant fibre resources for good quality pulps for use in printing and writing paper...|$|E

The five most important sensory attributes were sweet odour, sweet taste, juiciness, hardness and crispness. All sensory descriptors underwent a similar decrease in intensity during cooking {{for up to}} 15 min. Hardness and crispness were highly correlated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed differences between the experimental samples. The first principal component explained 99 % {{of the total variance}} and was related to the <b>cooking</b> <b>time.</b> The second principal component pointed at differences between the carrot batches, for example, carrots grown on a sandy soil (3 - 4 % organic matter) and kept over winter on a straw covered field, were less sweet, but more juicy, crisp and hard than carrots of the same cultivar grown on a soil with a higher humus content (8 % organic matter) and kept in a cool store. Soluble solids content (SSC), dry matter (DM), tensile strength (F-t) and compressive strength (F-c) also decreased with <b>cooking</b> <b>time.</b> SSC and DM decreased more or less linearly, while F, and F, showed an exponential decrease from one <b>minute</b> <b>cooking</b> onwards.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of outdoor cooking of meat, there is interest in determining the chemical and physical changes that occur during the charcoal broiling process. Of particular interest {{is the effect of}} these changes upon the quality of the broiled meat. Although broiling is not a new method of cooking meat, {{a review of the literature}} revealed few reports of scientific work on broiled meats. Some work has been done on the effect of different cooking methods on weight losses, tenderness, palatability, thiamine, protein content, but no reports were found relating surface temperature and <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> to rate of heat transfer and to final internal temperature. Little research has been done in this area because there has been no means available for measuring surface temperature during broiling. The investigation and results reported in this study were made possible by the development of an experimental model of a coil type thermometer, developed by the Taylor Instrument Company, and an Electronic Universal Nine Point Strip Chart Recorder were used to record temperatures in this study. The thermometer determined the surface temperature of the grill and thermocouples attached to the meat and connected tot he recorder determined the top, internal, and bottom temperatures of the samples.

40|$|Most of {{the rice}} {{produced}} in Portugal {{is of the}} Carolino type, botanically classified as Oryza sativa ssp. Japonica. Nowadays, this rice is playing {{a vital role in}} Portuguese rice trading. Five types of Carolino rice were collected and analysed for biometry characteristics, <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> water absorption, and texture properties. The Carolino rices studued are commercially classified as long grains type-A, because they present a length higher than 6 mm and the ratio length/width lower than 3 mm. This type of rice showed a high level of plastered area, meaning low vitrea aspect, with a negative strong correlation (r 2 =- 0. 99), and it was observed a great discrepancy for the study cultivars. The <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> varied from 17 to 22 minutes, with a water uptake between 143. 9 and 182. 5 g after achieving the cooking point. To compare the differences between the cultivars, the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> was also determined after 13 <b>minutes</b> of <b>cooking,</b> and the results showed that the water absorption veried from 101. 9 to 139. 6 g. Carolino rice flours were quite different considering the results of TPA (texture profile analysis). One of the samples was quite different from the others, presenting less adhesiveness, chewiness, gumminess, hardness, resilience and cohesiveness. The extrusion force (kg/cm 2) was similar between the five cultivars. In general, it could be concluded that in spite of the samples belonging to the same species, the different cultivars showed quite different biometric, cooking and texture characteristics...|$|R

Thanks to the initiative of the Manivovo Rural Training Centre, several precious varieties, thought to have been lost, have been restored. While everyone in Melanesia eats bananas and plantains, the Makirans rely on the crop {{to such an extent that}} neighbouring islanders teasingly call them huki after their favourite food. Makira has very few roads, so the first collecting expedition was made by motorised canoe. Villages with radio access were invited to donate their ancestral banana suckers to the collections. Local students were asked to bring 10 suckers each from their villages to the training centre, one of three collection points {{on the island}}. They documented the names and provenances of all varieties after being given training in the use of scientific descriptors. The students are paid a small fee for each variety they describe. So far, 55 out of 108 varieties have been characterised, using local names such as three heads and eight heads (referring to multi-headed bunches) or 5 <b>minutes</b> (referring to <b>cooking</b> <b>time).</b> The initiative was launched with support from the Kastom Garden Project in the Solomon Islands and the Seed Savers Network in Australia.

40|$|ABSTRACTFour cowpea {{varieties}} (Brown beans, Oloka beans, IAR 48 and IT 89 KD- 288) were toasted at 105 °C, {{and used}} to study the effect of dry heat treatment on the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and nutrient composition of cowpea seeds and also {{its effect on the}} functional properties of resultant flour of the cowpea seed varieties. Toasting reduced the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> for brown and oloka cowpea varieties from 55. 00 – 31. 00 and 70. 67 – 51. 67 min, respectively. The <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> for IAR 48 and IT 89 KD- 288 cowpea varieties increased from 104. 67 to 106. 00 and 88. 00 to 88. 67 min, respectively. The results indicate that the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of cowpea seeds can be reduced significantly on toasting, while maintaining their potential as functional agents in the food industry for nutrition and utilisation. Correlation between the amount of water imbibed by cowpea seeds and their <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> was - 0. 74, but was not significant at p≤ 0. 05, suggesting that there is no significant relationship between the amount of water imbibed by cowpea seeds and their <b>cooking</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to study the genetic variability and the interaction between genotypes and environments for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and protein content of bean grains {{as well as to}} identify elite lines of Carioca grain type with short <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> high protein content and high adaptability and stability for these two traits. Sixteen experiments were conducted in a complete randomized block design with three replications during the rainy, dry and winter seasons, in Goiás, Distrito Federal, Pernambuco, Sergipe, Bahia and Paraná States, in 2009 and 2010. Each trial was composed by 16 elite lines of Carioca grain type and the data of <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and protein content were obtained. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and to stability and adaptability analysis, according to the methodology proposed by Annichiarico. Genetic variability was found for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and for protein content among Carioca common bean elite lines; however, for protein content this variability is lower. The environmental effect is important for the expression of these traits and is larger than the genetic effect. The interaction between genotypes and environments is important for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and for protein content of common beans. The lines CNFC 11951 and CNFC 11962 presents short <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> high protein content and high stability and adaptability for both traits...|$|R
50|$|The higher {{temperature}} causes food to cook faster; <b>cooking</b> <b>times</b> can typically {{be reduced}} to one-third of the <b>time</b> for conventional <b>cooking</b> methods. The actual <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> also depends on the pressure release method used after timing (see Pressure release methods for details) and the thickness and density of the food, since thicker (and denser) foods take longer to cook. Meat joints and some other foods like sponge puddings and Christmas puddings are typically timed according to their weight.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} SUA to evaluate 30 bean lines along with 2 checks for <b>cooking</b> <b>time.</b> In this experiment,two different methods (Matson and Bags method) were compared. After being harvested the lines were stored for threemonths followed by screening for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and descriptive sensory evaluation. The data obtained were subjected toanalysis of variance (ANOVA) and New Duncan Multiple Range Test (NDMRT) using MSTAT-C software. Descriptivesensory evaluation data were subjected to K – means cluster analysis using SPSS software. Correlation coefficients (r) between <b>cooking</b> <b>time,</b> seed characteristics and sensory evaluation determined. Results of this work showed significantdifferences among bean lines in seed size and hydration capacity. Bean lines EG 10 R 51, EG 10 R 25, EG 21 R 35, EG 21 R 31,EG 10 R 11, EG 10 R 28, EG 21 R 34, EG 21 R 5 and EG 21 K 7 absorbed more than 1000 g of water per kilogram of seed, thustermed as of good hydration capacity. There {{was a significant difference}} in <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> among bean lines tested andbetween the two cooking methods. In Bags method, the range of <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> was from 24 to 53 minutes while in Matsonmethod the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> ranged from 29 to 83 minutes. Among them, EG 10 R 51, EG 21 R 5, EG 10 K 4, EG 10 R 11, EG 10 R 28,EG 21 R 30, EG 10 R 44, EG 21 R 31 and EG 21 K 5 had significantly longer <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> in Bags method than in Matson cookerwhile lines EG 21 K 5, EG 21 R 36, and EG 10 K 6 recoded significantly longer <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> in Matson device compared to Bagsmethod.

40|$|Influence of Variety, Storage Time and Natron Percentage on the <b>Cooking</b> <b>Time</b> of Cowpea Vigna unguiculata Seed. The {{present study}} is {{focussed}} {{on the influence of}} the variety, the time of storage and the natron percentage on the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of cowpea seed. Firstly, a physicochemical analysis has been made on the four retained varieties. Then a test of cooking to the water of these different varieties has been achieved. Of the gotten results, it comes out again that the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> depends on the varieties. Among the used varieties, the KVX 30 - 309 - 6 G cooks 30 minutes after boiling point, while the TN 27 - 80 requires a maximum time of 40 minutes. This study also shows that the time of storage influences the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of the seeds. The oldest seeds cook less quickly and also present an index swelling more important. Finally this work shows that the use of the natron decreases the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> of the dry beans. However, a dose critical of natron beyond which all increase of the natron is without effect on the <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> exists. On the nutritional plan one observes that the use of the natron in the water of cooking brings mineral elements notably of the Na+ ions that can have a damaging effect on health when the dose is high...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION - <b>Cooking</b> <b>time</b> and {{sensory quality}} are two {{important}} traits when selecting dry beans for consumption, but {{have largely been}} overlooked by breeders in favor of yield and other traits. Dry beans are an affordable, nutrient-rich food, but often require long <b>cooking</b> <b>times,</b> particularly without prior soaking. They also display a range of sensory characteristics, with consumers preferring cooked beans that are sweet and soft 1. Increased interest in dry beans to make new products necessitates studies assessing the diversity of sensory traits in beans, which would allow beans to be selected for specific products. In this study, the Andean Diversity Panel 2 (ADP) was assessed for <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> and sensory characteristics {{in order to identify}} diversity for these traits. MATERIALS AND METHODS - <b>Cooking</b> <b>Time</b> Evaluation: 398 genotypes of the ADP were harvested in Hawassa, Ethiopia in 2015, six months prior to evaluation. Prior to cooking, each sample was soaked for 12 hours in 250 ml distilled water after ensuring moisture content was between 10 - 14 %. Two replicates per genotype of 25 seeds each were cooked in random order in boiling distilled water using the Mattson cooker method for determining <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> 3. The Mattson cooker uses twentyfive 85 g stainless steel rods with 2 mm diameter pins that pierce beans loaded in wells when sufficiently cooked. For this study, the 50 % and 80 % <b>cooking</b> <b>times</b> were recorded, and the 80 % cook time is regarded as the time required to cook each genotype to completion. The <b>cooking</b> <b>time</b> data was analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with genotype as a fixed effect and rep as a random effect...|$|R
