50|$|When the cow elects {{to enter}} the milking unit (due to highly {{palatable}} feed that she finds in the milking box), a cow ID sensor reads an identification tag (transponder) on the cow and passes the cow ID to the control system. If the cow has been milked too recently, the automatic gate system sends the cow out of the unit. If the cow may be milked, automatic teat cleaning, <b>milking</b> <b>cup</b> application, milking, and teatspraying takes place. As an incentive to attend the milking unit, concentrated feedstuffs needs to be fed to the cow in the milking unit.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of milking cups to cow teats {{has been identified}} as a significant component of net manual labour on the commercial dairy farm. Several automatic milking systems (AMS) are available commercially, however such commercial AMS have low capacity (typically 7. 5 cows/unit/hr) and speed of teat detection and rmlking cup application is relatively low. Attempts to introduce commercial AMS into pasture-grazing systems have been unsuccessful as maximising milking efficiency in pasture-grazed herds involves optimizing throughput of cows during the milking session. This design project investgated the use of a commercial robot arm for high-speed <b>milking</b> <b>cup</b> application. Operating requirements and workspace parameters were determined horn field observation of cows in a milking parlour. An end-effector capable of handling four milking cups simultaneously was developed and interfaced with a 6 -axis robot arm to form a robotic <b>milking</b> <b>cup</b> application mechanism The end-effector profile is sufficiently compact to allow access between the rear legs of the cow while enabhg full access to all four teats for {{application of}} milking cups. A control system was designed and implemented for the applicator and basic testing was performed to validate operation. Test results indicate that small changes in teat location (< 20 mm) may be tracked at a position update rate of approximately 200 ms...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{vision system}} {{was successful in}} identifying target artificial teats in various and demanding scenarios, but the system is very prone to making false identifications. A robotic manipulator capable of the simultaneous handling of four milking cups has been designed. The end-effector profile is sufficiently compact to allow access between the rear legs of the cow while enabling full access to all four teats for application of milking cups. The positioning response of the end-effecter is satisfactory for accommodating small changes in teat position during <b>milking</b> <b>cup</b> application. End of Project Repor...|$|E
