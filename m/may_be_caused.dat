5000|$|A 2005 {{review by}} the UK Health Protection Agency and a 2006 {{systematic}} review each evaluated the evidence for various medical, psychological, behavioral, and alternative treatments for EHS and each found that the evidence-base was limited and not generalizable, but that the best evidence favored cognitive behavioural therapy. [...] As of 2005, WHO recommended that people presenting with claims of EHS be evaluated {{to determine if they}} have a medical condition that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>causing</b> the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, that they have a psychological evaluation, and that the person's environment be evaluated for issues like air or noise pollution that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>causing</b> problems.|$|R
5|$|Toothache <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such {{as those}} involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast}} majority of toothache is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|Unusually low or high sodium {{levels in}} humans are {{recognized}} in medicine as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. These conditions <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by genetic factors, ageing, or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E

50|$|Though higher-end tape {{solutions}} {{have moved}} away from file and directory encryption to device-level encryption, the increase in cybercrime <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>causing</b> small to mid-size companies, {{as well as individual}} consumers, to increase the use of file and directory encryption.|$|R
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E
50|$|A working {{diagnosis}} {{is made from}} a neurological examination and evaluation. Parts of a complete examination include a physical examination, MRI, patient history, and electrophysiological and accelerometric studies. A diagnosis of solely intention tremor can only be made if the tremor is of low frequency (below 5 Hz) and without the presence of any resting tremors. Electrophysiological studies {{can be useful in}} determining frequency of the tremor, and accelerometric studies quantify tremor amplitude. MRI is used to locate damage to and degradation of the cerebellum that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>causing</b> the intention tremor. Focal lesions such as neoplasms, tumors, hemorrhages, demyelination, or other damage <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>causing</b> dysfunction of the cerebellum and correspondingly the intention tremor.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear {{that are associated with}} hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E

5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is emitting an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by a debris disk of dust orbiting {{at a distance of}} more than 31 astronomical units from it.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
