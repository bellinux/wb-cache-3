500|$|The book is 15,000 words {{long and}} was first {{published}} in January 2011 as an electronic book only, priced at USD$4. The Economist noted that the [...] "publishing model is fascinating in its own right". A hardback version, which Cowen dubbed [...] "the retrogression", was published in June 2011. Yglesias described the publication as an innovation in [...] "current affairs publishing" [...] and [...] "much shorter and cheaper than a conventional book in a way that actually leaves you wanting to read more once you finish it. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that this is the future of books." [...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|E
500|$|When Carter goes {{undercover}} in the episode, {{she wears}} a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a [...] "Veronica Lake look". Ottobre-Melton noted that [...] "We got to make Peggy into the classic femme fatale". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as [...] "a hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her. She has a few nice pieces in her closet that she scrimped and saved to buy. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> {{she knows how to}} unravel an old tired sweater to knit herself a new one." [...] The man in the green suit [...] "wore a suit that was a tricky balance," [...] explained Ottobre-Melton. [...] "The goal was to find a green that wasn't over the top, but still made a powerful statement. The suit I designed was inspired by a 1940s green double breasted suit I had located." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's opening {{scenes are}} not great filmmaking. They're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation, murky and heavy on theory. [...] <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> {{that much of}} the fascination with this film is {{inspired}} by the unveiling of facts, unclearly seen. There isn't a whole lot of plot– basically, just that Maya thinks she is right, and she is.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{confound}} it,' I cried, 'here's another fiend {{of a woman}} {{sending me}} another manuscript! They are always at it! Wants to get it into a high-class magazine, as usual.' And <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> correct.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the moment}} <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> a shrewd one. His Grace of Wessex is in there, and had I not locked that door {{he would have}} precipitated a climax, which had sent Queen Mary into a fever of jealous rage, and the Spanish {{ambassador}} and myself back to Spain to-morrow." ...|$|R

2500|$|Romney's {{campaign}} speeches sometimes {{contained a}} standard {{response to the}} religion issue as a whole: [...] "I believe in God. I believe in the family. I believe in America's future. It has a great role to preserve the peace on the planet. So the kinds of values I have are very much in line {{with those of the}} American people. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> as they get to know me better, there will be other faults that they find more troubling." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a Washington Post profile a {{few months}} after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been {{accomplished}} during his September meetings. He said, [...] "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." [...] Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, [...] "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the book's publication, {{legal counsel}} for Cruise made {{statements}} to the press regarding the author's research. [...] When an attorney for Tom Cruise read reports that Morton had obtained letters asserting Cruise had a homosexual affair while filming Eyes Wide Shut, he commented on a November 2005 letter he had written to Morton: [...] "I {{wrote a letter to}} Mr. Morton back in November and said he obviously was entitled to write the book but 'make sure you check your facts'. If he tries to use my letter to create the impression that Mr. Cruise did have a gay affair, we will certainly sue … because the story is false. Mr. Cruise is not gay." [...] In an interview with InTouch Weekly, Cruise's attorney Bertram Fields commented on the book: [...] "To the extent that Mr. Morton's book sticks to the truth, it can't 'ruin' or 'harm' Tom … <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> this book will be dull except for those parts that are lies." [...] Cruise's publicist also stated that the book will consist of fabricated lies.|$|E
5000|$|In recent days, I {{have learned}} the Ole timer, has a new vision to re-launch snow-shoeing, from the back woods where guides and moose hunters roam, to the golf courses and {{abandoned}} narrow gauge railroad beds. <b>My</b> <b>guess,</b> he <b>is</b> onto something—Again!!! ...|$|R

5000|$|Surreptitiously and uninvited I {{helped to}} edit the paper {{when no one}} was watching; {{therefore}} I was a journalist.

2500|$|Several {{months after}} declaring his {{retirement}} from mixed martial arts, B.J. Penn {{announced that he}} would be returning to the octagon after repeated challenges made by welterweight prospect Rory MacDonald; stating, [...] "Rory, I accept your challenge!". Initially, Penn was expected to face Rory MacDonald on September 22, 2012 at UFC 152. [...] However, MacDonald pulled out of the bout after sustaining a cut to the forehead while training. Penn vs. MacDonald eventually took place on December 8, 2012 at UFC on Fox 5. [...] Penn lost the fight via unanimous decision. After the fight Dana White stated that he'd like to see B.J. Penn retire from mixed martial arts, although Penn has hinted a desire to return to the UFC's lightweight division. Following months of silence regarding his future, Penn spoke with Ariel Helwani in an interview for UFC on Fox, where he admitted that he was still undecided on his future, telling him that [...] "at this moment, <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> probably a little better than yours, but I don't know, I'm enjoying what I'm doing." ...|$|E
60|$|Vent. Alone, {{and talking}} to himself? {{concerned}} too? Perhaps <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> right; he loved her once, And may pursue it still.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly! The {{gold and}} silver plates, and the strange tools, and the living in retirement, and the sending the {{servants}} away at night--all point to the same conclusion. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> the right one. The man is an escaped criminal; and his form of crime is coining false money. He has been discovered at Exeter--he has escaped the officers of justice--and he {{is now going to}} begin again here. You can do as you please. If I happen to want change, I won't get it in this neighborhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't figured on that," [...] replied Kells. [...] "But you're right.... Joan, if I don't miss <b>my</b> <b>guess,</b> it won't <b>be</b> long till you'll be {{the talk}} of mining-towns and camp-fires." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, Michael Oliver of Gramophone {{described}} it as [...] "a disappointing piece." [...] Despite noting its [...] "vivid, subtle or mysterious sonorities," [...] Oliver wrote, [...] "Its six [...] mostly brief movements are spasmodic rather than cumulative, the overall effect being of unrelated events that {{might just as well}} be played in a different order; <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> would <b>be</b> that Ginastera simply got bogged down in the piece." ...|$|R
60|$|He says: At {{the first}} glance, I can see {{symptoms}} a, b, c. It is therefore probable that my patient has got complaint A. But {{if he has}} {{he ought to have}} symptom d also. If I find that, <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> will <b>be</b> yet more probable. He ought also to have symptom e, and so forth; and as I find successively each of these symptoms which are proper to A, <b>my</b> first <b>guess</b> will become more and more probable, till it reaches practical certainty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a little, my dear," [...] I rejoined. [...] "You have {{declared}} {{that nothing is}} known of this man. Now you mean by that--nothing which satisfies you. He has not dropped down from Heaven, I suppose? The time when he came here, must be known. Also, whether he came alone, or not. Also, how and where he has found a lodging in the village. Before I admit that <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> completely wrong, I {{want to hear what}} general observation in Dimchurch has discovered on the subject of this gentleman. How long has he been here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Marechal Duc de Belleisle {{was very}} wealthy: in Vernon Country, Normandy, he had estates and chateaux {{to the value}} of about 24,000 pounds annually. All these, having first {{accurately}} settled for his own debts, he, in his grand old way, childless, forlorn, but loftily polite to the last, bequeathed to the King. His splendid Paris Mansion he expressly left [...] "to serve in perpetuity as a residence for the Secretary of State in the Department of War:" [...] a magnificent Town-House it is, [...] "HOTEL MAGNIFIQUE, {{at the end of the}} Pont-Royal,"--which, I notice farther, is in our time called [...] "Hotel de CHOISEUL-PRASLIN,"--a house latterly become horrible in men's memory, if <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> right.|$|E
60|$|First, {{by direct}} experiment, {{as it is}} called. In plain English--go home and make a little Hartford Bridge Flat in the stable-yard; and then ask Mrs. How if she will not make a glen in it like this glen here. We will go home and try that. We will make a great flat cake of clay, and put upon it a cap of sand; {{and then we will}} rain upon it out of a watering- pot; and see if Mrs. How does not begin soon to make a glen {{in the side of the}} heap, just like those on Hartford Bridge Flat. I believe she will; and certainly, if she does, it will be a fresh proof that <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> right. And then we will see whether water will not make glens of a {{different}} shape than these, if it run over soils of a different kind. We will make a Hartford Bridge Flat turned upside down--a cake of sand with a cap of clay on the top; and we will rain on that out of our watering- pot, and see what sort of glens we make then. I can guess what they will be like, because I have seen them--steep overhanging cliffs, with very narrow gullies down them: but you shall try for yourself, and make up your mind whether you think me right or wrong. Meanwhile, remember that those gullies too will have been made by water.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I got {{my boots}} on, {{and we went}} down and slipped in and laid the paper of sugar on the berth, and sat down soft and sheepish and went to {{listening}} to Bud Dixon snore. Hal Clayton dropped off pretty soon, but I didn't; I wasn't ever so wide awake in my life. I was spying {{out from under the}} shade of my hat brim, searching the floor for leather. It took me a long time, and I begun to think maybe <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> wrong, but at last I struck it. It laid over by the bulkhead, and was nearly the color of the carpet. It was a little round plug about as thick as the end of your little finger, and I says to myself there's a di'mond in the nest you've come from. Before long I spied out the plug's mate.|$|R

5000|$|The coup at Athens {{went forward}} as planned, and [...] "on the fourteenth {{day of the}} Attic month of Thargelion, June 9, 411, ... the conspirators seized the reality of power."

You'll need that horse, too, my lad." ...|$|R
5000|$|Democrats {{were also}} {{critical}} of the negotiating process. House Minority Leader Frank Dermody lividly complained that Republicans didn't share their proposed plan until Monday.

6000|$|Because if {{you will}} take up one of these stones and crack it across, {{you will see that}} it is not of the same stuff as those said rocks. Step into the next field and see. That rock is the common Snowdon slate, which we see everywhere. The two {{shoulders}} of down, right and left, are slate, too; you can see that at a glance. But the stones of the pebble bank are a close-grained, yellow-spotted rock. They are Syenite; and (you may believe me or not, as you will) they were once upon a time in the condition of a hasty pudding heated to some 800 degrees of Fahrenheit, and in that condition shoved their way up somewhere or other through these slates. But where? whence on earth did these Syenite pebbles come? [...] Let us walk round to the cliff on the opposite side and see. It is worth while; for even if <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> <b>be</b> wrong, there is good spinning with a brass minnow round the angles of the rocks.|$|R
5000|$|April 10. — When I {{think of}} what I {{suffered}} with my stays, it seems very strange that they don't hurt me now.

I know when I take off my stays to wash, I don't feel comfortable till I get them on again. And then I do <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> figure <b>is</b> sweet.
