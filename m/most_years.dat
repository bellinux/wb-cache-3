The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.

5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line.

Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years {{the dry season}} becomes quite severe and water restrictions are imposed to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience any type of frozen precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|Since 1963, {{the custom}} in <b>most</b> <b>years</b> {{has been to}} start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, {{typically}} {{by one or more}} legendary players. The original honorary starters were Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a two-party system, but had only contempt for those who bolted the Republican Party to join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in <b>most</b> <b>years</b> until becoming president.|$|E

Later, the location alternated between the River Cam in Cambridge and The Isis, over a distance of about 1,000 yards.

5|$|The {{number of}} the members was not fixed; it varied from over 200 (with 289 in 1782 and 213 in 1817) to as low as 41 (in 1834); in <b>most</b> <b>years</b> the Sejm had {{averaged}} 60 to 80 deputies. They were composed of clergy, nobility (either titled or above a certain, relatively high, income level), two deputies {{from the city of}} Lviv representing the burghers and later, chancellor of the University of Lwów. The members were not elective, holding the mandates due to their offices, titles or wealth. This made the Sejm not representative, and rather conservative.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, <b>most</b> <b>years</b> saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces.

5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, none {{is believed to}} have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in <b>most</b> <b>years</b> fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for <b>most</b> <b>years</b> for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced that limited quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|Orme was a bay colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands {{high and}} had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's first crop of foals. By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been {{exported}} to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few foals <b>most</b> <b>years.</b> However, he did also sire Goldfinch, a horse that was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.|$|E

5|$|Pitru Paksha is {{considered}} by Hindus to be inauspicious, given the death rite performed during the ceremony, known as Shraddha or tarpan. In southern and western India, it falls in the 2nd paksha (forthnight) Hindu lunar month of Bhadrapada (September) and follows the forthnight immediately after the Ganesh festival. It begins on the Pratipada (first day of the forthnight) ending with the no moon day known as Sarvapitri amavasya, Pitru Amavasya, Peddala Amavasya, Mahalaya amavasya or simply Mahalaya. <b>Most</b> <b>years,</b> the autumnal equinox falls within this period, i.e. the Sun transitions from the northern to the southern hemisphere during this period. In North India and Nepal, and cultures following the purnimanta calendar or the solar calendar, this period may correspond to the waning fortnight of the luni-solar month Ashvin, instead of Bhadrapada.|$|E
5|$|Sea turtles nest {{on island}} beaches in the park. Park staff {{actively}} assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose {{an obstacle to}} adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles {{are the most common}} sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in <b>most</b> <b>years.</b> In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island.|$|E

Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
