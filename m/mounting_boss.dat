5000|$|In {{mechanical}} design, the prototypical [...] "male" [...] {{component is}} a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a <b>mounting</b> <b>boss,</b> or a sheet metal tab connector {{can also be}} considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.|$|E
50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, a docking sleeve or <b>mounting</b> <b>boss</b> is a tube or enclosure used {{to couple}} two mechanical components together, or for chilling, or to retain two components together; this permits two equally sized appendages {{to be connected}} via insertion and fixing within the construction. Docking sleeves may be physically solid or flexible, their implementation varying widely according to the required application of the device. The most common application is the plastic appendage that receives a screw in order to attach two parts.|$|E
50|$|The Bushmaster is a mine {{protected}} {{vehicle and}} provides {{a high degree of}} protection against land mines, using its v-hull monocoque to deflect the blast away from the vehicle and its occupants. The vehicle's armour provides protection against small arms of up to 7.62 mm ball ammunition, 81mm mortar fragments, Claymore mines, and with additional applique armor, protection for armour piercing ammunition of up to 7.62mm. The fuel and hydraulic tanks of the vehicle are located outside the crew compartment, while it also has an automatic fire suppression system. The troop carrier variant of the Bushmaster is fitted with one gun ring. The forward gun ring can be fitted with a 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm machine gun. The two rear hatches each have a <b>mounting</b> <b>boss</b> to allow the attachment of a swing mount capable of holding a 7.62 mm machine gun.|$|E
50|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{differentiate}} a bare Magnum block from a LA is by checking {{for the presence of}} the two crankshaft position sensor <b>mounting</b> <b>bosses</b> on the right rear top of the block, just {{to the rear of the}} cylinder head deck surface. Bosses = Magnum.|$|R
50|$|Pappinbarra River rises below <b>Mount</b> <b>Boss</b> on {{the slopes}} of the Gibraltar Range within the Werrikimbe National Park, {{northwest}} of the hamlet of Pappinbarra Junction, and flows generally southeast before reaching its confluence with the Hastings River, near Beechwood. The river descends 376 m over its 58 km course.|$|R
50|$|The Nissan A engine {{design is}} a refined, quiet and durable {{gasoline}} engine. It {{appears to be}} a modern replacement of the earlier iron-headed Nissan E engine and is of similar dimensions. The 1960s E series was an all-new design from newly acquired Aichi Kokuki, and integrated Nissan's improvements to the BMC A-Series engine design in the 1950s (Nissan was a licensee of Austin Motor Company technology). As production continued, 1974 and newer A-series engines have different block castings, with relocated motor <b>mount</b> <b>bosses.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} small {{features}} — bottle cage <b>mounting</b> holes, shifter <b>bosses,</b> cable stops, pump pegs, cable guides, etc. — {{are described as}} braze-ons because they were originally, and sometimes still are, brazed on.|$|R
25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck <b>mounting</b> <b>bosses</b> to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by overtightening their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the main cable {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|R
5000|$|... 1956 - Full-flow oil {{filtration}} was introduced, using a paper element filter in a canister that was <b>mounted</b> to a <b>boss</b> that {{was added to}} the left rear cylinder block casting and machined for this purpose.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{we got out}} the reaper, put the sickles in order, {{and father}} laid in a store of provisions. Extra hands were hired, and at last, early on a hot July morning, the <b>boss</b> <b>mounted</b> to his seat on the self-rake [...] "McCormick" [...] and drove into the field. Frank rode the lead horse, four stalwart hands and myself took [...] "stations" [...] behind the reaper and the battle was on! ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Vega {{picked up}} a <b>mount</b> named Shanannies <b>Boss,</b> who was a tough troubled horse who liked to run off with riders until Vega began to gallop him in the mornings. Vega {{made a deal with}} owner Frank Generazio, that he would tame the horse and help get him ready for the races, only if he would be allowed to ride him come race time. Vega went on to win [...] "The World Appeal Stakes" [...] at Meadowlands Racetrack (October 9, 1993) for owner and trainer Patricia and Frank Generazio.|$|R
25|$|Along {{the inner}} west wall (i.e. the head end) at the north-west corner stood a tall iron stand with a grid near the top. Beside this rested {{a very large}} {{circular}} shield, with a central <b>boss,</b> <b>mounted</b> with garnets and with die-pressed plaques of interlaced animal ornament. The shield front displayed two large emblems with garnet settings, one a composite metal predatory bird {{and the other a}} flying dragon. It also bore animal-ornamented sheet strips directly die-linked to examples from the early cemetery at Vendel near Old Uppsala in Sweden. A small bell, possibly for an animal, lay nearby.|$|R
50|$|The {{channel section}} chassis had {{suspension}} by leaf springs {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with radius arms controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The radius arms were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends <b>mounted</b> in a <b>boss</b> that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius rods provided axle location and anti-roll properties.|$|R
40|$|Regional {{mapping of}} the Surprise Lake {{batholith}} was initiated during the 1979 field season. The <b>Mount</b> Leonard <b>boss,</b> the most westerly {{segment of the}} Surprise Lake batholith, was mapped during July and August. Continuation of mapping in the batholith is planned for 1980. The maparea (Fig. 23). within the Atlin Horst tectonic subdivision, is situated east of Atlin Lake in northern British Columbia with {{the centre of the}} Surprise Lake batholith at latitude 59 degrees 42 minutes north and longitude 132 degrees 53 minutes west. The area is mountainous with peak elevations of 1 800 to 2 100 metres and the valley containing Surprise Lake at about 942 metres. Access is way and Highway 7 to Atlin. A good!'ia the Alaska Iiigh-gravel road exists between Atlin and Surprise Lake and various mining roads provide access to most of the batholith situated northwest of Surprise Lake. Several mining companies actively explored the area around Ruby Mountain during 1979. Prospecting and exploration efforts in the Surprise Lake batholith have located intermting molybdenum and/or tungsten properties including Adanac (molybdenum), Gladys Lake (molybdenum), Black Diamond (tungsten), and Weir Mountain (molybdenum, tungsten). Geochemical data obtained flom stream sill: and water samples collected during the Uranium Reconnaissance Program in 1977 demonstrate that the Surpris...|$|R
