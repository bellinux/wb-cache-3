5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government. Partly in response to the added public pressure spurred by the smog event, Congress passed and Johnson signed the 1967 Air Quality Act, which amended the 1963 Clean Air Act to provide for study of air quality and control methods.|$|E

The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, President Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups pushed for Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, Warren was strongly opposed by financial institutions and by Republican <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> believed Warren would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, Obama turned to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray and in January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, appointed Cordray to the post in a recess appointment.|$|E

I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E

During that time, United States Cabinet salaries were increased from $186,600 to $191,300 in January 2008, and to $196,700 in January 2009.

Before the January 2009 pay increases, secretaries made $191,300 compared to <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> earned $169,300.|$|E
500|$|The UFC {{also began}} a public {{relations}} campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired Edward Bernays, who mounted a concerted misinformation campaign for several years which portrayed the company as {{the victim of a}} communist Guatemalan government. The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952. These included commissioning a research study from a firm known to be hostile to social reform, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of [...] "exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories" [...] but it nonetheless {{had a significant impact on}} the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> read it.

While members of Congress are generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had [...] "meticulously" [...] followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and Gephardt [...] "allowed those <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>who</b> were there to have a fuller experience."
