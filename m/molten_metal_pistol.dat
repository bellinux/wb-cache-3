40|$|The {{method of}} well-bonded pipe {{coupling}} space filling control {{by means of}} ultrasonic NDT methods has been proposed. Use of ultrasonic NDT method for coupling space filling with self-hardening substance (both compound and <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> coupling space filling) has been analyzed. Taking into consideration the high temperature of the repair structure during repair works performance when using a <b>molten</b> <b>metal,</b> which is determined by high temperature, the application of piezo-electric transducers is ineffective. Therefore, it is offered to use electromagnetic (EMA) transducer as the emitter and receiver of ultrasonic oscillations. Theoretical and experimental research results of weld bonded coupling space filling with <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> control have confirmed the efficiency of EMA method use. The proposed control method allows to reach the maximum efficiency {{in the use of}} coupling space filling with <b>molten</b> <b>metal.</b> ????????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????. ???????? ?????? ????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??? ? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????????, ??? ? ? ??????????? ????????????? ????????. ? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????? ?????????? ????? ??? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????, ???????????? ???????????? ??? ?????????, ?????????? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????????????? ???????????????? ??????????????. ??????? ? ???????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ???? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ????????????????
