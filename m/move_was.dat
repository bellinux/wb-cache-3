5|$|The Kodokan {{moved to}} a 60-mat space in April 1890. In December 1893, the Kodokan started moving to a larger space located in Tomizaka-cho, Koishikawa-cho, and the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} by February 1894.|$|E
5|$|After {{his move}} to Oxford United in January 2008, {{he stated that}} the reason for the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> so that he could be closer to his family home in Southampton. On his arrival at Exeter City in July 2008, he moved into a house with fellow Exeter forward, Ben Watson. McAllister stated that it would make a huge {{difference}} living near the training ground, instead of travelling long distances to get to training and matches.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{inspired}} by the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> a return for the Football Echo man. The cartoon character had for years indicated the match results of Sunderland with a smile, a frown or a tear, while adorning the outside wall of the Bridge Street building. After several years in storage, he was returned {{to the wall of}} the new Echo building in 1976, where he still remains today.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} combat <b>move</b> <b>is</b> the taunt. If this <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{executed in}} full without the opponent striking, the opponent loses advantage.|$|R
50|$|The Daihatsu <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> a kei car, {{produced}} by Japanese automaker Daihatsu since August 1995. The <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> {{designed to be}} as tall as compact cars like the Suzuki Wagon R. Daihatsu successfully sold 500,000 Moves during its {{first three years of}} production. The <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> built upon the chassis of the Daihatsu Cuore but with a taller body.|$|R
5|$|Cho was {{dispatched}} by the Soviet {{authorities to}} liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become {{the driving force of}} North Korean literature and arts.|$|E
5|$|Cooksey {{had started}} {{his career as a}} trainee with Colchester United, prior to moving onto a number of non-League clubs. His first <b>move</b> <b>was</b> to Heybridge Swifts before joining Bishop's Stortford in 1998. He then moved onto Chesham United in 2000, leaving in 2002 to have a brief spell at Bromley.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after the exiled Central African Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This <b>move</b> <b>was</b> met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d'Ivoire in 1983.|$|E
50|$|Each pawn <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{defined by}} the new square {{occupied}} by the pawn. For example, if player 1 moves from square e9 to e8, player 1’s <b>move</b> <b>is</b> e8.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adjectival}} system ("difficulté" [...] in French guidebooks), {{going from}} F (Facile, easy) to ED+ (Extrêmement Difficile Supérieur, Extremely Difficult Higher), applies {{to a whole}} route. It measures the overall difficulty and danger of the route. (An easy route with a single hard <b>move</b> <b>is</b> graded lower than one where the hardest <b>move</b> <b>is</b> the same, but many <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> hard or unprotected.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Following western chess conventions, omitted <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> {{indicated}} with an ... ellipsis. As {{a consequence}} of the way <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> numbered in the western system, all <b>moves</b> by White <b>are</b> notated with an ellipsis prefix in texts. For example, ... P-5e indicates a move by White while P-5e indicates a move by Black. In handicap games, White plays first, so Black's first <b>move</b> <b>is</b> replaced by an ellipsis. For example, 1. ... G-3b 2. P-7f G-7b.|$|R
5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> widely seen as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E
5|$|Following Derby's relegation {{from the}} Premier League, Higginbotham moved to Southampton in January 2003 on loan {{until the end}} of 2002–03. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> made {{permanent}} in February 2003 for a £1.5million fee. He featured in Southampton's FA Cup run in 2002–03, playing once in the fifth round against Norwich City, but was an unused substitute for the final against Arsenal.|$|E

5000|$|An Intermediate lesson, {{involving}} a routine of 3 moves {{drawn from a}} much larger repertoire of Intermediate-level moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. At {{least one of the}} Intermediate <b>moves</b> will <b>be</b> a Classic <b>move</b> which <b>is</b> intended for new Intermediate dancers. Many of the harder Intermediate <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> based around these Classic <b>moves.</b> There <b>are</b> 24 Classic <b>moves.</b> [...] Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the intermediate-level lesson. Intermediate <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> more complex and may contain footwork.|$|R
50|$|The type I <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} <b>move</b> {{that affects the}} writhe of the diagram. The type III <b>move</b> <b>is</b> the only one which {{does not change the}} {{crossing}} number of the diagram.|$|R
5|$|For this thirteenth season, Seven {{chose to}} move Blue Heelers from its Wednesday-night, primetime timeslot, {{which it had}} {{occupied}} for 10 years, to the lower-rated Saturday-night timeslot, which also saw it up against popular British police programme The Bill; this <b>move</b> <b>was</b> slammed by cast member John Wood. Ratings for this season were generally low; no episode ranked in OzTAM's top 20 programme list for the week.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{and private}} {{enterprises}} have also come {{under pressure from}} China to censor media organizations operated by Falun Gong practitioners. In 2008, for instance, French satellite provider Eutelsat suspended its Asian broadcasts of New Tang Dynasty Television in response to pressure from China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> viewed as {{a quid pro quo}} attempt to secure access to the Chinese market.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick {{said that the}} <b>move</b> <b>was</b> made not because of {{problems}} by Ripken but because more defensive options were available at shortstop than at third base. Had Ripken not wanted {{to move back to}} third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E
50|$|To use premove, {{a player}} makes a {{move in the}} same way they would <b>move</b> if it <b>was</b> their turn. After their {{opponent}} moves, the original player's <b>move</b> <b>is</b> immediately made, assuming that the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> still legal. Premove is not available in over-the-board chess.|$|R

30|$|This paper uses a λ-interchange {{mechanism}} to move trains between routes to generate neighborhood {{solution for the}} problem (for more details see[Ghoseiri and Ghannadpour (2010])). In one version of the algorithm called global best, the whole neighborhood is explored, and the best <b>move</b> <b>is</b> selected. In the other version, first best, the first admissible improving <b>move</b> <b>is</b> selected if one exists; otherwise, the best admissible <b>move</b> <b>is</b> implemented.|$|R
5|$|In July 2017, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Executive Order 13795 from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce began re-evaluating the status of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which includes the Davidson Seamount. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> opposed by many environmentalists and residents.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague. This <b>move</b> <b>was</b> supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 he was {{reported}} to have agreed terms with South African side Bidvest Wits of the Premier Soccer League, but the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> never completed. He had a trial with Cheltenham Town in March 2015, and impressed in a reserve game against Plymouth Argyle after being out injured for the season, but the club was unable to offer him a contract.|$|E

5|$|In March and April 1991, Serbs in Croatia {{began to}} make moves to secede from that territory. It {{is a matter of}} debate to what extent this <b>move</b> <b>was</b> locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season as the Broncos' coach in 1965, Speedie's team posted a 4–10 record. After two losses to begin the 1966 season, Speedie {{resigned}} and assistant Ray Malavasi took over. He said the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{in the best interest}} of the club. Speedie had a 6-19-1 record as the Broncos' coach. He then accepted a scouting position with the organization and was based out of his home in Laguna Hills, California. He held the post until his retirement in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In late August {{and early}} September 1943, the {{division}} redeployed again, {{this time to}} Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast.
