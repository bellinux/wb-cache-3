5|$|The most clues for a <b>minimal</b> Sudoku is {{believed}} to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). These two Sudokus were discovered in 2014, more than four years after at least one programmer expressed doubts that a 40-clue <b>minimal</b> Sudoku would exist. In the work to find these Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 <b>minimal</b> puzzles with 36-clues. About 2600 <b>minimal</b> Sudokus with 39-clues were also found.|$|E
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a <b>minimal</b> element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a <b>minimal</b> element, the <b>minimal</b> counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

5|$|Ordinary Sudokus (proper puzzles) have {{a unique}} solution. A <b>minimal</b> Sudoku is a Sudoku from which no clue can be removed leaving it a proper Sudoku. Different <b>minimal</b> Sudokus can have a {{different}} number of clues. This section discusses the minimum number of givens for proper puzzles.|$|E

5|$|September 4, 2002– Tropical Storm Edouard hits near Ormond Beach as a <b>minimal</b> {{tropical}} storm. While {{crossing the}} peninsula {{from east to}} west, the storm drops up to 7.64inches (194mm) of rain in DeSoto City, resulting in some flooding and <b>minimal</b> damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{benefit to}} nuclear nonproliferation was <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} {{throughout its}} path, and winds were <b>minimal.</b> The combination of Danielle {{and a high}} pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage. The waves killed two in New Jersey from a boat sinking, and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Overall damage from the storm was <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The term <b>minimal</b> {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) {{is defined}} as encephalopathy that {{does not lead to}} clinically overt cognitive dysfunction, but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies. This is still an important finding, as <b>minimal</b> encephalopathy has been demonstrated to impair quality of life and increase the risk of involvement in road traffic accidents.|$|E
5|$|This {{scale has}} been {{modified}} by Claassen and coworkers, reflecting the additive risk from SAH size and accompanying intraventricular hemorrhage (0 - none; 1 - <b>minimal</b> SAH w/o IVH; 2 - <b>minimal</b> SAH with IVH; 3 - thick SAH w/o IVH; 4 - thick SAH with IVH);.|$|E
