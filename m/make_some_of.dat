5|$|The British were {{alerted to}} the 4thDestroyer Flotilla's {{movement}} by Ultra signals intelligence. The {{commander of the}} Home Fleet, Admiral Henry Moore, was informed that the destroyers had sailed on 27January, shortly after the three carriers and their escort had put to sea. He believed that the German ships were likely to use a route between the coastal islands and the shore, as was common for the Kriegsmarine. If this route was used, it would be preferable for strike aircraft of No. 18 Group RAF to attack the destroyers as Norway's inshore waters were protected by naval mines and coastal batteries. Alternatively, the German ships could make a high-speed night passage outside of the coastal islands. In case an offshore route was used, Moore ordered Vice Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, {{the commander of the}} 10thCruiser Squadron, to sail with the cruisers Diadem and Mauritius and patrol off Bergen. The Home Fleet did not have any destroyers available to accompany Dalrymple-Hamilton's force, though Moore considered but decided against cancelling the carrier operation in order to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these ships available.|$|E

25|$|The Western Costume Company in Hollywood {{claims to}} have made Garland's {{original}} slippers. While {{it is likely that}} Western would have been contracted to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> The Wizard of Ozs many costumes, no records of the original slippers exist to either validate or disprove their claim. In 1989, to commemorate the movie's 50th anniversary, Western produced the only authorized reproductions. Hand-lasted on Judy Garland's original foot mold and completely sequined and jeweled, the reproduction slippers were nearly identical to the originals. Western planned a limited edition of 500 pairs at $5000 each, but halted the project after selling only 16 pairs. One of these pairs fetched $35,000 (including buyer's premium) at a November 25, 2013, auction.|$|E

The Gornergrat railway, reaching a record altitude of 3,100 metres, was inaugurated in 1898. Areas served by cable car are the Unterrothorn and the Klein Matterhorn (Little Matterhorn) (3,883 m, highest transportation system in Europe). The Hörnli Hut (3,260 m), which {{is the start of}} the normal route via the Hörnli ridge, is easily accessible from Schwarzsee (2,600 m) and is also frequented by hikers. The Zermatt and Cervinia resorts function as separate ski resort all year round and are connected by skilifts over the Theodul Pass. In 2015 it was expected that there would be constructed a cable car link between Testa Grigia and Klein Matterhorn. It will finally provide a link between the Swiss and Italian side of the Matterhorn.|$|E
25|$|René Clair (11 November 1898 – 15 March 1981) born René-Lucien Chomette, was a French filmmaker and writer. He first {{established}} his {{reputation in the}} 1920s as a director of silent films in which comedy was often mingled with fantasy. He went on to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most innovative early sound films in France, before going abroad {{to work in the}} UK and USA for more than a decade. Returning to France after World War II, he continued to make films that were characterised by their elegance and wit, often presenting a nostalgic view of French life in earlier years. He was elected to the Académie française in 1960. Clair's best known films include The Italian Straw Hat (1928), Under the Roofs of Paris (1930), Le Million (1931), À nous la liberté (1931), I Married a Witch (1942), and And Then There Were None (1945).|$|E
25|$|The main {{motives for}} leaving Israel are usually {{connected}} with the emigrants' desire for improved living standards, or to search for work opportunities and professional advancement, for higher education. Polls amongst emigrants {{have shown that the}} political situation and security threats in Israel are not among the main factors in emigration. Emigration is also common amongst new immigrants who did not successfully integrate into Israeli society especially if they were unable to master the Hebrew language or were unable to join the labor force, or who already made one major residence change in their lives and therefore found an additional change easier to <b>make.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the immigrants move to a third country, almost always in the West, and some of them return to the country of their origin, a phenomenon which increases when the conditions in the country of origin improve, as occurred in the former USSR {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|The {{radio was}} built and {{operated}} in the British other ranks' compound. The {{maker of the}} radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by {{a core group of}} three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.|$|E
25|$|The calvary has {{suffered}} much erosion over the years, not surprisingly {{in view of}} its proximity to {{the sea and the}} sea's winds. This erosion does <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the parts of the statuary difficult to interpret although it was restored in 2001. The calvary comprises a large rectangular granite pedestal or base which measures 4.50 m by 3.15 m. Around this base are two friezes on which are various sculptures, single or in groups, which recount some incidents in Jesus' life beginning with the Annunciation when the Archangel Gabriel tells the Virgin Mary that she is pregnant with Jesus Christ. The bulk of these statues are in granite except for the Visitation (Christianity), the Nativity of Jesus and the Adoration of the Magi where the local Kersanton stone was used. Kersanton is easier to carve and very resistant to erosion. Research suggests that several masons and workshops were responsible for these sculptures. There is clear evidence that the calvary was originally painted. Another oddity {{is that many of the}} sculptures are carved in blocks and some have suggested that they were originally carved for display as part of a church wall rather than for a calvary. On the eastern side of the calvary there is evidence that there had originally been some form of altar table there.|$|E
500|$|For its time, Witchfinder General was {{considered}} an unusually sadistic film experience. British film censor John Trevelyan was reportedly a distant cousin of Michael Reeves and accepted the director's good intentions when Reeves explained why {{he felt it was}} necessary to include such intense violence in the movie. Trevelyan nonetheless argued, [...] "The film gave the impression that it was exploiting violence, and in particular, sadism for commercial reasons." [...] Consequently, the film was cut extensively by the British Board of Film Censors for its UK release. Nearly two complete minutes of what was described as [...] "excesses of sadistic brutality" [...] were removed. Reeves agreed to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the initial minor cuts himself, but when additional and more extensive demands were made he adamantly refused to take part in any further editing.|$|E

500|$|Like the band's earlier releases, {{the album}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} guitar configurations as well as electronic synths. Erikson said that initially they gather with the standard guitar-bass-drum and keyboard gear, and as they pass around different ideas and implement them the songs take form in any which way a session takes them. [...] "Once we started on the album proper, it became a Garbage record, which is any number of approaches to writing a recording. There were no rules, certainly", he explained. A song like [...] "Automatic Systematic Habit" [...] features more electronics than guitars, and [...] "Big Bright World", a guitar-heavy song, involves configurations that <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the guitars sound like synths. Guitar parts are normally divvied between guitarists Marker and Erikson. Erikson said {{it comes down to}} [...] "Whoever comes up with what at any given time. There's no job description as far as lead guitar/rhythm guitar. It's just whoever has an idea as a articular [...] moment. It's usually about 50/50". Erikson and Marker used a variety of guitars and pedals, old, new, and defective.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} between Woods and Rand {{allowed him to}} hire collaborators if he thought it necessary, paying them a limited portion of the author's royalties. He first hired John Hayden to direct, paying him one percentage point from Rand's 10-percent royalty. Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director, Rand disliked him and later called him [...] "a very ratty Broadway hanger-on". As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia, Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand's refusal to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them. He engaged Louis Weitzenkorn, {{the author of the}} previous hit Five Star Final, to act as a script doctor. Rand's relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse than hers with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another percentage point from Rand's royalties without informing her. Rand filed a claim against Woods with the American Arbitration Association; she objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties, and told the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play, which was cut after the auditions. Upon hearing this testimony, one of the arbitrators responded incredulously, [...] "That was [...] he did?" [...] In two hearings, the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed-upon one percent, but that Woods could not deduct the payment from Rand's royalties because she had not been notified in advance. Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert's Ambassador Theatre on September 16, 1935, where it ran successfully for seven months. It closed on April 4, 1936, after 283 performances.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Standard Atmosphere model {{starts with}} many of the same {{assumptions}} as the isothermal-barotropic model, including ideal gas behavior, and constant molecular weight, but it differs by defining a more realistic temperature function, consisting of eight data points connected by straight lines; i.e. regions of constant temperature gradient. (See graph.) [...] Of course the real atmosphere does not have a temperature distribution with this exact shape. [...] The temperature function is an approximation.

2500|$|Obsidian, called itztli in the Nahuatl language, {{has been}} found at nearly every Mesoamerican archaeological site.

Conversely, cohost Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost amongst the film's scientific concepts.

2500|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1930s, Sturges operated under the strict auspices of the studio system, working on a string of scripts, some of which were shelved, sometimes with screen credit and sometimes not. While he was highly paid, earning $2,500 a week, he was unhappy with the way directors were handling his dialogue, and he resolved to take creative control of his own projects. He accomplished this goal in 1939 by trading his screenplay for The Great McGinty (written six years earlier) to Paramount in exchange for the chance to direct it. Paramount promoted the unusual deal as part of the film's publicity, claiming that Sturges had received just one dollar (in reality, he was paid $10 for legal reasons). Sturges' success quickly paved the way for similar deals for such writer-directors as Billy Wilder and John Huston. Sturges said, [...] "It's taken me eight years to reach what I wanted. But now, if I don't run out of ideas – and I won't – we'll have some fun. There are some wonderful pictures to be made, and God willing, I will <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them." ...|$|E
