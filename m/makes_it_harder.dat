5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they have}} {{effective}} stingers, these wasps {{and other members}} of Stenogastrinae are typically passive aggressive. Their stings are less painful for humans than those of many other social wasps, and often when faced with a large threat, these wasps will simply fall passively out of their nests. This behavior actually <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for the potential predator to determine the location of the nest.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause for}} the death of coral reefs is bioerosion. Various fishes graze corals, dead or alive and change the {{morphology}} of coral reefs making them more susceptible to other physical and chemical threats. It has been generally observed that only the algae growing on dead corals is eaten and the live ones are not. However, this act still destroys the top layer of coral substrate and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for the reefs to sustain.|$|E

A stirrup that is too narrow will increase the chance that the boot will get caught in it (which would be very dangerous should the rider fall), and a too-wide stirrup <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the way through.

25|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the younger lady is Meritaten, {{daughter}} of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of Smenkhare, based on {{a study of the}} alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. The theory goes that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle. Thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to distinguish the generations, but there is one problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen Tiye, or her mother Thuya, as the younger lady's mitochondrial DNA fits with her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya.|$|E
25|$|When {{the breast}} overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from {{not getting enough}} milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after {{delivery}} and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement. Engorgement may affect the areola, {{the periphery of the}} breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.|$|E

25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these degradation products in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not}} be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, isopropyl alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017, the Senate voted 98 to 2 for a {{bill that}} had been {{initially}} drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia′s continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the 2016 election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as Iran, and North Korea; the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law. An identical bill was introduced by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in July and passed in the house on July 25, with 419 votes in favor and 3 against. On July 27, the bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate, which provoked Russia′s president Putin into pledging response to ″this kind of insolence towards our country″. On August 2, president Donald Trump signed the bill into law (the ″Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act″). Simultaneously, the president issued two separate, simultaneous statements. One of those said, ″While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions″. The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress, giving them time to reverse such a move. It targets Russia's defense industry by harming Russia's ability to export weapon, and allows the U.S. to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources. One of Trump′s statements noted that ″by limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.″ The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of retaliatory measure {{on the part of}} the European Union.|$|E

500|$|Saint Anselm College has {{resisted}} what the college {{sees as the}} grade inflation trend at many of America's college's and universities. At Saint Anselm, the top 25% of the class has a 3.1 GPA; the median grade at the college is around a 2.5 GPA. While the Dean's List at most schools begin at a 3.5 GPA, Saint Anselm awards students with the honor at a 3.0 GPA. According to a 2006 Fox News article, former Dean of the College Father Peter Guerin, O.S.B., {{is quoted as saying}} that today's [...] "parents may view universities as a consumer market in which they're in a way paying for the diploma....
