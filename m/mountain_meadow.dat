25|$|There {{are three}} soil zones. The Northern forest-steppe zone covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth chernozem, that {{accounts}} for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The Southern xerothermal zone encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The Mountain zone covers the mountainous regions above 700–800m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000m, the dark mountain forest soils {{can be found at}} 1700–2200m altitude and the <b>mountain</b> <b>meadow</b> soils— above 1700m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.|$|E

2500|$|The Bridge Creek Wilderness is very remote, and at , {{it is the}} {{smallest}} wilderness in Oregon. [...] It has few visitors except during the fall hunting season. [...] Its topography is dominated by steep, forested slopes and barren plateaus, although it has some <b>mountain</b> <b>meadow</b> lands as well. [...] The wilderness contains important winter elk habitat along Bridge Creek. [...] Other large mammals common to the area include mule deer, black bear, and cougar. Pileated woodpecker, goshawks, and prairie falcons nest in the Bridge Creek area. [...] There are no trails in the Bridge Creek Wilderness, so this area is for experienced outdoorsmen.|$|E
2500|$|T. B. H. Stenhouse, former Utah Mormon polygamist, Mormon missionary for {{thirteen}} {{years and a}} Salt Lake City newspaper owner, finally left Utah and wrote The Rocky Mountain Saints. His book gives a witnessed account {{of his life in}} Utah, both the good and the bad. He finally left Utah and Mormonism after financial ruin occurred when Brigham Young sent Stenhouse to relocate to Ogden, Utah, according to Stenhouse, to take over his thriving pro-Mormon Salt Lake Telegraph newspaper. In addition to these testimonies, The Confessions of John D. Lee, written by John D. Lee—alleged [...] "Scape goat" [...] for the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Meadow</b> Massacre—also came out in 1877. The corroborative testimonies coming out of Utah from Mormons and former Mormons influenced Congress and the people of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In 311 BC the consuls Gaius Junius Bubulcus and Quintus Aemilius Barbula divided their command. [...] Junius took on Samnium and Aemilius took on Etruria.The Samnites {{took the}} Roman {{garrison}} of Cluviae (location unknown) and scourged its prisoners. Junius retook {{it and then}} moved on Bovianum and sacked it. The Samnites sought to ambush the Romans. Misinformation {{that there was a}} large flock of sheep in an inaccessible <b>mountain</b> <b>meadow</b> was planted. Junius headed for it and was ambushed. While the Romans mounted the slope there was little fighting and when they reached level ground at the top and lined up the Samnites panicked and fled. The woods blocked their escape and most were killed. Meanwhile, the Etruscans besieged Sutrium, an ally which the Romans saw as their key to Etruria. [...] Aemilius came to help and the next day the Etruscans offered battle. It was a long and bloody fight. The Romans were starting to gain the upper hand, but darkness stopped the battle. There was no further fighting that year as the Etruscans had lost their first line and only had their reservists left and the Romans had suffered many casualties.|$|E

A {{lady that}} was {{beautiful}} as day Sat by me at a rustic festival With other beauties on a <b>mountain</b> <b>meadow,</b> And {{she was the}} most beautiful of all; Then but fifteen, and still as beautiful. The mountain flowers grew thickly round about. I made a wreath with some of these; I ask'd A ribbon from her hair to bind it with; I whisper'd, Let me crown you Queen of Beauty, And softly placed the chaplet on her head. A colour, which has colour'd all my life, Flush'd in her face; then I was call'd away; And presently all rose, and so departed. Ah! she had thrown my chaplet on the grass, And there I found it.

I joyed to see the streaks of day Above the purple peaks decay, [...] 20 And watch the latest line of light Just mingling with the shades of night; For day with me was time of woe When even tears refused to flow; Then would I stretch my languid frame [...] 25 Beneath the wild woods' gloomiest shade, And try to quench the ceaseless flame That on my withered vitals preyed; Would close mine eyes and dream I were On some remote and friendless plain, [...] 30 And long to leave existence there, If with it I might leave the pain That with a finger cold and lean Wrote madness on my withering mien.|$|E
