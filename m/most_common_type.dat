5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> of fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E

The decision upon a general-security women's corrective labor colony (the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> of prison in Russia) in the Republic of Mordovia, approximately 400 kilometers from Moscow, was later confirmed by Tolokonnikova's husband. The women asked authorities to let them serve their sentence at the pre-trial detention facility in Moscow. Their request was denied, and Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were then dispatched to penal colonies in Mordovia and Perm Oblast, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E
5|$|Standardized system: Boots and {{bindings}} have {{an integrated}} connection, typically a bar {{across the front}} end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> of binding.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> of home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife.

The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E

5|$|The images {{returned}} from Galileo, {{and the subsequent}} measurement of Ida's mass, provided {{new insights into the}} geology of S-type asteroids. Before the Galileo flyby, many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition.

Data {{returned from}} the flyby pointed to S-type asteroids as the source for the ordinary chondrite meteorites, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> found on the Earth's surface.|$|E

The second <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> of electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where {{the only difference is}} that water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E
