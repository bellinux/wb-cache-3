5000|$|Nonparametric {{regression}} models sometimes use an AIC {{based on the}} [...] "effective number of parameters". This penalizes a measure of fit by the trace of the smoothing matrix—essentially how much each data point contributes to estimating itself, summed across all data points. If, however, you use leave-one-out cross validation in the <b>model</b> <b>fitting</b> phase, the trace of the smoothing matrix is always zero, corresponding to zero parameters for the AIC. Thus, NPMR with cross-validation in the <b>model</b> <b>fitting</b> phase already penalizes the measure of fit, such that the error rate of the training data set is expected to approximate the error rate in a validation data set. In other words, the training error rate approximates the prediction (extra-sample) error rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Applying surface <b>fitting</b> <b>models</b> to {{reconstruct}} 3 -D objects with free-form features is widely employed from toy industry to medical surgery. However, reconstruction of free-form surfaces from range-image data always prone to intensive manual operations, and some technical skills are always needed. Recently, research {{focus on the}} studies of improving surface reconstruction results to achieve better quality with simple processing procedures. The research aims to report some strategies that provide guidelines to select appropriate surface <b>fitting</b> <b>models</b> for achieving the required quality at the shortest time. The surface <b>fitting</b> <b>models</b> including Extrusion, Revolution, Sweeping, Coons and Loft were detailed examined and compared with their abilities in the reconstruction of primitive 3 -D objects. Findings of the research illustrated that the listed <b>fitting</b> <b>models</b> could work well for a specific group of object surfaces. A shorter surface reconstruction time and better fitting result can be achieved from the recommended <b>fitting</b> <b>models.</b> A table categorizes surface <b>fitting</b> <b>models</b> provide the best fitting to various shape primitive 3 -D objects. Successfully apply the proposed surface fitting selection approach can simplify intensive learning of various surface modelling tools, and also build up confidence for unskilful designers in the using sophisticated computer-aided surface modelling software.
