6000|$|Since I left, I have heard, from a {{reliable}} source, that <b>my</b> <b>Sergeant</b> has gone home; therefore, the small romance that budded {{the first day}} I saw him, has blossomed into its second chapter, and I now imagine [...] "dearest Jane" [...] filling my place, tending the wounds I tended, brushing the curly jungle I brushed, loving the excellent little youth I loved, and eventually walking altarward, with the Sergeant stumping gallantly at her side. If she doesn't do all this, and no end more, I'll never forgive her; and sincerely pray to the guardian saint of lovers, that [...] "Baby B." [...] may prosper in his wooing, and his name be long in the land.|$|E

We have news that he is making for Harwich, where a vessel lies waiting to carry him to France, and we expect that he will ride this way. Three hours ago a young man unable clearly to account for himself rode into our net, and was brought to me. He was the bearer of a letter to Colonel Pride from Joseph Ashburn. He had given <b>my</b> <b>sergeant</b> a wrong name, and betrayed such anxiety to be gone that I deemed his errand a suspicious one, and broke the seal of that letter. You may thank God, Galliard, every night of your life that I did so." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, as {{our plans}} were made, {{we thought it}} best to carry them out at once, lest some fresh cause of quarrel should break out between our followers. The Bart and his men rode off, therefore, he having first torn the lace from his sleeves, and the gorget and sash from his uniform, {{so that he might}} pass as a simple trooper. He {{explained}} to his men what it was that was expected of them, and though they did not raise a cry or wave their weapons as mine might have done, there was an expression upon their stolid and clean-shaven faces which filled me with confidence. Their tunics were left unbuttoned, their scabbards and helmets stained with dirt, and their harness badly fastened, so that they might look the part of deserters, without order or discipline. At six o'clock next morning they were to gain command of the main gate of the Abbey, while at that same hour my hussars were to gallop up to it from outside. The Bart and I pledged our words to it before he trotted off with his detachment. <b>My</b> <b>sergeant,</b> Papilette, with two troopers, followed the English at a distance, and returned in half an hour to say that, after some parley, and the flashing of lanterns upon them from the grille, they had been admitted into the Abbey.|$|E

I dispatched <b>my</b> <b>sergeant</b> and the troop forthwith to London with the prisoner, keeping just two troopers with me. An hour or so later a coach clattered into the yard, and out of it stepped a short, lean man in black, with a very evil face and a crooked eye, who bawled {{out that he was}} Joseph Ashburn of Castle Marleigh, a friend of the Lord General's, and that he must have horses on the instant to proceed upon his journey to London. I was in the yard at the time, and hearing the full announcement I guessed what his business in London was. He entered the inn to refresh himself and I followed him. In the common room the first man his eyes lighted on was your son. He gasped at sight of him, and when he had recovered his breath he let fly as round a volley of blasphemy as ever I heard from the lips of a Puritan. When that was over, [...] "Fool," [...] he yells, [...] "what make you here?" [...] The lad stammered and grew confused. At last--"I was detained here," [...] says he. [...] "Detained!" [...] thunders the other, [...] "and by whom?" [...] "By my father, you murdering villain!" [...] was the hot answer.|$|E

5000|$|After his graduation, World War II broke out. He {{was sent}} to the front and {{assigned}} to the Fifth Army. When Danielyan arrived, fighting soon commenced between German and Soviet forces near Kiev. Danielyan describes the event as follows: Our casualties were terrifying! We had no communication with our headquarters. There was no discipline or order among our soldiers and panic began. Very soon, German tanks came nearer and we had to retreat into the forests, throwing away our arms. One of <b>my</b> <b>sergeants</b> and I managed to get some civilian clothes in the nearest village and made our way to the east hoping to get through the front line. But, alas, while going through a village we were halted by German guards and sent to a prisoner of war camp.|$|R
5000|$|The second bomb {{plunged into}} a muddy field at around 700 mi/h m/s and {{disintegrated}} without detonation of its conventional explosives. The tail was discovered about 20 ft below ground. Pieces of the bomb were recovered. Although the bomb was partially armed when it left the aircraft, an unclosed high-voltage switch had prevented it from fully arming. In 2013, ReVelle recalled the moment the second bomb's switch was found.Until my death I will never forget hearing <b>my</b> <b>sergeant</b> say, [...] "Lieutenant, we found the arm/safe switch." [...] And I said, [...] "Great." [...] He said, [...] "Not great. It's on arm." ...|$|E

During one of these exploits, a recruit from Fort Riley (along with twelve companions) intended to pull back Allen’s ears. As a result, the recruit {{was sent back to}} Fort Riley in an ambulance. In another incident, Allen entered a saloon while it was being vandalized by eight soldiers. Allen defeated each soldier and dragged them to the hoosegow. He arrested seven soldiers, but the eighth one managed to flee. Allen went to Fort Riley the next morning in order to arrest the eighth soldier. When the captain learned that Allen was present, he stated: “Great Scott, that’s the man who licked <b>my</b> <b>sergeant!</b> He can have him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to <b>my</b> room, <b>Sergeant</b> Hardy, and I'll {{tell you}} all about it," [...] she said, leading the way to her apartment, where the {{sergeant}} placed himself upon a chair, bolt upright, as if he {{were going to have a}} tooth drawn, or were about to illustrate some new species of sitting-drill.|$|R

Your men drill <b>my</b> <b>sergeants</b> {{four hours}} a day, and for the other eight each of them is repeating the instructions that he has received to three others. So {{that by the time}} we are in movement again I hope to have a sergeant who knows something of his duty to each fifty men. I can assure you that in addition to the great need for such men when the troops are out skirmishing, or otherwise detached in small parties, I felt that their appearance on parade was greatly marred {{by the fact that the}} non-commissioned officers did not know their proper places or their proper work, which neither Bull nor Macwitty, nor indeed the company officers, could instruct them in, all being cavalrymen." ...|$|R

5000|$|Unfortunately, {{the medal}} {{would have to}} be awarded posthumously. A little more than a week later Rivers would again {{distinguish}} himself leading the platoon, but this time he himself would not be so fortunate. On November 16 Able Company, with Rivers in the lead tank, would lead another assault. This time the target was German positions in Guebling. On the way into the town, Rivers' tank hit a mine, disabling it and leaving Rivers with a significant injury. Shrapnel had cut his leg from knee to thigh and as deep as the bone. His commanding officer, Captain David J. Williams, later remembered what happened when he {{and the rest of the}} company came to aid Rivers:With the morphine needle in my right hand about a half inch from Sergeant Rivers' leg, I could have told <b>my</b> <b>sergeant</b> to hold him down. I said, “Ruben, you're going back. You've got a million-dollar wound. You're going back to Tecumseh. You're getting out of this. You got a Silver Star and a Purple Heart.” He says, “Captain, you're going to need me.” I said, “I'm giving you a direct order! You're going back!” I said, Medics, get the stretcher.” He pushed the needle away and got up. He said, “This is one order, the only order I'll ever disobey.” ...|$|E
