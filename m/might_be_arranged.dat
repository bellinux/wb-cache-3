In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, {{influenced}} by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery {{of death in the}} forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or [...] "Art of Dying". [...] It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope UrbanVIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. [...] As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.|$|E

6000|$|The tobacco {{merchant}} {{made him}} a little half‐ironical inclination. “Colonel Morales will appreciate the consideration I have shown him in coming myself,” he said. “The affair <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>arranged</b> differently had I sent {{one or two of}} my men who have a little account with him.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Her style {{could be}} {{described}} as decorative, intimate, dream-like, naive, and eccentric. The colors of the portrait are striking, with a variety of green tones - from Granny Smith apples to fresh cut grass - contrasting against her bright white blouse and the black animals. While the foliage creates the illusion of a lush jungle scene, the portrait itself is remarkably flat and static, with each element competing on the same plane. The placement of the creatures also seems incredibly staged, suggesting that Kahlo is not painting attempting to conjure a real scene, but instead <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranging</b> symbolic elements to communicate a feeling or idea.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} {{you have a}} bigger interest in the farm than you had in the hotel and something <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged.</b> Anyhow, come over and hear what our friend has to say." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{governor}} laughed, {{and said}} he thought that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged,</b> and even allowed them another five minutes, while they talked of what these clothes should be. Then he departed with Bernaldez, leaving them alone.|$|E
60|$|There was, indeed, {{a certain}} undeveloped idea held {{out that some}} of the duplicates of Fergus's {{precious}} collection <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> as a sample of the specimens of minerals and fossils of Rockquay at the long-talked-of sale of work.|$|E
6000|$|... "However it <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>arranged</b> at first, {{it ought}} to remain now. Even though Ayala and I are only girls, {{we ought not to}} be changed about as though we were horses. If she had done {{anything}} wrong,--but Uncle Tom says that she has done nothing wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If madame {{would allow}} him to consult the owner of this so charming watch, the affair <b>might</b> yet <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> in a {{satisfactory}} manner. If madame would leave her address, he would report to her in a few hours, and have the happiness of obliging the dear lady." ...|$|R
60|$|George, as {{he heard}} this, at once {{determined}} that he must persuade Mr. Hart to include Mr. Walker's little account in that due to himself. It {{was only a matter}} of a few hundreds, and <b>might</b> surely <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> when so much real money would be passing from hand to hand.|$|R
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the jail, the turnkey informed them that it was against orders to admit any one after dark; but he intimated that the matter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> with {{any one of the}} constables who had brought the prisoners there.|$|E
60|$|He {{assured her}} that her {{kindness}} did comfort him; but he hoped better than that; he still thought that something better <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> if she would only go on with her task. So she went on painfully toiling through figures.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} he had called twice on the gentleman, but without an appointment--("I thought if I wasn't big enough, my {{business}} was")--and each time had found him engaged.

6000|$|... "Thou may'st have reason; and yet I wish thou wert more {{in error}} than ever Christian was! These are rugged mountains, Melchior, and, fairly passed, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> so <b>arranged</b> {{that the boy}} should forget Switzerland for ever. He might become a Genoese, in which event, dost thou not see the means of {{overcoming}} some of the present difficulty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such a thing <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> planned, <b>arranged,</b> practised, and ultimately, after a {{great deal}} of trouble, {{successfully}} carried out, but human intelligence could not grasp the other as a possibility.|$|R
5000|$|Act Three {{takes place}} {{a month later}} {{on the eve of}} Socrates’ execution. In Socrates’ jail cell, Socrates’ best friend, Crito, and Socrates’ wife, Xanthippe, take turns trying to {{convince}} the condemned man that he should escape, something that <b>might</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>arranged.</b> Socrates refuses, saying that to do so would further corrupt the young, something he swore to the jury he would never do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. That {{would be}} impossible. We {{have agreed to}} take her, and must bear with it. And I would not have her moved from this, if I thought that if she stayed awhile it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> that she might return from us direct to her husband." ...|$|E
60|$|She had {{nevertheless}} been {{anxious to}} hear what guests were expected at the Manor House. Sir Felix had promised to come down on Saturday, {{with the intention of}} returning on Monday, and Lady Carbury had hoped that some visiting <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> between Caversham and the Manor House, so that her son might have the full advantage of his closeness to Marie Melmotte.|$|E
6000|$|... "And a {{representative}} with full powers is legally a principal {{under a different}} name. I think this matter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> to our mutual satisfaction, Dr. Etherington, and the intention of poor Betsey most completely executed; she, poor woman, knew little of business, as was best for her sex; and when women undertake affairs of magnitude, they are very apt to make awkward work of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{my way of}} {{thinking}} there is no doubt of it. It was for that reason that I ventured to come 'ere. In the 'ope that I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> hinstrumental in <b>arranging</b> a meeting." ...|$|R
6000|$|It had {{occurred}} to her that these flowers <b>might</b> <b>be</b> so <b>arranged</b> on the wall as to form the word [...] "Welcome;" [...] and when she suggested her idea to the boys, after Mopsey had gone into his room, they were delighted. Therefore the delay caused by the author enabled them to go to work upon this last and most beautiful of their decorations at once.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{language}} {{sophistication of the}} witnesses {{on behalf of the}} non-US party, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> necessary to <b>arrange</b> for an interpreter to translate trial testimony. Interpreters cost money, which increases the costs of the trial.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] Monsieur D'Estanges said, [...] "surely this quarrel <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> without fighting. Monsieur de Fontaine {{addressed}} my principal, doubtless under a misapprehension, {{with some}} roughness, {{which was not}} unnaturally resented. If Monsieur de Fontaine will express his regret, which he certainly could do without loss of dignity, for {{the manner in which}} he spoke; my principal would, I am sure, gladly accept his apology." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nor was D'Arnot mistaken. A {{week later}} on Monsieur Flaubert was {{announced}} about eleven in the morning, as D'Arnot and Tarzan were breakfasting. Monsieur Flaubert was an impressively polite gentleman. With many low bows he delivered Monsieur le Count de Coude's challenge to Monsieur Tarzan. Would monsieur be so very kind as to arrange {{to have a}} friend meet Monsieur Flaubert at as early an hour as convenient, that the details <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned? ...|$|E

These are a few of my plans for the future, Robert, and I shall want the co-operation of disinterested men like yourself in all of them. But how brightly the sun shines, and how sweet the countryside looks! The world is very beautiful, and I should like to leave it happier than I found it. Let us walk out together, Robert, and you will tell me of any fresh cases where I may be of assistance." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Aristotle then, a hexis is an {{arrangement}} of parts such that the arrangement might have excellence, being well arranged, or in contrast, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> badly <b>arranged.</b> Also see Aristotle's Categories viii where a hexis ("habit" [...] in the translation of Edghill) is contrasted with a disposition (diathesis) in terms of it being more permanent and less easy to change. The example given is [...] "knowledge" [...] (epistemē).|$|R
6000|$|... "And that's all {{the good}} you have {{obtained}} from three perusals of the Commentaries on Scottish Criminal Jurisprudence?" [...] said his companion. [...] "I suppose the learned author very little thinks that the facts which his erudition and acuteness have accumulated for the illustration of legal doctrines, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> so <b>arranged</b> as to form a sort of appendix to the half-bound and slip-shod volumes of the circulating library." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But don't {{you see and}} {{understand}} {{that if you are}} already the property of a young man, and he were to find out this night's excursion, he may be angry with you and part from you for ever?

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Austin, slowly, [...] "a {{means of}} raising it has {{occurred}} to me. You see, as {{seems to have}} been the case with you, there is money in the family, and ethically I really think a little of it belongs to me. It is not--for several reasons--a pleasant thing to ask for it. In fact, I fancied once I'd have starved before I did so, but it couldn't be harder than what we have been doing here. One could cable to Las Palmas, and a credit <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged</b> by wire with one of the banking agencies there." ...|$|E
60|$|The two men {{after this}} {{remained}} {{silent for a}} while; and then the doctor, renewing the subject {{for which he had}} been summoned into the book-room, remarked, that as Scatcherd was now in the country--he did not say, was now at Boxall Hill, as he did not wish to wound the squire's ears--perhaps he had better go and see him, and ascertain in what way this affair of the money <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged.</b> There was no doubt, he said, that Scatcherd would supply the sum required at a lower rate of interest than that at which it could be procured through Umbleby's means.|$|E
60|$|Hereward was minded {{at first}} to fight and die. But Gilbert, who--to do him justice--wished no harm to his ancient squire, {{reasoned}} with him. Why should he destroy not only himself, but perhaps his people likewise? Why should he throw away his last chance? The king was not so angry as he seemed; and if Hereward would but be reasonable, the matter <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged.</b> As it was, he {{was not to be}} put to strong prison. He was to be in the custody of Robert of Herepol, Châtelain of Bedford, who, Hereward knew, was a reasonable and courteous man. The king had asked him, Gilbert, to take charge of Hereward.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} as {{important}} in my eyes; in fact, of the two, I would far rather that we were captured on our voyage thither, for in that case I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to <b>arrange</b> for the ransom of both of us." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he put on}} {{his helmet}} and marched out of Joan's tent as {{satisfied}} with himself as any one <b>might</b> <b>be</b> who had <b>arranged</b> a perplexed and difficult business to the content and admiration of all the parties concerned in the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} understand," [...] said the master, {{slightly}} resenting the classification, [...] "that my reason for inquiring about the permanency of your daughter's attendance was {{simply because it}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> necessary to <b>arrange</b> her studies in a way more suitable to her years; perhaps even to {{suggest to you that}} a young ladies' seminary <b>might</b> <b>be</b> more satisfactory"-- ...|$|R
