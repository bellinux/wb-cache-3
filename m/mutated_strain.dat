5|$|Like the game, {{the comic}} {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world, overrun by zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a <b>mutated</b> <b>strain</b> of the Cordyceps fungus. The comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor, Riley Abel. Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post-apocalyptic world. Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie's role in the game, considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game. The comic's art style is different than the game art—a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity.|$|E

40|$|Adherence to {{antiretroviral}} therapy {{affects the}} pharmacokinetics of antiviral drugs and activates {{a cascade of}} events ultimately leading to therapeutic success or failure. An optimal adherence usually affords minimal rounds of virus replication and rare spontaneous mutations, which are unable to be fixed in the genome because of the competition of wild-type (more fit) strains. Therefore, adherence-based therapeutic success is mostly accompanied by the prevalence of wild-type strains. In case of poor adherence, virus replication is substantial, and mutations randomly occurring tend to be fixed within the genome. Under these conditions, mutated-resistant strains will outgrow wild-type virus (sensitive to antivirals and thereby unable to compete enough with resistant strains for cellular targets) : thus, therapeutic failure occurs, and <b>mutated</b> resistant <b>strains</b> are predominant. In the case of very low or absent adherence, virologic failure occurs, although wild-type virus (whose replication is not significantly affected by antivirals) is not outgrown by <b>mutated</b> <b>strains</b> randomly produced but unable to be fixed within the genome. Taken together, these events and their consequences strongly support the relevance of a tight and continuous monitoring of adherence to antiretroviral drugs to prevent the risk of development of <b>mutated</b> <b>strains</b> often cross-resistant {{to the majority of}} antiretroviral drugs currently available...|$|R
5|$|The Last of Us is an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{video game}} developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment.

The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective; players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a <b>mutated</b> <b>strain</b> of the Cordyceps fungus. In the game's online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The game is set {{twenty years}} after an {{outbreak}} of the <b>mutated</b> <b>strain</b> of Cordyceps fungus that destroyed much of civilization. The single-player story follows Joel, tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States, {{in an attempt to}} create a potential cure against the infection to which Ellie is immune. Players make their way through various locations, fighting against the Infected and hostile human survivors. The multiplayer lets up to eight players engage in cooperative or competitive game matches. To accommodate Remastereds technical enhancements, Naughty Dog spent months developing the game, beginning upon the release of The Last of Us.|$|E
5|$|At night, Ellie catches Riley {{attempting}} {{to sneak out}} of the school, and demands to accompany her. Riley reluctantly agrees, and the two {{make their way to}} the mall, where they meet Riley's friend Winston. As Winston teaches Ellie how to ride a horse, Riley steals his radio, and discovers that an attack by the Fireflies—a rebel group opposing the quarantine zone authorities—has occurred nearby. Ellie and Riley {{make their way to the}} attack, and find that the Fireflies are wounded and outnumbered. To help, Ellie and Riley throw smoke grenades at the military, allowing the Fireflies to retreat safely. They are spotted by the military, and escape into a nearby alley, where they narrowly avoid being bitten by an Infected—zombie-like creatures infected by a <b>mutated</b> <b>strain</b> of the Cordyceps fungus.|$|E

They are heavily used in industry, and the trend is toward engineering modified microorganisms that produce high levels of specific terpenoids. Most studies have focused on creating specific heterologous pathways for sesquiterpenes in Escherichia coli or yeast. We subjected the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG 20 gene (encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase) to a set of amino acid mutations in the catalytic site at position K 197. <b>Mutated</b> <b>strains</b> have been shown to exhibit various growth rate, sterol amount, and monoterpenol-producing capacities.

The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers {{in a desperate attempt to}} stop the spread of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E

2500|$|While also {{referred}} to as zombies, the Infected are humans who have contracted a <b>mutated</b> <b>strain</b> of an infection, though neither the source nor nature of this [...] "Green Flu" [...] are made clear in the games. The most numerous Infected encountered by the survivors are the common Infected. Though individually weak, they can swarm and overwhelm the Survivors, especially when separated from their teammates.

A new addition to Left 4 Dead 2 is the Uncommon Infected unique to each campaign. By virtue of location and equipment worn pre-infection, they possess abilities that separate them from the Common Infected.
