500|$|Meanwhile, Tom and April {{continue}} {{to make fun of}} Leslie, much to the displeasure of Mark. Mark, who tells the documentary crew he is impressed that Leslie has somehow maintained her optimism about government for six years, secretly asks Ron to give her the park project. <b>Mark</b> <b>said</b> doing so would return a favor Ron owes him for unspecified reasons. Leslie and Ann are extremely excited about the new exploratory subcommittee, and the department celebrates by getting drunk. Despite her skepticism about politics and government, a drunken Ann pledges {{to do whatever it takes}} to help get the pit filled in, [...] "even if it takes two months". The episode ends with Ron explaining to the documentary crew how he makes his office as uninviting as possible.|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Tony Mark, the blood, {{sweat and}} heat captured on-camera {{in the production}} was mirrored behind the scenes. [...] "It's a tough, tough movie about a tough, tough subject", <b>Mark</b> <b>said</b> in an interview, [...] "There was a palpable tension throughout on the set. It was just like the onscreen story of three guys who fight with each other, but {{when the time comes}} to do the work, they come together to get the job done." [...] Renner remembered, [...] "I got food bugs. Then I got food poisoning: lost 15lbs in three days". In addition to the burden of the heat, the bomb suit he had to wear all day weighed [...] In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy, Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle, which delayed filming because he could not walk. At that point, [...] "people wanted to quit. All the departments were struggling to get their job done, none of them were communicating". A week later, filming resumed.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture {{can be summed up in}} the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, <b>Mark</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E

2500|$|Dick Klein {{wanted a}} name that evoked Chicago's {{traditional}} meat packing industry and the Chicago Stadium's proximity to the Union Stock Yards. Klein considered names like Matadors or Toreadors, but dismissed them, saying, [...] "If you think about it, no team {{with as many as}} three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for the [...]" [...] After discussing possible names with his family, Klein settled on Bulls when his son <b>Mark</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Dad, that's a bunch of bull!" ...|$|E
