40|$|Today, like {{no other}} time in our recent history, the term “accounting ” evokes much emotion. Practices at {{companies}} such as Enron, Arthur Anderson, and WorldCom have shaken {{the confidence of the}} world’s economic community. Innovative companies in all sectors are taking this opportunity to review their own accounting procedures. Honest financial performance demands honest accounting. Likewise, truly understanding a company’s environmental performance, as a first step toward improving it, depends on accurately accounting for the materials that are used. <b>Materials</b> <b>accounting</b> generally involves determining the amount of materials in inventory, amount brought on site, produced on site, recycled on site, consumed in process, produced as non-product output, shipped in (or as) product, and amount in ending inventory. <b>Materials</b> <b>accounting</b> provides a clear picture of the use and potential waste involved with each material accounted for.

40|$|The Federal Nuclear <b>Material</b> Control and <b>Accounting</b> Information System (FIS) is the {{national}} information source on nuclear <b>material</b> <b>accounting</b> of the Russian Federation (RF). RF regulations mandated {{the creation of a}} national nuclear <b>material</b> <b>accounting</b> system to be managed by Federal Agency For Atomic Energy (Rosatom), and for the past decade, the FIS has been developed for all organizations required to report to Rosatom. The system represents a successful integration of U.

This paper discusses crucial elements to ensure Sustainability of the FIS. A long-term plan for operation and maintenance of the information system is critical to a sustainable national accounting system. Plans undertaken throughout the FIS Project lifecycle have supported the necessary elements to ensure success. Through the next two years, long-term planning will be reevaluated and the successful elements and new initiatives will become part of an overall Operations Management Program. FIS resource needs will be managed through prioritization and ranking for each Program element, including: system operation; revising and implementing supporting regulations; establishing monitoring and control mechanisms to ensure validity of the data reported; maintaining and improving communication channels; and establishing regular FIS training.

40|$|Nuclear {{security}} {{practices have}} been a part of the development of China’s nuclear industry from the beginning, and they remain an important part of nuclear operations. The Chinese government pays close attention to nuclear security and has set up laws and regulations to govern the use of nuclear materials. The companies and operators that use nuclear materials have developed operational manuals and regulations to ensure the protection and control of nuclear materials based on national laws and regulations. These measures explain why there are no reported losses of nuclear materials from Chinese facilities. In light of recent reforms and the “opening” of China, which has increased communication with foreigners and has led to other changes in the international environment, threats to nuclear material security are changing and posing new challenges to Chinese nuclear management. The Chinese government is working to improve regulations to confront these new threats. Nuclear <b>material</b> <b>accounting</b> is one of the most important parts of nuclear material security.

40|$|Modern nuclear <b>materials</b> <b>accounting</b> and {{safeguards}} measurement {{systems are}} becoming increasingly advanced as they embrace emerging technologies. However, many facilities still rely on human intervention to update <b>materials</b> <b>accounting</b> records. The demand for nuclear materials safeguards information continues to increase while general industry and government down-sizing has resulted in less availability of qualified staff. Future safeguards requirements will necessitate access to information through unattended and/or remote monitoring systems requiring minimal human intervention.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} design {{issues for}} establishing a near-real-time accountability (NRTA) system for modem fuel fabrication facilities; however, the approach for developing an NRTA {{could be applied}} to many nuclear facilities planned for construction. The proposed design is for a computerized <b>materials</b> <b>accounting</b> system capable of providing near-real-time materials balances and associated variances. The system must accommodate data from both destructive analysis (DA) and nondestructive analyses (NDA) of material-in-process and interim storage. DA and mass measurements are used by facility operations for process control and drawing material balances. NDA measurements will be used primarily by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors for verification of inventories. An essential component of the NRTA system is a software interface between the facility`s process control computer and the NRTA computer. The purpose of the interface is to facilitate the use of process measurement and material transfer data to compute materials unaccounted for (MUF), limit of error of MUF (LEMUF), and covariance matrices for a sequence of MUFs. The design of the interface facilitates use of LANL developed software <b>Materials</b> <b>Accounting</b> with Sequential Testing (MAWST) for the NRTA calculations described above.
