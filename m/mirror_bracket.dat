50|$|He {{invented a}} special <b>mirror</b> <b>bracket</b> which allowed {{you to see}} {{yourself}} as others see you. He went on to receive 4 more patents.|$|E
50|$|In late 2007, a minor {{update to}} the Saf-T-Liner C2 was made. To improve driver sightlines, the <b>mirror</b> <b>bracket</b> for the passenger-side {{rear-view}} mirrors was extended. The passenger windows were redesigned, with equal-sized window sashes (previously, {{the top half}} was larger). In the rear, the taillights were redesigned and enlarged, later becoming a standard design for all Thomas buses.|$|E
50|$|Changes to the 2002-2003 ZX-9R {{included}} a new tail fairing, {{a single piece}} front mudguard, {{the loss of the}} passenger grab handles and the B/C/E model H-bar <b>mirror</b> <b>bracket.</b> Mechanical additions {{included a}} top braced swingarm (claimed 20% stronger) and rear shock with a side facing fluid reservoir, stiffened frame with relocated solid engine mounts, increased trail and reduced fork offset, and new Nissin four-piston caliper brakes and 320 mm discs at the front wheel. Slight engine modifications included a return to the B/C model style Keihin CVKD carburettor and a 10% heavier crankshaft offset by a reduced diameter flywheel reported to help the engine spin up quicker, boosting low and mid-range torque.|$|E
50|$|On the {{entrance}} tower, the roofline is continued with {{a section of}} concrete laid to appear as a slightly projecting flat course. The tower's roofline is broken by another double-hung two-over-two round-arched window flanked by <b>mirroring</b> <b>brackets.</b> Above its projecting cornice is a small jerkin-roofed one-over-one round-arched window. The top of the peak has an iron weathervane and some other decor.|$|R
50|$|Corner reflectors {{occur in}} two varieties. In {{the more common}} form, the corner is {{literally}} the truncated corner of a cube of transparent material such as conventional optical glass. In this structure, the reflection is achieved either by total internal reflection or silvering of the outer cube surfaces. The second form uses mutually perpendicular flat <b>mirrors</b> <b>bracketing</b> an air space. These two types have similar optical properties.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{close range}} {{photogrammetry}} {{has proven to}} be a precise and efficient measurement technique for the assessment of shape accuracies of solar concentrators and their components. The flexibility of photogrammetry to provide high accuracy 3 d-coordinate measurements over almost any scale resulted in the development of the QFoto system for inline quality control of support structures in parabolic trough collector assembly lines before the mirror panels are attached. The paper gives an overview of the capabilities of the QFoto system, its layout and measurement adapters and a description of the employed in-situ camera calibration. Special attention is given to the internal quality control of the system and features like the statistical process control, and the evaluation of the angles of all <b>mirror</b> <b>brackets</b> within one single measurement using specific measurement adapters...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{two high}} flow, high modulus fiber-glass reinforced nylon 6 (HMG series) grades for automotive and other industrial applications requiring high stiffness and high strength. These materials combined the following improved technological (injection molding, vibration welding, etc.) and mechanical performance properties such as greater dimensional stability, higher short-term (strength and stiffness) and long-term (fatigue and creep). The current and possible applications of these plastics includes auto <b>mirror</b> housing <b>brackets,</b> clutch pedals, clutch master cylinders, ski bindings, steering wheels, levers, auto seat frames, door handles and door lock mechanisms. In Part I of this paper, we are presenting results of reinforcement analysis with {{the influence of}} level of loading and geometrical parameters of used fiber-glass. KEY WORDS: nylon, reinforcement, fiber-glass, performance...|$|R
5000|$|The central facade {{segment is}} surmounted by a {{decorated}} parapet projection that spans {{the width of}} its three constituent bays. The two centrally disposed engaged piers are topped with a curved pediment, while the two framing piers are each topped with a small triangular pediment moulding. In the parapet, a small, semicircular gable and projecting panel supported either side by curved <b>brackets</b> <b>mirror</b> the curve in the pediment below. The words 'Headrick's' and [...] "Established 1860" [...] are lettered on {{this part of the}} ornate parapet. Above each framing pier and their pediments the parapet is articulated with a pedestal-like moulding.|$|R
