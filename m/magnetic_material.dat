Because of the large density of photon states in the cavity, {{the interaction between the}} electromagnetic field of the light and the electronic transitions of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> is enhanced, resulting in a larger difference between the velocities of the right- and left-hand circularized polarization, therefore enhancing Faraday rotation.|$|E
25|$|Type K (chromel–alumel) is {{the most}} common {{general-purpose}} thermocouple with a sensitivity of approximately 41µV/°C. It is inexpensive, and a wide variety of probes are available in its −200°C to +1350°C (−330°F to +2460°F) range. Type K was specified at a time when metallurgy was less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may vary considerably between samples. One of the constituent metals, nickel, is magnetic; a characteristic of thermocouples made with <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> is that they undergo a deviation in output when the material reaches its Curie point, which occurs for type K thermocouples at around 185°C.|$|E
25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with <b>magnetic</b> <b>material.</b> The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.|$|E

The magnetic flux produced by this ideal design would be perfectly uniform and be entirely confined to either the bore of the cylinder or {{the outside of the}} cylinder. Of course, the ideal case of infinite length is not realizable and in practice the finite length of the cylinders produces end effects which introduce non-uniformities in the field. The difficulty of manufacturing a cylinder with a continuously varying magnetization also usually leads to the design being broken into segments.|$|E

Additional cabin space was also provided to accommodate the scientists. Although the converted Galilee had magnetic constants lower than any equivalent ship at the time, corrections were still required to take account of the remaining <b>magnetic</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, {{and that includes}} the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.|$|E
25|$|Nothing in the {{principle}} {{of any of the}} motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> of the rotor is made {{in the form of a}} cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The novel soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> and <b>magnetic</b> core {{structure}} used in planar transformer have been studied. The frequency, electrical and structure {{feature of the}} planar transformer with matrix structure was described. Then the novel <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> used in the planar transformer were discussed, which were very different from ferrite block. The silicon steel strip was first represented, the magnetic characteristic of which was related to its geometric dimension, working frequency and the component.

Nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively. Passive targeting exploits {{the difference between}} tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels. Blood vessels in tumors are [...] "leaky" [...] because they have gaps from 200–2000nm, which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor. Active targeting uses biological molecules (antibodies, proteins, DNA and receptor ligands) to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells.

2500|$|In step 2, {{since there}} is no current observed, one might {{conclude}} that the magnetic field did not rotate with the rotating magnet. (Whether it does or does not effectively or relatively, the Lorentz force is zero since v is zero relative to the laboratory frame. So there is no current measuring from laboratory frame.) The use of the Lorentz equation to explain this paradox has led to a debate in the literature {{as to whether or not}} a magnetic field rotates with a magnet. Since the force on charges expressed by the Lorentz equation depends upon the relative motion of the magnetic field (i.e. the laboratory frame) to the conductor where the EMF is located it was speculated that in the case when the magnet rotates with the disk but a voltage still develops, the magnetic field (i.e. the laboratory frame) must therefore not rotate with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> (of course since it is the laboratory frame), while the effective definition of magnetic field frame or the [...] "effective/relative rotation of the field" [...] turns with no relative motion with respect to the conductive disk.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} to the static convergence and purity problems {{is a set of}} color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>material,</b> with their magnetic fields parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field vector can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [...] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.|$|E
