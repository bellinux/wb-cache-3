5000|$|The RCM is a {{representation}} of what is {{commonly referred to as}} records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches. These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994, referred in a 1959 American Archivist article to a [...] "continuum of (public) records administration" [...] from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a [...] "cultural end-product". Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple [...] "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" [...] involved in <b>managing</b> <b>records</b> and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.|$|E

One of the significant outcomes of computerization is that managing electronic records now relies on IT {{and it needs to be}} integrated into the business processes of an organization.
