Until December 2015, the Netherlands had Europe's largest fleet light-duty plug-in vehicles. Plug-in sales fell sharply during 2016, and as a result, by early October 2016, the Netherlands {{listed as the}} third largest European plug-in market, after being surpassed during the year by both Norway and France. , the Netherlands had the second largest plug-in <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> per capita in the world after Norway. The stock of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles registered in the Netherlands achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in November 2016.|$|E

25|$|One early {{introduction}} of energy market concepts and privatization to electric power systems {{took place in}} Chile in the early 1981s, in parallel with other market-oriented reforms associated with the Chicago Boys. The Chilean model was generally perceived as successful in bringing rationality and transparency to power pricing. Argentina improved on the Chilean model by imposing strict limits on <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> and by improving the structure of payments to units held in reserve to assure system reliability. One of the principal purposes of the {{introduction of}} market concepts in Argentina was to privatize existing generation assets (which had fallen into disrepair under the government-owned monopoly, resulting in frequent service interruptions) and to attract capital needed for rehabilitation of those assets and for system expansion. The World Bank was active in introducing a variety of hybrid markets in other Latin American nations, including Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, during the 1990s, with limited success.|$|E

25|$|In November 2013 the Netherlands {{became the}} first country where a plug-in hybrid topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. During November sales were led by the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV with 2,736 units, {{capturing}} a market share of 6.8% of new passenger cars sold that month. Again in December 2013 the Outlander P-HEV ranked as the top selling new car {{in the country with}} 4,976 units, representing a 12.6% market share of new car sales. These record sales allowed the Netherlands to become the second country, after Norway, where plug-in electric cars have topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. , the Netherlands was the country with highest plug-in hybrid <b>market</b> <b>concentration,</b> with 1.45 vehicles registered per 1,000 people. Most of the initial growth of the Dutch plug-in hybrid stock took place in 2013, with 20,164 units sold that year representing a rate of growth of 365% from 2012. Another surge in plug-in hybrid sales took place in 2015, particularly during the last two months, with 41,226 plug-in hybrids registered in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Agricultural {{economics}} {{refers to}} economics {{as it relates}} to the [...] "production, distribution and consumption of [...] goods and services". Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century. Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post-American Civil War Southern United States to the European feudal system of manorialism. In the United States, and elsewhere, food costs attributed to food processing, distribution, and agricultural marketing, sometimes referred to as the value chain, have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. <b>Market</b> <b>concentration</b> has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased <b>market</b> <b>concentration</b> is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{proportion}} and distribution of organic produce sold through different marketing channels by a sample of organic farmers in three "core" areas of organic farming in England and Wales. More specifically, it conducts a quantitative analysis of <b>marketing</b> <b>concentration</b> and geographical dispersion within different travel time zones. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative database was constructed on the marketing channels and travel time zones used by 61 organic farmers to sell their produce and purchase necessary inputs. Indices of <b>marketing</b> <b>concentration</b> and geographical dispersion (outputs and inputs) were then calculated for each farm and region. Findings - Results indicate a high level of <b>marketing</b> <b>concentration,</b> dominated by <b>marketing</b> cooperatives, direct marketing and abattoir/processors. Similar levels of concentration are recorded for the indices of geographical dispersion (especially outputs). Results vary significantly between the three regions, but it is clear that organic farmers in each region make use of different combinations of marketing channels, both local and national, in increasingly hybridised and individualised supply chains. Research limitations/implications - Many organic farmers are developing hybridised supply chains, including both local and more conventional marketing channels, and further research is needed into the identified regional differences and the reasons for developing what are often very individualised marketing chains. Originality/value - This is the first attempt to calculate indices of <b>marketing</b> <b>concentration</b> and geographical dispersion for organic farms in different regions of England and Wales. The paper also contributes to debates on the potential impact of organic farming on rural development and the local economy...|$|R

Re-examining the findings in the regionalisation-globalisation literature that show a general bias among firms towards home region markets, this cross-sectional study determines that home market size and home regional <b>market</b> <b>concentrations</b> heavily influence emergent regionalisation patterns. Implications on theory-building within the sphere of the regionalisation-globalisation debate are explored, with a particular focus on measure development.

It concludes that prices and diversity, respectively, are determined by similar competitive relations but at different market levels. ...|$|R

30|$|A crucial {{question}} in all risk assessment methodologies concerns how to aggregate the overall {{risk of a}} portfolio by combining the calculated risks of its individual components. For example, in the Solvency II paradigm, the market risk module comprises six submodules dealing with interest rate, equity, property, spread, currency risk, and the risk arising from <b>market</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The capital requirement for each submodule is determined based on prespecified scenarios, calibrated such that the resulting SCR should correspond to the VaR at the 99.5 % confidence level over a one-year period. Finally, the overall capital requirement for market risk is obtained by combining individual SCRs through a predefined correlation matrix (see EIOPA- 14 - 322 2014, pp. 138 – 139).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} how {{the structure}} of social networks affects innovation diffusion and competition under different information regimes. Diffusion is modeled {{as the result of}} idiosyncratic adoption thresholds, local network effects and information diffusion (broadcasting and demonstration effect from previous adopters). A high social cohesion decreases the probability of one innovation cornering the market. Nonetheless, with imperfect information, in small-world networks the higher speed of diffusion produced by the low average distance increases this probability. A low social cohesion also increases the probability of falling into traps of under-adoption. However, such probability is significantly lower with imperfect information, because such regime is characterized by higher levels of <b>market</b> <b>concentrations</b> and this reduces the frictions due to the coexistence of non-compatible product innovations. <br/...|$|R
