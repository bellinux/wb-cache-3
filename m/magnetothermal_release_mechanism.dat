40|$|The {{capabilities}} of three on-load and one off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were investigated for normal, extreme and failure type release {{operations at the}} Institute for Ocean Technology. The failure of <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> during maintenance and exercise drills is a well-documented occurrence. However, until very recently the possible causes of the failures have only been postulated but never tested in a systematic way. The current study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the operational performance of lifeboat <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with respect to normal, extreme and failure operational situations. Three twin fall davit on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and one off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> were tested in the experimental study. All the <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> design types are fully certified by the regulatory bodies. Of the three on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> two were of older existing design types while the third was of a newer (next generation) design. Of the four <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> tested, two of the mechanisms were new and never used outside of this study. Also, one of the never used new mechanisms was of an older design while the other was the next generation design. The never used mechanisms had a loading capacity of 6 tonnes, while the third on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> had been in operation for some time and had a capacity of 3 tonnes. The off-load mechanism had also been in use and had a capacity of 12 tonnes. The experiments were conducted in the material testing facility of the Institute for Ocean Technology of the National Research Council of Canada and encompassed the following tests: Inline/offline on-load tests Inline/offline static tests Offline cyclic loading Offline damage release cable Inline off-load tests Results for the above mentioned tests will be presented in this report. Thus far all the results from in-line to offline, and from dynamic to static indicate that hook C, the next generation design, appears to have a higher degree of stability than the other two sample hooks. The off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> was limited to inline tests and followed a different testing procedure as the on-load <b>mechanisms.</b> The off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> worked as intended in the limited test conditions.

In this paper the effectiveness of order <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in a job shop environment is assessed by studying the influence of single order release dimensions, instead of comparing different mechanisms as a whole. In particular, the paper aims at improving the basis for selecting the workload accounting over time and the workload control strategies, through the understanding of its impact on the overall system performance. The robustness of these order release strategies to environmental perturbations is also assessed through a plan of experiments based on the Taguchi method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a composite sandwich solar array panel with internal local stiffeners. The purpose of this investigation is {{the connection between the}} panel and the satellite structure. The application for this purpose is the Eu:CROPIS (Euglena and Combined Regenerative Organic-Food Production in Space) compact satellite. The <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to be used are Frangibolts. A main design driver is the use of as few hold down and <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as possible. This approach is well founded due to the resulting reduction in complexity of the on board computer, the harness and its connections. Furthermore, the reduction in <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> reduces the power consumption during the detumbling phase after launch. A finite element model is used to calculate the deformations, stresses and strains of the solar panel in different configurations. The numbers of hold down and <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (HDRM) as well as the layout of the internal panel stiffeners are investigated. The hold down and the bearing forces are evaluated under launch loads to examine the different array configurations...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{assumptions}} in past job shop research is that arriving jobs are immediately released to the shop floor for processing regardless of available job and shop information. In practice, jobs arriving at the shop are usually collected into a backlog file. Jobs are then <b>released</b> by some <b>mechanism</b> {{so that they can}} be processed within the time available before the due date. This study examines the effects of several <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the performance of a dual resource constrained job shop. The <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> differ in the amount and types of information used to make release decisions. Four <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are tested in conjunction with two dynamic, due date oriented dispatching rules, Modified Operation Due Date and Critical Ratio. The job shop environment is specified by two levels of due date tightness. A labor and machine limited job shop model was used to simulate the shop performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used biodegradable polymer in the controlled release of encapsulated drugs. Understanding the <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as well as which factors that affect drug release, is important {{in order to be able}} to modify drug release. Drug release from PLGA-based drug delivery systems is however complex. This review focuses on <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and provides a survey and analysis of the processes determining the release rate, which may be helpful in elucidating this complex picture. The term <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the various techniques that have been used to study <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are discussed. The physico-chemical processes that influence the rate of drug release and the various <b>mechanisms</b> of drug <b>release</b> that have been reported in the literature are analyzed in this review, and practical examples are given. The complexity of drug release from PLGA-based drug delivery systems can make the generalization of results and predictions of drug release difficult. However, this complexity also provides many possible ways of solving problems and modifying drug release. Basic, generally applicable and mechanistic research provides pieces of the puzzle, which is useful in the development of controlled-release pharmaceuticals...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade.
