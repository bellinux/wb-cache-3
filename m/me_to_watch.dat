500|$|Family Trade was {{considered}} to be a risk for GSN due to the network's history of airing mostly game shows. Greg Braxton of the Los Angeles Times called the show a [...] "game-changer", and a [...] "key part in [...] strategy to broaden its programming and brand". The day after the series premiere, Michael Tyminski of Manhattan Digest gave a negative review of the show, calling it [...] "incredibly bland", and stating that it appeared to lack much of the family drama that had previously been advertised. Writing for the Star Tribune, Neal Justin added, [...] "The toughest sell of all: Convincing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> more than one episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Heigl, who portrayed Stevens, was {{particularly}} critical of her character's relationship with O'Malley, deeming it [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl further explained her outlook on {{the progression of}} her character, [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review.|$|E
2500|$|The Song Remains The Same {{is not a}} great film, but there's {{no point}} in making excuses. [...] It's just a {{reasonably}} honest statement of where we were at that particular time. [...] It's very difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it now, but I'd like to see it in a year's time just to see how it stands up.|$|E

2500|$|Criticism {{has also}} been placed upon media outlets themselves, {{especially}} CNN. During {{the course of the}} delinquent verdict on March 17, 2013, CNN's Poppy Harlow stated that it was [...] "Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart...when that sentence came down, [...] collapsed in the arms of his attorney...He said to him, 'My life is over. No one is going to want me now.'" [...] Candy Crowley and Paul Callan were also criticized for their lack of focus on the victim and their sympathy for the rapists.|$|E
2500|$|Candy Crowley, Poppy Harlow and Paul Callan were {{criticized for}} portraying the two convicted rapists in the Steubenville High School rape case sympathetically and for placing very little {{focus on the}} victim on March 17, 2013.

2500|$|In 2005, Miike {{was invited}} to direct an episode of the Masters of Horror {{anthology}} series. The series, featuring episodes by a range of established horror directors such as John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Dario Argento, was supposed to provide directors with relative creative freedom and relaxed restrictions on violent and sexual content (some violent content was edited from the Dario Argento-directed episode [...] "Jenifer"). However, when the Showtime cable network acquired {{the rights to the}} series, the Miike-directed episode [...] "Imprint" [...] was deemed too disturbing for the network. Showtime cancelled it from the broadcast lineup even after extended negotiations, though it was retained as part of the series' DVD release. Mick Garris, creator and executive producer of the series, described the episode as [...] "amazing, but hard even for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch...</b> definitely the most disturbing film I've ever seen".|$|E

2500|$|On Friday 26 October 2007 for the People in Need Telethon [...] Podge and Rodge {{finally got}} to {{interview}} their nemesis and ultimate rival, the then host of The Late Late Show and [...] "Ireland's Alan Partridge" [...] Pat Kenny. [...] "Do the words lamb and slaughter mean anything to you?" [...] He was asked: [...] "Does it get on your tits though when people are saying, Jaysus - Pat Kenny earns how much? He should be paying <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> that shite!" [...] He was also asked: [...] "Where did the nickname Pat the Plank come from? Who {{came up with that}} beauty?" [...] Pat blamed it on Eamon Dunphy. [...] "Are you bored with the wood puns?" [...] they asked to which Pat jibed: [...] "In fairness lads I'm not the puppet round here." [...] Then {{it was time for a}} quick game of [...] "Plankety Plank" [...] which featured author Patricia Cornwell - he'd forgotten her name; Dawn French - he'd told her he'd give her €10 not to get out of bed; Brigitte Nielsen - she'd forced him to dance live on TV. Comparing Pat's bike to Gaybo's Harley-Davidson they asked: [...] "Did Fisher Price make that?" [...] And then it was back to Tubbicino, Teletubby...|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Charizanis of The Fandom Post {{found the}} anime {{portrayal}} of Eren's transformation to be amusing, starting from his [...] "almost pitiful" [...] look while declaring how he's {{going to kill}} all of the Titans. When the anime portrays him as capable of controlling his transformation, Charizanis adds [...] "Maybe one day he’ll be able to contort his body {{to be used as}} a bridge, or heal other people’s wounds, or morph his arms into sharp blades like a certain other anime character." [...] In the final anime episode, when Eren is fighting the Female Titan, he describes Eren's internal monologue as changing [...] "from the usual violent determination to a kind of gleeful madness." [...] and likens his tone to that of The Joker. Elijah Watson from Complex magazine liked the plot twist of Eren's titan form turning on the other titans that he called it a Worldstar moment. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network was fond on Eren's Titan abilities as [...] "there has not been anything as uncomfortable for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> as Eren chomping into his own hand, trying to transform. There is something visceral and real about Eren drawing blood from his own hand, and boy, it gave me the chills," [...] and later praised his thoughts when fighting the Female Titan due to the portrayal of Eren's humanity despite being a Titan.|$|E
