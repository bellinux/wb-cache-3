5000|$|A fourth trip to Tallahassee {{was made}} on Dec. 13, 2005. Black Box Voting and the {{producers}} of the film Hacking Democracy organized the test. Attending were Harris and Kathleen Wynne from Black Box Voting, Hursti, Thompson, along with Susan Pynchon of Florida Fair Elections Coalition from Volusia County, Florida, and Susan Bernecker, a former candidate for New Orleans city council who videotaped Sequoia-brand touch-screen voting machines in her district recording vote after vote for the wrong candidate. During his research, Hursti found that Diebold's cards allowed negative votes. Hursti successfully altered the votes using only a memory card, producing a one-step hack that simultaneously altered both the central tabulator results and the voting <b>machine</b> results <b>tapes</b> <b>for</b> matched (but rigged) results.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{diagonal}} processes over time bounded computations of one-tape Turing machines by diagonalizing only over those <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> which there exist formal proofs that they {{operate in the}} given time bound. This replaces the traditional “clock” in resource bounded diagonalization by formal proofs about running times and establishes close relations between properties of proof systems and existence of sharp time bounds <b>for</b> one-tape Turing <b>machine</b> complexity classes. These diagonalization methods also show that the Gap Theorem for resource bounded computations can hold only for those complexity classes which differ from the corresponding provable complexity classes. Furthermore, we show that there exist recursive time bounds T(n) such that the class of languages for which we can formally prove the existence of Turing machines which accept them in time T(n) differs from the class of languages accepted by Turing <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> which we can prove formally that they run in time T(n). We also investigate the corresponding problems <b>for</b> <b>tape</b> bound computations and discuss the difference time and tapebounded computations...|$|R

500|$|Later in 2015, Corgan {{announced}} that the band would undertake a co-headlining tour of North America with Marilyn Manson. The End Times Tour was set to begin in Concord, California, at the Concord Pavilion on July 7, and was scheduled to end with a concert in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the Riverbend Music Center on August 8. Prior to the co-headlining dates, the band performed a series of acoustic shows with drum <b>machines</b> and <b>tapes</b> <b>for</b> percussion. When the time came for the co-headlining tour, plans for a drummer fell through and Corgan recruited Chamberlin to reunite for the shows. On February 1, 2016, it was {{announced that}} the band would continue their In Plainsong acoustic tour with Jimmy Chamberlin on drums and were planning to head [...] "straight to the studio after the dates to record a brand new album inspired by the sounds explored in the new acoustic setting". On February 25, 2016, Corgan posted a video from a Los Angeles studio on the band's Facebook account, giving an update on the writing process for the new songs for the upcoming album to be released after the In Plainsong tour.|$|R
