40|$|The {{overall system}} is {{designed}} to permit automatic collection of delamination field data for bridge decks. In addition to measuring and recording the data in the field, the system provides for transferring the recorded data to a personal computer for processing and plotting. This permits rapid turnaround from data collection to a finished plot of the results in {{a fraction of the}} time previously required for manual analysis of the analog data captured on a strip chart recorder. In normal operation the Delamtect provides an analog voltage for each of two channels which is proportional to the extent of any delamination. These voltages are recorded on a strip chart for later visual analysis. An event marker voltage, produced by a <b>momentary</b> <b>push</b> <b>button</b> on the handle, is also provided by the Delamtect and recorded on a third channel of the analog recorder...|$|E
50|$|The ARP Pro Soloist would {{eventually}} be reintroduced as the updated Pro-DGX featuring <b>momentary</b> digitally-latched <b>push</b> <b>button</b> voice selector switches with LED status indicators, rather than toggle switches. It would remain in production until the company's demise in 1981.|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} a console for theater {{lighting}} control. It interfaces with a personal computer (PC) using the Universal Serial Bus (USB) giving a friendly graphical user interface for lighting control. The console, based upon the Motorola 68376 microcontroller, controls lighting instruments {{through the use of}} the industry standard DMX 512 lighting control protocol. Up to 16 sets of 8 external faders and <b>momentary</b> <b>push</b> <b>buttons</b> can be added for real time lighting control on the console. The input blocks use the queued serial peripheral interface (QSPI) and are designed to be modular so the system can be configured with different amounts and types of user inputs. The prototype system consists of two blocks of 8 faders and 8 buttons each as well as a third block containing three master fader controls. The system outputs the dimmer control data in DMX 512 format using the serial communication interface (SCI) and an RS- 485 transmitter. Also, a USB peripheral interface, firmware to control it, and a windows driver to acces...|$|R
