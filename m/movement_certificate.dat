The data were collected with the cooperation of the Sakarya Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Sakarya University International Trade Department. The database is composed of information gathered from Invoice, ATR, and Euro 1 <b>movement</b> <b>certificates,</b> as well as the certificate of origin given to the Chamber by the exporter during export transactions.|$|R

50|$|In {{place of}} a <b>movement</b> <b>certificate,</b> a simple {{declaration}} of origin on the invoice can be provided by the manufacturer or sender of the goods in {{place of a}} proper movement certificate: this is called an invoice declaration. This is an accepted alternative to the EUR.1 only if the amount of items with EU preferential origin under a single shipment does not exceed at certain amount (for a non-approved exporter). If it concerns an approved exporter (that is, a regular authorized exporter), this value limit does not apply.|$|E
50|$|Since all GS were {{certificated}} {{prior to}} the advent of RoSS, dealers resorted to the exchange of warehouse receipts rather than the physical <b>movement</b> of the <b>certificates</b> {{in the course of}} their trading activities. Bancapital conducted brokering operations based on these warehouse receipts and the 1994 scandal erupted when the physical count of certificates against warehouse receipts did not tally. The scandal was far reaching and threatened to collapse market confidence in the GS market.|$|R
25|$|Such {{nationals}} {{may create}} and manage economic enterprises, including {{any type of}} organization which they own or control (e.g. sole proprietorship, company, etc.) {{for the production of}} or trade in goods, or the provision of services. Service providers may also move to establish businesses under the Companies Act or the Registration of Business Names Act. The procedure in those cases would be the same as those applying to the establishment of business for the provision of goods by a Company. Nationals exercising this right may move to another Member State on a permanent basis. This category of person is not required to obtain a Free <b>Movement</b> of Skill <b>Certificate,</b> however Service Providers must obtain a Certificate of Registration as a CARICOM Service Provider.|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of growing dissonance between Kerala’s captive {{elephants}} and the mobile-toting population, Dr. Dinesh Arora (the then District Collector of Thiruvananthapuram) formulated {{a new set of}} regulations after a district-level meeting to prevent cruelty to elephants under the Kerala Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules 2003. The regulations came into effect from May 1, 2011 and it demanded organisers of celebrations using elephants to seek permission from the District Forest Officer, two weeks in advance. The DFO is now required to submit a copy of the permit to the Collector. This permit is based on a certificate issued by the Forest Veterinary Officer or the veterinary surgeon of the Elephant Squad. The DFO has to inspect the mahout's <b>certificate,</b> <b>movement</b> register and other documents to ensure that the elephant to be paraded is free of musth, diseases, injuries and signs of pregnancy, before issuing a permit.|$|R
40|$|Effective {{methods of}} {{traceability}} are urgently required {{for use in}} research {{as well as in}} different types of aquaculture operations and to control trade in aquatic animals and products. In regard to the marking of fish, many different tagging methods have been described and the method to be used depends on the purpose and need for tagging. In contrast, for molluscs and crustaceans, only a few methods of marking such animals have been described, due to the practical difficulties. The authors first describe the different methods for tracing fish and fishery products, by means of external tags, such as Floy tags, Carlin tags and passive integrated transponder tags; chemical marking using inorganic substances such as silver nitrate or potassium nitrate, pigments, oxytetracycline, etc.; and several different types of electronic devices in which basic information such as the strain of fish, farm of origin or weight can be stored. Genetic traceability using deoxyribonucleic acid profiling is developing quite rapidly for cultured brood stocks and wild populations. This technique may be used with very high degrees of confidence to assign to or exclude animals or products from their claimed origin, paternity or strain, and may be used as evidence in court proceedings. The second section of this paper describes the traceability of live molluscs for restocking and for human consumption. In these applications, genetic markers have been demonstrated to be suitable. Mechanical tagging on a small scale for research purposes has also been used. Otherwise, the only means of tracing live molluscs are the movement documents and the labelling on boxes that certifies the origin of the commodity. The third section describes the methods available for tracing live and dead crustaceans. A large variety of physical tagging methods for decapod crustaceans is described, such as the injection of biological stains (fast green, Niagara sky blue, trypan red and blue) and external tags such as coloured streamer tags, wire tags and a variety of anchor tags. Furthermore, a number of different internal coding methods, such as the coded micro-wire tags and injected elastomer tags are discussed in detail. As is the case for fish, genetic molecular techniques are also applied in population studies of crustaceans; some of the molecular genetic methods are described. Prawns for human consumption are most frequently packed whole or as tails after the necessary sorting, washing and freezing and the only way of performing a traceback is through documents relating to <b>movement,</b> invoices, health <b>certificates</b> and labelling of the boxes. The minimum requirements for labelling would be the content of the packages, i. e. species, quantity, identification of the manufacturer (name and address), packing place, importer/exporter or vendor of the product, in addition to the loading bill number.
