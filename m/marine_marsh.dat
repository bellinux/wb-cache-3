40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The foraminiferal {{population}} of Yaquina Bay was investigated {{to attempt a}} correlation of seasonal changes in the hydrography with observed changes in the faunal distribution patterns. The results are {{based on data from}} two spatial surveys conducted in July 1966, and late February and March, 1967. The hydrography of Yaquina Bay undergoes seasonal changes closely paralleling the seasonal precipitation pattern. Except for short-term variations, the estuarine system is partly-mixed during the period of maximum river discharge (November to May) and wellmixed from June through October. Coastal upwelling (high salinity, low temperature) has a marked influence on the hydrography of the lower bay during the summer; maximum salinities and temperatures prevail in {{the upper reaches of the}} estuary during late summer and fall. Species associations were determined by the Fager-McConnaughey correlation coefficient method; similar assemblages were found for both summer and winter surveys. A marine biofacies fauna, dominated by Elphidium microgranulosum and E. frigidum, occupies the main estuary channel for about five miles upstream. The distributional patterns of the living fauna show evidence of a stronger marine influence during the summer, corresponding to a similar pattern in the hydrography. In the lower bay, the Elphidium fauna is displaced laterally by an assemblage characterized by Trochammina charlottensis and Elphidium incertum in the middle intertidal zone. This assemblages in turn gives way to an Ammobaculites exiguus -Miliammina fusca fauna in the upper intertidal area. The Elphidium assemblage gives way to a Miliammina fauna in the upstream direction. Trochammina inflata, T. macrescens, Miliammina fusca, Jadamminina polystoma, Haplophragmoides sp., H. hancocki and Siphotrochammina lobata are the principal species found in the <b>marine</b> <b>marsh.</b> Zones of environmental similarity were defined by the index of affinity association analysis. Living and total faunas of both winter and summer surveys were considered separately; several sample groups were defined in each case. Index of affinity data can also be used to provide an index of the marine influence on the foraminiferal {{population of}} the estuary. Species diversity or the average number of species/sample, ranges from 22 in the marine biofacies zone to six on the lower bay tideflats. An intermediate value (l 0 /sample) was found for the <b>marine</b> <b>marsh.</b> Highest standing crops were found in the marshes (summer) and on the tideflats adjacent to the lower bay channel, averaging 40 and 42 /cm² respectively. Lowest values (1 to 2 cm²) were found in the middle to upper intertidal areas of the lower bay during the summer. The distribution of the total fauna is quite similar to that of the living population. Highest average values (175 /cm³) are again found in the <b>marine</b> <b>marsh</b> and in the marine biofacies zone (70 to 80 /cm³). Lowest values occur on the lower bay intertidal areas (3 to 9 /cm³). In general, the percentage representation of agglutinated species in the total fauna increases with distance upstream in the channel and with distance laterally from the channel axis. Faunas of some marsh stations are composed entirely of agglutinated species. The percentage of calcareous hyaline species shows an inverse relation to that of the agglutinated fauna, increasing in importance with approach to marine conditions. Porcelaneous and planktonic species are generally minor constituents in the total fauna and are restricted to the marine biofacies as it is developed in the estuary. Foraminifer-ostracod ratios are extremely variable in the environments sampled in Yaquina Bay. Smooth-valved species are characteristic of the <b>marine</b> <b>marsh</b> and inner bay environments; valve ornamentation tends to increase with approach to marine conditions. Thecamoebians are present in low numbers throughout the estuary. In general however, the number of species and population size increases in the upstream direction...|$|E

The data suggest that acidity {{is an important factor}} in explaining the lower decomposition rates of algae in Okefenokee Swamp water relative to L-Lake or Sapelo Island water. The decomposition of algal substrate was less sensitive to low pH (∼ 5 to 35 % inhibition) than was the decomposition of lignocellulose (∼ 30 to 70 % inhibition). These substrate-dependent differences were greater and more consistent in salt marsh than in L-lake incubations. In both freshwater sites, the extent to which decomposition was suppressed by acidity was greater for green algal substrate than for mixed diatom or blue-green algal (cyanobacteria) substrates. The use of different bases to adjust pH or incubation in a defined saltwater medium had no significant effect on substrate-dependent differences. Although pH differences with lignocellulose were larger in marine incubations, amendment of lakewater with marine bacteria or with calcium, known to stabilize exoenzymes in soils, did not magnify the sensitivity of decomposition to acid stress...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} thin clayey beds topping shallow marine cyclothems was sampled from a Turonian {{succession}} in Israel and was analysed by XRD for the mineralogical composition of its clay fraction. The main {{goal was to}} search for potential relations between short-term shallowing and possible emergence events and clay mineralogy. The bulk (< 2 mm), coarse (0. 22 mm) and fine (< 0. 2 mm) clay fractions of a unique clay bed, dominated by R 51 -type I-S were analysed for their chemical composition and dated by the K-Ar method. The fine clay fraction was dated at ~ 5 m. y. younger and the bulk clay to be slightly older than the known stratigraphic age, {{which means that the}} clay is mostly authigenic and formed at low-temperature, near-surface conditions. This is supported by the geological history of the region and by the variability of the clay assemblages and I-S composition within ~ 30 m vertical distance, neither of which indicates evidence for high temperatures. The sedimentological analysis suggests that the clay bed was deposited at marginal <b>marine</b> <b>marshes</b> where evaporated sea water turned into an alkaline solution of high K concentration. This is apparently the first study to provide convincing evidence for low-temperature, early diagenetic formation and preservation of I-S with R 1 -type, or similar ordering...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Sechura Desert {{provides}} a unique {{example of a}} vast palaeo-lagoon system on the Peruvian coast that was active during the first millennium AD. Reconstruction of coastal evolution is {{made possible by the}} good resolution of the sedimentary records of the Las Salinas Noroeste coastal plain. Evidence from morphostratigraphy and sedimentary facies indicates marked environmental diversity between the 3 rd and the 8 th centuries AD and a wide variability of sedimentary dynamics: lagoon foreshores received alternately fine distal marine sediments and coarser continental sediments in pro-deltaic sheets. Evaporation phases periodically occurred in these foreshores causing the formation of salt crusts. After a last high water level in the 8 th century AD, the lagoon ultimately dried out and remains dry today. The malacofauna and sedimentary facies indicate that <b>marine</b> <b>marshes</b> bordered by vegetation, perhaps mangrove, developed in the higher parts of these lagoons. This palaeogeography is explained by the progressive build-up of a sand bar which started at least in the middle Holocene. From the 3 rd to 8 th centuries AD, the lagoon had limited connection to the sea in its northern end and hosted a warm-water and productive ecosystem that was exploited by pre-Hispanic populations. Wetter conditions in the Andes and occasional El Niño rainfalls maintained the lagoon during this period. The freshwater input likely stopped in the 8 th century AD, which led to the closing of the shore bar {{under the influence of the}} longshore drift rapidly followed by the drying up of the lagoon, and the abandonment of the archaeological site...|$|R
40|$|Assemblages {{composed}} {{entirely of}} agglutinated foraminifera {{occur in a}} restricted range of modern environments: where carbonate dissolution is prevalent, e. g., marshes, deep shelves or ocean depths below the carbonate compensation depth. Fossil agglutinated assemblages undoubtedly come from {{a wider range of}} environments than these modern analogues. Natural post-depositional or diagenetic dissolution of carbonate foraminiferal tests in original dead assemblages (ODAs) leads to the formation of residual agglutinated assemblages. Simulating this process experimentally by treating modern ODAs with dilute acid gives rise to acid-treated assemblages (ATAs). This paper provides a synthesis of previous work on 261 samples and provides new data on a further 87 samples. Investigated environments range from marginal <b>marine</b> <b>marshes</b> and estuaries through fjord and shelf seas to deep sea. The pattern of species diversity in ATAs follows the same pattern as that for ODAs and living assemblages: there is a progressive increase in diversity from marginal marine to deep sea. Because agglutinated foraminifera are normally only a small component of ODAs, the ATAs provide a much more reliable guide to species and generic distributions. Although the faunal distribution patterns are well defined in terms of broad environment, it has proved difficult to account for individual distributions using the available data on abiotic environmental factors. In NW European seas, Miliammina is confined to intertidal to shallow subtidal marginal marine environments but elsewhere it is common on deep shelves (e. g., off Antarctica). In summary where evolution can not explain the absence of calcareous taxa, ATAs fill the no-analogue gap and provide baseline data {{that can be used to}} interpret the ecology of fossil agglutinated assemblages...|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the water rail is permanent wetland with still or slow-moving fresh or brackish water and dense, tall vegetation, which may include common reed, reedmace, irises, bur-reed or sedges. In coastal areas, sea rush is common in saltmarsh breeding sites, with sedges and bur-reed dominant in somewhat less saline environments. A study in the Netherlands and Spain showed that the rush provided better concealment than the other maritime plants. As elsewhere, nests were constructed from the nearest available plants. Where it occurs, saw-sedge provides good breeding habitat, its tall (1.5 m) dense structure providing good cover for the nesting rails. The preferred habitat is Phragmites reedbed with the plants standing in water, with a depth of 5 - 30 cm, muddy areas for feeding and a rich diversity of invertebrate species. Locations with nearby willows or shrubs are favoured above large areas of uniform habitat. In addition to natural fresh or <b>marine</b> <b>marshes,</b> this rail may use gravel or clay excavations and peat workings {{as long as there}} is suitable habitat with good cover. It may be found in rice paddies or on floating islands, and it occurs in Kashmir in flooded sugarcane fields. A Finnish study showed that the main factor influencing the distribution of water rails was the extent of vegetation cover, with the highest densities in the most vegetated areas; the presence of other marshes nearby was also significant. However, factors such as temperature, rainfall, length of shore line and extent of peat, important for some other marsh birds, were not statistically relevant. The areas with the highest densities of the rail also had the greatest numbers of three species considered at risk in Finland, the great reed warbler, Eurasian bittern and marsh harrier. The northern limit of breeding seems to be determined by the transition from nutrient-rich wetland to poorer, more acidic water. This leads to the replacement of common reed by a more open vegetation type dominated by marsh cinquefoil, which is unsuitable for the rails.|$|R

Therefore, in the ongoing development of new tools for aquatic ecosystem biomonitoring (<b>marine,</b> salt <b>marsh</b> and freshwater), biochemical measurements {{that can be used}} as individual biomarkers of impaired biological functions in invertebrates have been proposed.

Indeed, the heat shock protein family plays a key role: their induction is the signal of exposure to conditions that alter intracellular proteins. The present contribution deals with the actual knowledge in the field of heat shock proteins as biomarker tools in aquatic bioindicator invertebrates for the early detection of environmental changes and ecological risks. The growing emphasis of these biological tools is supported by their interest to complete water quality criteria based on chemical analysis and mortality of species under stress conditions.

50|$|From {{as early}} as 8000 BCE through the period of European contact in the seventeenth century,prehistoric populations {{periodically}} visited Saxis Island, probably to procure plants, shellfish,and game from its rich <b>marine</b> and <b>marsh</b> environments. The earliest documentary related to Saxis occurs on Capt. John Smith’s map of the Chesapeake Bay region and in his published description of an exploratory voyage {{in the summer of}} 1608. During a foray up the Pocomoke Sound, Smith and his party encountered a village inhabited by the Pocomoke Indians along the south shore of the sound. By the 1630s, though, fur traders based in Maryland and rival Virginia traders on Kent Island were active all along the bay side of the Eastern Shore. Due to its isolation—separated from the Eastern Shore mainland by maritime tidal marsh and bounded by water on the north, south, and west—the peninsula has been known as Saxis Island since European settlers and speculators claimed land there beginning in 1661. When land was first patented by European settlers in 1666, Saxis Island was divided into two sections; the north end, the 150-acre property of Robert Sikes was known as “Sikes’s Island,” and the remaining 200-acre parcel to the south was owned by George Parker who called his land “St. George’s Island.” The division is still partly visible by a drainage ditch along Saxis Road.|$|R

Inpolar records, RCCs that start abruptly within {{a decade or two}} at the most andmost often concern a period of 150 to 400 years, are often considered amongthe main environmental factors causing socio-economic and cultural changes,migrations, and even collapses.

40|$|Cenozoic {{terrestrial}} mammals from Sardinia contribute {{substantial information}} for reconstructing the complex {{history of the}} western Mediterranean. The occurrence of endemic perissodactyls in Eocene <b>marine</b> and <b>marsh</b> deposits suggests the existence of ecological or physical barriers between the Corso-Sardinian massif and the Iberian-Occitanic area. At {{the end of the}} Oligocene, isolation of Sardinia was almost complete, although a migration from Europe occurred {{at the beginning of the}} Early Miocene, as indicated by the unbalanced endemic fauna from Oschiri. During the Late Miocene, the Tusco-Sardinian palaeobioprovince came into existence as an isolated region inhabited by the quite diversified, but notably endemic, Oreopithecus fauna. Sardinia was definitely isolated from Tuscany by the Messinian, but temporary connections with the European mainland possibly allowed the colonization of forerunners of some Sardinian Pliocene taxa. During the Plio-Pleistocene, Sardinia maintained permanent isolation. However, sea level drop, resulting in a relatively short distance between Sardinia and the European mainland, allowed different migratory events. From the Late Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, two main mammalian faunal complexes (FC) can be recognized: the Nesogoral FC (Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene) and the Microtus (Tyrrhenicola) FC (late Early Pleistocene-Early Holocene). At the transition from Nesogoral to Microtus (Tyrrhenicola) FC, approximately 47 % of the genera and 76 % of the species disappeared, while approximately 58 % of the genera and 71 % of the species appeared. A noticeable turnover followed the arrival of Neolithic man and his accompanying fauna.

Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide, a {{phytotoxin}} {{that often}} accumulates in anoxic <b>marine</b> and freshwater <b>marsh</b> soils, suppressed {{the activity of}} alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the enzyme that catalyzes the terminal step in alcoholic fermentation, in the roots of two wetland macrophytes. This inhibition of root ADH activity with increasing sulfide concentration was associated with decreases in root total adenine nucleotide pool (ATP + ADP + AMP), the adenylate energy charge ratio (AEC), nitrogen uptake (percent recovery of rSNH,+-N) and growth (leaf elongation). These responses were species-specific with a greater negative impact in the freshwater marsh species that naturally inhabits low-sulfide environments. These findings {{lend support to the}} hypotheses that ADH activity, as a mcasurc of fermcntative metabolism, is important in maintaining the root energy status of wetland plants under hypoxic-anoxic conditions, that there is a significant negative effect of H,S on the anoxic production of energy in these roots, and that an important negative effect of H,S on plant growth is an inhibition of the energy-dependent process of N uptake.

40|$|Fifty-one species {{belonging}} to 16 families of halophytes {{have been collected}} in salty areas surrounding the Seyfe Lake in Central Anatolia (Turkey). Their plant/sodicity relationships and the involvement of nitrogenous solutes in their osmotic adjustment have been more specifically investigated in order to compare adaptative traits involved in their salt tolerance with those well-known occurring in halophytes from <b>marine</b> salt <b>marshes.</b> The internal molecular ratio between [K+]int and [K+ + Na+]int {{was found to be}} low in the shoots of dicots due to important abilities to accumulate Na+. In contrast this ratio was higher in the monocots, this being due to low contents of Na+ not to high ones of K+. This suggests specific traits which allow the dicots to absorb, accumulate and compartmentalize Na+ in order to provide cheap osmotic particles for osmotic adjustment. In terms of putative compatible solutes derived from primary nitrogen metabolism the study has been restricted to free proline and glycine betaine. It reveals that the 51 species investigated could be discriminated according to their capacity to accumulate, under natural saline conditions, either proline or glycine betaine or both of these compounds. It was also shown that species that behaved as glycine betaine accumulators behaved as poor proline accumulators and vice versa. This might suggest that in a number of species exhibiting attributes for glycine betaine production the level of free proline could be under the negative control of that of glycine betaine. A number of other nitrogenous osmolytes, such as Δ 1 -acetylornithine, β-alanine betaine and choline-O-sulfate were also found in certain species. Plantago maritima previously found to accumulate sorbitol in response to saline conditions was shown here to coaccumulate proline and glycine betaine in addition to sorbitol which was also found to be abundant. Phenetic analysis of the set of data obtained allow to discriminate two main clusters of halophytic species refering mainly to the traits associated with proline and (or) glycine betaine accumulation. As expected, the majority of the Chenopodiaceae, exhibited a distinct behavior within cluster II, based on their dual ability to store Na+ and glycine betaine. Some species of this family did not conform with this model. Thus, it becomes clear that salt tolerance in halophytic plants which might partly result from the cooperativity of a number of well-conserved mechanisms could also result from specific processes that could be modulated by the saline environmen...|$|R

Tzedakis 1993; Tzedakis et al, 2002). These niches, of course, extend to the aquatic environment, where high levels of both regional and local endemism are reflected in many diverse groups. However, whilst it would seem plausible that modern aquatic faunal distribution patterns should reflect the biogeographical evolution of the region, the extreme complexity of Balkan physiographical history means that attempts to document this evolution remain difficult without large biological datasets, which are often unavailable. Nevertheless, some progress has recently been made using modern phylogenetic and taxonomic techniques on freshwater fish populations (Figure 1). For example, Economidis & Banarescu (1991) examined taxa from 55 lake, river and stream sites across the region and, on a taxonomic basis, proposed five main biogeographical provinces linked, in part, to major drainage basin structure: Danubian, Ponto-Aegean, Attiko-Boetian, Dalmatian and South Adriatic-Ionian. In addition, they proposed that the endemic species seen originally descended from either European, Euro-Siberian or Palaearctic stock (Economidis & Banarescu, 1991). Although genetic work in part supports these conclusions and in part suggests that the boundaries between the provinces may be more complicated (e. g. Bianco, 1990; Doadrio & Carmona, 1998; Durand et al., 1999), researchers agree that to have full confidence in the results of such investigations, both genetic and taxonomic data must be validated by means of comprehensive fossil evidence. Whilst this presents certain obvious difficulties when dealing with fish populations, other groups are perhaps more suited to such analyses. The Ostracoda have been a subject of study in the Balkans for almost the last two centuries. These tiny, millimetre-scale bivalved crustaceans are ubiquitous in a variety of aquatic habitats from fully freshwater to fully <b>marine,</b> including <b>marshes,</b> estuaries, lagoons, rivers and lakes. Their calcareous shells often preserve well in the sediments of such environments and, owing to the stenotopic nature of many species, are able to contribute usefully to palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological reconstructions. These factors, coupled with their passive dispersal mechanisms, make them ideal tools for studying the biogeographical evolution of a region over geological timescales (e. g. Frogley et al., 2002). Indeed, modern faunas are relatively well described in the Balkans (particularly from lacustrine environments) and fossil records are often correspondingly numerous and detailed (e. g. Griffiths, 1995). Consequently, this paper aims to highlight their suitability in addressing biogeographical and evolutionary issues from this region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAt least 100 {{fish species}} {{are known to}} be present in the {{intertidal}} areas (estuaries, mudflats and salt marshes) of Mont Saint-Michel Bay. These and other comparable shallow marine coastal waters, such as estuaries and lagoons, play a nursery role for many fish species. However, in Europe little {{attention has been paid to}} the value of tidal salt marshes for fishes. Between March 1996 and April 1999, 120 tides were sampled in a tidal creek. A total of 31 species were caught. This community was largely dominated by mullets (Liza ramada represent 87 % of the total biomass) and sand gobies(Pomatoschistus minutus and P. lozanoi represent 82 % of the total numbers). These species and also Gasterosteus aculeatus, Syngnathus rostellatus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Mugil spp., Liza aurata and Sprattus sprattus were the most frequent species (> 50 % of monthly frequency of occurrence). In Europe, salt marshes and their creeks are flooded only during high spring tides. So, fishes only invade this environment during short immersion periods, and no species can be considered as marsh resident. But, the salt marsh was colonized by fish every time the tide reached the creek, and during the short time of flood, dominant fishes fed actively and exploited the high productivity. Nevertheless, this study shows that there is little interannual variation in the fish community and there are three â seasons â in the fish fauna of the <b>marsh.</b> <b>Marine</b> straggler and marine estuarine dependent species colonize marshes between spring (recruitment period in the bay) and autumn before returning into deeper adjacent waters. Estuarine fishes are present all year round with maximum abundances in the end of summer. The presence of fishes confirms that this kind of wetland plays an important trophic and nursery role for these species. Differences in densities and stages distribution of these species into Mont Saint-Michel systems (tidal mudflats, estuaries and tidal salt marshes) can reduce the trophic competition...|$|R
50|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human {{occupation}} dating back to the Palaeolithic, and including significant archaeology. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000-5,000 BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland. Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to 15 cm long found on the present-day coast at nearby Titchwell Marsh date from a time when it was 60 - 70 km from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic (50,000-10,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (5,000-2,500 BCE). Deposits of peat between layers of <b>marine</b> or salt <b>marsh</b> sediments date from 1980-1780 BC, indicating that the sea had retreated, leaving this area as dry land during that era. Signs of human use of the island range from early medieval Grimston ware pottery to post-World War II building foundations, and wooden structures in the marshes include posts set for mussel farming, and a wooden structure that was probably a fish trap It was originally thought that the island, believed to be 2-3 thousand years old, developed from an offshore shingle ridge, and had thus always been an island, but current thinking is that the island was originally a spit extending west from Holkham dunes. Support for this theory comes from boreholes and from radiocarbon dating of a shell to 837AD, that appeared to indicate the existence of saltmarshes behind the shingle barrier at that time. A 1585 map also appears to show a spit at this location, and a 1630 inventory of the lands of Robert of Brancaster, the local Lord of the Manor, did not show list the island as a separate entity.|$|R
40|$|The Venice Lagoon {{mainland}} {{is affected}} by salt water contamination in coastal and circum-lagoonal aquifers due to the close vicinity of both the sea and lagoon. The territory, characterized lithologically by alternating layers of silt, clay and sand which have <b>marine,</b> continental and/or <b>marsh</b> origins, is characterized by several critical conditions. These include the existence of paleorivers, lagoonal paleochannels, and rivers which are artificially suspended above the surrounding land by dikes. All of these conditions contribute {{to an increase in}} groundwater salinization. Areas with high permeability seem to constitute a preferential way of movement for salt water from the sea or lagoon towards the mainland. Old fossil water seems to be able to reach the surface and contribute to an increase in the process of salt pollution. In fact, during the 1970 s, several studies had detected, throughout the territory, the existence of a deep salt water aquifer storing fossil saline water. This aquifer lies at a depth of about 300 - 450 m {{in the southern part of}} the study area and of more than 600 m in the northern part of the Venice mainland. Salt water contamination of subsoil could cause ground salinization and, consequently, desertification of the area, with great economical consequences. These include damaging the large agricultural development of the territory as well as having adverse impacts on the tourist industry. The combined use of adequately validated geophysical and geochemical tools confers a multidisciplinary character to the research and allows for the definition of the phenomenon’s superficial extension. Geophysical analysis based on Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and conductivity logs have been performed together with water table measurements and geochemical analysis on samples collected from selected wells. Moreover, a critical review of old geophysical data allowed for the verification of possible saline contamination changes in time. Interesting results have been obtained within the northern sector of the Venice lagoon mainland, specifically within territory of Jesolo. In this case, considering the influence of the Piave and Sile rivers and the presence of a coastal sand dune, it is possible to create a map of salt water contamination to evaluate the agricultural use of superficial water. Therefore, the aim of this research is to define the effective origin of salt water found in the aquifers of the northern lagoon mainland, its distribution, extension and its preferential way of movement within the territory. Thereby, relating all the information acquired to the geological, geomorphological and stratigraphic characteristics of the area...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution human activities {{have more than doubled}} the amount of bioavailable nitrogen (N) on earth leading to far-reaching ecological consequences for coastal <b>marine</b> ecosystems. Salt <b>marsh</b> systems, including their intertidal creek and mudflat sediments, serve as nutrient filters transforming nitrogen and removing it through denitrification. However, as hotspots of nitrogen transformation, these ecosystems are also thought to be sources of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. We investigated the influence of various scales of anthropogenic fertilization on the nitrogen cycling in intertidal creek and mudflat sediments in the salt marsh ecosystem of Plum Island Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research site in northern Massachusetts, USA. Benthic fluxes from whole core incubations showed that long-term fertilization of tidal creek sediment stimulated net denitrification with significantly higher rates in the fertilized creek compared to the reference (162. 7 ± 32 and 0. 74 ± 39 μmol N m^- 2 hr^- 1, respectively). However, fertilization also appeared to stimulate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) with calculated rates also significantly higher in the fertilized compared to reference creek and representing 45 and 11 % of total nitrate uptake, respectively. These results indicate that DNRA may outcompete denitrification at higher nitrate concentrations, thus anthropogenic fertilization may be driving tidal creek sediments toward this N regeneration process and thus inhibiting the overall nitrogen removal capacity of the ecosystem. Conversely, a smaller scale, short-term nitrogen addition experiment had no significant impact on nearby tidal flat sediments likely because the fertilization exposure time on the tidal sediments was too short. Overall benthic flux rates were lower in the tidal flat compared to the tidal creeks. However, the tidal flat was also a net N filter with an average net N 2 flux of 5. 7 ± 2. 6 μmol N N m^- 2 hr^- 1. Rates of nitrification and therefore coupled nitrification-denitrification appeared to be affected by the active microphytobenthos (MPB) community within the tidal flat sediments with oxygen production from photosynthesis fueling coupled denitrification in the light while N fixation dominated under dark conditions. As in the tidal creeks, we found evidence that DNRA is also an important N transformation process within tidal flat sediments. Finally, sediment microprofiling measurements showed these tidal mudflat sediments to be a net sink of N 2 O (average - 6. 9 ± 1. 7 μmol N 2 O N m^- 2 hr^- 1) with significantly higher rates of uptake the longer sediments were exposed to the atmosphere at low tide. Fluxes were shown to be driven by nutrient supply and nitrate limitation of denitrifiers with tidal pulsing. Additionally, smaller, core scale nutrient additions revealed an increase in N 2 O flux with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) addition. Importantly, N 2 O uptake was found to be phosphorus limited. Again, nutrient enrichment appeared to stimulate DNRA over denitrification indicating that fertilization may not only hamper nitrogen removal capacity, but also increase N 2 O flux to the atmosphere...|$|R
