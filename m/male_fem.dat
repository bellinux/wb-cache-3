40|$|Dengue is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} arboviral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti worldwide, whose chemical control is difficult, expensive, and of inconsistent efficacy. Releases of Metarhizium anisopliae [...] exposed Ae. aegypti males to disseminate conidia among female mosquitoes by mating represents a promising biological control approach against this important vector. A better understanding of fungus virulence and impact on reproductive parameters of Ae. aegypti, is need before testing auto-dissemination strategies. Mortality, mating competitiveness, sperm production, {{and the capacity to}} auto-disseminate the fungus to females up to the 5 th copulation, were compared between Aedes aegypti males exposed to 5. 96 x 10 (7) conidia per cm 2 of M. anisopliae and uninfected males. Half (50 %) of fungus-exposed <b>males</b> (<b>FEMs)</b> died within the first 4 days post-exposure (PE). FEMs required 34 % more time to successively copulate with 5 females (165 ± 3 minutes) than uninfected males (109 ± 3 minutes). Additionally, fungus infection reduced the sperm production by 87 % at 5 days PE. Some beneficial impacts were observed, FEMs were able to successfully compete with uninfected males in cages, inseminating an equivalent number of females (about 25 %). Under semi-field conditions, the ability of FEMs to search for and inseminate females was also equivalent to uninfected males (both inseminating about 40 % females); but for the remaining females that were not inseminated, evidence of tarsal contact (transfer of fluorescent dust) was significantly greater in FEMs compared to controls. The estimated conidia load of a female exposed on the 5 th copulation was 5, 200 mL(- 1) which was sufficient to cause mortality. Our study is the first to demonstrate auto-dissemination of M. anisopliae through transfer of fungus from males to female Ae. aegypti during mating under semi-field conditions. Our results suggest that auto-dissemination studies using releases of FEMs inside households could successfully infect wild Ae. aegypti females, providing another viable biological control tool for this important the dengue vector...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of {{quantitative}} dietary restriction during refeeding on the performance, body chemical composition, and deposition, weight gain of organs and carcass parts of quails reared for meat (Coturnix coturnix coturnix). A total of 144 quails, between 11 to 42 days old, were distributed in a completely randomized design, 4 x 2 factorial scheme, at four levels of feed restriction (ad libitum, 30 %, 50 % and 70 % restrictions on the daily intake ad libitum) for both genders. Therefore, there was eight treatments with three replicates and six birds each. At the tenth day of age, the animals were housed in cages, where remained for four days under adaptation. Dietary restriction was applied between the days 15 and 35 while refeeding was carried out from day 36 to 42. Compensatory weight gain (CWG), i. e. weight gain of organs and carcass parts, and feed efficiency (FE) were improved for quails under feed restriction. Fat (F), crude protein (CP), protein deposition rate (PDR) and fat in females (FDf) and carcass retained energy in females (CREf) increased linearly as restriction levels decreased. Maximum estimates of feed intake for males (MFIm), compensatory weight gain for males (CWGm) and females (CWGf), feed efficiency for <b>males</b> (<b>FEm),</b> protein deposition for males (PDm) and carcass retained energy in males (CREm) were obtained with restriction levels of 43. 56 %, 30. 56 %, 63. 93 %, 62. 63 %, 80. 25 %, 1. 94 % and 09. 34 % if compared to ad libitum, respectively. As a result, we concluded that according to quantitative feed restriction level, significant increases in feed efficiency and body weight gain, as well as decreases in carcass fat throughout quail refeeding period. As for gender, given the existing sexual dimorphism, females lost greater body weight than males under dietary restriction, besides showing higher protein and fat gains in the carcass and an enhanced feed efficiency during refeeding...|$|R

While the study provided a greater understanding of MiRPE stress distribution within the craniofacial complex, the results are only valid for patients with comparable craniofacial structure. Sutures were incorporated into the model to mimic an adolescent, but the general size and shape of the model is more similar to that of an adult <b>male.</b> Additionally, <b>FEM</b> {{is only as good as}} the model upon which it is based. In this study, it was assumed that the elements have isotropic properties and are time-independent, yet in an actual skull, the bone is more anisotropic with a time-dependent component. In essence, FEM does not demonstrate longitudinal effects, only a particular instance in time. As such, future studies that allow a time-dependent change in the model should be explored.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the isolation and characterization of 16 mutations in the germ-line sex determination gene fog- 2 (fog for feminization of the germ line). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans there are normally two sexes, self-fertilizing hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). Wild-type XX animals are hermaphrodite in the germ line (spermatogenesis followed by oogenesis), and female in the soma. fog- 2 loss-of-function mutations transform XX animals into females while XO animals are unaffected. Thus, wild-type fog- 2 {{is necessary for}} spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites but not <b>males.</b> The <b>fem</b> genes and fog- 1 are each essential for specification of spermatogenesis in both XX and XO animals. fog- 2 acts as a positive regulator of the fem genes and fog- 1. The tra- 2 and tra- 3 genes act as negative regulators of the fem genes and fog- 1 to allow oogenesis. Two models are discussed for how fog- 2 might positively regulate the fem genes and fog- 1 to permit spermatogenesis; fog- 2 may act as a negative regulator of tra- 2 and tra- 3, or fog- 2 may act positively on the fem genes and fog- 1 rendering them insensitive to the negative action of tra- 2 and tra- 3...|$|R
40|$|Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera Drosophilidae) is {{a highly}} poliphagous insect which is native to South East Asia and now is {{widespread}} in many regions of Europe causing severe damages to crops mainly soft fruits. As economic losses due to D. suzukii damages are relevant many efforts {{should be done to}} find strategies to control this pest. There are multiple biocontrol agents (fungi, bacteria, viruses and other natural enemies of the pest, such as predators and parasitoids) that could be employed in IPM for D. suzukii. Natural enemies in the invaded area may establish new associations with invasive pests, thus gradually contributing to its control. There is hence a high probability for natural enemies in the invaded regions to exploit also D. suzukii. The predatory activity of Anthocorids was suggested by some Authors. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the predatory activity against D. suzukii of two specie of Anthocorids such as Orius laevigatus (Fieber) and O. maiusculus (Reuter), under laboratory conditions. D. suzukii females and <b>males</b> from <b>FEM</b> rearing were put into plastic box containing blueberries, and let lay eggs for 24 - 48 hours. After this period D. suzukii individuals were removed and the eggs laid in each blueberry fruit were counted. Blueberries infested by D. suzukii eggs were exposed to 0, 1, 2, 3 adult stages of O. maiusculus or O. laevigatus. A treatment containing blueberries without D. suzukii eggs and 3 Orius was also considered as control for the surviving of Orius. The number of emerged D. suzukii was checked daily until no more D. suzukii was born for three consecutive days. This number was compared with the initial egg counts to assess the predation of Orius on D. suzukii. The longevity of Orius was also considered.

40|$|The {{associations}} between fat pattern and metabolic profile were evaluated, using cluster analysis, in 214 <b>males</b> and 244 <b>fem</b> ales (aged 21 - 60 years). The subjects {{were randomly selected}} from the patients of one general practice in Castel D’Azzano (Italy). The metabolic status was indexed by blood pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipo protein cholesterol, and high-density lipo protein cholesterol (both total and percentage). Fat pattern was evaluated using six skinfolds and three circumferences. The analyses were performed separately on anthropometric and metabolic variables for each sex. The analyses were repeated five times to evaluate the stability of the cluster solution. Anthropometric rather than metabolic variables provided a more stable solution for cluster analysis. Anthropometric clusters showed significantly different metabolic patterns. Most of the differences disappeared when a body mass index (BMI) effect was taken into account but not when an adjustment for waist to hip ratio (WHR) was made. On the other hand, neither BMI nor WHR was able to fully account for the differences in metabolic profiles of metabolic clusters. Cross-classification results of anthropometric and metabolic cluster mem bership showed a significant, although moderate, degree of association between the two classification sets. These results indicate that in both sexes an thropometric characteristics contribute to a limited degree to the metabolic profile and that the associations probably reflect a complex mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Bycatch from {{interactions}} with fisherie s remains the biggest global threat to marine mammals. Galicia, north - west Spain, {{is one of}} the world’s main fishing regions and a high level of cetacean - fisheries interactions has been reported from on - board observers, interviews with fisheries stakeholde rs and analysis of stranded and by - caught carcasses. Delphinus delphis is the most abundant cetacean in the area and since 1990 necropsies of over 1800 stranded and by - caught Delphinus have been conducted. Life history data (age, maturity, and pregnancy ra te data) from stranded and by - caught cetaceans can be used to construct life tables and to estimate overall mortality and fisheries mortality rates. Age and maturity were determined from stranded and by - caught Delphinus between 1990 and 2009. <b>Males</b> and <b>fem</b> ales reach sexual maturity at 8. 5 and 7. 5 years of age, respectively, and no temporal difference in age at sexual maturity was observed. Results indicate 13 % annual mortality in the Delphinus delphis north - east Atlantic population and necropsy data suggest s that 60 % of mortality (i. e. 7. 2 % annual mortality) is attributable to fisheries interactions, predominantly from pair trawls and gillnets. By - caught Delphinus were found to die significantly younger than non - by - caught animals (p=< 0. 001) although no sex - r elated difference in bycatch rate was observed (p= 0. 051). The estimated annual mortality due to fisheries interactions greatly exceeds the 2 % limit set by ASCOBANS and the IWC and high bycatch rates are also reported for other countries e. g. the UK, France and Portugal. Although Delphinus delphis in the north - east Atlantic is one continuous population, the high level of bycatch occurring in parts of the range is most likely unsustainable and will be discussed. There is a need to carry out on - board monitorin g, notably in the north - west Iberian Peninsula (Galicia and Portugal), to incorporate cetacean bycatch into fisheries advice and, above all, to start introducing mitigation measures...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1955 Field {{work on the}} Arctic {{grayling}} {{was conducted}} from September, 1951, to May, 1953; data on movements, spawning, food habits, sex ratios, and population dynamics were obtained. Returns on 1, 222 tagged grayling varied from 0 to 20 per cent with areas. No returns were obtained from 165 fin-clipped fish. Fish entered the streams in the spring as soon as water started flowing, the dates varying from March 15 to May 9, 1952. Spawning in the Little Salcha River during 1952 {{is believed to have}} occurred between June 12 and June 16, Of 262 grayling checked for maturity, 18. 7 per cent were mature in their fourth summer, 45 per cent in their fifth summer, and all by their sixth summer. Sex ratios obtained for adults varied with areas. The average sex ratio found for all areas was 79 <b>males</b> per 100 <b>fem</b> ales. The rate of growth was determined for grayling from six areas. The average increment for class V fish varied from 2. 7 to 4. 6 cm. per year. Aquatic insects were the main food organisms taken by grayling. Some terrestrial insects, fish, fish eggs and vegetable, matter were also taken. In view of the findings made in this study, overfishing appears to be the major cause of the decline in the sizes of grayling populations along the highways in the Fairbanks area. A twelve-inch minimum size limit is apparently the best management procedure, although an area closure is advisable for overfished spawning runs...|$|R
