40|$|Thesis {{is focused}} on the {{measurement}} and evaluation of microclimate parameters in barns for dairy farming and the determination of the energy consumptions of selected technologies <b>in</b> these barns. <b>The</b> aim of this work was to design and eventually to implement adjustments in order to improve <b>the</b> parameters of <b>cowshed</b> microclimate and reducing the energy consumption of selected technologies in depends on results of the measurements. Three structurally different cowsheds with different slurry clearing technologies were selected for monitoring. I focused on the measurement of temperature and relative humidity in relation to temperature- humidity index and its impact on heat stress on dairy cows. I measured airflow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowsheds</b> and I determinate concentrations and emissions of ammonia and methane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowsheds</b> <b>in</b> different seasons. I monitored light intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowsheds</b> and I determined the dependence of building solutions on the use of outdoor light to illuminate the interior of the barns. The energy consumption of the lighting system depending on the season and the consumption of additional fans on the air temperature were studied. On the bases of results of the experimental part I designed and implemented lighting system, controlled by light intensity in a cowshed and energy-saving ventilation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowshed</b> - type K 105. I suggested a system of continuously monitoring of climatic parameters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowshed</b> with immediate calculation of temperature- humidity index. Measurements have shown the dependence of gases concentrations on the way of slurry clearing technologies. The building solutions of cowsheds and type of ventilation proved a significant influence on the temperature- humidity index during the summer...|$|R

40|$|Require {{ventilation}} {{of the pen}} is used {{to control}} the temperature, air humidity, and air movement of cattle dung to micro- environmental conditions required to fulfilled the cattle. Ventilation occurs {{if there is a}} difference in air pressure. Ventilation with a certain air pressure can affect the speed of air movement, way of movement, intensity and pattern of flow and local resistance (Takakura, 1979). Ventilation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowshed</b> PT Green field requires the use of additional flow blower.

5|$|The Bebington Kop, simply {{referred}} to as the Kop, is a large single-tier, all-seater stand with a capacity of 5,696. Completed in 1995, it replaced the earlier open terrace (also called the Kop) which had stood behind the goal at the Bebington End. The Bebington Kop is also the biggest Kop stand in Non league football. Originally the Kop housed both home and away fans, split down the middle, and occasionally was handed entirely to the away fans. However, following the 2000 League Cup semi-final against Bolton, when the Kop was given entirely to the home fans, a campaign was begun to claim the Kop as a home end. From the 2000-01 season this became the case, with away fans housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cowshed.</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluated}} fertility and milk performance due to multiple milking technology which was used. The monitoring was carried in 2011 in farms Agrospol, Malý Bor a. s. and the farm Dub. System evaluation of fertility and milk performance of dairy cows at multiple <b>milking</b> were evaluated <b>in</b> 186 lactations of Czech pied cattle breeding. The average number of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parlour was 2. 96 x/day and robot 2. 36 x/day. 107 lactations were obtained during <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour and 79 of lactation during <b>milking</b> by robots. <b>In</b> this thesis were measured indicators of fertility (insemination interval, service period, the mean time and age at first calving) and indicators of milk production (lactation length, the amount of milk fat, protein and lactose content). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> reproductive indicators were taken statistically highly difference in age at first calving, where the average difference was 195 days. For other indicators of fertility were all statistically significant results <b>in</b> favor of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour (2. 96 x/day). Czech pied cattle <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour per normative lactation average amount of milk produced 8 599. 8 kg, cows milked by robot 7 272. 5 kg. Among these values was statistically highly significant difference. <b>The</b> best results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of <b>milk</b> per normative lactation were gained by <b>milked</b> cows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour (9 284. 4 kg) and the second lactation cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour (9 033. 0 kg) on the third and more lactation. <b>The</b> lowest <b>milk</b> production <b>in</b> normative lactation gained dairy cows milked by robot at first lactation (6 874. 7 kg). The higher average fat content had dairy cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour with a value of 4. 47 %, dairy cows milked by robot had fat content of 4. 15 %. Between these values was statically highly significant difference. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> average protein content in dairy cows has been demonstrated statistically significant difference. Dairy cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour reached the value 3. 41 % compared to cows milked by a robot, where the average value of protein was 3. 47 %. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> lactose content between groups was not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|Dairy farm {{buildings}} can have, {{as it is}} well known, a big influence on <b>the</b> microclimatic conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cowshed.</b> <b>In</b> order to examine the influence of environmental parameters on the conditions affecting animal welfare, an experimental programme was set up at a farm where anomalous behaviour of cows had been previously noted. The research {{was carried out in}} a freestall barn from June 2004 till June 2005. Part of the research involved a detailed monitoring of animal movements and a simultaneous measurement of temperature and humidity within <b>the</b> <b>cowshed.</b> <b>The</b> behaviour of cows has been obtained by the analysis of a recorded video and expressed through indices. A strict relationship between environmental parameters and animal movement has been confirmed by the results obtained. The proportion of animals resting <b>in</b> stalls during <b>the</b> daytime, not affected by milking or feeding, rised from 30 % in hot periods to 75 % <b>in</b> winter time. <b>The</b> highly significant (P< 0. 01) correlation obtained between environmental parameters and cow behaviour confirmed the strong influence of THI on total proportion of lying cows.
