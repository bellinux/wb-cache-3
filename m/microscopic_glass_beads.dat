5000|$|The first {{commercial}} advertisement vehicle wrap {{is thought to}} have been created for Pepsi Co in 1993, which used vinyl to wrap a bus promoting its Crystal Pepsi product. It wasn’t long before bus wrap advertising was everywhere and the new form of vehicle graphics trickled down to smaller businesses and consumers. Wrapping whole vehicles was still challenging. Majority of the difficulties came from premature adhesion and air bubbles under the vinyl. As technology improved, companies like Avery Dennison, 3M and Oracal developed the use of air-channels that made the vinyl repositionable and allowed for bubble-free installation. Air-channel, created using <b>microscopic</b> <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> incorporated into the vinyl’s adhesive, prevented the vinyl from fully sticking to the substrates surface thereby permitting air flow between adjacent sections. In addition, these beads allow for the vinyl to be repeatedly be removed and reapplied until the beads are broken by firmly pressing the vinyl using a small hard squeegee. Once the beads are broken the vinyl will be firmly adhered to the substrates surface. Proprietary company blends of polymer in the vinyl allowed the material to conform to compound curves, recesses, and corrugations through the use of heat guns and torches.|$|E

40|$|Pavement {{markings}} {{are vital}} for safely navigating roadways. The nighttime visibility of pavement markings {{is enhanced by}} addition of retroreflective <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> {{most of which are}} made from recycled glass. Concern has been raised over the presence of heavy metals in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used in pavement markings and their effect on human and environmental health. Based upon the potential risk associated with the presence of arsenic and lead in the <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> two Bills are currently being considered before the 112 th Congress of the United States of America seeking to set a maximum permissible limit for the amount of arsenic and lead in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used within pavement marking systems on domestic roadways. This study was designed to support legislative decision making by providing data necessary for risk assessment. The experiments carried out provide: an analysis of <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> metal content and extractability; an evaluation of the relationship between arsenic content of the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and their retroreflective performance; an evaluation of analytical methods used to measure the total bead metal content; and an analysis of samples of <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> and soil mixture from a <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> storage site used to determine site-specific metal concentrations in the soil media. Mean arsenic content, measured using the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's KOH fusion digestion, in all the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> examined ranged from 11 ppm to 82 ppm, while mean lead content, measured using KOH fusion digestion, ranged from below quantification limit to 199 ppm. Total metal content measurements indicated a high amount of variability in the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> samples; most likely {{associated with the use of}} recycled glass feed during manufacturing. The relationship between the retroreflective performance and the arsenic content of the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> was analyzed and a weak but positive correlation was observed between the two factors. However, a more detailed study is required to evaluate the relationship between arsenic content and retroreflectivity. Different methods to evaluate the total metal content in <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were compared; it is recommended that any analytical method may be used, as long as the standard reference material is reproduced within the range of concentration expected in the <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> In the analysis of the field site samples of soil containing <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> obtained from a <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> storage and transfer facility, the mass content of beads in the soil varied from a mean of 19 % to 78 % depending on the location within the facility.

Process Engineering Development designed and constructed the test apparatus to aid in the understanding and impacts that spherical <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> may have on the existing DWPF Frit Transfer System. Testing was conducted to determine if the lines would plug with the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and the <b>glass</b> frit slurry and what is required to unplug the lines. The flow loop consisted of vertical and horizontal runs of clear PVC piping, similar in geometry to the existing system. Two different batches of glass slurry were tested: a batch of 50 wt% spherical <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and a batch of 50 wt% glass frit in process water. No chemicals such as formic acid was used in slurry, only water and glass formers. The <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> used for this testing were commercially available borosilicate glass of mesh size - 100 + 200. The glass frit was Frit 418 obtained from DWPF and is nominally - 45 + 200 mesh. The spherical <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> did not {{have a negative impact on}} the frit transfer system.

In this study, the effect of the cleaning process on the fracture behavior of particulate composites is investigated using <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> filled epoxies as model systems. The cleaning process is shown to be a simple method to strengthen the interface between the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and the epoxy matrix. Although the chemistry of the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> surface is unlikely to be altered by the cleaning process, submicron particles that exist on the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> surfaces are removed by cleaning with distilled water or ultrasonic vibration. The removal of submicron particles increases the interfacial strength between the <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and the matrix and changes the tensile strength of the composites.

40|$|The {{roughness}} of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilaments (SNFs) is exploited {{to enlarge}} the contact area of conventional filter material. As an efficient wetting of the filter material is crucial for water treatment, the wettability of SNFs is readily modified from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic during the functionalization process. SNFs are coated on <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> without SNF coating. Thus, in column experiments, the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> exert superior antibacterial activity towards suspensions of E. coli K 12 compared to AgNP functionalized <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> without SNFs. Additionally, reusing the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-coated <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with fresh bacteria contaminated medium increases their efficacy and reduces the colony forming units by ≈ 6 log units.
