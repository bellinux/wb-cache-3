The results of the study show that common errors in these essays in decreasing order are tenses, prepositions, articles, word choice, mechanics, and verb to be.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{computer}} technologies creates a plethora {{of ways in which}} technology can be integrated into one of the alternatives to facilitate essay marking. Automated essay marking systems developed from the late 1960 s have attempted to prove that computers can evaluate essays as competently as human expert. Several computer-based essay marking (CBEM) systems have been developed to mark students’ essays and they can be divided into semi-automated and automated systems. This paper illustrates the development of an Automated Tool for Detecting Errors in Tenses (ATDEiT™). The first phase analysed the errors found in 400 essays written by 112 English as second language (ESL) learners at tertiary level using Markin 3. 1 software.

40|$|In forensics, {{fingerprints}} {{can be used}} to uniquely identify {{suspects in}} a crime. Similarly, a <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> left at a crime scene {{can be used to}} identify the tool that was used. However, the current practice of identifying matching <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> involves visual inspection of marks by forensic experts which can be a very subjective process. As a result, declared matches are often successfully challenged in court, so law enforcement agencies are particularly interested in encouraging research in more objective approaches. Our analysis is based on comparisons of profilometry data, essentially depth contours of a <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> surface taken along a linear path. In current practice, for stronger support of a match or non-match, multiple marks are made in the lab under the same conditions by the suspect tool. We propose the use of a likelihood ratio test to analyze the difference between a sample of comparisons of lab <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> to a field <b>tool</b> <b>mark,</b> against a sample of comparisons of two lab <b>tool</b> <b>marks.</b> Chumbley et al. (2010) point out that the angle of incidence between the <b>tool</b> and the <b>marked</b> surface can have a substantial impact on the <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> and on the effectiveness of both manual and algorithmic matching procedures. To better address this problem, we describe how the analysis can be enhanced to model the effect of tool angle and allow for angle estimation for a <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> left at a crime scene. With sufficient development, such methods may lead to more defensible forensic analyses. We then consider the effect of using multiple <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> made in the lab. Specifically, we consider how flaws in the mark surface or error in the mark making process make it is possible for <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> to be made under the same conditions using the same tool that do not resemble one another. Thus it is necessary to incorporate a quality control step in the <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> matching process. Toward this end, we describe a method {{that could be used to}} verify that all the lab marks made do in fact match each other well enough to be considered reliable for comparing to a field <b>tool</b> <b>mark,</b> or to identify those that should be eliminated. Finally, we return to the proposed use of a likelihood ratio test to compare multiple <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> made in the lab to a single field <b>tool</b> <b>mark.</b> In that analysis, a one-sided hypothesis test was used for which the null hypothesis states that the means of the two samples are the same, and the alternative hypothesis states that they are different and appropriately ordered. The weakness of this approach is that the hypotheses are reversed from the desired analysis; we must assume that the null hypothesis is true until we can prove otherwise, which equates to assuming the <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> were made by the same tool (i. e. the evidence supports the suspect 2 ̆ 7 s guilt) until we can prove otherwise. Using synthetic <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> generated from a statistical model fitted to the lab <b>tool</b> <b>marks,</b> we propose a method for comparing marks that reverses the hypotheses to achieve the desired test...|$|R

40|$|If a {{striated}} tool {{such as a}} {{screw driver}} is used to commit a crime, often there is a <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> left behind as evidence.

Examiners first compare marks according to their class characteristics and if they match, they continue to compare the individual characteristics. If the class characteristics do not match, it is concluded the marks were not made by the same tool. Many of the algorithms being developed to remove the subjective nature of an examiner 2 ̆ 7 s comparison ignore the distinction between class and individual characteristics and attempt to directly compare the marks visually, or by applying some quantitative similarity index. We have developed a procedure for comparing <b>tool</b> <b>marks</b> that initially decomposes a digitized <b>tool</b> <b>mark</b> into class and individual components and applies a fixed width window correlation separately to each component. Based on the offsets (or registration) producing the maximized correlation (optimal offsets) and the correlation at the remaining offsets, we formulate hypothesis tests (Different Tool vs. Common Tool) with test statistics and p-values based on the distance between the optimal offsets for the two components, or by setting a threshold for correlations between the individual component series. Additionally, we have developed a simulation based approach for a test based on the maximized correlation between two <b>tool</b> <b>marks.</b> Finally, we review the method of Chumbley et al.

40|$|Background The {{intention}} of giving written feedback is {{to close the}} gap between the standard achieved and the standard desired, but students do not always read it. Web-based marking tools are increasingly being used in assessment practices to deliver the feedback. What motivates students to read the feedback provided, especially since the advent of these online marking tools, is poorly understood. This research looked at the factors likely to influence a medical student's engagement with written feedback delivered through an online <b>marking</b> <b>tool</b> (grademark by Turnitin). What motivates students to read the feedback provided Methods Third-year medical students on a UK undergraduate medical course submitted an assignment online. A questionnaire was distributed to a cohort of them following the release of their results and feedback, allowing quantitative and qualitative data collection. Software recorded whether they opened their feedback. Previous examination performance figures were also collated. Results Online feedback is accessible and acceptable to the majority of students. Personal demographics, computer literacy, previous course performance, or personal motivational drivers did not predict those who did or did not read it. Some students reported seeing little value in feedback because of their previous negative experiences. A minority found feedback hurtful, and were likely to show avoidance behaviours. Discussion: This research found that feedback provided through an online <b>marking</b> <b>tool</b> overcame many of the problems associated with handwritten feedback, but alone was not enough to ensure universal engagement. Feedback dialogues are proposed as a method to overcome negative student experiences, enhance tutor performance and encourage future student engagement...|$|E
