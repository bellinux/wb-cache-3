5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given <b>more</b> <b>nuanced</b> reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a <b>more</b> <b>nuanced</b> description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E

Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a new expanded console with room for them all, allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a <b>more</b> <b>nuanced</b> picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{discusses}} the frames {{that were used}} in the public debate about raising the retirement age in Belgium from 65 years to 67 years. The aim of the study is to gain insight into the prevailing frames in order to develop counterframes, that are less problematizing and can be used to bring <b>more</b> <b>nuance</b> to the debate. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive framing analysis was conducted, using articles from Flemish newspapers and magazines, published in a two-year period (March 2013 - March 2015). This sample was complemented by a convenience sample of texts by various stakeholders. The total sample consisted of 182 texts. Findings: The analysis yielded four problematizing frames and six deproblematizing counterframes. They cover both the meaning of work for the individual, and the effect that working longer has on society. Practical implications: The overview of the frames {{can be used as a}} tool to analyze existing communication, and to bring <b>more</b> <b>nuance</b> to future communication by introducing deproblematizing perspectives into the debate regarding the need to work for a longer period of time. Originality/value: In addition to giving an overview of existing frames, the study also constructed alternatives which can be used to deproblematize the issue of having to work longer. status: publishe...|$|R

But either way, the monastic ideal was regarded as the utmost expression of the Christian life.|$|E

The report, titled An Agenda for Peace, described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in post-Cold War international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Social ecology is a {{philosophy}} developed by Murray Bookchin in the 1960s; it holds that present ecological problems {{are rooted in}} deep-seated social problems, particularly in dominatory hierarchical political and social systems. These have resulted in an uncritical acceptance of an overly competitive grow-or-die philosophy. It suggests that this cannot be resisted by individual action such as ethical consumerism but must be addressed by <b>more</b> <b>nuanced</b> ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in radical democratic ideals. The complexity of relationships between people and with nature is emphasised, along with the importance of establishing social structures that take account of this.|$|E
