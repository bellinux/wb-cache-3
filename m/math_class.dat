This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a <b>math</b> <b>class.</b> The students' level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the percentage of time they spent talking, the amount of time they spent making eye contact, and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self-monitoring. This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations.|$|E

500|$|Writer Brian K. Vaughan {{conceived}} Saga in his childhood, {{calling it}} [...] "a fictional universe that I created when I was bored in <b>math</b> <b>class.</b> I just kept building it." [...] He {{was inspired by}} such influences as Star Wars, Flash Gordon and children's books, and has also invoked the awe and wonder of first seeing the Silver Surfer, which seemed an [...] "incredible and different" [...] concept to him. It was not until his wife became pregnant with his second daughter, however, that he conceived of the protagonists, the winged Alana and the horned Marko, two lovers from warring extraterrestrial races who struggle to survive with their newborn daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the series. It was also {{at this point that}} the central theme that Vaughan wanted for the book emerged. Vaughan explains, [...] "I wanted to write about parenthood, but I wanted to Trojan-horse it inside some sort of interesting genre story, to explore the overlap between artistic creation {{and the creation of a}} child." [...] Vaughan, who intended to return to writing a comics series following the 2010 conclusion of his previous series, Ex Machina, and who notes that the publication of Saga #1 coincided with the birth of his daughter, saw parallels between the caution advised by colleagues against launching a new book in the poor economy and those who cautioned against bringing a new child into the world, observing: ...|$|E

Robert Harrow Jr. of The Washington Post recommended the Madeline series to parents since it was [...] "educational software... cloaked in games."

[...] A school in Hope Meadows, Illinois, offered the program {{as a reward for}} children who had done their 15 minutes of reading, and Madeline Classroom Companion: 1st and 2nd Grade Reading Deluxe was made available as a resource at the Washington-Centerville Public Library in 1999. According to education lecturer Tom Lowrie in a paper entitled Using Technology to Enhance Children's Spatial Sense, the interactive program Madeline Thinking Games is commonly used to test [...] "for a range of visual and spatial understandings" [...] in children.

To meet these requirements, co-teaching has become a popular service delivery model for instruction of students with disabilities within the general education setting. The purpose of this causal-comparative study was to compare math achievement of secondary students with disabilities in general education co-taught <b>math</b> <b>classes</b> to students with disabilities in special education resource <b>math</b> <b>classes.</b> Participants included 145 high school students with disabilities from four large suburban schools in Northeast Georgia. Learning outcomes were measured by scores on the Georgia Math II End of Course Test.

Data were analyzed for statistical significance using an ANCOVA. Results indicated that students instructed in co-taught <b>math</b> <b>classes</b> had higher mean scores on end of course tests than students instructed in resource <b>math</b> <b>classes.</b> The findings suggest that co-teaching had a smal...|$|R
