Pang, pang, went two carbines, but I had flown round the curve of the street, and never so much as heard the hiss of the balls. Ah, we were great, both Violette and I. She lay down to it like a coursed hare, the fire flying from her hoofs. I stood in my stirrups and brandished my sword. Someone sprang for my bridle. I sliced him through the arm, and I heard him howling behind me. Two horsemen closed upon me. I cut one down and outpaced the other. A minute later I was clear of the town, and flying down a broad white road with the black poplars on either side. For a time I heard the rattle of hoofs behind me, but they died and died until I could not tell them from the throbbing of my own heart. Soon I pulled up and listened, but all was silent. They had given up the chase.|$|E

During this time the apparently spontaneous wish arose among the soldiers to erect a monument to permanently honour Drusus in Mogontiacum. Appropriate construction activities were probably already ongoing in the immediate vicinity of the legionary camp, as Augustus approved the project retroactively. As a special tribute to Drusus, Augustus himself wrote a grave inscription (Elogium) which was attached to the cenotaph. With this the building was completed, of which the remains are now known as the Drususstein.|$|E

30|$|During {{the last}} glacial period (MIS 2), the ECS {{continental}} shelf was exposed, which triggered eastward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastlines and river <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Chinese rivers (Xie et al. 1995; Xu and Oda 1999; Kawahata and Ohshima 2004; Ijiri et al. 2005). However, <b>the</b> paleoceanography <b>of</b> older glacial periods has remained unknown because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack, until now, of sediment cores covering time intervals prior to 40 ka. Based on our data, the paleoceanographic conditions during MISs 2 – 4, 6, and 10 were likely very similar, although MIS 10 was probably warmer because Actinomma medianum, a transitional species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific, exhibited relative abundances of about 5 % (Figs.  5 and 7). Thus, a similar sea-level drop probably occurred during MISs 2 – 4, 6, and 10 (Fig.  8). This scenario {{is consistent with}} a recent study that attempted to separate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> temperature and global ice volume on deep-ocean foraminiferal δ 18 O values (Elderfield et al. 2012). The radiolarian Lithomelissa setosa, a coastal-water species, dominated the assemblage with relative abundances exceeding 40 % during these glacial periods (Fig.  7). In the modern era, L. setosa dominates <b>the</b> coastal environment <b>of</b> northern Japan and is absent offshore (Kamikuri et al. 2008; Matsuzaki and Itaki 2017). Additionally, this species is probably associated with nutrient-rich coastal water created by suspension of lithogenic matter (Itaki et al. 2008). Therefore, our data suggest that during MISs 2 – 4, 6, and 10, nutrient-rich coastal water prevailed because of probable higher input of terrigenous matter and consequent eastward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastline.|$|R

5000|$|Routing {{also can}} be used to predict the {{hydrograph}} shape (and thus lowland flooding potential) subsequent to multiple rainfall events in different sub-catchments of the watershed. Timing and duration of the rainfall events, as well as factors such as antecedent moisture conditions, overall watershed shape, along with subcatchment-area shapes, land slopes (topography/physiography), geology/hydrogeology (i.e. forests and aquifers can serve as giant sponges that absorb rainfall and slowly release it over subsequent weeks and months), and stream-reach lengths all play a role here. The result can be an additive effect (i.e. a large flood if each subcatchment's respective hydrograph peak arrives at the watershed mouth at the same point in time, thereby effectively causing a [...] "stacking" [...] of the hydrograph peaks), or a more distributed-in-time effect (i.e. a lengthy but relatively modest flood, effectively attenuated in time, as the individual subcatchment peaks arrive at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> watershed channel in orderly succession).|$|E

5000|$|The Roman stronghold or castrum Mogontiacum, the {{precursor}} to Mainz, {{was founded by}} the Roman general Drusus perhaps as early as 13/12 BC. As related by Suetonius the existence of Mogontiacum is well established by four years later (the account of the death and funeral of Nero Claudius Drusus), though several other theories suggest the site may have been established earlier. Although the city is situated opposite the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> river, the name of Mainz is not from Main, the similarity being perhaps due to diachronic analogy. Main is from Latin Menus, the name the Romans used for the river. Linguistic analysis of the many forms that the name [...] "Mainz" [...] has taken on {{make it clear that}} it is a simplification of Mogontiacum. The name appears to be Celtic and ultimately it is. However, it had also become Roman and was selected by them with a special significance. The Roman soldiers defending Gallia had adopted the Gallic god Mogons (Mogounus, Moguns, Mogonino), for the meaning of which etymology offers two basic options: [...] "the great one", similar to Latin magnus, which was used in aggrandizing names such as Alexander magnus, [...] "Alexander the Great" [...] and Pompeius magnus, [...] "Pompey the great", or the god of [...] "might" [...] personified as it appears in young servitors of any type whether of noble or ignoble birth.|$|E
30|$|However, {{there is}} a {{discrepancy}} between radiolarian abundance and other primary productivity indicators such as total organic carbon (TOC %) and diatom abundance (Tada et al. 2015; Fig.  9). The TOC and diatom data show that primary productivity at this site did not alter in association with glacial and interglacial cycles; instead, the primary productivity seems to have changed during the time interval between 130 to 220 ka (Fig.  9). This discrepancy {{can be explained by}} considering that two factors control ocean primary productivity: sunlight and nutrients. Radiolarians related to the KC bear algal symbionts because they inhabit oligotrophic waters and thus have to obtain energy from photosynthesis. This fact explains why <b>the</b> absolute abundances <b>of</b> algal-symbiont-bearing radiolarians were higher during interglacial periods, and suggests that <b>the</b> absolute abundances <b>of</b> algal-symbiont-bearing species {{can be used as a}} primary productivity index for interglacial periods. However, this index cannot be used to compare primary productivity between interglacial and glacial periods. Indeed, our data show that the KC did not influence our site during glacial periods; thus, <b>the</b> absolute abundances <b>of</b> algal-symbiont-bearing species decreased. In contrast, <b>the</b> percentage abundances <b>of</b> coastal species increased during glacial periods because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea-level drop and consequent southeastward migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastlines and river <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Chinese rivers, which might have led to a marked increase in the nutrient levels in shallow water. This finding indicates that, although we detected a drastic decrease in <b>the</b> abundances <b>of</b> species that bear algal symbionts, high nutrient levels were available in the shallow water during glacial periods, and thus the ocean primary productivity should have been also high during those times. Therefore, to compare and discuss changes in ocean primary productivity during glacial periods, abundances of coastal species (such as Lithomelissa setosa) should be used.|$|R

In this study, spatial and seasonal variability in concentration and composition of CDOM and the origin of its variation was studied in Lake Balaton (Hungary), a large temperate shallow lake in central Europe. In addition, we investigated the effect of photobleaching on the optical properties of CDOM through in-lake incubation experiments. There was marked variability throughout the year in CDOM absorption in Lake Balaton (aCDOM (440) [*]=[*] 0. 06 – 9. 01 [*]m− 1). The highest values were consistently observed at the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> inflow (River Zala), which drains humic-rich material from the adjoining Kis-Balaton wetland, but CDOM absorption decreased rapidly towards the east where it was consistently lower and less variable than in the westernmost lake basins. The spectral slope parameter for the interval of 350 – 500 [*]nm (SCDOM(350 – 500)) was more variable with increasing distance from the inflow (observed range 0. 0161 – 0. 0181 [*]nm− 1 for the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> inflow and 0. 0158 – 0. 0300 [*]nm− 1 for waters closer to the outflow). However, spatial variation in SCDOM was more constant exhibiting a negative correlation with aCDOM(440). DOC was strongly positively correlated with aCDOM(440) and followed a similar seasonal trend but it demonstrated more variability than either aCDOM or SCDOM with distance through the system. Photobleaching resulting from 7 days exposure to natural solar UV radiation resulted in a marked decrease in allochthonous CDOM absorption (7. 04 to 3. 36 [*]m− 1, 42 [*]% decrease) and an even greater decrease in the absorption of autochthonous CDOM (1. 34 to 0. 312 [*]m− 1, 77 [*]% decrease). Photodegradation also resulted {{in an increase in}} the spectral slope coefficient of dissolved material.

Deltaic deposits are of more importance in this context. The glacio-marine deltaic sands of several terrace levels contain terrestrial plant remnants which delivered C 14 dates. Using these dates und <b>the</b> relative elevations <b>of</b> terraces <b>the</b> emergenee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area investigated could be recorded. This occured in a series of phases (and steps) which were summarized into two periods: an early period of emergenee which took place from at least 25 300 years B. P. to later than 17 340 years B. P. and a later one from at least 12 870 years B. P. up to the present day. The emergence seems to represent a discontinuous but regular sequence of relative sea level movements without intermittent submergence. Since <b>the</b> deltaic fans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early emergence period were accumulated by sediments through glacio-fluvial channels of an adjacent glacier body <b>the</b> appropriate location <b>of</b> this glacial stage for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glaciers delivering meltwater (Nukapingwa Glacier) could be reconstructed. This stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier appears to belong to a retreating phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mid-Wisconsin (?). <b>The</b> later period <b>of</b> emergence resulted in six rather glacio-marine delta terrace generations at <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> rivers with glaciofluvial regimen debouching into the Oobloyah Bay.

Materials and Methods Sampling of phytoplankton and physical and chemical variables was performed quarterly between August 2013 and May 2015, in the Paraná River main channel and in the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> tributaries, at the stretch located between downstream Porto Primavera reservoir and the backwaters of Itaipu reservoir. To summarize the variation of phytoplankton density in relation to the main physical and chemical variables, we performed a Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Results A total of 214 taxa were identified throughout the study. We registered low values of phytoplankton species richness and abundance, which showed no patterns of temporal and spatial distribution, both for the Paraná River and the tributaries. However, RDA results showed spatial segregation among samples from the Paraná River main channel, such that the stretch located closer to the dam was associated with higher values of water transparency and Cyanobacteria density, exported by upstream reservoirs, whereas the middle and lower stretches were associated with higher phytoplankton complexity and higher nutrient concentration and turbidity. Conclusion Through the analysis of the phytoplankton community we could verify a reduction in the effects of oligotrophication along the longitudinal axis of the Paraná River and the important role of the tributaries in diminishing this effect...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{reservoirs}} of {{the medium}} and low Tietê River are disposed as a "cascade series", in which time, physiographic features and influence from drainage basins present differences that determine variability in their dynamics. These reservoirs are submitted to different impacts from the urban centres which they drain, and also from agricultural activities. Considering these features, {{the aim of this}} work was to characterize the Medium and Low Tietê river stretches by limnological analysis (including water and sediments) considering dry and rainy seasons evaluating changes along the reservoirs sequence. METHODS: Based on physical and chemical measurements on water and sediments from 16 points along the reservoirs and in the river <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> tributaries, it was possible to make an environmental characterization of the study area. RESULTS: This was performed focusing on water, sediment, habitat structure and time scale. Generally, the data showed a reduction in the values of the analyzed parameters along the reservoirs sequence. Moreover, it was possible to identify differences between the dry and rainy seasons for water and sediment parameters. Concerning habitat structure, there is a gradient along the river, which shows that the environmental quality improves from the river head to the river mouth. Differences in macrophyte composition, kind of sediments, transparency and habitats were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, modifications were identified in the habitats general structure along the medium Tietê stretch: emerging macrophytes and muddy bottom predominate upstream; and submerging macrophytes and sandy bottom predominate downstream. The water characteristics should be taken into consideration, because they reflect the impacts upon the drainage basin of each reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{quality for}} a given fish species is {{determined}} by factors that enhance survival, growth and reproductive success of its individuals. As such fish growth rate {{can be used to}} estimate the quality of essential fish habitats like estuaries. If food is not limiting, then temperature {{is likely to be the}} main controlling factor for growth. A multivariable bioenergetics model was constructed for the European flounder to generate spatially-explicit estimates of growth in theScheldt estuary. Digital maps of abiotic variables (temperature, oxygen concentration and salinity) for March, July and October were used as model inputs to evaluate spatial and temporal effects of water quality on growth rate potential. The model was run for two years (1998 and 2003) in order to describe any effect of improvement of the water quality on the estuarine-wide distribution of flounder. The model predicted that in March, when 0 -group flounder is known tomigrate upstream, growth is highest in the upper freshwater reaches of the estuary. This suggests that freshwater migration of flounder may be, at least partly, temperature driven. In July and October, low oxygen concentrations near the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> tributary probably prevent upstream migration. In summer and autumn, growth rate in the brackish part of the estuary was higher compared to the marine part. Field data on the distribution of flounder in theestuary showed that flounder abundance throughout the year was highest in the brackish part, where suitable prey items are readily available. Our results indicate that abiotic variables may be useful to predict the habitat use of diadromous species in estuaries. Given the importance of food in habitat selection, the model should be expanded with a foraging compartment to account for prey availability...|$|E
40|$|Pre-dams of optimum size {{normally}} located upstream of reservoirs {{have proven}} effective in phosphorus load reduction due to sedimentation of allochthonous and autochthonous seston. In {{order to achieve}} similar effects, model and in-situ experiments were carried out with an overstreamed submerged flexible curtain (SFC, 160 m long, 6 m deep) installed perpendicular to the flow direction in <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saidenbach Reservoir (Saxony, Germany). Before <b>the</b> installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SFC, the inlet normally formed a hydraulic short circuit between <b>mouth</b> and <b>main</b> basin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservoir along the upper metalimnetic layers during summer stratification. Therefore, <b>the</b> retention time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inflowing water was too short (1. 7 days on an average) to allow soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) elimination higher than approximately 20 % in the mouth region. The flow through regime changed after the SFC was built-in. The average retention time increased to about five days and sedimentation was favoured in the volume separated. The SRP elimination varied between 40 % and 60 % in the summer months. It is conclusive from <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a research project that flexible curtains of sufficient depth may be cost-effective substitutes for conventional pre-dams of eutrophic lakes or reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Dioxin and dioxin-like {{activity}} in sediments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Sea, along the Belgian coast, was assessed with the bioassay CALUX (Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression). Crude extracts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples {{as well as}} the dioxin fraction (PCDD/Fs) obtained after a thorough clean-up procedure were analyzed with the CALUX method. When analyzing the cleaned extract, a general low contamination level is observed (around 0. 1 pg CALUX-TEQ/g sediment), except at <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>main</b> rivers-the Yser and the Scheldt-where concentrations measured are about 100 times higher (10 - 42 pg CALUX-TEQ/g sediment). Much higher potencies are measured for the crude extracts compared to the cleaned ones. In the crude extracts, the highest dioxin-like activities were again observed at <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> and outflow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two rivers (600 - 7200 pg CALUX-TEQ/g sediment). These activities are at least two orders of magnitude higher than the ones found at the coastal and sea stations (1. 3 - 45 pg CALUX-TEQ/g sediment). The difference in activity between cleaned and crude sediment extracts is due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> dioxin-like compounds such as, for example, non-ortho and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated dioxins, but also to PAHs. <b>The</b> percentage <b>of</b> five major PAHs in the crude samples at the river mouths, when using the average activities in those samples, varies between 25 % and 50 %. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sea level, {{sea level}} changes and changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{coastline}} {{are very important}} elements used in Engineering Geology for understanding many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geomorphological and hydrogeological conditions or events. Sea level is, for instance, <b>the</b> border condition <b>of</b> all coastal aquifers; in hydrogeology, stable sea levels have the same importance as that of marine terraces in geomorphology, because in the appropriate contexts they may mark well developed karst levels or overlapped dolomitization in carbonate rocks. Riverbed profiles also develop according to the final sea level; when it decreases, a strong erosion phase begins. About 1500 stratigraphies of water wells or boreholes and geophysical logs have been analysed for hydrogeological purposes, with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> recognizing <b>the</b> bedrock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastal aquifer along <b>the</b> Ionic coastline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Basilicata region.

Some profiles representing these results are shown. This data may be important in evaluating the recent overall relative movement between the sea and the continent.
