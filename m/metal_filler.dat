50|$|In March 1990, 4-door {{versions}} of the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy were introduced as a 1991 model; the 4-door had a 6.5in longer wheelbase (2-doors had a 100.5 in wheelbase - six inches (152 mm) longer than the Ford Bronco II) and a one-piece front grille with a painted black insert (1990 2-door S-10 Blazers and Jimmies had the 3-piece grille). This new grille also did away with the separate <b>metal</b> <b>filler</b> panel under the grille, since the grille is taller and took its place.

40|$|Polymer-metal {{composites}} (PMCs) {{based on}} polyethylene (PE) and polyoxymethylene (POM) {{and on the}} blend PE/POM filled with dispersed iron or copper were prepared.

The method of processing was found to influence the percolation behavior of electrical conductivity.

40|$|Recently {{the use of}} {{injection}} moulded bonded magnets has become very widespread. This is mainly due to the interesting price of {{injection moulded}} magnets. However the process is actually limited by some critical aspects {{that are related to}} rheological and thermal properties of the melt. Compared to a non-filled polymer melt, the high filler content (about 90 % in weight), leads to a much higher viscosity, heavily affected by temperature. Furthermore, injection moulding of bonded magnets is characterized by high cooling rate, due to the high diffusivity of the <b>metal</b> <b>filler.</b> This can often lead to a premature gate freezing, negatively affecting the quality of the moulded part. Therefore, a reliable no-flow temperature is a prerequisite for a robust numerical simulation of the process. This paper presents a full characterization of the no-flow temperature of a commercial polyamide-based compound. To this aim, a method based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been compared with another approach that relies on rheological data.

The interstices are filled with air, phase change materials, or other fluids. Local thermal equilibrium between the solid filler and the matrix is not ensured in such systems since their thermal diffusivities are frequently very different. The use of a single volume-averaged energy equation for both the phases cannot be justified in such situations. A two-medium approach is used in the present work to account for the local thermal non-equilibrium. Separate energy equations are written for the solid and fluid respectively, and are closed using a steady-state interphase heat transfer coefficient between the two phases. A general momentum equation which includes the Brinkman-Forchheimer extension to Darcy flow is employed. The resulting equations are solved implicitly using a fully transient method on fixed orthogonal co-located finite volumes. Unsteady natural convection in a metal-foam filled cavity is computed. The influence of various parameters such as the ratios of solid-to-fluid thermal conductivities and heat capacities, Rayleigh number, Prandtl number and Darcy number on the thermal and flow fields is investigated.
