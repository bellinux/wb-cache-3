Methods: We retrospectively analyzed {{the records of}} patients who underwent TACE using <b>miriplatin</b> plus low-dose epirubicin (30 patients, 61 nodules, August 2011 –March 2012) and control patients who underwent TACE using <b>miriplatin</b> alone (36 patients, 70 nodules, June 2010 –July 2011). The local control rate was compared {{between the two groups}} using the Kaplan–Meier estimator and the log-rank test. Factors affecting local tumor recurrence were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Treatment-related toxicity was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Results: The local control rates at 6 months and 1 year were 87 % and 65 % for the <b>miriplatin</b> plus low-dose epirubicin group, and 61 % and 43 % for the <b>miriplatin</b> group, respectively. Local tumor control rates were significantly better in the <b>miriplatin</b> plus low-dose epirubicin group than in the <b>miriplatin</b> group (P = 0. 038). Multivariate analysis showed that the addition of epirubicin was an independent factor associated with better local tumor control (hazard ratio 0. 2, P = 0. 001). Overall incidence rates for adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Additional usage of low-dose epirubicin for TACE using <b>miriplatin</b> improved local tumor control of hepatocellular carcinoma with adverse effects comparable to those observed with TACE using <b>miriplatin</b> alone.

40|$|Abstract Background There is no {{standard}} therapeutic {{procedure for}} the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{in patients with}} poor hepatic reserve function. With the approval of newly developed chemotherapeutic agent of <b>miriplatin,</b> we have firstly conducted the phase I study of CDDP powder (DDP-H) and <b>miriplatin</b> combination therapy and reported its safety and efficacy for treating unresectable HCC in such cases. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for the combination of transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE) and transarterial chemotherapy (TAC) using <b>miriplatin</b> and DDP-H for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Transarterial chemotherapy using DDP-H was performed through the proper hepatic artery targeting the HCC nodules by increasing the dose of DDP-H (35 – 65 [*]mg/m 2) followed by targeting the HCC nodules by transarterial oily chemoembolization with <b>miriplatin.</b> Results A total of nine patients were enrolled {{in this study and}} no DLT was observed with any dose of DDP-H in all cases in whom 80 [*]mg (median, 18 – 120) <b>miriplatin</b> was administered. An anti-tumour efficacy rating for partial response was obtained in one patient, while a total of four patients (among eight evaluated) showed stable disease response, leading to 62. 5 % of disease control rate. The pharmacokinetic results showed no further increase in plasma platinum concentration following <b>miriplatin</b> administration. Conclusion Our results suggest that a combination of DDP-H and <b>miriplatin</b> can be safely administered up to their respective MTD for treating HCC.

30|$|For each patient, the TACE {{procedure}} was as follows. The femoral artery was catheterized under local anesthesia, and a 4 -Fr catheter was {{inserted into the}} celiac or common hepatic artery. Then a 1.8 -Fr coaxial micro-balloon catheter (Logos, Piolax, Yokohama, Japan) was advanced into the hepatic artery that supplied the entire target tumor. CT hepatic arteriography was performed before and after inflation of the balloon. Subsequently, miriplatin–lipiodol suspension was injected followed by gelatin sponge particle (Gelpart; Nippon Kayaku, Tokyo). <b>Miriplatin</b> was prepared by mixing 30 or 60  mg (1 or 2 vials) of <b>miriplatin</b> hydrate in 3 or 6  mL of lipiodol.

30|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) is {{a widely}} accepted and effective therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; Llovet et al. 2002). Various anticancer drugs {{can be used for}} TACE, including doxorubicin, epirubicin, cisplatin and mitomycin, but the superiority of any particular drug in terms of effectiveness has not been established (Ishikawa et al. 2014). <b>Miriplatin</b> hydrate (Miripla®; Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Osaka, Japan), which has the same diaminocyclohexane structure as oxaliplatin, is a lipophilic derivative that can be suspended in lipiodol (Hanada et al. 2009), became commercially available in 2010. Theoretically, <b>miriplatin</b> is a good agent in terms of its higher solubility, stability in lipiodol, and gradual release within the tumor. However, a 2012 study revealed that the rate of local recurrence in patients treated with <b>miriplatin</b> was significantly higher than that in patients treated with epirubicin with mitomycin (Miyayama et al. 2012). This is due to the high viscosity of miriplatin–lipiodol suspension (Kora et al. 2013). Some researchers have tested creative TACE methods to overcome the high viscosity problem and improve the therapeutic effect (TE); these methods including warming <b>miriplatin</b> (Kora et al. 2013) and balloon-occluded TACE (B-TACE; Ishikawa et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: We {{report a}} patient with a rapidly {{progressing}} recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a portal vein tumor thrombus after radiofrequency ablation of the original lesion, then treated with transcatheter arterial infusion. Radical hepatic resection demonstrated a complete pathological response. Presentation of case: A 60 -year old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and gastric varices was diagnosed with HCC measuring 12  mm in segment 8. He underwent laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, but recurred three months later. The lesion progressed rapidly and the right portal vein was occluded. He then underwent transcatheter arterial infusion with <b>miriplatin</b> and iodized oil, which was effective in reducing {{the size of the}} main lesion and portal vein tumor thrombus. Right anterior sectionectomy was then performed. Pathologically, there were no viable HCC cells in either the main lesion or the portal vein thrombus. He is alive two years and nine months after surgery without recurrence. Discussion: A rapidly progressing HCC recurrence with portal vein tumor thrombus is usually associated with a poor prognosis. No effective treatments have been reported in this situation except hepatic resection. In this patient the tumor was effectively reduced after three courses of transarterial <b>miriplatin</b> and subsequent radical hepatic resection. This is the first report to achieve a complete pathological response for such an aggressive recurrence after initial radiofrequency ablation. Conclusion: This strategy may result in long-term survival of patients with rapidly progressing recurrent HCC with portal vein thrombus, and further study is warranted...|$|E
30|$|This {{retrospective}} {{clinical study}} {{was approved by}} the ethics committee of our hospital. The requirement for informed patient consent was waived.

30|$|B-TACE {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Irie et al. (2013). They reported that selective B-TACE with doxorubicin and mitomycin induced dense lipiodol accumulation in HCC nodules. Ishikawa et al. (2014) revealed that B-TACE with <b>miriplatin</b> achieved relatively good local control of HCC (local recurrence rate, 11.1  % at 6  months and 26.2  % at 12  months). The mechanism of this improved local control effect might {{be explained by the}} presence of anastomotic vessels, the viscosity of lipiodol emulsion, and the difference in size between the peripheral vessels in normal parenchyma and the vessels feeding into the HCC (Irie et al. 2013). Ishikawa et al. (2014) mentioned that altering hemodynamics might be a main factor under balloon occlusion.|$|E
30|$|Ishikawa et al.

They {{reported that in}} the setting of a balloon occlusion, lipiodol emulsion ceased to flow in the peripheral vessels supplying liver parenchyma but still continued to flow into HCC nodules in the majority of the cases (Irie et al. 2013). In some cases, lipiodol emulsion did not show stagnation in the peripheral vessels supplying the liver parenchyma, leading to poor local control (Irie et al. 2013). Ishikawa et al.

Objective response was defined as TE 3 / 4, and poor TE as TE 1 / 2, evaluated by response evaluation criteria in cancer of the liver at 1 – 4  months after the procedure. Univariate analysis revealed that proximal level of balloon occlusion, intratumoral lower CT values immediately after treatment and BO-CTHA findings were significantly correlated with poor TE (p =  0.034, 0.037, and 0.003, respectively).

A total of 82 HCC nodules (82 patients), ≤ 5 cm in diameter, were treated with balloon-occluded TACE using <b>miriplatin</b> between December 2013 and November 2014. For each patient, both CBCT and conventional CT images were obtained post-TACE. The degree of correlation between CBCT and conventional CT was determined by comparing identical regions of interest for each imaging modality using pixel values. The pixel values from conventional CT and CBCT were highly correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 912 (p< 0. 001). The location of the nodules within the liver did not affect the results; the correlation coefficient was 0. 891 (p< 0. 001) for the left lobe and 0. 926 (p< 0. 001) for the right lobe. The mean pixel value for conventional CT was 439 ± 279 HU, and the mean pixel value for CBCT was 416 ± 311 HU.
