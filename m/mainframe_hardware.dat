40|$|The {{development}} of virtualization started in 1960, when VMware introduced partitioning of large <b>mainframes</b> for better <b>hardware</b> utilization. (Virtualization History, 2010) Since then virtualization has matured and been adopted {{to a wide}} extent in the industry. Recent developments include branching into areas of server virtualization, storage and application virtualization and, very recently, desktop virtualization. Desktop virtualization {{has so far been}} through two models: the Client hosted model, which is typically operated from the user‚Äôs workstation using Windows Virtual PC; and the VMware workstation or Java Virtual Machine (VM). However, recently a third model has emerged, called the server hosted model or Hosted virtual desktop (HVD), which is a virtualized form of desktop (VM) delivered to users from the cloud infrastructure. In other words virtualization in computing has progressed to an extent where desktops can be virtualized and accessed from anywhere. The server hosted model has already surpassed 1 % market share of the worldwide professional PC market, with estimates indicating that this is a rapidly growing area. This study investigates the adequacy of current digital forensic procedures on hosted virtual desktops (HVDs) as there {{does not appear to be}} specific methods of locating and extracting evidences from this infrastructure. Using the Forensic Iterative Development Model (FIDM), HVDs deployed in private cloud were simulated to reflect three different computer crime (quasiexperimental) scenarios. It was found that current digital forensic procedures may not be adequate for locating and extracting evidence, since the infrastructure in scenario 2 and 3 introduces complications such as non-persistent disk modes and segregating data in a multitenant environment. However in scenario 1, findings illustrate that all standard investigation techniques can be followed as a result of the persistent user environment. Furthermore, suggestions are made to extend the current research in the areas of techniques to acquire virtual machines from hypervisors, hashing evidence and forensic readiness in environments consisting HVDs...|$|R
5000|$|Historical note: The 3270 {{approach}} {{differed from}} lower-cost dumb terminals of the period, which were point-to-point and asynchronous. Commercial time-sharing users, an important segment of early CP/CMS and VM sites, relied on such devices {{because they could}} connect via 300- or 1200 bit/s modems over normal voice-grade telephone circuits. Installing a dedicated circuit for a 3270 was often not practical, economical, or timely.The 3270's block-oriented approach was more consistent with IBM's batch- and punched card-oriented view of computing, and was particularly important for IBM mainframes of the day. Unlike contemporary minicomputers, most IBM mainframes were not equipped for character-at-a-time interrupts. Dumb terminal support relied on terminal control units such as the IBM 270x (see IBM 3705) or Memorex 1270. These asynchronous terminal controllers assembled a line of characters, up to a fixed maximum length, until the RETURN key was pressed. Typing too many characters would result in an error, a familiar situation to users of the day. (Most data centers did not include this equipment, except as needed for dial-up access. The 3270 approach was preferred.)Block-oriented terminals like the 3270 made it practical to implement screen-oriented editors on mainframes [...] - [...] as opposed to line-oriented editors, the previous norm. This had been an important advantage of contemporary minicomputers and other character-oriented systems, and its availability via the 3270 was warmly welcomed.A gulf developed between the 3270 world, focused on page-oriented mainframe transaction processing (especially via CICS), and the asynch terminal world, focused on character-oriented minicomputers and dial-up timesharing. Asynchronous terminal vendors gradually improved their products {{with a range of}} smart terminal features, usually accessed via escape sequences. However, these devices rarely competed for 3270 users; IBM maintained its dominance over <b>mainframe</b> data center <b>hardware</b> purchase decisions.Viewed in retrospect, there was a major philosophical divergence between block-oriented and character-oriented computing. Asynchronous terminal controllers and 3270s both provided the mainframe with block-oriented interactions [...] - [...] essentially, they made the terminal input look like a card reader. This approach, preferred by IBM, {{led to the development of}} entirely different user interface paradigms and programming strategies. Character-oriented systems evolved differently. The difference is apparent when comparing the atomic transaction approach of dominant CICS with the interactive, stream-oriented style of UNIX. VM/CMS evolved somewhere between these extremes. CMS has a command-driven, stateful, interactive environment, rather than adopting the CICS approach of a stateless transaction-oriented interface. Yet CMS responds to page- or line-at-a-time interaction, instead of character interrupts.|$|R

The GS21 machines are essentially ESA/390 (31-bit) instruction set processors largely based on Amdahl-designed technologies but are only compatible with Fujitsu's domestic market operating systems: OSIV/MSP-EX and OSIV/XSP. MSP is most similar to classic IBM MVS/ESA, and XSP is most similar to classic IBM VSE/ESA.

50|$|In {{addition}} to hardware, both Burroughs and Sperry {{had a history}} of working on U.S. government contracts. Unisys continues to provide hardware, software, and services to various government agencies. Soon after the merger, the market for proprietary mainframe-class systems‚Äîthe mainstream product of Unisys and its competitors such as IBM‚Äîbegan a long-term decline that continues, at a lesser rate, today. In response, Unisys made the strategic decision to shift into high-end servers (e.g., 32 processor Windows Servers), as well as information technology (IT) services such as systems integration, outsourcing, and related technical services, while holding onto the profitable revenue stream from maintaining its installed base of proprietary <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware</b> and applications.|$|E
50|$|On July 26, 2010, the European Commission {{announced}} {{two separate}} antitrust investigations against International Business Machines (IBM).

In 2000, Hitachi co-developed the zSeries z900 with IBM to share expenses, but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new Hitachi models. Hewlett-Packard sells its unique NonStop systems, which it acquired with Tandem Computers and which some analysts classify as mainframes.

50|$|Open Mainframe Project is a Collaborative Project {{managed by}} the Linux Foundation to {{encourage}} the use of Linux-based operating systems and open source software on mainframe computers. The project was announced on August 17, 2015 and was driven by IBM, a major supplier of <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware,</b> as well as 16 other founding members, that included SUSE, Computer Associates, BMC Software, Compuware as well as clients and partners such as RSM Partner, Vicom Infinity, L3C LLP and ADP, and academic institutions such as Marist College and University of Bedfordshire. Coincident with the announcement, IBM also announced a partnership with Canonical to make the Ubuntu operating system available for their high-end z Systems hardware.|$|E
50|$|That trend {{started to}} turn around in the late 1990s as {{corporations}} found new uses for their existing mainframes and {{as the price of}} data networking collapsed {{in most parts of the}} world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of e-business also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the Linux operating system, which arrived on IBM mainframe systems in 1999 and is typically run in scores or hundreds of virtual machines on a single mainframe. Linux allows users to take advantage of open source software combined with <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware</b> RAS. Rapid expansion and development in emerging markets, particularly People's Republic of China, is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000, IBM introduced 64-bit z/Architecture, acquired numerous software companies such as Cognos and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM's quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM's <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware</b> business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM's System z hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS shipments increased 4% per year over the past two years. Alsop had himself photographed in 2000, symbolically eating his own words ("death of the mainframe").|$|E
50|$|In Packed BCD (or simply packed decimal), {{each of the}} two nibbles of each byte {{represent}} a decimal digit. Packed BCD has been in use since at least the 1960s and is implemented in all IBM <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware</b> since then. Most implementations are big endian, i.e. with the more significant digit in the upper half of each byte, and with the leftmost byte (residing at the lowest memory address) containing the most significant digits of the packed decimal value. The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag. As an example, a 4-byte value consists of 8 nibbles, wherein the upper 7 nibbles store the digits of a 7-digit decimal value and the lowest nibble indicates the sign of the decimal integer value.|$|E

5000|$|Japanese {{mainframe}} manufacturers Fujitsu and Hitachi both {{repeatedly and}} illegally obtained IBM's MVS source code and internal documentation {{in one of}} the 20th century's most famous cases of industrial espionage. Fujitsu relied heavily on IBM's code in its MSP mainframe operating system, and likewise Hitachi did the same for its VOS3 operating system. MSP and VOS3 were heavily marketed in Japan, where they still hold a substantial share of the mainframe installed base, but also to some degree in other countries, notably Australia. Even IBM's bugs and documentation misspellings were faithfully copied. IBM cooperated with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation in a sting operation, reluctantly supplying Fujitsu and Hitachi with proprietary MVS and <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware</b> technologies during the course of multi-year investigations culminating in the early 1980s‚Äîinvestigations which implicated senior company managers and even some Japanese government officials. Amdahl, however, was not involved in Fujitsu's theft of IBM's intellectual property. Any communications from Amdahl to Fujitsu were through [...] "Amdahl Only Specifications" [...] which were scrupulously cleansed of any IBM IP or any references to IBM's IP.|$|E
50|$|Linux on z {{gives the}} {{flexibility}} of running Linux with the advantages of fault-tolerant <b>mainframe</b> <b>hardware</b> capable of over 90,000 I/O operations per second and with a {{mean time between failure}} (MTBF) measured in decades. Using virtualization, numerous smaller servers can be combined onto one mainframe, gaining some benefits of centralization and cost reduction, while still allowing specialized servers. Instead of paravirtualization, IBM mainframes use full virtualization, which permits workload density far greater than paravirtualization does. Combining full virtualization of the hardware plus lightweight Virtual Machine containers that run Linux in isolation (somewhat similar in concept to Docker) result in a platform that supports more virtual servers than any other in a single footprint, which also can lower operating costs. Additional savings can be seen from reduced need for floor space, power, cooling, networking hardware, and the other infrastructure needed to support a data center. IBM mainframes allow transparent use of redundant processor execution steps and integrity checking, which is important for critical applications in certain industries such as banking.. Mainframes typically allow hot-swapping of hardware, such as processors and memory. z Systems provides fault tolerance for all key components, including processors, memory, I/O Interconnect, power supply, channel paths, network cards, and others. Through internal monitoring, possible problems are detected and problem components are designed to be switched over without even failing a single transaction. In the rare event of failure, firmware will automatically enable a spare component, disable the failing component, and notify IBM to dispatch a service representative. This is transparent to the operating system, allowing routine repairs to be performed without shutting down the system. Industries continue to rely on mainframes because they are genuinely the best option, in terms of reliability, security, and often cost.|$|E
