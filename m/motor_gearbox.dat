50|$|The {{upper body}} joints of SURENA III {{are driven by}} {{servomotor}} packages which include <b>motor,</b> <b>gearbox</b> and driver. One DOF in waist enlarges the workspace of the arms for gripping and whole body motions. Two DOFs in neck give the head capability of having pan and tilt motions. Furthermore, inspired from human beings, each arm of the robot has 7 DOF (three in shoulder, 1 in elbow, 3 in wrist), in which the actuators have been connected via fiberglass plates to reduce the weight. This redundant structure gives the robot arms capability of dexterous manipulation. Finally, a mechanism has been employed in hands to enable it to grip the objects. Using this mechanism, all 5 fingers of each hand may move simultaneously, and realize the gripping.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a couple}} of {{propulsion}} techniques for AUVs. Some of them use a brushed or brush-less electric <b>motor,</b> <b>gearbox,</b> Lip seal, and a propeller which may be surrounded by a nozzle or not. All of these parts embedded in the AUV construction are involved in propulsion. Other vehicles use a thruster unit to maintain the modularity. Depending on the need, the thruster may be equipped with a nozzle for propeller collision protection or to reduce noise submission, or it may be equipped with a direct drive thruster to keep the efficiency at the highest level and the noises at the lowest level. Advanced AUV thrusters have a redundant shaft sealing system to guarantee a proper seal of the robot even if one of the seals fails during the mission.|$|E

5000|$|Commercial Motor {{carried a}} review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with {{commercial}} operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a [...] motor, and was designed to travel at 3 mph, with a range of 8 to 10 mi on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat platform truck, with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The <b>motor,</b> <b>gearbox</b> and an automatic clutch were mounted on the single front wheel forks. A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the centrifugal drum clutch was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried.|$|E
