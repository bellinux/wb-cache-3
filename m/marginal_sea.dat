They are all subject to strong climate forcing as well as anthropogenic impacts. On the one hand, continental margins in this region are bordered by the world's most densely populated coastal communities and receive tremendous amount of land-derived materials. On the other hand, the Kuroshio, the strong western boundary current of the North Pacific Ocean, which is modulated by climate oscillation, exerts strong influences over all three <b>marginal</b> <b>seas.</b> Because these continental margins sustain arguably {{some of the most}} productive marine ecosystems in the world, changes in these stressed ecosystems may threaten the livelihood of a large population of humans. This special issue reports the latest observations of the biogeochemical conditions and ecosystem functions in the three <b>marginal</b> <b>seas.</b> The studies exemplify the many faceted ecosystem functions and biogeochemical expressions, but they reveal only a few long-term trends mainly due to lack of sufficiently long records of well-designed observations.

40|$|We review {{data on the}} {{absorption}} of anthropogenic CO 2 by Northern Hemisphere <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> (Arctic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and East/Japan Sea) and its transport to adjacent major basins, and consider the susceptibility to recent climatic change of key factors that influence CO 2 uptake by these <b>marginal</b> <b>seas.</b> Dynamic overturning circulation is a common feature of these seas, and this effectively absorbs anthropogenic CO 2 and transports it from the surface to {{the interior of the}} basins. Amongst these seas only the East/Japan Sea has no outflow of intermediate and deep water (containing anthropogenic CO 2) to an adjacent major basin; the others are known to be significant sources of intermediate and deep water to the open ocean. Consequently, only the East/Japan Sea retains all the anthropogenic CO 2 absorbed during the anthropocene. Investigations of the properties of the water column in these seas have revealed a consistent trend of waning water column ventilation over time, probably because of changes in local atmospheric forcing. This weakening ventilation has resulted in a decrease in transport of anthropogenic CO 2 from the surface to the interior of the basins, and to the adjacent open ocean. Ongoing measurements of anthropogenic CO 2, other gases and hydrographic parameters in these key <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> will provide information on changes in global oceanic CO 2 uptake associated with the predicted increasing atmospheric CO 2 and future global climate change. We also review the roles of other <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> with no active overturning circulation systems in absorbing and storing anthropogenic CO 2. The absence of overturning circulation enables anthropogenic CO 2 to penetrate only into shallow depths, resulting in less accumulation of anthropogenic CO 2 in these basins. As a consequence of their proximity to populated continents, these <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> are particularly vulnerable to human-induced perturbations. Maintaining observation programs will make it possible to assess the effects of human-induced changes on the capacity of these seas to uptake and store anthropogenic CO 2...|$|R

As shown by micropaleontological, iso 2 topical and organic geochemical analyses, the sea surface temperatures in the <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> at the last glacial maximum were much cooler {{than those in the}} open Western Pacific Ocean. The emergence of extensive shelves of the <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> at the glacial low sea 2 level stand and the decrease of surface temperatures in their deeper water parts resulted in a remarkable reduction of the ability of vapor and heat transport to the atmosphere, causing variabilities to the Warm Pool in the glacial cycles. The intensification of winter monsoon at the glacial stages not only led to a decrease of the surface water temperature and hence to an enhanced seasonality, but also carried moisture from the sea to the tropical islands, giving rise to the downward shift of snowline and mountainous vegetation zones there.

40|$|Using {{satellite}} observations, reanalysis data, {{and model}} simulations, this study investigates {{the effect of}} sea surface temperature (SST) on interannual variations of lower-stratospheric ozone at southern high latitudes in austral spring. It is found that the SST variations across the East Asian <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> (5 ° S– 35 ° N, 100 – 140 ° E) rather than the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, where ENSO occurs, have the most significant correlation with the southern high-latitude lower-stratospheric ozone changes in austral spring. Further analysis reveals that planetary waves originating over the <b>marginal</b> <b>seas</b> in austral spring can propagate towards southern middle to high latitudes via teleconnection pathway. The anomalous propagation and dissipation of ultra-long Rossby waves in the stratosphere strengthen/cool (weaken/warm) the southern polar vortex, which produces more (less) active chlorine and enhances (suppresses) ozone depletion in the southern high-latitude stratosphere on one the hand and impedes (favors) the transport of ozone from the southern middle-latitude stratosphere to high latitudes on the other.
