Ultimately, the conclusion in Prometheus is premised upon the public policy consideration that certain types of medical and diagnostic findings should not be afforded patent protection, {{as the need for}} unencumbered access to critical scientific data and study in the medical community overwhelms any alleged <b>monetary</b> <b>disincentive</b> suffered by the patent applicant. The Court recognized that patent protection should not serve as a stumbling block for continued scientific innovation and improvement in medical treatment methodologies.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} effectiveness of extrinsic <b>monetary</b> <b>disincentives</b> and intrinsic non-monetary disincentives to corruption. In doing so, we also test the Beckarian prediction {{that at the}} same level of expected payoff, a low probability of detection with high penalty is a stronger deterrent to corruption than a high probability of detection with low penalty. In Experiment 1, two treatments are designed to study the effect of a low probability of detection with high penalty, and a high probability of detection with low penalty, on bribe taking behavior in a harassment bribery game. In Experiment 2, subjects participate in the same baseline harassment bribery game either without or after having gone through a four-week ethics education program. Results show that a) a low probability of detection with high penalty reduces both the amount and the likelihood of bribe demand, b) a high probability of detection with low penalty has no effect on bribe demand behavior, c) normative appeals of ethics education has a small effect on the likelihood but not on the amount of bribe demand, when measured immediately after the intervention, d) the effect of ethics education vanishes when measured four weeks after the intervention, e) extrinsic monetary intervention, particularly low probability of detection with high penalty, is more effective than normative appeal driven non-monetary intervention that aim to increase intrinsic moral cost, f) analysis of belief about acceptability of bribe demand indicates that the underlying channels through which monetary and non-monetary interventions work are very different...|$|R

In the first documented case, the athlete Eupolos from Thessalia bribed {{three of his}} competitors in fist fightingat the Olympic games of 388 B. C. In modern sports, well documented cases of corruption are e. g the college basketball scandal in the USA in 1951, and the scandal in German soccer Bundesliga in 1971, and {{the case of the}} IOC in 1998 / 1999, concentrated around the bidding process for the Olympic Winter Games of 2002 inSalt Lake City, USA. This article shows that corruption in sports is - as in other areas of human activities - accessible for an economic analysis. From such an analysis informations can be deduced which may enhance the anticorruption measures which - up to now - have been worked out and implemented mainly by experts from law, policy and pedagogy. Measures which reduce the rents in sports, which enhance transparency and <b>monetary</b> <b>disincentives</b> against corruptive behaviour are especially efficient. It is noticeable that - in spite of the obviously high degree of economic determination of the problems - in all cases relatively little use has so far been made of economic instruments during the elaboration of counter-measures. The usual, most prominent reactions were bans for officials and/or athletes, for a limited time or for lifetime. These bans were accommodated by other measures of order policy. For example, {{in the case of the}} IOC scandal, membership in the IOC was limited to eight years (with the possibility of reelection), the age limit was lowered to 70, the host city election procedure was overhauled to ensure that only cities adequately prepared will be authorized to go forward into the full bid process, and there is now a ban on members travelling to the applicant cities. Furthermore, since 2003, the IOC ethic code now also applies to bidding cities. The case of the IOC is a good one to show that - althoughthe sports federations in general underwent transformations in a shorttime which would almost seem impossible for any other comparable national or international organisation the measures might becriticised and enhanced from an economic point of view.

40|$|This papers {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} equity effect of a hypothesized economic instrument, a carbon charge on car commuters, for reducing carbon dioxide emissions produced by commuters on airport surface access. Manchester Airport is taken {{as a case study}} using staff Survey data from 2008 and 2010. Consumer welfare change is analysed for measuring the equity effects of carbon charge by user group, which considers the changes of travel mode choice, the carbon dioxide emissions reduction, the revenue from a carbon charge and how it is distributed. First, the individual carbon footprint in terms of gram passenger kilometre, and the damage cost of carbon by commuters on airport surface access are estimated. Next, the impact of carbon charge on travel behaviour is investigated by the nested logit model. Finally, the net effect of carbon charges is assessed by travel mode user, gender, job type, and age group. The results show some impacts of the carbon charge on car users and carbon reduction, and the positive effects on lower income group and less carbon commuters. The quantified results provide the evidences for the mitigation policies to combine <b>monetary</b> incentives with <b>disincentives</b> for travel behaviour change, and demonstrate the different equity effects among commuter groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{population policy}} agenda {{has traditionally been}} dominated by demographically driven population control policies. However, in the population policy development that preceded the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994, people’s reproductive needs and rights received more emphasis. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze how the new emphasis in population policies has been interpreted at the country level. In analyzing population policy rhetoric and its practical interpretations in India in 1994, the authors found that the rhetoric was broadening to encompass women’s empowerment and reproductive health and that the use of direct method-specific <b>monetary</b> incentives and <b>disincentives</b> for accepting family planning methods was disapproved. However, population policy options were still considered mainly in terms of their ability to reduce fertility. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on the general market agenda was more important than that on reproductive needs and rights in molding population policies, as was evident in the greater stress on cost-recovery systems and nongovernmental actors. The findings suggest that the broader agenda for population policies and reproductive rights has been interpreted so that it can serve the aims of population-growth control and be implemented in the context of more market-oriented social policies and trade liberalization. International population policies have traditionally had a demographic orienta-tion. In the 1970 s the implementation of population policies was promoted pre-dominantly by the industrial countries, while most Third World countries argued for a new economic order and the right to development as the best means for This study was supported by the Academy of Finland...|$|R
40|$|Barriers to the {{adoption}} of grid pricing by fed cattle producers are investigated over a 206 -week period (January 1997 to December 2000). The empirical findings document the following potential barriers to adoption: (1) when fed cattle are evaluated on a grid pricing system versus a dressed weight pricing system, a price differential per cwt. and a per-head revenue differential exists over time, (2) the price differential per cwt. is subject to seasonal variation, resulting in variability in the monetary incentive to market-fed cattle on a grid relative to selling cattle at an average price, and (3) the variability in per-head grid revenue is consistently higher than per-head dressed weight revenue variability over time. The marketing implications for fed cattle producers are (1) the incentive to market on a grid versus selling fed cattle dressed weight is lower in the spring relative to the fall; (2) marketing on a grid does reward producers selling high quality steers and the incentive to market higher quality cattle on a grid has been increasing over the 206 -week period of the study; (3) grid discounts levied on lower quality cattle have also been increasing over time; (4) selling on a grid results in higher per-head revenue variability relative to selling fed cattle dressed-weight, indicating that while producers are rewarded when selling high quality cattle on a grid relative to selling at an average price, it is also a riskier marketing option relative to average pricing; and (5) the 4 -year trend in the price differential per cwt. for above-average cattle has been positive but negative for the below-average quality cattle. This trend indicates that packers are providing <b>monetary</b> incentives and <b>disincentives</b> based on overall cattle quality when fed cattle are sold on a grid relative to purchasing fed cattle at an average price. Corresponding with this shift in the incentive structure of grid pricing, overall carcass quality has improved in the region from which data was collected. However, the empirical evidence supports the conclusion that the barriers to {{the adoption}} of grid pricing continue to exist. Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
