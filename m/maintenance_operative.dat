40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between cavity preparation extension and restoration longevity is examined through a systemic {{review of the}} available evidence on specific conservative, operative caries-management strategies. Evidence tables are provided for three specific techniques in the permanent dentition: 1) the proximal “tunnel ” restoration, 2) the proximal “box-only ” restoration, and 3) the preventive resin restoration. In the primary dentition, the clinical trials involving the proximal box-only restoration, most of which involved glass-ionomer materials, are reviewed. In the permanent dentition, the evidence reveals low effectiveness for “tunnel ” restorations, limited but supportive results for proximal-only restorations, and generally favorable outcomes for the occlusal composite resin-sealant restoration. The weak link in the latter is the overlying fissure sealant, which requires adequate ongoing <b>maintenance.</b> Conservative <b>operative</b> strategies in the primary dentition have not been uniformly successful, and deleterious material effects dominate restoration performance. This systematic review concludes that operative conservatism per se does not guarantee increased restoration longevity and that all restorations are vulnerable to caries recurrence, material failures, and technical deficiencies. The more successful conservative strategies are expected to enhance tooth longevity, provided concomitant caries control is effective.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specialties}} {{dealing with}} emergency medicine and emergency surgery {{are in need}} for a new roadmap. While the medical and surgical management of emergency conditions very often go hand-in-hand, issues relating to emergency and trauma surgery have particular concerns, which are global in magnitude. Obviously, choosing a career dealing (solely) with emergencies and trauma is associated with concerns related to lifestyle issues and, for surgeons, <b>maintenance</b> of adequate <b>operative</b> experience with the increased non-operative management. Also, dealing with patients' whose outcome may be dismal with high associated morbidity and mortality is often not viewed as rewarding. The global flux of medical students away from general surgical training and trauma surgery in particular {{is an example of how}} recruitment to specialties dealing with uncomfortable, unpredictable, and "out-of-office-hours" work may be in dire straits. How surgeons around the world will deal with this challenge will likely be diverse and tailored according to the needs of any given region, be it North America, Europe, or Scandinavia. However, refurnishing the training in General Surgery in order to ensure proper care for acute surgical illness and trauma appears mandated in order to keep in line with the centennial words of Halstead that "every important hospital should have on its resident staff of surgeons at least one who is well and able to deal with any emergency that may arise"...|$|R

The compounds that can leach from landfilled materials include dissolved organic matter, inorganic macrocomponents, heavy metals, and xebobiotic organic compounds. Landfill surface-water runoff {{poses a threat to}} the environment due to high mobility, but has not been rigorously characterized with regards to common pollutants found in landfills. It is well documented that constructed wetlands can serve as an effective treatment option for many pollutants found in landfills. The Napanee Landfill has constructed a wetland in order to treat surface-water runoff coming off the landfill. The objectives of this study were to: 1) characterize the water chemistry of surface-water runoff for an inactive landfill; 2) evaluate the treatment potential for the constructed wetland system at the Napanee Landfill; and, 3) recommend design, <b>maintenance,</b> and <b>operative</b> improvements to enhance effluent water quality. The analysis of the landfill surface-water runoff entering the Napanee Landfill constructed wetland included the pollutants nitrate, ammonia, sulphate, phosphorus, and chloride. The median inflow and outflow concentrations for all of the observed pollutants did not exceed Canadian federal or provincial water quality guidelines. There were sampling days where ammonia, phosphorus, and chloride exceeded guidelines at the inflow and days where ammonia and chloride exceeded guidelines at the outflow. The only pollutant that saw a statistically significant decrease in concentrations was sulphate, with a change of 38 % from the inflow to the outflow. Other changes of note were nitrate and phosphorus concentrations increasing by 50 % and 23 % respectively from the inflow to the outflow. There are a variety of improvements that can be made to the Napanee Landfill constructed wetland that would increase the treatment efficiency of ammonia. Incorporating a vertical-flow wetland would increase available surface area for nitrifying bacteria growth and would provide more oxygen for nitrification processes; both would increase the potential for significant ammonia treatment. Overall, the concentrations of the pollutants found in the surface-water runoff coming off of the Napanee Landfill constructed wetland did not pose a significant threat to the environment at the time of sampling and treatment processes were only successful in reducing sulphate pollutant concentrations...|$|R
40|$|A {{recognized}} {{safety issue}} for future fusion reactors fueled with deuterium and tritium is {{the generation of}} sizeable quantities of dust. Several mechanisms [like plasma disruptions, Edge Localized Modes (ELM) and Vertical Displacement Events (VDE) ] resulting from material response to plasma bombardment in normal and off-normal conditions are responsible for generating dust of micron and sub-micron length scales inside the VV (Vacuum Vessel) of experimental fusion reactors like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The loss of coolant accidents (LOCA), loss of coolant flow accidents (LOFA) and loss of vacuum accidents (LOVA) are types of accidents expected in experimental fusion reactors like ITER, which may jeopardize the components and the plasma vessel integrity and cause dust mobilization risk for workers and public. A small facility, Small Tank for Aerosol Removal and DUST (STARDUST), {{was set up to}} perform experiments concerning the dust mobilization in a volume with the initial condition similar to those existing in ITER VV. The aim of this work was to reproduce a low pressurization rate (300 Pa/s) LOVA event in ITER due to a small air leakage, for two different positions of the leak, at the equatorial port level and at the divertor port level, in order to evaluate a first re-suspension numerical model by the analysis of the: 1. 	influence of obstacles and temperature on dust resuspension during both <b>maintenance</b> and <b>operative</b> conditions; 2. 	The velocity field inside STARDUST. For the first experimental purpose the dusts used were tungsten (W), stainless steel (SS) and carbon (C), similar to those produced inside the vacuum chamber in a fusion reactor when the plasma facing materials vaporizes due to the high energy deposition. The experimental campaign has been carried out by introducing inside STARDUST facility an obstacle to simulate the presence of objects, like divertor and the limiter-divertor gap inside ITER VV at different temperatures (25 �C maintenance conditions, 110 �C during operative conditions). For the second experimental purpose, local measurements of velocity have been acquired by means of a capacitive transducer. A two-dimensional (2 D) modelling of STARDUST was made with the commercial CFD code FLUENT, {{in order to get a}} preliminary overview of the fluid dynamics behaviour during a LOVA event and to justify the experimental evidence. The results of these simulations were compared against the experimental data for the CFD code validation.

In this work, the computer-simulation data and the comparison with data collected during the laboratory studies will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Scope of {{this paper}} is to report results of an {{experimental}} research aiming to characterize emergency lighting equipment behavior during switch on transients with static CSS supply. Emergency lighting equipment inrush current peak values and waveforms are typically very dispersed depending on technology and manufacturers and can create problems when sizing or operating CSS equipments. High peak values can lead to CSS electronic protection tripping. Emergency lighting centralized systems are nowadays becoming a growing issue due to higher safety level requirements in addition to higher lighting power needed. Considering the lack of available reliable data on lighting equipment behavior, inrush current issue is currently approached by CSS over sizing. The research aims to fill this gap providing statistical data obtained with a proper scientific approach. Given the importance of CSS cost, the availability of such data will allow system designers to optimize CSS sizing, reducing both <b>operative</b> (<b>maintenance</b> and losses) and installation costs. The key factor for an optimal CSS sizing is the knowledge of the behavior of lighting equipments during switch on phase: the cool start phase is typically considered the most critical condition. Measurements described in this paper have been carried out on different types of lamps typically used in emergency installations around Europe mains supplied. Further investigations have been done with sample lamps CSS supplied. Network supply conditions have been chosen in order to evaluate the parameters describing phenomenon in terms of duration, maximum peak value and current rms value during turn on transients. CSS supply conditions have been chosen in order to evaluate lighting equipment behavior with current limitation and non sinusoidal waveform...|$|R
40|$|Background: Patients with unicompartmental {{osteoarthritis}} of {{the knee}} can be treated with a correction osteotomy. The goal of the correction osteotomy is to transfer the load bearing from the pathologic to the normal compartment {{of the knee}}. A successful outcome of the osteotomy relies on proper patient selection, stage of osteoarthritis, achievement and <b>maintenance</b> of adequate <b>operative</b> correction. This is an update of the original review published in Issue 1, 2005. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of an osteotomy for treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Search strategy: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE (Current contents, Health STAR) up to October 2002 in the original review and in the update until May 2007. Reference lists of identified trials were screened. Selection criteria: Randomised and controlled clinical trials comparing a high tibial osteotomy or a distal femoral osteotomy in patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the medial or lateral compartment of the knee. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Due to heterogeneity of the studies, pooling of outcome measures was not possible. Main results: Thirteen studies involving over 693 people were included; 11 studies {{were included in the}} first version and two studies and one longer follow-up study were included in this update. All studies concerned a valgus high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. Six studies, in which two studies were included in this update, compared two techniques of HTO. One study compared HTO alone versus HTO with additional treatment. Four studies compared within the same type of HTO, different perioperative conditions (two studies) or two different types of post-operative treatment (two studies). Two studies, including the longer follow up, compared HTO with unicompartmental joint replacement. No study compared an osteotomy with conservative treatment. Most studies showed improvement of the patient (less pain and improvement of function scores) after osteotomy surgery, but in the majority of the studies {{there was no significant difference}} with other operative treatment (other technique of HTO/ unicompartmental joint replacement). Overall, the methodological quality was low. Authors' conclusions: Based on 13 studies, we conclude that there is 'silver' level evidence (www. cochranemsk. org) that valgus HTO improves knee function and reduces pain. There is no evidence whether an osteotomy is more effective than conservative treatment and the results so far do not justify a conclusion about effectiveness of specific surgical techniques.

40|$|Most {{companies}} {{today are}} working in a global environment where competition is hard. In {{order to be able}} to survive it is essential that the companies utilise their resources as much as possible in order to keep the production cost low. Maintenance plays a crucial role because of its impact on availability, reliability, quality and life cycle cost (LCC). However, being able to use maintenance proactively so as to increase the utilisation of the production process resources requires access to proper tools and methods for deciding on what maintenance to use and to follow up maintenance impact. Consequently, the overall research problem discussed in the thesis is: How to select a maintenance policy and follow up its performance with respect to cost-effectiveness in order to improve company profitability. In order to solve this overall research problem it has been broken down into four research questions R 1 : How can different approaches intended for maintaining or improving production process performance assist in the identification, analysis, elimination and prevention of recurrence of problems in a production process?, R 2 : How should maintenance be selected on the basis of cost-effectiveness?, R 3 : How should the technical and financial performance of maintenance be measured in order to enable cost-effective improvements? and R 4 : How to access relevant data required for cost-effective decisions in maintenance?. The philosophical basis applied in the work presented in this thesis is systems theory. When looking at maintenance, it is necessary to have a wide perspective and also see the interaction between maintenance and other relevant working areas. The major contributions that have been achieved and reported in the thesis are: 1. A literature review regarding current approach abilities to identify, analyse and prevent the recurrence of problems, 2. The development of a conceptual model for measuring the maintenance impact through a set of key performance indicators indicating where and how much to invest in maintenance., 3. The development of a maintenance support system for measuring the economic/financial impact of <b>maintenance</b> on both <b>operative</b> and strategic levels, 4.

Results from an exploratory study regarding IT maturity within maintenance management in Swedish industry are presented. The main conclusion of the thesis is that the tools and methods described in this thesis can represent important elements in a system to continuously and cost-effectively improve maintenance performance and thereby better utilise the resources in the production process...|$|R

40|$|Industrial energy {{accounts}} for roughly one-third of total global energy consumption {{and is expected}} to continue with a similar share in the foreseeable future, therefore the efficient use of energy and energy saving are important issues for the industrial sectors. Energy Efficiency EE is a crucial factor for energy cost-benefits and waste reduction also environmental management, and can be improved by different approaches. Especially in this study the energy saving through management system will be illustrated. EE is achieved by use of an energy management system which presents various strategies, tools, methods, technologies, and effective measures to face energy saving and consumption issues, that also includes energy audits, monitoring, control and continuous improvement of the system. In particular in this work energy saving through maintenance (corrective and preventive) and operative procedures were addressed. Maintenance operations are fundamental in granting machineries and processes energy saving, given the capability of optimising them thanks to the predictive models. The major challenge of maintenance optimization is to implement a maintenance strategy, which maximizes availability and efficiency of the equipment, controls the rate of equipment deterioration, ensures the safe and environmentally friendly operation, and minimizes the total cost of the operation which means the both production and energy cost. In this work, an energy efficiency analysis model was developed formed by integration of a deterministic and probabilistic model of the system, based on a balance of cost/benefits, to optimize <b>maintenance</b> interventions and <b>operative</b> procedures as the first aim of maximizing energy efficiency. In particular, as an element of novelty with respect to literature models, the maintenance influence has been explicitly modeled and used as an optimization parameter. The decision making model and data analysing were shown through application to a case study in an industrial production process in Bitumtec Ltd. plant, which produces bituminous materials for road paving. The motor-driven equipment {{accounts for}} approximately 60 % of manufacturing final electricity use worldwide. A major barrier to effective policymaking, and to more global acceptance of the energy efficiency potential in industrial motor systems, is the lack of a transparent methodology for quantifying the magnitude and cost-effectiveness of these energy savings. Therefore the power consumption was analyzed, as an example, for the most critical system (the greater energy consumption system) or the three phases electric motor system (160 kW) "Siefer" which drives the homogenization mill during production. Bottom-up energy efficiency supply curve models is used to estimate the cost-effective electricity efficiency potentials, also CO 2 emission reduction, for the motor system. Using a combination of expert opinions and available data, from our selected industrial case study, there was introduced an analysis approach where is used the concept of a "conservation supply curve CSC" to capture the cost effective as well as the technical potential for energy efficiency. The curve shows the energy conservation potential {{as a function of the}} marginal Cost of Conserved Energy. This approach is explained in details; further the results were illustrated and discussed. The first step of this study was a literature review to develop a base line of information, through of research in the field of energy management systems, industrial energy efficiency technologies. That included general review of energy saving models, also optimization of energy consumption in industrial production process. Because of the importance of the maintenance activities and reliability of the systems, also was reviewed maintenance optimization models and their impacts on energy cost-effectiveness, productivity benefits and environments. A part of these studies are introduced in this work and illustrated as the theoretical parts. Analysis has been emphasized, the importance of optimizing maintenance activities and operating procedures to increase the performance of the system. Energy efficiency was evaluated for three different base case scenarios; Low, Medium and High with their related potential energy recovery, performance and environmental benefits. Maximizing efficiency of the system that is our goal is achieved through the use of this model, which also based on analysis of historical data, expert inputs and analysis of the economic impacts that was discussed and demonstrated by the results. In this work the proposed framework with flowing steps are introduced: • Identification of the Most Important System MIS Specially, in this study a motor-driven system in a production process of bituminous materials in Bitumtec Ltd. plant, is addressed. • Identification of the most critical component MCC Particularly, in this study is addressed the electrical motor (160 kWh) that drives homogenization mill "Siefer" during production process of bituminous materials. • Life time and energy consumption data collection and observation, also data related to maintenance activities (corrective and preventive) and failures data collection. • Estimated costs of maintenance and the economic evaluation of maintenance policies (based on balanced cost and risk of inefficiency). • Maintenance optimization (in terms of probability and consequences). • Estimated operating costs of the system. • Analysis of energy efficiency through maintenance optimization and operating procedures, by using of bottom-up energy efficiency supply curve analysis model, where it was introduced; Expert inputs (based on the information of the expert of the system), and data assumption. • Definition of three base case scenarios In this case, were defined three efficiency base case scenarios; low, Medium and High, base case levels with related potential for recovery of electricity. Further, was proposed the related efficiency measures o adequate solutions (cost-effective) to increase the efficiency, based on the maintenance activities, operating procedures and the conditions of the system. • Determination of the impact of these measures on the performanc...|$|R
