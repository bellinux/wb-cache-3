25|$|Digital <b>multimeters</b> {{generally}} {{take measurements}} with accuracy superior to their analog counterparts. Standard analog <b>multimeters</b> measure with typically ±3% accuracy, though instruments of higher accuracy are made. Standard portable digital <b>multimeters</b> are specified {{to have an}} accuracy of typically ±0.5% on the DC voltage ranges. Mainstream bench-top <b>multimeters</b> are available with specified accuracy of better than ±0.01%. Laboratory grade instruments can have accuracies of a few parts per million.|$|E
25|$|A {{multimeter}} or a multitester, {{also known}} as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Analog <b>multimeters</b> use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings. Digital <b>multimeters</b> (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. Digital <b>multimeters</b> are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog <b>multimeters</b> are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multimeters</b> are {{available}} {{in a wide range}} of features and prices. Cheap <b>multimeters</b> can cost less than US$10, while laboratory-grade models with certified calibration can cost more than US$5,000.|$|E
25|$|Absolute {{accuracy}} is {{the error of}} the measurement compared to a perfect measurement. Relative {{accuracy is}} the error of the measurement compared to the device used to calibrate the <b>multimeter.</b> Most <b>multimeter</b> datasheets provide relative accuracy. To compute the absolute accuracy from the relative accuracy of a <b>multimeter</b> add the absolute accuracy of the device used to calibrate the <b>multimeter</b> to the relative accuracy of the <b>multimeter.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Specifying [...] "display counts" [...] {{is another}} way to specify the resolution. Display counts give the largest number, or the largest number plus one (so the count number looks more impressive) the <b>multimeter's</b> display can show, {{ignoring}} the decimal separator. For example, a 5½ digit <b>multimeter</b> can also be specified as a 199999 display count or 200000 display count <b>multimeter.</b> Often the display count is just called the 'count' in <b>multimeter</b> specifications.|$|R
25|$|Additional scales such as decibels, and {{measurement}} {{functions such as}} capacitance, transistor gain, frequency, duty cycle, display hold, and buzzers which sound when the measured resistance is small have been included on many <b>multimeters.</b> While <b>multimeters</b> may be supplemented by more specialized equipment in a technician's toolkit, some <b>multimeters</b> include additional functions for specialized applications (temperature with a thermocouple probe, inductance, connectivity to a computer, speaking measured value, etc.).|$|E
25|$|A {{multimeter}} may {{be implemented}} with a galvanometer meter movement, or less {{often with a}} bargraph or simulated pointer such as an LCD or vacuum fluorescent display. Analog <b>multimeters</b> are common; a quality analog instrument will cost {{about the same as}} a DMM. Analog <b>multimeters</b> have the precision and reading accuracy limitations described above, and so are not built to provide the same accuracy as digital instruments.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{technologies}} {{usually involves}} combination of several devices to achieve specific goals. Hence {{the interface between}} the combined devices is significant. The objective of this project is to demonstrate a working communication interface between a PDA and a <b>multimeter.</b> Therefore with slight modifications this concept may be applied to any common electronic circuit such as <b>multimeter</b> for them to interface with an intelligent device such as PDA. A digital <b>multimeter</b> was built to demonstrate this concept and serial communication was used between the <b>multimeter</b> and a Palm Pilot. This report outlines the hardware and software implementation of this digital <b>multimeter.</b> The hardware implementation involves {{the construction of a}} common digital <b>multimeter,</b> and the software implementation consists of building a successful interface between the two devices and writing a friendly user interface.

When proposing the <b>multimeter</b> there was a tendency to use a minimal number of component parts to conserve a good protection against a bad usage in application. The most widespread busbar USB is used for connection of the <b>multimeter</b> and a computer. Standard HID is used for communication, for {{that it is not}} neccessary to install any system drivers...|$|R
25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit {{by the current}} drawn by the meter movement, some analog <b>multimeters</b> use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified <b>multimeters</b> are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the absence}} of amplification, {{ordinary}} analog multimeter are typically less susceptible to radio frequency interference, and so continue to have a prominent place in some fields even in a world of more accurate and flexible electronic <b>multimeters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>multimeters</b> {{are often}} digital {{due to their}} accuracy, {{durability}} and extra features. In a digital multimeter the signal under test is converted to a voltage and an amplifier with electronically controlled gain preconditions the signal. A digital multimeter displays the quantity measured as a number, which eliminates parallax errors.|$|E

25|$|The {{resolution}} of a multimeter {{is the smallest}} part of the scale which can be shown, which is scale dependent. On some digital <b>multimeters</b> it can be configured, with higher resolution measurements taking longer to complete. For example, a multimeter that has a 1mV resolution on a 10V scale can show changes in measurements in 1mV increments.|$|E
25|$|Every inline series-connected ammeter, {{including}} a multimeter in a current range, {{has a certain}} resistance. Most <b>multimeters</b> inherently measure voltage, and pass a current to be measured through a shunt resistance, measuring the voltage developed across it. The voltage drop {{is known as the}} burden voltage, specified in volts per ampere. The value can change depending on the range the meter selects, since different ranges usually use different shunt resistors.|$|E
25|$|Test {{equipment}} {{tends to}} drift {{out of calibration}} over time, and the specified accuracy cannot be relied upon indefinitely. For more expensive equipment, manufacturers and third parties provide calibration services so that older equipment may be recalibrated and recertified. The cost of such services is disproportionate for inexpensive equipment; however extreme accuracy is not required for most routine testing. <b>Multimeters</b> used for critical measurements {{may be part of}} a metrology program to assure calibration.|$|E

25|$|Analog meters {{are also}} useful where {{the trend of}} a {{measurement}} {{is more important than}} an exact value obtained at a particular moment. A change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in a digital readout. For this reason, digital <b>multimeters</b> often approximate this with a bargraph (typically with a more rapid reading response than the primary readout); the most effective of these are arranged in an arc, to simulate the pointer of an analog meter.|$|E
25|$|Nixies {{were used}} as numeric {{displays}} in early digital voltmeters, <b>multimeters,</b> frequency counters and many other types of technical equipment. They also appeared in costly digital time displays used in research and military establishments, and in many early electronic desktop calculators, including the first: the Sumlock-Comptometer ANITA Mk VII of 1961 and even the first electronic telephone switchboards. Later alphanumeric versions in fourteen segment display format found use in airport arrival/departure signs and stock ticker displays. Some elevators used Nixies to display floor numbers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multimeters</b> {{were invented}} {{in the early}} 1920s as radio {{receivers}} and other vacuum tube electronic devices became more common. The invention of the first multimeter is attributed to British Post Office engineer, Donald Macadie, who became dissatisfied {{with the need to}} carry many separate instruments required for maintenance of telecommunications circuits. Macadie invented an instrument which could measure amperes (amps), volts and ohms, so the multifunctional meter was then named Avometer. The meter comprised a moving coil meter, voltage and precision resistors, and switches and sockets to select the range.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>multimeters</b> {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will {{sometimes}} prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E
25|$|The meter {{movement}} in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil galvanometer of the d'Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands {{to support the}} moving coil. In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1milliampere from a circuit at full scale deflection. More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) <b>multimeters</b> typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.|$|E
25|$|Most analog <b>multimeters</b> of the moving-pointer type are unbuffered, {{and draw}} current from the circuit under test to deflect the meter pointer. The {{impedance}} of the meter {{varies depending on}} the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000ohms/volt sensitivity will have an input resistance of two million ohms on the 100-volt range (100 V * 20,000 ohms/volt = 2,000,000 ohms). On every range, at full scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit under test. Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, power circuits; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements {{so as not to}} load the circuit under test with the meter impedance.|$|E
