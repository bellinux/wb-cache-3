40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} of {{teaching}} <b>method</b> <b>has</b> been {{proposed for the}} palletizing robot.

5|$|Methods in {{programming}} language are {{the members of}} a class in a project, some <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> signatures and some don't have signatures. Methods can be void or can return something like string, integer, double, decimal, float and bool. If a method is void it means that the method does not return any data type.|$|E
5|$|Methods on {{objects are}} {{functions}} {{attached to the}} object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> an explicit self parameter to access instance data, {{in contrast to the}} implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).|$|E
5|$|Modern {{microwave}} synthetic <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> {{also been}} reported. Rhodocenium hexafluorophosphate forms after reaction of cyclopentadiene and rhodium(III) chloride hydrate in methanol following work-up with methanolic ammonium hexafluorophosphate; the reaction yield exceeds 60% with only 30 seconds {{of exposure to}} microwave radiation.|$|E

5|$|While early explorers {{reported}} various traditions {{associated with}} Guanche mummification, {{there are three}} methods identified in modern times through scientific analysis: evisceration, preservation, and stuffing.

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so other <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Front {{tracking}} <b>methods</b> <b>have</b> {{long been}} used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs.
