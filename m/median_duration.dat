Patients and methods: A total of 96 patients with mCRC treated by chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in the PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and August 2012 were analyzed retrospectively by overall response rate, disease-control rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The tumor responses were {{assessed by the}} Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines. Results: A total of 96 patients with mCRC were identified. Median age was 53. 6 years. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 – 2. By the end of follow-up (August 20, 2012), 54 patients exhibited progression (56. 3 %), and 39 (40. 6 %) patients had died. A total of 27 (28. 1 %) achieved partial response, and 48 patients (50. 0 %) had stable disease, exhibiting an overall response rate of 28. 1 % and a disease-control rate of 78. 1 %. The response rates of the first-line, second-line, and third-line (or later) therapy were 41. 7 %, 21. 9 %, and 15. 8 %, respectively. The <b>median</b> <b>durations</b> of the PFS and OS were 8. 13 months and 14. 80 months, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background and aims. Limited {{data from}} large cohorts are {{available}} on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) switch over time. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of switching from one TNF antagonist to another and to identify associated risk factors. Methods. Data from the Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Cohort Study (SIBDCS) were analyzed. Results. Of 1731 patients included into the SIBDCS (956 with Crohn's disease [CD] and 775 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), 347 CD patients (36. 3 %) and 129 UC patients (16. 6 %) were treated {{with at least one}} TNF antagonist. A total of 53 / 347 (15. 3 %) CD patients (<b>median</b> disease <b>duration</b> 9 years) and 20 / 129 (15. 5 %) of UC patients (<b>median</b> disease <b>duration</b> 7 years) needed to switch to a second and/or a third TNF antagonist, respectively. <b>Median</b> treatment <b>duration</b> was longest for the first TNF antagonist used (CD 25 months; UC 14 months), followed by the second (CD 13 months; UC 4 months) and third TNF antagonist (CD 11 months; UC 15 months). Primary nonresponse, loss of response and side effects were the major reasons to stop and/or switch TNF antagonist therapy. A low body mass index, a short diagnostic delay and extraintestinal manifestations at inclusion were identified as risk factors for a switch of the first used TNF antagonist within 24 months of its use in CD patients. Conclusion. Switching of the TNF antagonist over time is a common issue. The <b>median</b> treatment <b>duration</b> with a specific TNF antagonist is diminishing with an increasing number of TNF antagonists being used...|$|R

These findings indicate that the cloud charge structure for (at least some) oceanic storms are different than those for storms over land. The percentage of flashes that had at least one NLDN-reported negative cloud pulse prior to the first negative cloud-to-ground stroke was found to be about the same over land and ocean.
