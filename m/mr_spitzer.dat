5000|$|The Senate Committee on Investigations is {{considering}} investigating a controversial multimillion-dollar loan that New York State Governor Eliot Spitzer's father Bernard Spitzer gave {{him when he}} ran for attorney general in 1998, a loan <b>Mr.</b> <b>Spitzer</b> has acknowledged not being truthful about. Committee Chairman George Winner told The New York Post that subpoenas should be used to find out about the loans. Winner wrote to Griffo, who is the Chairman of the Senate Elections Committee, that an article profiling Spitzer in New York Magazine [...] "outlined what may have been a willful effort by Eliot Spitzer and his father to circumvent campaign-contribution limits in New York state law and then conceal their actions." [...] In 1998, Spitzer claimed that he secured the $5 million loan by mortgaging apartments his developer had given him, but later revealed that his father was actually paying off the loans and, therefore, financing his campaign.|$|E

Spitzer also used the state {{aircraft}} {{during the first six}} months of his term as governor for political purposes, including a stop in Rochester to attend an event for the Monroe County Democratic Committee on a day in which he had a number of stops related to public business. The report criticized Spitzer's office for using State Police resources to gather information about Bruno's travel and releasing the information to the media. New York Republican State Committee Chairman Joseph Mondello claimed that [...] "Today's explosive report by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo validates the frightening charges that Governor Spitzer's administration abused the New York State Police and New York's FOIL laws in an attempt to set up Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno" [...] and that [...] "This disturbing abuse of power by a Governor is unprecedented." [...] The findings of the report were endorsed by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Spitzer's</b> own Inspector General, Kristine Hamann.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{attention}} of Wells and money invested by Bollack, the language gained no adherents, and Bollack went on to support Ido, according to Otto Jespersen, writing in 1912 in The History of our Language about a conference {{that had taken place}} in 1907:The inventors of language systems had been invited to attend either in person or by representative to defend their systems. This offer was availed of by Dr. Nicolas (Spokil), <b>Mr.</b> <b>Spitzer</b> (Parla) and Mr. Bollack (La langue bleue); moreover Dr. Zamenhof got himself represented by Mr. de Beaufront, who had been propagating Esperanto for many years; and almost as representative of Neutral came Mr. Monseur, professor of comparative philology in Brussels: yet his plea had the character less of a positive defence of Neutral than of a zealous and expert insistence on the weaknesses of Esperanto. Of the discussions with those outside the committee two episodes deserve special mention: Dr. Nicolas emphasised as an advantage of his system founded on [...] "a priori" [...] principles, that it was constructed in accordance with a firm grasp of the laws of mnemonics and therefore was especially easy to remember. Yet he was almost offended when I wished to begin examining him about his own dictionary, and so it appeared that he could not remember the words which he himself had made. Mr. Bollack in a very elegant discourse presented his Langue bleue for the diffusion of which he had devoted a great deal of money; he ended by declaring that although he wished naturally that his language should be adopted, he would nevertheless accept the verdict of the committee of experts if it went otherwise; this promise he has kept loyally by being now an eminent member of the Ido organization in Paris.|$|E
40|$|The University of Toledo August 29, 1979 2801 W. Bancroft Street FROM: Marty Clark Toledo, Ohio 43606 FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT Office of Public Information (419) 537 · 2675 Dedication of the Wa. ~<!_!: 1 ~_CaE-~~~y, Center for Re~_~~rc::~_. ~~d Use of Rare Books and Special Collections of The University of Toledo's Carlson Library {{has been}} {{scheduled}} for 4 p. m. on Wednesday, Sept. 26, according to Leslie W. Sheridan, di­rector of libraries at the University. An open {{house will be}} held in the Center from 2 to 4 p. m. on Sept. 26 and The Friends of The University of Toledo Libraries will mark the occasion at its annual dinner meeting that evening. Journalist Bill Moyers will address the dinner, to be held at the Inverness Club, Mr. Sheridan said. Construction and equipping of the 13, 000 -square-foot Canaday Center was made possible by a gift of $ 226, 000 from <b>Mrs.</b> Doreen Canaday <b>Spitzer</b> in memory of her father, the Toledo industrialist for whom it is named. Located in a fully enclosed section of the fifth level of the Carlson Library, the Canaday Center includes a public display area for rare books and manuscripts furnished with 14 movable walnut display cases and special lighting. Also parts of the Center are a preservation area for storage of collections under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity, a large study area for scholars and researchers using the collection, a work area for Center staff, an office for the director, and a smaller office and work area for visiting scholars. The custom-fabricated display cases and special lighting in the public display area provide an unusually flexible environment for exhibiting materials from the Center's collections, Mr. Sheridan noted. The walnut cases feature self-contained, filtered lighting and movable glass shelves. They were designed to complement walnut tables, chairs, shelving and catalogue cases originally acquired when the University opened the first library on its main campus more than 40 years ago. These furnishings have been preserved and refinished for use in the Center. (over) The display cases are free-standing and may be placed in a variety of arrangements within the public display area depending on the needs of "each exhi­bition. A flexible system of lights, suspended from ceiling tracks, will permit materials to be shown in an interesting and dramatic way, he explained. Three university librarians experienced in the area of special collections have been invited to attend the dedication and will meet with Mr. Sheridan and other Uni­versity officials on Thursday, Sept. 27, to help develop a program for continued ac­quisitions by the Canaday Center and an outline of qualifications for a director for the Center. They are Dr. James Tanis, director of the Mariam Coffin Canaday Library at Bryn Mawr College (Bryn Mawr, Pa.), Dr. John C. Dann, director of the University of Michigan's Clements Libary, and Dean Keller, curator of special collections at the Kent State University Library (Kent, 0.). <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Spitzer's</b> mother, the late Mariam Canaday, was a benefactor of the Bryn Mawr Library. Mrs. Canaday and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Spitzer</b> both were graduates of Bryn Mawr College. Mr. Sheridan said that the Canaday Center's collections already have developed areas of specialization in the materials of certain American writers. These include poets Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, novelists William Faulkner and Edith Wharton, women novelists from the American South including Katherine Anne Porter, Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor and Ellen Glasgow, and Black writers, particularly those who es­tablished reputations during the past 20 years. "In terms of the Center's collections, we are in an organizational phase and the advice and assistance of Drs. Tanis and Dann and Mr. Keller will be very welcome. We will be identifying areas in which the collections can be expanded to achieve maximum usefulness for scholars at reasonable cost, areas which do not duplicate collections already assembled by libraries in the Midwest," he explained. Dr. William McDonald, Jr. and Noel Stock, professors of English at UT, have served as consultants on acquisitions made by the Center to date. Mr. Sheridan said that he anticipates that an emphasis will be placed on acquiring (more) / special materials in the humanities in adding to the Center's collections, and that funds. are being sought from various sources outside the University to assist in that effort. Reservations for the annual dinner meeting of The Friends of The University of Toledo Libraries, to be addressed by Mr. Moyers, are welcome and may be obtained by calling Mr. Sheridan's office in the Carlson Library, 537 - 2326. The dinner will be open to the public as well as members of the Friends. - 30 ­...|$|R
