40|$|Current {{procedures}} {{used for the}} global prediction of 300 nm <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> starting from known values of 1 deg by 1 deg <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> yield unreasonable prediction results when applied to 300 nm blocks which have a rapidly varying gravity anomaly field and which contain relatively few observed 60 nm blocks. Improvement of overall 300 nm anomaly prediction is first achieved by using area-weighted as opposed to unweighted averaging of the 25 generated 60 nm <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> inside the 300 nm block. Then, improvement of prediction over rough 300 nm blocks is realized {{through the use of}} fully known 1 deg by 1 deg mean elevations, taking advantage of the correlation that locally exists between 60 nm <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> and 60 nm mean elevations inside the 300 nm block. An improved prediction model which adapts itself to the roughness of the local anomaly field is found to be the model of Least Squares Collocation with systematic parameters, the systematic parameter being the slope b which is a type of Bouguer slope expressing the correlation that locally exists between 60 nm <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> and 60 nm mean elevations...|$|R

40|$|Detailed gravity {{anomalies}} are {{computed from}} a combination of Geos 3 satellite altimeter and terrestrial gravity data using least-squares principles. The mathematical model used is based on the Stokes' equation modified for a nonglobal solution. Using Geos 3 data in the calibration area, the effects of several anomaly parameter configurations and data densities/distributions on the anomalies and their accuracy estimates are studied. The accuracy estimates for 1 deg x 1 deg <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> from low density altimetry data are of the order of 4 mgal. Comparison of these anomalies with the terrestrial data and also with Rapp's data derived using collocation techniques show rms differences of 7. 2 and 4. 9 mgal, respectively. Indications are that the anomaly accuracies can be improved to about 2 mgal with high density data. Estimation of 30 in. x 30 in. <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> indicates accuracies of the order of 5 mgal.

40|$|Intraseasonal and interannual {{variability}} of Asian summer monsoon rainfall in pentad precipitation data is examined using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The spatial patterns of discrete rainfall states derived with the HMM {{and the associated}} transition probabilities between the states are shown to represent well the principal Asian summer monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (ISO), propagating eastward and northward with a period of 40 – 50 days. Stochastic simulations made with the HMM reasonably reproduce the canonical ISO propagation and its observed statistics such as the frequency of ISO events. The interannual modulation of the ISO associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is assessed by employing a nonhomogeneous HMM (NHMM) with summermean NINO 3. 4 index prescribed as an input variable. ENSO influence on the ISO is found to manifest as preferences toward particular ISO phases depending on the ENSO condition, thus adding an asymmetry to the ISO. In the presence of seasonal <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies,</b> it is shown that the El Niño seasonal <b>mean</b> rainfall <b>anomaly</b> pattern is identified by the HMM as a distinct state, {{in addition to the}} ISO states, whereas the La Niña seasonal <b>mean</b> rainfall <b>anomaly</b> pattern does not appear distinct from the ISO states. ...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} of the Earth's gravity field was obtained from new and improved satellite measurements such as satellite to satellite tracking and gradiometry. This improvement was examined by estimating {{the accuracy of the}} determination of <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> and <b>mean</b> undulations in various size blocks based on an assumed mission. In this report the accuracy is considered through a commission error due to measurement noise propagation and a truncation error due to unobservable higher degree terms in the geopotential. To do this the spectrum of the measurement was related to the spectrum of the disturbing potential of the Earth's gravity field. Equations were derived for a low-low (radial or horizontal separation) mission and a gradiometer mission. For a low-low mission of six month's duration, at an altitude of 160 km, with a data noise of plus or minus 1 micrometers sec for a four second integration time, we would expect to determine 1 deg x 1 deg <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> to an accuracy of plus or minus 2. 3 mgals and 1 deg x 1 deg mean geoid undulations to plus or minus 4. 3 cm.

2500|$|The main {{difficulty}} {{with this approach}} is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical orbits. [...] For near-parabolic orbits, eccentricity [...] is nearly 1, and plugging [...] into the formula for <b>mean</b> <b>anomaly,</b> , we find ourselves subtracting two nearly-equal values, and accuracy suffers. [...] For near-circular orbits, it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place (and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all). [...] Furthermore, the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit, and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1992 Long term {{changes in}} the {{atmospheric}} and oceanic environment of the North Pacific were investigated for the period 1946 - 1991. A climatology of North Pacific wind stress curl was developed because of the relevance of changes in wind stress curl to both oceanic and atmospheric variability. The dominant scales of spatial and temporal wind stress curl variability were determined and examined {{within the context of}} observed changes in North Pacific air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), sea ice cover, oceanic mass transport and the occurrence of blocking anticyclones. Relationships between these variables and indices of tropical Pacific variability were also determined on interannual time scales. During 1976 - 1988, phase relationships were very strong between long term <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> of wind stress curl, SST, air temperature, sea ice cover, The Pacific North American index, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and tropical Pacific SST. Long term <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> of these parameters did not change sign during 1976 - 88. These strong phase relationships did not occur amongst these variables during any other period of the record. The 1976 - 1988 period is characterized by intensified storminess, the decreased occurrence of blocking anticyclones, and decreased sea ice cover in the subarctic North Pacific. Intensified atmospheric circulation also occurred in the western Pacific subtropical anticyclone. Anomalously low SST occurred across the central and western North Pacific during this period while anomalously high SST was present in the eastern North Pacific adjacent to North America. Changes in the sign of the long term <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> of wind stress curl, central North Pacific SST and the SOI suggest that this climate regime ended or relaxed after 1988. After 1975, long term changes in anomalies of the Southern Oscillation Index, tropical Atlantic wind stress, Sahel rainfall, and Greenland Sea ice cover have characteristics similar to those observed in the North Pacific. It is suggested that the climate anomalies observed in the North Pacific during 1976 - 1988 occurred as part of a hemispheric or global scale climate regime...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of marine ecosystems {{is determined by}} spatial and temporal patterns of global biogeochemical cycles. Shifts in marine ecosystem composition driven by changes in climate can in turn affect biogeochemical cycles, especially through their impact on air-sea fluxes of CO 2 and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere. However, the response of marine ecosystems to climate is difficult to assess at global scale due to the scarcity of large-scale in-situ biological monitoring programmes. Here, we combine and analyse remote-sensing observations, in-situ observations, and a global ocean biogeochemistry model to gain insight into interactions between marine ecosystem composition and climate variability over the last decade, in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. Our results show large-scale shifts in the dominance of diatoms, with <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> 63. 3 % higher during extreme positive phases of North Atlantic Oscillation index compared to its extreme negative phases and with <b>mean</b> <b>anomalies</b> 134 % higher during extreme positive phases of Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Ocean over the period 1998 - 2008.
