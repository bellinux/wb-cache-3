Therefore, if the flux distribution is specified, {{it is difficult to}} obtain the distributions of magnetomotive forces or configuration of magnets producing the specified field distribution by the conventional finite element method. New methods which are called the "finite element method taking account of external power source" and the "finite element method with shape modification" have been developed.

50|$|Operation of a {{transformer}} at its designed voltage {{but at a}} higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current.</b> At a lower frequency, the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers {{may need to be}} equipped with 'volts per hertz' over-excitation, ANSI function 24, relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.|$|E
50|$|The knee-point voltage of {{a current}} {{transformer}} is {{the magnitude of}} the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the knee point is reached. The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> by 50%. For voltages greater than the knee point, the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher, but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of knee point voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} when {{there is little or}} no primary {{resistance}} and little or no switch resistance, the increase of the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> Im is a [...] "linear ramp" [...] defined by the formula in the first paragraph. In {{the case when}} there is significant primary resistance or switch resistance or both (total resistance R, e.g. primary-coil resistance plus a resistor in the emitter, FET channel resistance), the Lp/R time constant causes the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> to be a rising curve with continually decreasing slope. In either case the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> Im will come to dominate the total primary (and switch) current Ip. Without a limiter it would increase forever. However, in the first case (low resistance), the switch will eventually be unable to [...] "support" [...] more current meaning that its effective resistance increases so much that the voltage drop across the switch equals the supply voltage; in this condition the switch is said to be [...] "saturated" [...] (e.g. this is determined by a transistor's gain hfe or [...] "beta"). In the second case (e.g. primary and/or emitter resistance dominant) the (decreasing) slope of the current decreases to a point such that the induced voltage into the secondary is no longer adequate to keep the switch closed. In a third case, the magnetic [...] "core" [...] material saturates, meaning it cannot support further increases in its magnetic field; in this condition induction from primary to secondary fails. In all cases, the rate of rise of the primary <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> (and hence the flux), or the rate-of-rise of the flux directly in the case of saturated core material, drops to zero (or close to zero). In the first two cases, although primary current continues to flow, it approaches a steady value equal to the supply voltage Vb divided by the total resistance(s) R in the primary circuit. In this current-limited condition the transformer's flux will be steady. Only changing flux causes induction of voltage into the secondary, so a steady flux represents a failure of induction. The secondary voltage drops to zero. The switch opens.|$|E

50|$|Core {{losses are}} caused mostly by {{hysteresis}} and eddy current {{effects in the}} core and are proportional to {{the square of the}} core flux for operation at a given frequency. The finite permeability core requires a <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> IM to maintain mutual flux in the core. <b>Magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> is in phase with the flux, {{the relationship between the two}} being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits. With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current I0 equals transformer no-load current.The resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations. Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the switch}} (transistor, tube) closes it places the source voltage Vb across the {{transformer}} primary.

This <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> Im will [...] "ride upon" [...] any reflected secondary current Is that flows into a secondary load (e.g. into the control terminal of the switch; reflected secondary current in primary = Is/N). The changing primary current causes a changing magnetic field ("flux") through the transformer's windings; this changing field induces a (relatively) steady secondary voltage Vs = N×Vb. In some designs (as {{shown in the}} diagrams) the secondary voltage Vs adds to the source voltage Vb; {{in this case because}} the voltage across the primary (during the time the switch is closed) is approximately Vb, Vs = (N+1)×Vb. Alternately the switch may get some of its control voltage or current directly from Vb and the rest from the induced Vs. Thus the switch-control voltage or current is [...] "in phase" [...] meaning that it keeps the switch closed, and it (via the switch) maintains the source voltage across the primary.|$|E

50|$|Transformers for use at {{power or}} audio {{frequencies}} typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel. The steel has a permeability {{many times that}} of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.

Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.

50|$|Flux braking {{is another}} method, based on motor losses, for {{handling}} an overrunning load. When braking {{in the drive}} system is needed, the motor flux and thus also the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> component used in the motor are increased. The control of flux can be easily achieved through the direct torque control principle. With DTC the inverter is directly controlled to achieve the desired torque and flux for the motor. During flux braking the motor is under DTC control which guarantees that braking can be made according to the specified speed ramp. This is very different to the DC injection braking typically used in drives. In the DC injection method DC current is injected to the motor so that control of the motor flux is lost during braking. The flux braking method based on DTC enables the motor to shift quickly from braking to motoring power when requested.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{that the}} switch has opened at Topen, the <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> {{in the primary}} is Ipeak,m = Vp×Tclosed/Lp, and the energy Up is stored in this [...] "magnetizing" [...] field as created by Ipeak,m (energy Um = 1/2×Lp×Ipeak,m2). But {{now there is no}} primary voltage (Vb) to sustain further {{increases}} in the magnetic field, or even a steady-state field, the switch being opened and thereby removing the primary voltage. The magnetic field (flux) begins to collapse, and the collapse forces energy back into the circuit by inducing current and voltage into the primary turns, the secondary turns, or both. Induction into the primary will be via the primary turns through which all the flux passes (represented by primary inductance Lp); the collapsing flux creates primary voltage that forces current to continue to flow either out of the primary toward the (now-open) switch or into a primary load such as an LED or a Zener diode, etc. Induction into the secondary will be via the secondary turns through which the mutual (linked) flux passes; this induction causes voltage to appear at the secondary, and if this voltage is not blocked (e.g. by a diode or by the very high impedance of a FET gate), secondary current will flow into the secondary circuit (but in the opposite direction). In any case, if there are no components to absorb the current, the voltage at the switch rises very fast. Without a primary load {{or in the case of}} very limited secondary current the voltage will be limited only by the distributed capacitances of the windings (the so-called interwinding capacitance), and it can destroy the switch. When only interwinding capacitance and a tiny secondary load is present to absorb the energy, very high-frequency oscillations occur, and these [...] "parasitic oscillations" [...] represent a possible source of electromagnetic interference.|$|E
5000|$|The use of 'West' to {{mean the}} 'out' {{direction}} (actually 'out' → 'West' → 'sunset' → 'down', i.e. 'out of view') may appear unnecessarily contrived. Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term [...] "exode" [...] (the doorway where the current exits). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the West electrode' (other candidates had been [...] "westode", [...] "occiode" [...] and [...] "dysiode") was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for current, whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which {{at that time was}} believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and {{in the same direction as}} a hypothetical <b>magnetizing</b> <b>current</b> loop around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic dipole field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the West electrode would not have been the 'way out' any more. Therefore, [...] "exode" [...] would have become inappropriate, whereas [...] "cathode" [...] meaning 'West electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the cathode's function any more, but more importantly because, as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the [...] "cathode" [...] term is based is subject to reversals whereas the current direction convention on which the [...] "exode" [...] term was based has no reason to change in the future.|$|E
