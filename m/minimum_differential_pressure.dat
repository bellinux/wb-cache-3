40|$|The {{collapse}} pressure of an inflatable membrane is the <b>minimum</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> which will sustain a specific desired shape under an applied load. In this paper, {{we present a}} method for estimating the {{collapse pressure}} of a tension-cone inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (IAD) that is subject to a static aerodynamic load. The IAD surface is modeled as an elastic membrane. For a given aerodynamic load and sufficiently high torus differential pressure, the IAD assumes a stable axisymmetric equilibrium shape. When the torus pressure is reduced sufficiently, the symmetric equilibrium state becomes unstable and we define this instance to be the critical pressure Pcr. In this paper, we will compare our predicted critical torus pressure with the corresponding observed torus collapse pressure (OTCP) for fifteen tests that were conducted by the third author and his collaborators at the NASA Glenn Research Center 10 x 10 Supersonic Wind Tunnel in April 2008. One of the difficulties with these types of comparisons is establishing the instance of torus collapse and determining the OTCP from quantities measured during the experiment. In many cases, torus collapse is gradual and the OTCP is not well-defined. However, in eight of the fifteen wind tunnel tests where the OTCP is well-defined, {{we find that the}} average of the relative differences (Pcr - OTCP/Pcr) was 8. 9 %. For completeness, we will also discuss the seven tests where the observed torus collapse pressure is not well-defined...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to rapid decompression, porous magma may fragment explosively. This {{occurs when the}} melt can no longer withstand forces exerted upon it due to the overpressure in included bubbles. This occurs at a critical pressure difference between the bubbles and the surrounding magma. In this study we have investigated this pressure threshold necessary for the fragmentation of magma. Here we present the first comprehensive, high temperature experimental quantification of the fragmentation threshold of volcanic rocks varying widely in porosity, permeability, crystallinity, and chemical composition. We exposed samples to increasing <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> in a high temperature shock tube apparatus until fragmentation was initiated. Experimentally, we define the fragmentation threshold as the <b>minimum</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> that leads to complete fragmentation of the pressurized porous rock sample. Our {{results show that the}} fragmentation threshold is strongly dependent on porosity; high porosity samples fragment at lower <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> than low porosity samples. The fragmentation threshold is inversely proportional to the porosity. Of the other factors, permeability likely affects the fragmentation threshold at high porosity values, whereas chemical composition, crystallinity and bubble size distribution appear to have minor effects. The relationship for fragmentation threshold presented here can be used to predict the <b>minimum</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> necessary for the initiation or cessation of the explosive fragmentation of porous magma...|$|R

40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors are two {{among the}} most widely employed sensors for vortex flowmeter application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor. The output signals of the piezoelectric sensor and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor under no flow condition are compared to obtain the background noise due to piping vibrations and electrical interferences. These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|After three {{cycles of}} WAG, {{when there was}} no more oil production, an ASP slug was {{injected}} into the core and then displaced by alternate injection of water and CO 2. There was an increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> during the ASP slug injection which shows a flow resistance related to the formation and propagation of the oil bank in the core due to ASP injection. The increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the mobilization of residual oil which persisted until oil bank breakthrough. The mobilized oil creates an oil bank in front of the ASP slug. As the oil bank size increases, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> increases until oil bank breakthrough occurs. The second peak in the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is related to the second oil bank generated that is associated with surfactant desorption and wettability changes. After the second oil bank breakthrough and microemulsion production, the conditions in the core and the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> profile are similar to that in the previous WAG process but slightly higher. This is possibly due to chemical slug effects such as adsorption and wettability changes.|$|R

Two mixtures (air-water and air-oil) were used in the two-phase analysis while a mixture of air, water and oil was employed in the three-phase case. Due to the high gas void fraction (&# 945;> 0. 9), the mixture was considered wet gas. A slotted plate was utilized in the low <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> analysis and the discharge coefficient behavior was analyzed. Assuming homogeneous flow, an equation with two unknowns was obtained for the multi-phase flow analysis. An empirical relation and the differential {{response of}} the meters were used to estimate the variables involved in the equation. Good performance in the gas mass flow rate estimation was exhibited by the slotted and standard plates for the air-water flow, while poor results were obtained for the air-oil and air-water oil flows. The performance of all the flow meter tested in the analysis improved for <b>differential</b> <b>pressures</b> greater than 24. 9 kPa (100 in_H 2 O).

40|$|Abstract − The {{measurement}} of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is widely employed in the petrol industry for determining the flow rate, level, blockage of filters and the oil-water interface. The calibration of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> transmitters is usually made at atmospheric pressure, since there is little concern about the static pressure influence on the transducer performance. As a main contribution, this paper presents a calibration methodology of <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> transmitters. The ranges of the studied static pressure (from 0 to 20000 kPa) and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> (from 40 to 250 kPa) cover Petrobras production and exploration operating conditions. To achieve the results, a pressure amplification device was developed and used at each port of the pressure transmitter. Thus, during the calibration of a pressure transmitter, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> at the transmitter ports is deduced from the measured value at nearly atmospheric pressure and the amplification factor.
