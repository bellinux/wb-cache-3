His study of the first trigonal prismatic complexes is one such example. Harry Gray's most significant work lies at the interface between chemistry and biology. As a pioneer of the important and thriving field of bioinorganic chemistry, he has made many key contributions, the most important of which is the development of fundamental understanding of electron transfer in biological systems, at the atomic level.|$|E

But {{as luck would have}} it, in England he could not find a berth on ships as they were all reserved for American troops who were then being demobilised due to the First World War. The Trustee permitted him to join the University College London under chemistry professor Frederick G. Donnan. He earned his DSc in 1921. While in London, he was additionally supported by the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research with fellowship of £250 a year. In August 1921 he returned to India and immediately joined the newly established Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor of chemistry, where he remained for three years. He wrote the ‘Kulgeet’ (University song). Justice N.H. Bhagwati, Vice-Chancellor of BHU said: [...] "Many of you perhaps do not know that besides being an eminent scientist, Professor Bhatnagar was a Hindi poet of repute and that during his stay in Banaras, he composed the ‘Kulgeet’ of the University...Prof. Bhatnagar is remembered with reverence in this University {{and will continue to be}} so remembered till this University exists." [...] He moved to Lahore as Professor of Physical Chemistry and Director of University Chemical Laboratories of the University of the Punjab. This career was the most active period of his life in original scientific work. His research interests included emulsions, colloids, and industrial chemistry, but his fundamental contributions were in the field of <b>magneto-chemistry,</b> the use of magnetism for the study of chemical reactions. In 1928 he and K.N. Mathur jointly invented what they called the Bhatnagar-Mathur Magnetic Interference Balance, which was one of the most sensitive instruments for measuring magnetic properties. It was exhibited at the Royal Society Soiree in 1931 and it was marketed by Messers Adam Hilger and Co, London.|$|E

It provides the background, methodologies and tools for basic areas related to spin interactions, such as spin chemistry and biology, electron transfer, light energy conversion, photochemistry, radical reactions, <b>magneto-chemistry</b> and magneto-biology. The book also includes {{an overview of}} designing advanced magnetic materials, optical and spintronic devices and photo catalysts. This monograph appeals to scientists and graduate students working in the areas related to spin interactions physics, biophysics, chemistry and chemical engineering...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of molecular magnets has undergone rapid progress in recent years. Each of the identical molecular units can contain {{as few as}} two and up to several dozens of paramagnetic ions (spins). Although these materials appear as macroscopic samples, i. e. crystals or powders, the intermolecular magnetic interactions are utterly negligible {{as compared to the}} intramolecular interactions. Therefore, measurements of their magnetic properties reflect mainly ensemble properties of single molecules. Their magnetic features promise a variety of applications in physics, <b>magneto-chemistry,</b> biology, biomedicine and material sciences as well as in quantum computing. It appears that in the majority of these molecules the localized single-particle magnetic moments couple antiferromagnetically and the spectrum is rather well described by the Heisenberg model with isotropic nearest neighbor interaction sometimes augmented by anisotropy terms. Thus, the interest in the Heisenberg model, which is known already for a long time, but used mostly for infinite one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems, was renewed by the successful {{synthesis of}} magnetic molecules. Studying such spin arrays focuses on qualitatively new physics caused by the finite size of the system. Theoretical inorganic chemistry itself provides several methods to understand and describe molecular magnetism. In this contribution we would like to focus on those subjects which are of general interest in the context of quantum magnetism.

The {{understanding}} of the magnetic interaction mechanisms among the crystal network metallic ions has been object of several studies during the last decades. The X-ray diffraction and the susceptibility measurements are the most extended techniques for structural and magnetic materials characterization however for an accurate micro-magnetic strucre description the most powerful tool is magnetic crystallography. Nevertheless neutron diffraction under metalorganic compounds is not really extended among the <b>magneto-chemistry</b> community. The synthesis, the crystal structure, the magnetic susceptibility and Neutron diffraction studies of two heteronuclear 3 d- 3 d solid solutions are here presented. The three-dimensional coordination polymer, [(Co 1 -x Mx) 2 (bta) ]n[H 4 bta = 1, 2, 4, 5 -benzenetetracarboxylic acid, with M = Fe(II) for compound (I) and Mn(II) for compound (2) and x= 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1] has been synthetized through hydrothermal conditions. The crystal structure and, particularly the magnetic properties of the pure Co(II) complex have been widely discussed in the literature. The crystal structure of [Co 2 (bta) n', [Fe 2 (bta) n', and [Mn 2 (bta) ]n is the same and crystallizes in the monoclinic C 2 /m space group with a cell-volume of 440 ºA and Z = 4. The pyromellitate ligand exhibits 12 coordination bonds towards 10 metal ions, and it consists of M(II) μ-oxo and carboxylate bridged layers linked through the carbon skeleton of the bta ligand (pillared-layer network). The doped ratio concentrations for compound 1 and 2 have been determined by neutron diffraction (bco, = 0. 25. 10 - 12 cm, bFe = 0. 96. 10 - 12 " cm, and bMn = - 0. 37. 10 - 12 cm). We find variations on Neel temperatures as well as relevant changes on neutron diffraction patterns along {{the whole range of}} ratio concentrations for compound 1 and 2. Peer reviewe...|$|E
