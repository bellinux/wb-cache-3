500|$|The [...] "Budapest rook" [...] is a manoeuvre, {{introduced}} by the IM Dolfi Drimer in 1968, with which Black develops the a8 rook aggressively along the sixth rank using the moves a7–a5 and the rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. For example, this can happen in the Adler variation after the <b>move</b> <b>sequence</b> 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 Ngxe5 7.Nxe5Nxe5 8.a3 a5 9.0-0 0-0 10.Nc3 Ra6 11.b3 Rh6.|$|E
500|$|This <b>move</b> <b>sequence</b> {{is called}} the [...] "Rubinstein variation" [...] in {{reference}} to the famous game Rubinstein–Vidmar (Berlin 1918) when 4.Bf4 was first employed. Various authors consider this move to be the most dangerous for Black. It aims to answer 4...Bc5 with 5.e3 without blocking the Bc1, contrary to what happens in the Adler variation 4.Nf3. Another point is that in the Adler variation White faces the risk of a strong attack against his kingside (see section [...] "Budapest rook"), while in the 4.Bf4 variation this is seldom the case because the Bf4 is well placed to protect White's kingside. On the other hand, the early development of the bishop means that White is more vulnerable to the check Bf8–b4+, the b2-pawn is not defended, and in some rare cases the Bf4 can become subject to attack.|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} for White to push their rook pawn (1. ... P-8d) instead of opening the bishop diagonal.

50|$|The Catalan Opening is {{characterized}} by White forming a pawn center at d4 and c4 and fianchettoing his king's bishop. It resembles {{a combination of the}} Queen's Gambit and Réti Opening. Since the Catalan can be reached from many different move orders, (one Queen's Gambit Declined-like <b>move</b> <b>sequence</b> is 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.g3), it is sometimes called the Catalan System.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{specific}} {{order of the}} castle <b>move</b> <b>sequence</b> will vary depending on White's piece development.

40|$|Abstract. We are {{studying}} the well known problem of the sliding puzzle or N-puzzle and we are modeling a number of consecutive extensions and their solution based on the known algorithmic solution. The usual approach to date has been to find optimal solutions (<b>move</b> <b>sequences)</b> to the N-puzzle {{with the aid of}} sophisticated special-purpose search methods. Our goal is to study it from a bottom up perspective and to do cognitive modeling of the scalable algorithmic solution that finds suboptimal <b>move</b> <b>sequences</b> but that can do so consistently for a large number of extensions with practically no increase in polynomial complexity. This approach claims both to model for fundamental cognitive skills that are exerted on top of existing intelligent problem-solving methods as well as to identify modules of reasoning that should be included in any scalably intelligent system...|$|R

50|$|In the {{position}} of the diagram at right, which never arose in real play, Alekhine claimed that White wins by 24.Rh6, as after some complicated play Black is mated or goes into an endgame a queen down. Some recent analyses suggest {{that this is not the}} case: if White plays 24.Rh6, black can play 24...Bg4+! and White has no mating attack. A later computer-assisted analysis concludes that White can force a win, but only by diverging from Alekhine's <b>move</b> <b>sequence</b> at move 20, while there are only three queens.|$|E

40|$|AbstractApproaches to {{computer}} game playing based on α–β {{search of the}} tree of possible <b>move</b> <b>sequences</b> combined with a position evaluation function have been successful for many games, notably Chess. Such approaches are less successful for games with large search spaces and complex positions, such as Go, and we are led to seek alternatives.

This approach means searching the space of possible goal expansions, typically much smaller than the space of <b>move</b> <b>sequences.</b> Previous attempts to apply these techniques to Go have been unable to provide results for anything other than a high strategic level or very open game positions.
