40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the effects of drunk driving deterrents and other alcohol related policies on drunk driving. The data set employed is an annual time-series of state cross-sections for the 48 contiguous states of the U. S. from 1982 through 1988. Total and alterative alcohol involved motor vehicle fatality rates, for the general population and for 18 to 20 year olds, are used as measures of drunk driving. The results indicate that the moat effective policies are increased beer taxes and <b>mandatory</b> administrative <b>license</b> actions. Maintaining the beer tax at its real 1951 value would have reduced fatalities by 11. 5 percent annually, on average, during the sample period. A <b>mandatory</b> administrative <b>license</b> sanction of one year would have reduced fatalities by 9 percent. The next most effective policies are a 21 year old legal drinking age, preliminary breath test and dram shop laws and relatively large mandatory fines. These policies each reduce total fatalities by about 5 to 6 percent. No plea bargaining provisions and <b>mandatory</b> <b>license</b> sanctions upon conviction are also found to have some deterrent effect. Other drunk driving laws tested include mandatory jail sentences and community service options, illegal per se laws, and open container laws. None of these were found to have a deterrent effect on drunk driving. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Mandatory</b> <b>licensing</b> {{for drivers}} came into force on 1 January 1904 after the Motor Car Act 1903 {{received}} royal assent in the United Kingdom. Every car owner had to register their vehicle with their local government authority {{and be able}} to prove registration of their vehicle on request. The minimum qualifying age was set at 17. The licence gave its holder 'freedom of the road' with a maximum 20 mph speed limit. Compulsory testing was introduced in 1934, with the passing of the Road Traffic Act.|$|E
50|$|Engineering, as {{it became}} a profession, had fewer {{restrictions}} in the 19th century. As {{it did not have}} <b>mandatory</b> <b>licensing</b> for entrants, competition was bigger. Unlike physicians, engineers could not enjoy protection from competition. For instance, a person without a college degree could still become an engineer. Engineers could be independent. It was a semi-autonomous profession because it could still require extended training and it formed body of specialized knowledge. The nature of their work meant that they were always influenced by business and industry. In many cases they did want to be independent. Oftentimes, they sought power through their connection with an organization. The engineer profession was much more collaborative.|$|E

5000|$|The SAC made news in late 2007 {{when they}} {{released}} {{a proposal to}} monetize file sharing in Canada by setting up a collection agency to distribute royalties to artists and songwriters (much like what is done on the radio). Similar ideas had been proposed in the past by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and William Fischer, but the SAC {{was one of the}} largest organizations {{and one of the first}} artist organizations to get serious about the idea. The Canadian Record Industry Association called it a [...] "pipe dream" [...] at first, but in 2008 the record industry shifted its strategy to push for largely the same idea that the SAC had proposed. The Canadian Music Creators Coalition, on the other hand, called the proposal [...] "forward thinking." [...] The proposal received much criticism from technology experts as a [...] "music tax," [...] since it calls for a <b>mandatory</b> <b>license</b> for everyone connected to the Internet, rather than an opt-in voluntary system.|$|R
5000|$|Little Girls in Pretty Boxes: The Making and Breaking of Elite Gymnasts and Figure Skaters is a 1995 nonfiction book by San Francisco Chronicle {{sports writer}} Joan Ryan {{detailing}} the difficult training regimens endured by {{young women in}} competitive sports such as gymnastics and figure skating, published by Doubleday Books. Ryan’s material was largely derived from personal interviews with nearly 100 former gymnasts and figure skaters as well as trainers, sports psychologists, physiologists and other experts, focusing on {{the physical and emotional}} hardships young women endured for the sake of Olympic glory and was ultimately critical of training practices. She argues that the image of these athletes' beauty, glamour, class and sophistication conceals a troubled reality, with physical problems of eating disorders, weakened bones, stunted growth, debilitating and fatal injuries, psychological issues such as depression and low self-esteem, and life sacrifices of dropping out of school, losing the chance to [...] "be a child", and becoming isolated from their peers and families. [...] While decrying these practices, Ryan advocates for systemic change in figure skating and gymnastics, calling for raising minimum-age requirements, <b>mandatory</b> <b>licensing</b> of coaches and careful scrutiny by national governing bodies, and requiring athletes to remain in regular schools at least until they are 16.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use individual-level census data on {{registered}} and practical nurses in the United States from 1950 - 70 {{to determine the}} effect that the switch from certification to licensure had on wages and participation in the registered and practical nurse professions. We examine these occupations {{to take advantage of a}} quasi-experiment afforded by the fact that, by the beginning of our sample, all states already had certification in place and some states already required a license. During the subsequent decade several states switched from certification to a <b>mandatory</b> <b>licensing</b> regime while others did not. Accordingly, we infer the effect of licensure in a differences-in-differences framework that uses states that did not change their regulatory regime as a control. Interestingly, we find that the shift from certification to <b>mandatory</b> <b>licensing</b> had little to no effect on the wages or the participation rate of practical and registered nurses...|$|E

See also District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U. S. 63 (1930); United States v. Craner, supra.
