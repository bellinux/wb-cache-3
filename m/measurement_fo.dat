40|$|Precise {{measurements}} of the minimal fluorescence yield (Fo) and maximal fluorescence yield (Fm) of a dark-adapted sample are prerequisites for the quantification of other fluorescence parameters. The pulse amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM 101 Chlorophyll Fluorometer, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) and saturating pulse technique have frequently been used in measuring Fo and Fm and in resolving the contributions of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching to the total fluorescence yield. The extent to which instrument-dependent factors may affect the accurate <b>measurement</b> of <b>Fo</b> and Fm is addressed. It is shown {{that the increase in}} pulse amplitude-modulated measuring beam intensity at 1. 6 and 100 kHz was nonlinear at higher light intensity settings. The implications of this for <b>measurements</b> of <b>Fo</b> (1. 6 kHz) and Fm (100 kHz) are discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The anomaly of shear {{thickening}} at high shear rates {{can be observed}} under certain conditions for high molecular weight polymers dissolved in low-viscosity New-tonian solvents {{despite the fact that}} shear-thinning behavior is considered the norm for these fluids. The nature of the shear-thickening region of the flow curve is examined herein through the application of a recent rheological model that has the capability of quantifying not only the rheological properties of the material, but its internal micro-structural state as well. The results of this examination provide a self-consistent explanation of the full flow characterization of this anomalous behavior, including both rheological and optical experimental measurements. The results presented herein suggest that the shear-thickening behavior is actually caused by the destruction of structures formed during shear at lower shear rates, not by their formation, as previ-ously assumed. The linear birefringence and linear dichroism observed experimentally in correlation with the shear-thickening behavior are well described by the rheological model and give predictions in line with experimental measurements. Furthermore, quantitative predictions are made for rheological characteristic functions, such as the first and second normal-stress coefficients, for which experimental <b>measurements</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|R

Study Design: Five-year follow-up study of 30 female education majors, initially documented with a standard voice assessment and a vocal endurance test. Measurements before and after vocal endurance testing were compared and related to the vocal outcome 5 years after the initial testing. Methods: Voice assessment included perceptual evaluation, airflow <b>measurements,</b> <b>Fo</b> and SPL <b>measurements,</b> voice range profile and laryngeal (stroboscopic) examination.

Most of these models have been developed to define and improve the behavior of specific laboratory devices or commercial products.

40|$|Cloud {{computers}} and multicore processors are two emerging classes of computational hardware {{that have the}} potential to provide un-precedented compute capacity to the average user. In order for the user to effectively harness all of this computational power, operat-ing systems (OSes) for these new hardware platforms are needed. Existing multicore operating systems do not scale to large num-bers of cores, and do not support clouds. Consequently, current day cloud systems push much complexity onto the user, requiring the user to manage individual Virtual Machines (VMs) and deal with many system-level concerns. In this work we describe the mechanisms and implementation of a factored operating system named fos. fos is a single system image operating system across both multicore and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud sys-tems. fos tackles OS scalability challenges by factoring the OS into its component system services. Each system service is further factored into a collection of Internet-inspired servers which com-municate via messaging.

An 11 -subject convenience sample wore the monitor for 2 consecutive days; in addition, 7 subjects carried the monitor on 1 day of the following week. Demographic characteristics of the sample were age: mean +/ – standard deviation [SD] = 87. 8 +/ – 2. 5 yr, body mass index: mean +/– SD = 25. 3 +/ – 2. 1 kg/m 2, and Mini-Mental State Examination score: mean +/ – SD = 27. 5 +/ – 2. 0. Analyzed movements were sit-to-stand (SiSt) and stand-to-sit postural transitions, dynamic activity (walking), and static behavior (sitting, standing, lying). Significant correlations were found for the SiSt transition dura-tion (TD) between days (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 78).

40|$|Independent {{studies have}} shown that the median raphe nucleus (MRN) and dorsal {{hippocampus}} (DH) are involved in the expression of contextual conditioned fear (CFC). However, studies that examine the integrated involvement of serotonergic mechanisms of the MRN-DH are lacking. To address this issue, a CFC paradigm was used to test whether the serotonergic projections from the MRN to DH can influence CFC. Serotoninergic drugs were infused either into the MRN or DH prior to testing sessions in which freezing and startle responses were measured in the same context where 6 h previously rats received footshocks. A reduction of serotonin (5 -HT) transmission in the MRN by local infusions of the 5 -HT(1 A) agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) -tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) decreased freezing in response to the context but did not reduce fear-potentiated startle. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that MRN serotonergic mechanisms selectively modulate the freezing response to the aversive context. As for the DH, a decrease in postsynaptic 5 -HT receptor activity at projection areas has been proposed to be the main consequence of 5 -HT(1 A) receptor activation in the MIRN. Intra-DH injections of 8 -OH-DPAT inhibited both the freezing and fear-potentiated startle response to the context. To reconcile these findings, an inhibitory mechanism may exist between the incoming 5 -HT pathway from the MRN to DH and the neurons of the DH output to other structures. The DH-amygdala or medial prefrontal cortex projections could well be this output circuit modulating the expression of CFC as revealed by <b>measurements</b> of <b>Fos</b> immunoreactivity in these areas.

The <b>measurements</b> of <b>fo</b> F 2, hm F 2, bottomside scale height around the peak height (H m), and slab thickness (B 0) were collected at the ionosonde station at Chung-Li Observatory. In addition, we calculated the total electron content (TEC) to study the differences {{inside and outside the}} eclipse area, using 3 receivers located at Marzhu (denoted as MATZ), Hsinchu (TNML), and Henchun (HENC).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent {{evidence}} suggests that 5 -HT(2 C) receptor activation may inhibit midbrain 5 -HT neurones by activating neighbouring GABA neurones. This hypothesis was tested using the putative selective 5 -HT(2 C) receptor agonist, WAY 161503. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of WAY 161503 on 5 -HT cell firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) was investigated in anaesthetised rats using single unit extracellular recordings. The effect of WAY 161503 on DRN GABA neurones was investigated using double label immunohistochemical <b>measurements</b> of <b>Fos,</b> glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and 5 -HT(2 C) receptors. Finally, drug occupancy at 5 -HT(2 A) receptors was investigated using rat positron emission tomography and ex vivo binding studies with the 5 -HT(2 A) receptor radioligand [(11) C]MDL 100907. KEY RESULTS: WAY 161503 caused a dose-related inhibition of 5 -HT cell firing which was reversed by the 5 -HT(2) receptor antagonist ritanserin and the 5 -HT(2 C) receptor antagonist SB 242084 but not by the 5 -HT(1 A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. SB 242084 pretreatment also prevented the response to WAY 161503. The blocking effects of SB 242084 likely involved 5 -HT(2 C) receptors because the drug did not demonstrate 5 -HT(2 A) receptor occupancy in vivo or ex vivo. The inhibition of 5 -HT cell firing induced by WAY 161503 was partially reversed by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Also, WAY 161503 increased Fos expression in GAD positive DRN neurones and DRN GAD positive neurones expressed 5 -HT(2 C) receptor immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings indicate that WAY 161503 inhibits 5 -HT cell firing in the DRN in vivo, and support a mechanism involving 5 -HT(2 C) receptor-mediated activation of DRN GABA neurones...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent {{experiments}} using non-selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) (2 C) receptor agonists including WAY 161503 {{suggested that}} midbrain 5 -HT neurones {{are under the}} inhibitory control of 5 -HT(2 C) receptors, acting via neighbouring gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurones. The present study extended this pharmacological characterization by comparing the actions of WAY 161503 with the 5 -HT(2 C) receptor agonists, Ro 60 - 0275 and 1 -(3 -chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP), {{as well as the}} non-selective 5 -HT agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the 5 -HT releasing agent 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: 5 -HT neuronal activity was measured in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) using extracellular recordings in anaesthetized rats. The activity of DRN GABA neurones was assessed using double-label immunohistochemical <b>measurements</b> of <b>Fos</b> and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). KEY RESULTS: Ro 60 - 0175, like WAY 161503, inhibited 5 -HT neurone firing, and the 5 -HT(2 C) antagonist SB 242084 reversed this effect. mCPP also inhibited 5 -HT neurone firing (approximately 60 % neurones) in a SB 242084 -reversible manner. LSD inhibited 5 -HT neurone firing; however, this effect was not altered by either SB 242084 or the 5 -HT(2 A/C) receptor antagonist ritanserin but was reversed by the 5 -HT(1 A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. Similarly, MDMA inhibited 5 -HT neurone firing in a manner reversible by WAY 100635, but not SB 242084 or ritanserin. Finally, both Ro 60 - 0275 and mCPP, like WAY 161503, increased Fos expression in GAD-positive DRN neurones. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data strengthen the hypothesis that midbrain 5 -HT neurones are under the inhibitory control of 5 -HT(2 C) receptors, and suggest that the 5 -HT(2 C) agonists Ro 60 - 0175, mCPP and WAY 161503, but not LSD or MDMA, are useful probes of the mechanism(s) involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reproducibility of temperature measurements in solid materials under microwave heating are investigated {{in this work}} using {{two of the most}} celebrated temperature measurement techniques, namely fiber optic probes (FO) and infrared (IR) sensors. Two solid materials {{with a wide range of}} applications in heterogeneous catalysis and different microwave absorbing capabilities are examined: CeO 2 –ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles. We investigate a number of effects ranging from purely technical issues, such as the use of a glass probe guide, over process operation parameters, such as the kind and the volume of the heated sample, to measurement related issues, such as the exact location of the probe in the sample. In this frame, the FO and IR methods are benchmarked. It was found that when using bare FO probes, not only is their lifetime reduced but also the reproducibility of the results is compromised. Using a glass probe guide greatly assists in precise location of the probe in the sample resulting in more reproducible temperature <b>measurements.</b> The <b>FO</b> reproducibility, though, decreases with increasing temperature. Besides, contrary to conventional heating, the sample temperature decreases with decreasing sample mass (and volume) at constant irradiation power level, confirming the volumetric nature of microwave heating. Furthermore, a strongly non-uniform temperature field is developed in the reactor despite the use of a monomode cavity and small amounts of samples. These temperature variations depending on the volume and position can only by detected by FO. In contrast, IR, which actually measures temperature at the exterior of the reactor wall, remains nearly insensitive to them and consistently underestimates the real temperature in the reactor. The modeler and the experimentalist should be rather circumspect in accepting the IR output as a representative reactor temperature.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the feasibility of conducting quantitative ultrasound (QUS) screening of uninsured Hispanic women to determine low bone mass in the calcaneus. The population included in the study was a convenience sample (n= 69) of women who attended a free health clinic. Upon consent, participants placed their foot on the Achilles Bone Ultrasonometer to have their bone mass evaluated with ultrasound. A series of 2 to 3 measurements were taken for each patient to ensure reproducibility. The average of the <b>measurements</b> was used <b>fo...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The H/V {{spectral}} ratio method {{based on}} seismic noise (HVSRN) {{was used in}} the Grenoble Basin (France), an Alpine valley characterized by a small apex ratio. The resonance frequencies obtained in the experiments were compared to the thickness of the sediments deduced from a microgravimetric survey and to the 1 -D theoretical assessment of site responses. Given the abundance of data on the sediments and depth of the basin, the values of the theoretical resonance frequency fo can be determined quite accurately. However, it has been observed that the effects of basin geometry can disturb <b>fo</b> <b>measurements</b> using the HVSR method, in particular for a case like the Grenoble Basin, which has a small apex ratio (w/H) and strong suspected 2 -D and/or 3 -D effects. Interpretation of fo values in terms of bedrock depth gives rise to estimation errors of about 10 % in certain cases, with the most significant errors (> 50 %) occurring on the edges of the basin, where subsurface layers are characterised by larger heterogeneities and where the basin topography is accentuated. This study suggests that great care must be taken when using the HVSRN method as an exploration tool, at least in valleys with a small apex ratio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Agger nasi cell (ANC) and {{the frontal}} sinus ostium (FO) are {{important}} structures that {{can influence the}} anatomy and physiology of the frontal recess. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the presence and size of ANC and the FO and correlate them according to gender, race and among themselves. MethodA prospective study with 40 patients who underwent CT of the paranasal sinuses with sagittal reconstruction. Measurements: ANC (APAN) anteroposterior diameter, ANC (CCAN) craniocaudal diameter, ANC (LLAN) side-to-side diameter, anteroposterior diameter of the FO (APFO) and side-to-side diameter of the FO (LLFO). ResultsTwenty-two patients were male and 18 females, mean age 33. 7 years. Most patients were white (45 %), followed by browns (32. 5 %), blacks (20 %) and asians (2. 5 %). The ANC was present in 98. 7 % of patients. There was statistical difference for APAN on females and LLAN on females and on the total sample. There were no differences for all measurements regarding gender, as well as the race. ANC and <b>FO</b> <b>measurements</b> showed positive correlation, but poor or very poor. ConclusionThe prevalence of ANC in our sample was high and did not show a statistically significant difference for most measurements. The correlation between measurements of ANC and the FO was poor or very poor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{clinical}} decision support system based on machine learning (ML) algorithms to help the diagnostic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using forced oscillation (<b>FO)</b> <b>measurements.</b> To this end, the performances of classification algorithms based on Linear Bayes Normal Classifier, K nearest neighbor (KNN), decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM) were compared in order to the search for the best classifier. Four feature selection methods were also used in order to identify a reduced set of the most relevant parameters. The available dataset consists of 7 possible input features (FO parameters) of 150 measurements made in 50 volunteers (COPD, n= 25; healthy, n= 25). The performance of the classifiers and reduced data sets were evaluated by the determination of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Among the studied classifiers, KNN, SVM and ANN classifiers were the most adequate, reaching values that allow a very accurate clinical diagnosis (Se> 87 %, Sp> 94 %, and AUC> 0. 95). The use of the analysis of correlation as a ranking index of the FOT parameters, allowed us to simplify the analysis of the FOT parameters, while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the proposed classifiers may contribute to easy the diagnostic of COPD by using forced oscillation measurements...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} experiments aimed at testing the calibration of oxygen barometers for the garnet peridotite [garnet (Gt) -olivine (Ol) -orthopyroxene (Opx) ] phase assemblage. These involved equilibrating {{a thin layer}} of garnet sandwiched between layers of olivine and orthopyroxene at 1300 °C and 23 - 35 kbar for 1 - 7 days. Oxygen fugacity was controlled (but not buffered) by using inner capsules of Fe-Pt alloy or graphitc or molybdenum sealed in welded Pt outer capsules. Post-experiment <b>measurement</b> of <b>fO</b> 2 was made by determining the compositions of Pt-Fe alloy sensors at the interface between garnet and olivine + orthopyroxene layers. The composition of alloy in equilibrium with olivine + orthopyroxene was approached from Fe-oversaturated and Fe-undersaturated conditions in the same experiment with, in general, excellent convergence. Product phase compositions were determined by electron microprobe and a piece of the garnet layer saved for 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The latter gave the Fe 3 + content of the garnet at the measured P-T-fO 2 conditions. Approach to equilibrium was checked by observed shifts in Fe 3 + content and by the approach of garnet-olivine Fe-Mg partitioning to the expected value. The compositions of the phases were combined with mixing properties and thermodynamic data to calculate an apparent fO 2 from two possible garnet oxybarometers:- {Mathematical expression} and {Mathematical expression} Comparison of calculated fO 2 s with those measured by the Pt-Fe sensors demonstrated that either barometer gives the correct answer within the expected uncertainty. Data from the first (Luth et al. 1990) has an uncertainty of about 1. 6 log fO 2 units, however, while that from equilibrium (2) (Woodland and O'Neill 1993) has an error of +/- 0. 6 log units, comparable to that of the spinel peridotite oxybarometer. We therefore conclude that equilibrium (2) may be used to calculate the fO 2 recorded by garnet peridotites with an uncertainty of about +/- 0. 6 log units, providing the potential to probe the oxidation environment of the deep continental lithosphere. Preliminary application based on data from Luth et al. (1990) indicates that garnet peridotite xenoliths from Southern Africa record oxygen fugacities about 3. 0 log units below the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) buffer. These are substantially more reducing conditions than those recorded by continental spinel lherzolites which typically give oxygen fugacities close to FMQ (Wood et al. 1990). © 1995 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{capture and}} {{detection}} of airborne biological agents {{in real time}} with a cantilever biosensor without introducing the agents into liquids, we present the effects of inlet/outlet configurations of a homemade particle collector on the electrostatic capture of airborne 100 nm diameter nanoparticles under swirling gas flows. This particle collector has three different inlet/outlet configurations: forward inlet/outlet (FO), backward inlet/outlet (BO) and straight inlet/outlet (SO) configurations. We also present the electrostatic capture of Vaccinia viruses using the same particle collector and compare these virus measurements with the nanoparticle cases. The most particles were collected in the FO configuration. The numbers of particles captured in the BO and SO configurations were close within their standard deviations. For all the three configurations tested, the number of particles captured in the center electrode C was much smaller than those captured in the other electrodes at a flow rate of 1. 1 l min- 1 and an applied potential of 2 kV. Using a commercial CFD code FLUENT, we also simulated {{the effects of the}} three inlet/outlet configurations on the particle capture in terms of particle trajectories, velocities and travel times. This simulation was in a good agreement with <b>measurements</b> that the <b>FO</b> configuration is the most favorable to particle capture among the tested configurations at a flow rate of 1. 1 l min- 1. The effects of particle diameters on the capture will also be discussed. This collector can be used for real-time monitoring of bioaerosols along with cantilever biosensors. close 3...|$|R
