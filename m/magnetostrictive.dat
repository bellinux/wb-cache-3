5|$|A <b>magnetostrictive</b> {{material}} is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the <b>magnetostrictive</b> material. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the <b>magnetostrictive</b> material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{naturally}} <b>magnetostrictive</b> material, meaning that, {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field, the material undergoes a small change in length. The magnetostriction of nickel is on the order of 50ppm and is negative, indicating that it contracts.|$|E
5|$|The usual <b>magnetostrictive</b> {{materials}} {{used for the}} transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire {{may be used for}} the input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly <b>magnetostrictive.</b> However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1886 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, {{but it was}} not isolated in pure form until the development of ion exchange techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a <b>magnetostrictive</b> material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and <b>magnetostrictive</b> material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetostrictive</b> transducers, {{based on}} magnetostriction, have been {{predominantly}} used as sonar ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. <b>Magnetostrictive</b> speaker drivers have some special advantages: {{they can provide}} greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. <b>Magnetostrictive</b> speaker modules have been produced by Fostex and FeONIC and subwoofer drivers have also been produced.|$|E
25|$|Japanese WW2 sonars {{operated}} at a {{range of}} frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19kHz <b>magnetostrictive)</b> at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6km. The later Type 3, with German-design <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except model 1 which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The Simple type used 14.5kHz <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducers at 0.25kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5km.|$|E
25|$|There {{was little}} {{progress}} in development from 1915 to 1940. In 1940, the US sonars typically {{consisted of a}} <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducer {{and an array of}} nickel tubes connected to a 1-foot-diameter steel plate attached back-to-back to a Rochelle salt crystal in a spherical housing. This assembly penetrated the ship hull and was manually rotated to the desired angle. The piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystal had better parameters, but the <b>magnetostrictive</b> unit was much more reliable. Early WW2 losses prompted rapid research in the field, pursuing both improvements in <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducer parameters and Rochelle salt reliability. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), a superior alternative, was found as a replacement for Rochelle salt; the first application was a replacement of the 24kHz Rochelle-salt transducers. Within nine months, Rochelle salt was obsolete. The ADP manufacturing facility grew from few dozen personnel in early 1940 to several thousands in 1942.|$|E
25|$|During World War I {{the need}} to detect {{submarines}} prompted more research into the use of sound. The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer Constantin Chilowsky, worked {{on the development of}} active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915. Although piezoelectric and <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, this work influenced future designs. Lightweight sound-sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones (acousto-electric transducers for in-water use), while Terfenol-D and PMN (lead magnesium niobate) have been developed for projectors.|$|E
500|$|Both <b>magnetostrictive</b> and {{piezoelectric}} transducers {{are used}} in mechanical filters. Piezoelectric transducers are favoured in recent designs since the piezoelectric material {{can also be used}} as one of the resonators of the filter, thus reducing the number of components and thereby saving space. They also avoid the susceptibility to extraneous magnetic fields of the [...] <b>magnetostrictive</b> type of transducer.|$|E
500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{combinations}} of resonators and transducers {{that can be used}} to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in antiphase to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. [...] When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal. Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducers. Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The <b>magnetostrictive</b> transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa. Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.|$|E

2500|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy at {{the onset}} of WW2 used {{projectors}} based on quartz. These were big and heavy, especially if designed for lower frequencies; the one for Type 91 set, operating at 9kHz, had a diameter of [...] and was driven by an oscillator with 5kW power and 7kV of output amplitude. The Type 93 projectors consisted of solid sandwiches of quartz, assembled into spherical cast iron bodies. The Type 93 sonars were later replaced with Type 3, which followed German design and used <b>magnetostrictive</b> projectors; the projectors consisted of two rectangular identical independent units in a cast iron rectangular body about [...] The exposed area was half the wavelength wide and three wavelengths high. The <b>magnetostrictive</b> cores were made from 4mm stampings of nickel, and later of an iron-aluminium alloy with aluminium content between 12.7% and 12.9%. The power was provided from a 2kW at 3.8kV, with polarization from a 20V, 8A DC source.|$|E
2500|$|Significant stress {{may exist}} even when {{deformation}} is negligible or non-existent (a common assumption when modeling {{the flow of}} water). [...] Stress may exist {{in the absence of}} external forces; such built-in stress is important, for example, in prestressed concrete and tempered glass. Stress may also be imposed on a material without the application of net forces, for example by changes in temperature or chemical composition, or by external electromagnetic fields (as in piezoelectric and <b>magnetostrictive</b> materials).|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} US Navy scanning sonar {{at the end}} of the World War II operated at 18kHz, {{using an}} array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s <b>magnetostrictive</b> and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used <b>magnetostrictive</b> nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and [...] "expendable modular design", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995 Maytag {{introduced}} an [...] "intelligent" [...] dishwasher {{based on a}} fuzzy controller and a [...] "one-stop sensing module" [...] that combines a thermistor, for temperature measurement; a conductivity sensor, to measure detergent level from the ions present in the wash; a turbidity sensor that measures scattered and transmitted light to measure the soiling of the wash; and a <b>magnetostrictive</b> sensor to read spin rate. The system determines the optimum wash cycle for any load to obtain the best results with {{the least amount of}} energy, detergent, and water. It even adjusts for dried-on foods by tracking the last time the door was opened, and estimates the number of dishes by the number of times the door was opened.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Magnetostrictive</b> {{transducers}} were pursued after WW2 as {{an alternative}} to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to [...] in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by prestressing. Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent sch material is Galfenol.|$|E

50|$|<b>Magnetostrictive</b> level sensors {{are similar}} to float type sensors in that a {{permanent}} magnet sealed inside a float travels {{up and down a}} stem in which a <b>magnetostrictive</b> wire is sealed.
