5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone to form or enter the central Pacific was first identified on September25 several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands. Traveling nearly due west, the storm attained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. By September27, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated on September28 over open waters.|$|E
5|$|The July 1, 1919, {{incarnation}} of M-89 was much shorter relative to today's road. Its western terminus {{was at a}} junction with M-11 (later US31, now A-2) near Ganges. It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before {{turning back to the}} east towards Allegan on an alignment that is a few <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present day configuration. The highway then left Allegan on present day M-222 and terminated at M-13, which is now A-45 east of the US131 freeway.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 31, 2006. It moved westward without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 10. An area of convection developed along the wave axis, several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Tehuantepec. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. Convection and banding features organized around a developing center, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 13. The system continued to organize and strengthened into Tropical Storm Lane early on September 14 about 90miles (145km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. Based on a potentially developing anticyclone over the storm and a track over warm water temperatures, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model issued a 46percent probability for rapid intensification of the storm.|$|E
5|$|SR78 runs {{concurrently}} with SR79 {{across the}} headwaters of the San Diego River and through the hamlet of Wynola, briefly entering Cleveland National Forest before reaching Julian and entering the town as Washington Street. The route, still concurrent with SR79, turns east onto Main Street and travels through downtown Julian before SR79 diverges south towards Cuyamaca and SR 78 heads northeast as Banner Road. The road intersects with County Route S2 (CRS2) at a junction called Scissors Crossing; CRS2 runs concurrently in a wrong-way concurrency. Shortly afterwards, SR78 enters Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and is designated as a scenic highway for its length in the state park. Although this route travels many <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town of Borrego Springs, it provides access to the town via CR S3. SR 78 travels through the town of Ocotillo Wells before exiting the state park and entering Imperial County.|$|E
5|$|The town of Harrisburg was platted a few <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{junction}} of the Goshen and Shawneetown–Kaskaskia Trail, {{two of the}} first pioneer trade routes in the state. Prior to the War of 1812, most {{of the population of}} today's Saline County lived in cabins clustered around blockhouses to protect against Indian attack and dangerous wildlife such as wild cats and bears. Permanent settlements in the forested area were inevitable with the influx of more settlers, and the first land entry was made in 1814 by John Wren and Hankerson Rude. By 1840 the settlers outnumbered the Native Americans, and most of the black bear population of the county had been killed off by 1845.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Patricia was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that briefly affected parts of Baja California Sur before rapidly degenerating over water. Developing from a tropical wave that traversed the Atlantic Ocean during September 2009, Patricia was first {{classified as a}} tropical depression on October11 several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baja California Peninsula. The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm as it tracked in a general northward direction. By October12, Patricia attained its peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). The following day, increasing wind shear and unfavorable conditions caused the storm to rapidly weaken. By the morning of October14, Patricia had degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near the southern coastline of Baja California Sur. The remnants of the storm persisted until October15, at which time they dissipated over open waters.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boston meetinghouse. Within months, someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in the Boston church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, {{the theology of the}} Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} European Americans to visit the area were fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Rogue Valley. Neither Ogden nor the {{expedition}} mentioned the Table Rocks. The gold rush of the early 1850s brought many emigrants to the area, and Table Rock City (later renamed Jacksonville) was established several <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocks. The sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with the Rogue River Indians. These conflicts turned into warfare, and several treaties were signed {{in an attempt to}} end the hostilities. In June 1851, soldiers of the United States Army led by Major Philip Kearny attacked the Takelma near Lower Table Rock, but the Takelma were prepared. One soldier died, and three others were injured. Major Kearny returned with volunteers from Yreka soon after, accompanied by Oregon Territory delegate Joseph Lane. The ensuing Battle of Table Rock lasted 10days, and 30Takelma were imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} the major firebombing {{campaign}} was delayed as XXIBomber Command was used to attack airfields in southern Japan from late March to mid-May {{in support of the}} invasion of Okinawa, an island only a few hundred <b>miles</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home islands. Prior to the landings on 1April, the Command bombed airfields in Kyushu at Ōita and Tachiarai as well as an aircraft plant at Ōmura on 27March, and struck Ōita and Tachiarai again on the 31st of the month. No B-29s were lost in these raids. From 6April the Japanese conducted large-scale kamikaze air raids on the Allied invasion fleet, during which suicide aircraft damaged or sank many warships and transports. As part of the Allied response to these attacks, XXIBomber Command conducted major raids on airfields in Kyushu on 8 and 16April, though the first of these attacks was diverted to strike residential areas in Kagoshima after the airfields were found to be covered by clouds. From 17April until 11May, when the B-29s were released for other duties, about three quarters of XXI Bomber Command's effort was devoted to attacking airfields and other targets in direct support of the Battle of Okinawa; this included 2,104 sorties flown against 17 airfields. These raids cost the Command 24 B-29s destroyed and 233 damaged and failed to completely suppress kamikaze attacks from the targeted airfields.|$|E
