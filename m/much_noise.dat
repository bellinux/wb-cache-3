5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very <b>much</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too <b>much</b> <b>noise,</b> and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion.

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a measure}} of how <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> is {{introduced}} in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is noise figure or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.|$|E

50|$|A {{more radical}} pixel design is the active-reset pixel. Active reset {{can result in}} <b>much</b> lower <b>noise</b> levels. The {{tradeoff}} is a complicated reset scheme, as well as either a much larger pixel or extra column-level circuitry.|$|R
25|$|Music, {{including}} {{everything from}} the choir of a church procession to the marching band of a military procession. Criers may march before the procession, yelling {{to clear the way}} for it.

25|$|For {{the first}} two miles Johnny walked barefoot, {{so as to avoid}} making too <b>much</b> <b>noise,</b> until he reached the ranch of E.W. Smith. Johnny found that the ranch house had been broken into and that black clothing, a gun, and a bottle of brandy had been taken. Smith was found just after, he had {{apparently}} hidden, or was elsewhere, when the Apaches attacked. Smith joined Johnny and together the rode to Oro Blanco, arriving at 2:00 am the next morning. Meanwhile, Yank was able to fend off the attackers so when Johnny returned with help the hostiles were already gone.|$|E
25|$|When {{activity}} {{recognition is}} performed indoors and in cities using the widely available Wi-Fi signals and 802.11 access points, there is <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> and uncertainty. These uncertainties are modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network model by Yin et al. A multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals is presented by Chai and Yang, where a deterministic state transition model is applied. A better model that models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach is proposed by Hu and Yang. A user action discovery model is presented by Yin et al., where the Wi-Fi signals are segmented to produce possible actions.|$|E

50|$|The {{response}} of a coil/magnet geophone {{is proportional to}} ground velocity, while MEMS devices usually respond proportional toacceleration. MEMS have a <b>much</b> higher <b>noise</b> level (50 dB velocity higher) than geophones and can only be used in strong motion or active seismic applications.|$|R
50|$|The torpedo {{has been}} the subject of {{continued}} improvement over its service lifetime. In the 1990s, a Mod 6 variant of the ADCAP provided <b>much</b> improved <b>noise</b> isolation for the engine, which makes this torpedo more difficult to detect for a potential target.|$|R
25|$|In November 1834 Nimble {{pursued the}} Spanish slave ship Carlota {{until she was}} wrecked on the Cuban coast. Nimble rescued 272 African slaves, which contributed to her wrecking. On the way to Havana Nimble met bad weather, and on 4 November was driven onto a reef near Cay Verde {{on the north side}} of the Old Bahama Channel. The ship was lost and 70 of the Africans drowned. It was {{reported}} that the Africans in the hold were making so <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> that the crew could not hear the sound of the breakers on the reef. All her crew were saved, as were some 200 slaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} on {{the number}} of participants in the Labour Day celebrations on Taksim Square in 1977 is usually given as 500,000 citizens. Many participants and in particular the Maoist bloc had not even entered the square when shots were heard. Most witnesses stated that they came from the building of the water supply company (Sular İdaresi) and Intercontinental Hotel (now the Marmara Hotel), the tallest building in Istanbul in 1977. Subsequently the security forces intervened with armoured vehicles making <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> with their sirens and explosives. They also hosed the crowd with pressurized water. People tried to escape through Kazancı Yokuşu, the nearest exit from the square, however a track blocked escape route. Most casualties were caused by the panic that police intervention created.|$|E
25|$|Later in the epic, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh {{the story}} of the Great Flood, which was sent by the god Enlil to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly overpopulated, made too <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> and {{prevented}} him from sleeping. Utnapishtim tells how, when the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the Anunnaki. Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods. Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a lapis lazuli necklace with beads shaped like flies and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods. She swears him that she will never allow Enlil to cause another flood and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a sign of her oath. Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic haze {{machines}} use transducers {{submerged in}} {{a reservoir of}} fluid to create atmospheric effects. Although less common {{than some of the}} other technologies used to produce haze, ultrasonic hazers are promoted as generating their effects with <b>much</b> less <b>noise</b> than other technologies.|$|R
25|$|H/SJD-7 is the Chinese {{development}} of Italian DE-1164 sonar, with additional noise cancellation and vibration reduction measures {{so that it}} can be used on older steam powered warship, whose steam propulsion system generates <b>much</b> greater <b>noise</b> and vibration than diesel and gas turbine propulsion system.|$|R
6000|$|Constitutional Patriotism is in deep natural alarm {{at these}} things. The august Assembly sits {{diligently}} deliberating; dare nowise resolve, with Mirabeau, on an instantaneous disbandment and extinction; finds that {{a course of}} palliatives is easier. But at least and lowest, this grievance of the Arrears shall be rectified. A plan, <b>much</b> <b>noised</b> of in those days, under the name 'Decree of the Sixth of August,' has been devised for that. Inspectors shall visit all armies; and, with certain elected corporals and 'soldiers able to write,' verify what arrears and peculations do lie due, and make them good. Well, if {{in this way the}} smoky heat be cooled down; if it be not, as we say, ventilated over-much, or, by sparks and collision somewhere, sent up! ...|$|R
25|$|Further {{practical}} aspects {{concern the}} amount of time the system can switch from channel to channel, time to lock when first switched on, and how <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> there is in the output. All of these are a function of the loop filter of the system, which is a low-pass filter placed between the output of the frequency comparator and the input of the VCO. Usually the output of a frequency comparator {{is in the form of}} short error pulses, but the input of the VCO must be a smooth noise-free DC voltage. (Any noise on this signal naturally causes frequency modulation of the VCO.) Heavy filtering will make the VCO slow to respond to changes, causing drift and slow response time, but light filtering will produce noise and other problems with harmonics. Thus the design of the filter is critical to the performance of the system and in fact the main area that a designer will concentrate on when building a synthesizer system.|$|E
25|$|Caesar responded quickly. He force-marched six legions {{north to}} Orléans, where the {{rebellion}} had begun, {{and then to}} Gergovia, the home of Vercingetorix. At the same time, he sent his deputy Titus Labienus with four legions to subdue the Parisii and their allies, the Senons. The Commander of the Parisii, Camulogene, burned the bridge that connected the oppidum to the left bank of the Seine, so the Romans were unable to approach the town. Then Labienus and the Romans went downstream, built their own pontoon bridge at Melun and approached Lutetia on the right bank. Camulogene responded by burning the bridge to the right bank and burning the town on the Île de la Cité, before retreating to the left bank and making camp at what is now Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Labienus deceived the Parisii with a clever ruse; {{in the middle of}} the night, he sent part of his army, making as <b>much</b> <b>noise</b> as possible, upstream to Melun, left his most inexperienced soldiers in their camp on the right bank, and, with his best soldiers, quietly crossed the Seine to the left bank and laid a trap for the Parisii. Camulogene, believing that the Romans were retreating, divided his own forces, some to capture the Roman camp, which he thought was abandoned, and others to pursue the Roman army. Instead, he ran directly into the best two Roman legions on the plain of Grenelle, near the site of the modern Eiffel Tower and the École Militaire. The Parisii fought bravely and desperately in what became known as the Battle of Lutetia; Camulogene was killed and his soldiers were cut down by the disciplined Romans. Despite the defeat, the Parisii continued to resist the Romans; they sent eight thousand men to fight with Vercingetorix in his last stand against the Romans at the Battle of Alesia.|$|E
