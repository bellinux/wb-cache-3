Research during this grant year includes: (1) Completion of the Spin-Polarized Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (SPEELS) research program. (2) Design of an improved and much more intense <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> source that can also be converted to a Rydberg atom beam, for continuing studies utilizing Spin-Polarized <b>Metastable</b> (<b>Atom)</b> Deexcitation Spectroscopy (SPMDS), and to initiate new investigations of interactions of Rydberg atoms with surfaces.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of a helium 23 s 1 <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> electronic spin-state {{is measured in}} helium gas using optical pumping techniques. The metastable atoms are created by an RF electrical discharge. The spin-state lifetime is found to vary with the -pressure of the helium {{and the intensity of}} the discharge. Also, the {{lifetime of}} the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> is measured in the afterglow of a helium discharge. The metastable spin-state lifetime in a discharge is found to be much shorter than the metastable afterglow lifetime at the same pressure. At 1 mm Hg pressure, the afterglow lifetime of the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> is about 1 as. At the same pressure in a discharge the metastable spin-state lifetime is found to be about 0. 2 ms. The mechanism pro- posed to explain this difference is collisions of metastable atoms with the hot (~ 4 ev) electrons present in the dis-charge. The total cross-section for this process is large, and presumably a large fraction of the collisions will be effective in relaxing the spin-states...|$|E
40|$|The {{metastable}} deexcitation {{spectrum of}} Ag(100) is measured {{and information on}} the effective density of states probed by the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> is obtained by deconvolution of the experimental spectrum, under the hypothesis that it reflects the self-convolution of the surface density of states. Layer resolved semi-empirical LCAO calculations are compared to the deconvolution curve, showing poor agreement {{as far as the}} branching ratios of sp versus d contributions are concerned. The agreement between theory and experiment strongly improves if an energy dependent exponential decay factor is included in the first layer calculated density of states to account for the energy dependent increased overlap between electronic states of the solid and <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> outside the surface...|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} named after the Dutch {{physicist}} Frans Michel Penning who first reported it in 1927. Penning started to worked at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium at Eindhoven to continue the investigation of electric discharge on rare gases. Later, he started measurements on the liberation of electrons from metal surfaces by positive ions and <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms,</b> and especially on the effects related to ionization by <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the photoemission {{spectroscopy}} of the graphite hollow cathode sooting discharge to identify the roles played by the kinetic and potential sputtering, respectively. Our indicators are the relative densities of the sputtered carbon C, the Ne <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms,</b> and the ionized components (Ne+) of the regenerative sooting plasma. We find that the <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> are the main agents for the regeneration of the soot. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Space {{resolved}} {{concentrations of}} helium He <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> in an atmospheric pressure radio-frequency micro-plasma jet were measured using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The spatial profile of <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> {{in the volume}} between the electrodes was deduced for various electrode gap distances. Density profiles reveal the sheath structure and reflect the plasma excitation distribution, {{as well as the}} dominance of the alpha-mode discharge. Gap width variations show the transition from a normal glow plasma to a pure sheath discharge. In order to analyze and verify the experimentally observed profiles of the <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> a 2 -dimensional simulation model was set up. Applying an appropriate He/N 2 /O 2 chemistry model the correlation between the metastable profiles and the underlying excitation mechanisms was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Atomic beam {{experiments}} {{are limited by}} intensity. Intensity limitations are specially critical in the measurements of metastable atoms, since their relative population is several order of magnitude smaller than the beam population. This thesis provides a method for increasing the intensity of metastable argon and neon beams effusing from a hot cathode, glow discharge by use of a longitudinal magnetic field. The argon and neon <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> intensities have been measured {{for a range of}} discharge pressure, voltage, and current for a magnetic field strengths from 0 to 31 mT. For both argon and neon, the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> beam intensity rises to a maximum value about one order of magnitude above the zero field case. A qualitative discussion of the theory of this phenomenon is also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{characterization}} of an intense source of metastable Ar(3 P 0, 2) atoms is described together with its application in the patterning of Si surfaces. Two {{different approaches to}} patterning were investigated. In the first, a hydrogen-passivated Si(100) surface was exposed to the Ar(3 P 0, 2) <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> beam, {{in the presence of}} a small partial pressure of O 2, using a 2000 line/inch grid as a mask. The hydrogen-passivation layer is removed in those areas exposed to the beam, allowing formation of an oxide resist. Subsequent immersion in a KOH solution results in selective etching of the hydrogen-passivated regions, producing an image of the grid on the Si surface with âˆ¼ 20 nm feature depths. In the second approach, an octadecylsiloxane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) grown on the native oxide of a Si(100) surface was exposed to the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> beam through the grid. Ar(3 P 0, 2) impact damages the SAM permitting pattern transfer through subsequent plasma and chemical etching. Because <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> beams can be manipulated and focused using optical fields, these methods could provide the basis for a new maskless, massively-parallel approach to nanoscale fabrication on Si that is not limited in resolution by space charge or diffraction effects as in conventional charged-beam and optical techniques...|$|E
40|$|The strong {{electronic}} {{interaction between}} electronically excited metastable helium atoms (He"*) and a surface {{leads to a}} high deexcitation probability upon impact due to charge transfer. The probability that a <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> survives the scattering process depends sensitively upon the overlap of the orbitals of the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> and the electronic states at the surface. In the current study the potentials and limits of scattering of metastable atoms for the investigation of surfaces are determined. For this purpose the interaction between metastable He 2 " 3 S_ 1 atoms and different insulator and metal surfaces was investigated {{for the first time}} with a high angular and energy resolution through the application of a new state of the art scattering apparatus.

40|$|The {{electron}} spin dependence of reactions involving helium <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> is investigated using optical pumping and microwave diagnostic techniques. Wigner (1927) proposed that {{electron spin}} angular momentum is conserved in atomic collisions. This rule of elec-tron spin conservation is {{tested in the}} collision of two helium triplet <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> in the afterglow of a helium discharge at 2 Torr: If the Wigner spin rule holds, the above reaction will be dependent upon the spin states of the colliding <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms.</b> A simple theory is developed showing the influence of spin conservation {{on the number of}} electrons produced in such reactions. The effect of electrons resulting from other collisions in the afterglow is introduced, and the two treatments are combined to yield a quantitative prediction of the results of experimental observation. Optical pumping is used to change the normal distribution of the spin states. Microwave diagnostic techniques are used to observe any corresponding change in the number of electrons in the helium afterglow. A very definite and measurable change in electron number density results, indicating that the Wigner spin rule holds in the collision of helium triplet <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms.</b> The experimental data lie within 20 % of the theoretical predictions in the early afterglow period, with the agreement decreasing at later times.

40|$|We have {{realized}} a scheme for continuous loading of a magnetic trap (MT). ^{ 52 }Cr atoms are continuously captured and cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Optical pumping to a <b>metastable</b> state decouples <b>atoms</b> from the cooling light. Due to their high magnetic moment (6 Bohr magnetons), low-field seeking <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> {{are trapped in}} the magnetic quadrupole field provided by the MOT. Limited by inelastic collisions between atoms in the MOT and in the MT, we load 10 ^ 8 <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> {{at a rate of}} 10 ^ 8 atoms/s at 50 - 100 microkelvin into the MT.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{production}} of neutral metastable fragments in electron collisions with neutral argon clusters. The fragments are detected using a time-of-flight technique. The time-of-flight spectra show that the metastable fragments appear in two velocity ranges. Kinetic energy distributions are obtained, showing that the faster fragments are ejected with energies from 0. 2 to 1. 5 eV and that the slower fragments have energies less than 0. 2 eV. It is argued that the fragmentation of the clusters involves the excitation and decay of excitons in the clusters. The faster fragments are produced by n 52 excitons, which localize on an excimer or an excited trimer within the cluster and upon dissociation cause the ejection of a <b>metastable</b> <b>atom.</b> The slower fragments are produced by n 51 excitons, which tend to localize {{on the periphery of}} the cluster, leading to the ejection of a <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> due to weak repulsive forces with neighboring atoms. Four different production mechanisms for neutral metastable fragments are observed...|$|E
40|$|In this Letter, {{a new way}} {{of cooling}} neutral atoms is presented, based on the {{interaction}} of a trapped <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> with a space dependent static electric field. This electric field induces a population transfer from the metastable state to a radiative one. The transfer rate depends on the field intensity experienced by the atom. The spatial profile of the field is chosen to enhance this rate for the hottest atoms...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{desorption}} of <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> induced by electronic transitions in solid Ne by low energy electron impact. Time-of-flight spectra and the angular distribution of <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> desorbed {{from the surface}} of an annealed sample show increased kinetic energy, higher signal intensity, and a narrower angular distribution compared with those measured using an unannealed sample. These results are explained by considering the sampleâ€™s surface conditions in the framework of the cavity ejection mechanism. Our results for annealed solid Ne show that when the sample temperature increases from 5 to 7 K, the width of the angular distribution increases by about 10...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of simultaneous quantum degeneracy in a dilute gaseous Bose-Fermi mixture of <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms.</b> Sympathetic cooling of helium- 3 (fermion) by helium- 4 (boson), both in the lowest triplet state, allows us to produce ensembles containing more than 10 ^ 6 atoms of each isotope at temperatures below 1 micro-Kelvin, and achieve a fermionic degeneracy parameter of T/Tf= 0. 45. Due to their high internal energy, the detection of individual <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> with sub-nanosecond time resolution is possible, permitting the study of bosonic and fermionic quantum gases with unprecedented precision. This may lead to metastable helium becoming the mainstay of quantum atom optics. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures submitted to PR...|$|R
40|$|A well {{collimated}} thermal beam of argon atoms, {{moving in}} the z direction, crosses the electron beam {{that is to be}} studied. Those argon atoms that are excited by impact to a metastable state proceed, with very little change in speed or direction, to a detector (windowless electron multiplier) some distance away. The neutral atomic beam of the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> probe (MAP) has a negligible interaction with the electromagnetic fields that govern the behavior of the electron beam; moreover, almost no additional space charge is created when the atomic beam is introduced. Thus, if the cross section of the atomic argon beam is small compared to the characteristic dimensions of the electrode structure that defines the electron beam, the <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> count rate, monitored as a function of x and y, gives a virtually nonperturbative measurement of the density profile of the electron beam. In this paper we outline the principles and applications of the method, discuss details of its implementation, and give results obtained with an MAP that has a spatial resolution of better than 0. 5 mm...|$|E

40|$|<b>Metastable</b> <b>Atom</b> De-excitation Spectroscopy (MDS) {{provides}} a powerful technique {{with which to}} investigate surface electronic structure with unparalleled surface specificity. In this technique a thermal energy beam of noble-gas metastable atoms is directed at the surface to be studied and the kinetic energy distribution of ejected electrons that result from <b>metastable</b> <b>atom</b> de-excitation is measured.

The electron spins on the incident metastable atoms are polarized and the spin-polarization of the ejected electrons is measured with a Mott polarimeter. Energy-integrated electron spin-polarization (ESP) measurements for Pd(110) and energy-resolved ESP measurements for Cu(100) surfaces under a variety of conditions indicate that metastable atom-surface interactions are more complex than has been assumed in past MDS studies.

A through cavity {{at the center}} of the chip was formed by laser drilling technique. MHCD with a diameter of few hundreds of micrometers allowed us to generate direct current discharges in helium at up to atmospheric pressure. A slowly varying ramped voltage generator was used to study the ignition and the extinction periods of the microdischarges. The analysis was performed by using electrical characterisation of the V-I behaviour and the measurement of He*(3 S 1) <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> density by tunable diode laser spectroscopy. At the ignition of the microdischarges, 2 Âµs long current peak as high as 24 mA was observed, sometimes followed by low amplitude damped oscillations. At helium pressure above 400 Torr, an oscillatory behaviour of the discharge current was observed just before the extinction of the microdischarges. The same type of instability in the extinction period at high pressure also appeared on the density of He*(3 S 1) <b>metastable</b> <b>atoms,</b> but delayed by a few Âµs relative to the current oscillations. <b>Metastable</b> <b>atoms</b> thus cannot be at the origin of the generation of the observed instabilities...|$|R
