25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel <b>management</b> <b>costs</b> do not have a clear time limit.|$|E

2500|$|While {{community-based}} conservation bears out individual analysis, {{there are}} significant overlaps between active and theoretical conservation and {{a discussion of the}} two as halves of a whole seems more constructive. [...] For example, in 2002 Rwanda's national parks went through a restructuring process. The director of the IGCP, Eugene Rutagarama stated that [...] "They got more rangers on better salaries, more radios, more patrol cars and better training in wildlife conservation. They also built more shelters in the park, from which rangers could protect the gorillas". [...] The funding for these types of improvements usually comes from tourism - in 2008, approximately 20 000 tourists visited gorilla populations in Rwanda, generating around $8 million in revenue for the parks. [...] In Uganda too, tourism is seen as a [...] "high value activity that generates enough revenue to cover park <b>management</b> <b>costs</b> and contribute to the national budget of the Uganda Wildlife Authority." [...] Furthermore, tourist visits which are conducted by park rangers also allow censuses of gorilla sub-populations to be undertaken concurrently.|$|E

Most current approaches largely focus on system performance improvement, neglecting <b>management</b> <b>cost</b> in deciding replicas number and their store places, which cause great financial burden for cloud users because the cost for replicas storage and consistency maintenance may lead to high overhead {{with the number of}} new replicas increased in a pay-as-you-go paradigm. In this paper, towards achieving the approximate minimum data sets <b>management</b> <b>cost</b> benchmark in a practical manner, we propose a replicas placements strategy from cost-effective view with the premise that system performance meets requirements. Firstly, we design data sets <b>management</b> <b>cost</b> models, including storage cost and transfer cost. Secondly, we use the access frequency and the average response time to decide which data set should be replicated. Then, the method of calculating replicas’ number and their store places with minimum <b>management</b> <b>cost</b> is proposed based on location problem graph. Both the theoretical analysis and simulations have shown that the proposed strategy offers the benefits of lower <b>management</b> <b>cost</b> with fewer replicas...|$|R

40|$|Implementing {{effective}} <b>cost</b> <b>management</b> approaches {{has recently}} gained momentum due to intense competition and increasing customer demands. Moreover, effective <b>cost</b> <b>management</b> approaches {{have contributed to}} firms’ competitive advantage in relation to cost leadership strategy. Consequently, firms have implemented contemporary <b>cost</b> <b>management</b> systems, such as activity-based management, business process re-engineering, life-cycle costing, target costing, and theory of constraint (TOC), {{to enable them to}} become low-cost producers and compete effectively and sustain their performance. Furthermore, focusing on <b>cost</b> <b>management</b> to improve profitability has led to the integration of activity-based costing (ABC) and TOC.
