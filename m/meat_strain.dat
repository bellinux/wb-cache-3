Age and not growth rate appears to have a greater influence on serum T 3 concentrations in the slow- and fast-growing normal strains. Growth hormone levels were significantly higher in the dwarf chickens at all ages and in all three experiments. The heterozygous and homozygous broilers had similar GH levels and the slow-growing, genetically normal roasters had intermediate concentrations between the broiler and dwarf lines.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare growth performance and carcass characteristics of exotic <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> and indigenous chicken ecotypes under hot climate. A total of 105 Hybro, 105 Hubbard, 102 Bare- neck, 129 Large Baladi and 75 Betwil one old day chicks obtained from three consecutive hatches, were reared under CRD up to 8 week of age. Body weight feed intake and mortality were recorded at weekly intervals. Eviscerated carcass weights, carcass dressing percentage and carcass cuts as percentages of eviscerated carcass were also recorded. Chemical compositions and taste panel were conducted to evaluate the meat quality. The results showed significant differences (P< 0. 01) for growth rate and carcass traits between the exotic <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> and native chicken ecotypes from hatch up to 8 th weeks of age. A significant difference (P< 0. 01) was also found within the exotic <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> (Hybro and Hubbard) with Hybro being heavier at 3, 4, 5 and 7 weeks of ages whereas the Hubbard was heavier than Hybro at hatch. On the other hand significant differences (P< 0. 01) were found among native chicken ecotypes with Bare- neck being heavier than Large Baladi and Betwil native chicken ecotypes from hatch up to 8 weeks of age. Feed intake and feed conversion ratio were found to be significantly different (P< 0. 01) between the exotic <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> and native chicken ecotypes with the exotic strains consumed amount of feed three times that consumed by the native chicken ecotypes.

40|$|ABSTRACT Rice bran either raw or {{processed}} in an extrusion cooker at 130 C was fed to <b>meat</b> <b>strain</b> chickens for 25 days after hatch. Either full fat or hexane-extracted rice bran {{was placed in}} the diet at the equivalent of 60 % full fat bran. Raw full fat bran for one diet was stored at- 23 C until fed, whereas rice bran for all other diets was stored at 32 C. Four experiments were conducted at 6 -week intervals. Free fatty acid (FFA) content in oil from raw rice bran stored at the elevated temperature reached 81 % by the start of the final experiment whereas FFA in stabilized bran oil remained at about 3 %. Chickens fed stabilized rice bran made significantly greater gains than chickens fed raw bran diets. Feed efficiency was superior for chickens fed either full fat or extracted stabilized bran compared with full fat bran stored at either 32 or- 23 C. Feed conversion for extracted raw bran was intermediate between stabilized bran and full fat raw bran. Raw bran stored at 32 C (with elevated FFA content) tended to produce lower gains than the frozen raw bran. Analysis of the combined data from all four trials indicated that raw bran held at 32 C produced the lowest gains among all of the diets. (Key words: rice bran, chicken, nutrition, growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of elevated carcass temperature in combination with rapidly declining pH or with postrigor muscle on turkey breast meat quality. Two groups of twelve turkey carcasses with similar ultimate pH values were selected based on 15 min postmortem (PM) breast muscle pH (rapid-glycolyzing (RG), pH 6. 0). One side of each carcass was held near 40 °C and immersion chilling was delayed until 110 min PM (DC), while the other side was chilled at 20 min PM (IC). Raw breast meat quality was assessed using measurements of colour and protein extractability, while quality characteristics of cooked product were assessed using cook yield and torsion gelometry. The extractability and degradation of 10 specific proteins was monitored using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Additionally, holding postrigor turkey breast meat at 40 °C was evaluated as a model for mimicking changes due to rapid PM glycolysis. Sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein extractability was reduced for breast samples from RG and DC carcasses as well as for postrigor meat held at 40 °C (P < 0. 05). All colour values ('L*a*b*') increased for DC ground breast <b>meat.</b> <b>Strain</b> at fracture for breast meat gels was lower for RG samples. Both stress and strain at fracture and cook yield were reduced for DC breast meat gels. The reduction in meat quality measurements was additive for RG samples that were delay-chilled. Densitometry of Western blot analyses revealed that the extractability of glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, and M-protein was reduced for RG or DC samples. Increased myosin degradation was observed for samples from either RG or DC carcasses with up to 20 % of myosin degraded in RG/DC samples. Nebulin degradation was also more extensive in RG samples than for controls. Heating postrigor breast increased myosin degradation, however, differences in the banding pattern of myosin fragments compared to samples from RG carcasses were observed. These results provide conclusive evidence that rapid PM glycolysis and delayed chilling have detrimental effects on turkey breast meat quality. The association of postmortem protein degradation with meat of reduced quality merits further investigations into the relationship between postmortem proteolytic activity and meat quality...|$|E
40|$|Atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC) is {{considered}} to be an emerging enteropathogen that is more prevalent than typical EPEC in developing and developed countries. The major adherence factor, intimin, an outer membrane protein encoded by eae, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of aEPEC. This study investigated the distribution and polymorphisms of intimin subtypes of 143 aEPEC strains from diarrheal patients, healthy carriers, animals, and raw meats in China. These aEPEC strains belonged to more than 71 different serotypes, which comprised 52 O serogroups and 24 H types. Sixty-eight different eae genotypes and 19 intimin subtypes were detected. Eighteen, eight, seven, and five intimin subtypes were identified from 86 diarrheal patients, 14 healthy carriers, 19 animals, and 24 raw <b>meats</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively. Intimin β 1 was the most prevalent subtype in strains from diarrheal patients (34. 88 %) and animals (47. 37 %). There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of eae-β 1 between diarrheal patients and healthy carriers (P = 0. 004). Intimin-θ was more predominant among raw <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> (50 %) than among diarrheal patients strains (12. 79 %, P = 0. 0003), healthy carrier strains (7. 14 %, P = 0. 007), or animal strains (15. 79 %, P = 0. 020). The two predominant subtypes (eae-β 1 and eae-θ) had considerable polymorphisms with no significant differences among the four sources. PFGE analysis revealed 119 distinct patterns and the strains were clustered into 11 groups with similarity indices ranging from 63 % to 100 %. These results suggest that in China, aEPEC strains from different sources are highly heterogeneous.

40|$|The {{capability}} of five {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) to counteract the adhesion of Listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line HT 29 was studied. The highest adhesion ability to HT 29 was achieved by the intestinal strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus CTC 1679, followed by the meat-derived strains Lactobacillus sakei CTC 494 and Enterococcus faecium CTC 8005. Surprisingly, the <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> showed significantly better adhesion to HT 29 than two faecal isolates of Lactobacillus casei and even {{significantly higher than the}} reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. Additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture L. sakei CTC 494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of L. monocytogenes to HT 29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. The performance was better than the faecal isolate L. rhamnosus CTC 1679. Our results reinforce the fact that the ability of LAB to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. Additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food LAB behave better than intestinal ones. Therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. These strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible. © 2014 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Feed {{medication}} with monensin caused {{delays in}} development of immunity in two floor-pen experiments which simulated commercial broiler production. Development of immunity was retarded {{with the higher}} level of monensin (120 p. p. m.) but was progressively less delayed as the monensin level was decreased (100, 60 or 0 p. p. m.). Delay was greatest with Eimeria tenella, but also occured with intestinal species including E. acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. mivati, and E. necatrix. Drug withdrawal permitted earlier development of immunity. Plans involving use of monensin on layer replacements which later will be maintained on the floor without medication should consider: 1) prevalence of infective oocyst exposure in the area, 2) the lowest possible level of drug required for protection, and 3) its use for the shortest possible period of time. POULTRY SCIENCE 56 : 66 - 71, 1977 ALTHOUGH new preventive anticocci-dials are first introduced to protect <b>meat</b> <b>strains</b> of birds for short growing periods, the question inevitably arises as to effects the drug may have on development of immu-nity in layer or breeder replacements. Since any anticoccidial may affect cycling of the parasite, its use may retard development of flock immunity (Reid et al, 1960, 1968). Can monensin, which is now established as a broiler anticoccidial, provide protection for growing birds and yet permit immunity to develop before the drug is withdrawn or egg production is started? Callender and Shumard (1973) concluded that birds develop immunity earlier when lower levels of monensin (60 or 100 p. p. m.) were fed than with a higher level (120 p. p. m.). This immunity developed more rapidly as measured by severity of lesions after chal-lenge if flocks were exposed to "direct" litter-seeding than if by "indirect " exposure (terminology of Callender and Tonkinson, 1971).

A total of 505 one day old chicks were reared together using a Completely Randomized Design with 9 replicates for each genotype. Traits studied up to 8 weeks of age were body weight, feed intake, live weight gain, feed conversion ratio and mortality. Results revealed that there were significant differences (p< 0. 01) for body weight at various ages among the different genotypes. Body weights for the exotic strains at hatch, 4 and 8 weeks were in the range of 37. 85 ± 2. 23 - 39. 76 ± 3. 77, 497. 37 ± 101. 50 - 516. 25 ± 107. 95 g and 1230. 46 ± 258. 06 - 1269. 63 ± 242. 16 g respectively, whereas the corresponding results for the local ecotypes were 24. 68 ± 2. 60 - 27. 83 ± 4. 24, 109. 28 ± 25. 77 - 141. 53 ± 33. 75 g and 271. 90 ± 25. 18 - 341. 73 ± 63. 77 g. Average live weight gain during the first 4 weeks of age (starter stage) was significantly lower than that during the second 4 weeks (finisher stage) for both exotic strains and native ecotypes. Hybro strain exhibited the highest total live weight gain (1231. 78 g.) whereas Large Baladi ecotype was the lowest (247. 22). Feed intake and feed conversion ratio showed significant differences (p< 0. 01) between the exotic strains and the local ecotypes with the former consumed amount of feed three times that consumed by the latter and had better feed efficiency. Although the overall mortality and mortality during the first 4 weeks of age were higher among the local ecotypes than those of the exotics, the reverse was true during the second 4 weeks of age.

The eggs of the Heavy Meat hybrid turkeys, aged 32 weeks, showed a higher fertilization rate − 91. 92 %, higher early embryonic death rates: 1. 35 % up to the 3 rd day of incubation and 2. 02 % up to the 7 th day, vs. 0. 88 % (up to day 3) and 0. 88 % (up to day 7) in eggs laid by turkeys aged 44 weeks. The hatchability of placed and fertilized eggs was higher for eggs from younger layers (age of 32 weeks) compared to those laid by turkeys at the age of 44 weeks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSalmonella enterica {{subspecies}} enterica serovar Typhimurium {{is one of}} {{the common}} food pathogens which may cause human disease and/or animal infections. In an attempt to trace the clonal relationship and to discern the possible transmission of these strains from different origins, twenty-five Salmonella typhimurium strains isolated from retail <b>meats</b> and four <b>strains</b> isolated from food-poisoning cases were tested for antimicrobial resistance using the standard disk diffusion method. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to identify subtypes of these S. typhimurium strains. The results showed that in S. typhimurium high genetic similarity could exist. When plasmid profiles were combined with PFGE patterns, this combination further improves the discrimination of these strains. The strains of the same pattern combination may be the most epidemic strains which circulating between contaminated animal-derived meat and human. Transmission of these strains between different areas and origins might be possible...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{strains of}} Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni {{isolated}} from {{humans and animals}} grew at temperatures ranging from 34 to 45 degrees C and pH minima between 5. 7 and 5. 9. Only one strain grew at pH 5. 8 with lactic acid present at a concentration {{similar to that in}} <b>meat.</b> All <b>strains</b> had decimal reduction times of less than 1 min at 60 degrees C. Further examination of a typical strain showed that it grew at 37 degrees C on high-pH meat but not at 37 degrees C on normal-pH meat. Bacterial numbers on both high (6. 4) -pH and normal (5. 8) -pH inoculated meat declined at a similar rate when the meat was stored at 25 degrees C. At - 1 degree C, the rate of die-off was somewhat slower on normal-pH meat but was very much slower on high-pH meat. The initial fall in bacterial numbers that occurred when meat was frozen was also greater for normal-pH meat than for high-pH meat. The organism exhibited a long lag phase (1 to 2 days) when grown in cooked-meat medium at 37 degrees C and died in meat pies stored at 37 or 43 degrees C. Evaluation of the risk of Campylobacter contamination of red-meat carcasses to human health must take into account the limited potential of the organism to grow or even survive on fresh meats and in warm prepared foods...|$|R
40|$|Yeasts of the Yarrowia clade {{frequently}} {{occur in}} meat and milk products. In many cases they cause spoilage {{due to their}} strong lipolytic and proteolytic activity, {{and their ability to}} produce brown pigments. Using conventional methods, some of these yeasts can be misidentified as Yarrowia lipolytica, but using molecular biological methods it can be stated that they are members of a complex group including several different species. The aims of this study were to find a proper method to collect Yarrowia <b>strains</b> from raw <b>meat,</b> and to assign them to groups based on their physiological and molecular characteristics, followed by sequence-based identification of the selected members of each group to determine the composition of the species. This study revealed three novel Yarrowia species. From 62 samples of different raw <b>meats</b> 291 yeast <b>strains</b> were isolated, from which 118 strains proved to be members of the Yarrowia group. They could be assigned to seven species. Four of them are described species, three of them are novel ones...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus xylosus is a {{commensal}} species {{commonly found}} on the skin of mammals, but also currently used as starter culture for <b>meat</b> fermentation. Most <b>strains</b> of this species colonize by forming a biofilm on abiotic surfaces. We show here {{that the majority of}} S. xylosus strains also exhibit extensive colony spreading on the surface of soft agar media. This phenomenon seemed to be independent of biofilm-forming ability. It occurred in different culture media and was dependent on temperature. Formation of a giant S. xylosus colony did not involve a biosurfactant. Microscopic observation showed that the front of the giant colony comprised a single layer of spacing cells with more packed cells in the median area. Supplementation of the soft media with DNase I increased S. xylosus colony spreading, indicating that extracellular DNA may be involved in limiting the phenomenon. The ability of S. xylosus to spread on semi-solid surfaces may constitute an advantage for surface colonization...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} of poultry feeds with aflatoxins {{is a global}} problem responsible for considerable losses to poultry industry. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effects of aflatoxin B 1 and Mycotox NG, applied either independently or together, on performance, relative weights of visceral organs and antibody titres against Newcastle disease in turkey broilers. Experiments of 42 -day duration were carried out with sixty 7 -day-old female turkey broilers (<b>meat</b> TM <b>strain)</b> divided into one control and five treatment groups (n= 10) : Group І – control (fed standard feed according to the species and age of birds); Group II – experimental, whose feed was supplemented with 0. 5 g/kg Mycotox NG, Group ІІI – experimental, whose feed contained 0. 2 mg/kg aflatoxin В 1, Group IV – experimental, whose feed contained 0. 4 mg/kg aflatoxin В 1, Group V – experimental, supplemented with 0. 2 mg/kg aflatoxin В 1 and 0. 5 g/kg Mycotox NG and Group VI – experimental, supplemented with 0. 4 mg/kg aflatoxin В 1 and 0. 5 g/kg Mycotox NG. In Groups III and IV, production traits (live body weight, daily weight gain, feed intake) as well as antibody titres were reduced along with in-creased feed conversion and relative weights of liver, kidneys, heart, pancreas, proventriculus and gizzard. At the same time, relative weights of the spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius were statisti-cally significantly lower. The supplementation of the feed of Groups V and VI with 0. 5 g/kg Mycotox NG reduced and prevented some of deleterious effects of AFB 1 on production traits, antibody titres and relative weights of visceral organs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{atypical}} Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua strains {{have been detected}} in food and the environment. Because of mutations in the major virulence genes, these strains have different virulence intensities in eukaryotic cells. In this study, we performed phenotypic and genotypic characterization of atypical L. monocytogenes and L. innocua isolates obtained from swine slaughterhouses and <b>meat</b> markets. Forty <b>strains</b> were studied, including isolates of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua with low-hemolytic activity. The isolates were characterized using conventional phenotypic Listeria identification tests and by the detection and analysis of L. monocytogenes-specific genes. Analysis of 16 S[*]rRNA {{was used for the}} molecular identification of the Listeria species. The L. monocytogenes isolates were positive for all of the virulence genes studied. The atypical L. innocua strains were positive for hly, plcA, and inlC. Mutations in the InlC, InlB, InlA, PI-PLC, PC-PLC, and PrfA proteins were detected in the atypical isolates. Further in vitro and transcriptomic studies are being developed to confirm the role of these mutations in Listeria virulence...|$|R
