5|$|CAPS {{researchers}} are also collaborating with Virginia Tech {{on a project}} for the U.S. Office of Naval Research to evaluate the performance of an electrical impedance <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> (IMU) developed by Virginia Tech and to be shipped to CAPS for testing. The purpose of an IMU is to probe a power system for its impedance characteristics to establish criteria for stable operation of the system.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial <b>Measurement</b> <b>Unit</b> (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E

Usage of N⋅m is discouraged by the SI authority, since it can lead to confusion as to whether the quantity expressed in newton metres is a torque measurement, or a measurement of work.|$|E
25|$|The rover has an Inertial <b>Measurement</b> <b>Unit</b> (IMU) that {{provides}} 3-axis information on its position, {{which is used}} in rover navigation. The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature. Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover.|$|E

25|$|Development of the A-Darter {{started in}} 1995, however it {{suffered}} from inadequate funding and {{changes to the}} SAAF's requirements. Mectron, Avibras and Atech joined the program in 2006 after a three-year negotiation process with US$52million invested by the Brazilian Government in the project, estimated to be worth US$130million.

25|$|SRE-1 is a 555kg capsule. It {{comprises}} aero-thermo structure, internal structure, Mission Management Unit, Altitude {{sensors and}} Inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit,</b> S-band transponder with unique belt array antenna embedded to ATS, power and electronics packages to support deceleration and flotation system. It also houses two microgravity payloads. It has a sphere-cone-flare configuration with a spherical nose of about 0.5 m radius, base diameter of 2 m and 1.6 m height. The parachute, pyro devices, avionics packages of triggering unit and sequencer, telemetry and tracking system and sensors for measurement of system performance parameters are placed inside the SRE-1 capsule. Parachutes for SRE capsule {{were provided by}} ADRDE.|$|E
25|$|Before launch, {{testing of}} the {{assembled}} spacecraft uncovered a potential data corruption problem with an interface card {{that was designed to}} route MARDI image data as well as data from various other parts of the spacecraft. The potential problem could occur if the interface card were to receive a MARDI picture during a critical phase of the spacecraft's final descent, at which point data from the spacecraft's Inertial <b>Measurement</b> <b>Unit</b> could have been lost; this data was critical to controlling the descent and landing. This was judged to be an unacceptable risk, and it was decided to not use MARDI during the mission. As the flaw was discovered too late for repairs, the camera remained installed on Phoenix but it was not used to take pictures, nor was its built-in microphone used.|$|E

500|$|Because all IQ {{tests have}} error of {{measurement}} in the test-taker's IQ score, a test-giver should always inform the test-taker of the confidence interval around the score obtained on a given occasion of taking each test. IQ scores are ordinal scores and are not expressed in an interval <b>measurement</b> <b>unit.</b> Besides the inherent error band around any IQ test score because tests are a [...] "sample of learned behavior", IQ scores can also be misleading because test-givers fail to follow standardized administration and scoring procedures. In cases of test-giver mistakes, the usual result is that tests are scored too leniently, giving the test-taker a higher IQ score than the test-taker's performance justifies. Some test-givers err by showing a [...] "halo effect", with low-IQ individuals receiving IQ scores even lower than if standardized procedures were followed, while high-IQ individuals receive inflated IQ scores.|$|E
500|$|Movement by {{the astronauts}} was {{detected}} by the spacecraft's inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, {{or whether it was}} related to the fire. [...] The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the Operations and Checkout Building, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: [...] "How {{are we going to get}} to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" [...] The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.|$|E
500|$|When {{analyzing}} {{a weather}} map, a station model is plotted at each point of observation. Within the station model, the temperature, dewpoint, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather are plotted. The {{circle in the}} middle represents cloud cover; fraction it is filled in represents the degree of overcast. Outside the United States, temperature and dewpoint are plotted in degrees Celsius. The wind barb points in the direction from which the wind is coming. Each full flag on the wind barb represents [...] of wind, each half flag represents [...] When winds reach , a filled in triangle is used for each [...] of wind. In the United States, rainfall plotted {{in the corner of}} the station model are in [...] inches. The international standard rainfall <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> is the millimeter. Once a map has a field of station models plotted, the analyzing isobars (lines of equal pressure), isallobars (lines of equal pressure change), isotherms (lines of equal temperature), and isotachs (lines of equal wind speed) are drawn. The abstract weather symbols were devised to take up the least room possible on weather maps.|$|E

2500|$|An assay is {{an investigative}} (analytic) {{procedure}} in laboratory medicine, pharmacology, environmental biology and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity {{of a target}} entity (the analyte). [...] The analyte can be a drug, a biochemical substance, or a cell in an organism or organic sample. The measured entity is generally called the analyte, the measurand or {{the target of the}} assay. The assay usually aims to measure an intensive property of the analyte and express it in the relevant <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> (e.g. molarity, density, functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|Display: The glucose {{value in}} mg/dl or mmol/l is {{displayed}} on a digital display. The preferred <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> varies by country: mg/dl are preferred in the U.S., France, Japan, Israel, and India. mmol/l are used in Canada, Australia and China. Germany {{is the only country}} where medical professionals routinely operate in both units of measure. (To convert mmol/l to mg/dl, multiply by 18. To convert mg/dl to mmol/l, divide by 18.) Many meters can display either unit of measure; there have been a couple of published instances in which someone with diabetes has been misled into the wrong action by assuming that a reading in mmol/l was really a very low reading in mg/dl, or the converse. [...] In general, if a value is presented with a decimal point, it is in mmol/l, without a decimal it is most likely mg/dl.|$|E

2500|$|In {{inertial}} navigation, {{as applied}} to ships and submarines, {{a minimum of three}} gimbals are needed to allow an inertial navigation system (stable table) to remain fixed in inertial space, compensating for changes in the ship's yaw, pitch, and roll. In this application, the inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> (IMU) is equipped with three orthogonally mounted gyros to sense rotation about all axes in three-dimensional space. The gyro outputs are kept to a null through drive motors on each gimbal axis, to maintain the orientation of the IMU. To accomplish this, the gyro error signals are passed through [...] "resolvers" [...] mounted on the three gimbals, roll, pitch and yaw. These resolvers perform an automatic matrix transformation according to each gimbal angle, so that the required torques are delivered to the appropriate gimbal axis. The yaw torques must be resolved by roll and pitch transformations. The gimbal angle is never measured.|$|E
