40|$|The {{focus on}} process {{improvements}} in high performance lightweight structures is mainly located on thermoset material. Resin transfer moulding processes {{have been developed}} to decrease cost for high performance structures in competition to prepreg material. However, thermoplastic materials, such as CF/PEEK, CF/PEKK or CF/PPS, offer interesting opportunities despite the higher material cost compared to thermosets. This paper shows two examples using continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic material and the joining processes among themselves as well as to titanium in a hybrid structure design. Cost reduction is demonstrated using vacuum consolidation, special moulds and several welding techniques. The first example is a rudder from the vertical tail plane of a military aircraft. Several manufacturing steps including forming or shaping with flat plates, positioning stringers during vacuum consolidation, welding of ribs and welding of the central spar are shown. A cost statement is given analysing the overall manufacturing process. The second example shows the design study of a hybrid fan blade of an aero engine, made from titanium and CFRP part joined along an extended surface. The fan blade is a newly developed high performance blade to save weight and to increase the pressure ratio per compressor stage, so that one complete compressor stage is obsolete. A newly developed finite element model for combining titanium and CFRP is introduced and the special aspects of draping and consolidation in low cost moulds are shown. Future prospects are the integration of additional functions into the structure like lightning protection, bird impact improvement and combination of short fibre and continuous fibre material. Heated press processes during consolidating or welding are reducing cycle times. Some examples such as the <b>man</b> <b>hole</b> access cover, door frame or suspension arm in automotive application are shown with feasible process cycles. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project was to quantify the emission of VOCs during the transport of mineral oil products by means of rail tank cars. The aim was furthermore to develop appropriate measures {{on the basis of}} the results in order to reduce or avoid emissions. At present approximately 1. 2 thousand tons of VOC are annually emitted due to the railway transport of motor fuel. This corresponds to a share of about 1 / 40 of the total actual NMVOC-emissions from transport of motor fuel although in Germany approximately 1 / 3 of the transports are carried out by railway. Other mineral oil products are not relevant for VOC-emissions. A combination of several technical, organisational and logistic measures would enable to further reduce the actual emissions. The following measures for the mitigation and reduction of emissions would be possible: (1) Consequent implementation of the 'best practice'. (2) Improvement of the efficiency of the exhaust air cleaning during inside cleaning of rail tank cars. (3) Reduction of remaining liquid during emptying procedures. (4) Filling by means of bottom loading. (5) Furnishing of rail tank cars with overpressure deflation junction and corresponding adaptation of filling stations and modification of the top-loading procedure (connection to the overpressure deflation junction before opening of the <b>man</b> <b>hole</b> cover). (6) Improvement of the efficiency of the vapour recycling installation. The measures (1) and (2) are recommended on the basis of a technical-economic-ecologic evaluation. The measures (3) to (6) are only recommendable in specific single cases. There is no need for legislative action. (orig.)

50|$|The tunnels {{presented}} {{many potential}} threats: enemy soldiers <b>manned</b> <b>holes</b> {{on the sides}} of tunnels through which spears could be thrust, impaling a crawling intruder. Not only were there human enemies, but also dangerous creatures, such as snakes (including venomous ones, sometimes placed there as living booby traps), rats, spiders, scorpions and ants. Black-Bearded Tomb Bats (Taphozous melanopogon) and Lesser Dawn Bats (Eonycteris spelaea) also roosted in the tunnels, though they were a harmless nuisance if awakened. Often there were flooded U-bends in the tunnels to trap poison gas. Underground, gas could be a very deadly weapon, and a tunnel rat might choose to go into the tunnels wearing a gas mask as {{it would be impossible to}} put one on in a narrow tunnel. More often than not, however, a tunnel rat would take his chances without a gas mask, as wearing one made it even harder to see, hear and breathe in the narrow, dark tunnels.|$|R
