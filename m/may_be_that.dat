5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E

50|$|Under-capitalization {{refers to}} any {{situation}} where a business cannot acquire the funds they need. An under-capitalized business <b>may</b> <b>be</b> one <b>that</b> cannot afford current operational expenses {{due to a}} lack of capital, which can trigger bankruptcy, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> one <b>that</b> <b>is</b> over-exposed to risk, or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> one <b>that</b> <b>is</b> financially sound but does not have the funds required to expand to meet market demand.|$|R

50|$|There are {{at least}} three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and {{sensorimotor}} awareness, which <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you <b>may</b> <b>be</b> aware <b>that</b> you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness you <b>may</b> <b>be</b> aware <b>that</b> you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.

5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> manipulation can cause dissection, or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late {{distortion of the}} Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E

5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> his successes {{south of the}} river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa {{to gain control of}} Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not have control of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E

It may also be that {{in the mind}} of their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E

5|$|It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him as an ally of Cathal mac Finguine. The evidence for such involvement is limited. There {{is the presence of}} Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report the presence of a Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E

5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The reason <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Nothing more {{is known}} of Michael Bourtzes after that, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he died {{sometime}} around the autumn of 995.

This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.|$|E
