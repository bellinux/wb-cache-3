50|$|The Hubble {{classification}} of elliptical galaxies contains an integer that describes how elongated the galaxy image is.The classification {{is determined by}} the ratio of the major (a) to the <b>minor</b> (b) <b>axes</b> of the galaxy's isophotes:Thus for a spherical galaxy with a equal to b, the numberis 0, and the Hubble type is E0.

Hubble recognized that his shape classification depends both on the intrinsic shape of the galaxy, as well as the angle with which the galaxy is observed. Hence, some galaxies with Hubble type E0 are actually elongated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper elaborates a novel {{method to}} {{recognize}} persons using ear biometrics. We propose {{a method to}} index the ears using Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN). In order to obtain the invariant features, an ear has been considered as a planar surface of irregular shape. The shape based features like planar area, moment of inertia with respect to <b>minor</b> and major <b>axes,</b> and radii of gyration with respect to <b>minor</b> and major <b>axes</b> are considered. The indexing equation is generated using the weights, centroids and kernel function of the stabilized RBFN network. The so developed indexing equation was tested and validated. The analysis of the equation revealed 95. 4 % recognition accuracy. The retrieval rate of personal details became faster {{by an average of}} 13. 8 % when the database was organized as per the indices. Further, the three groups elicited by RBFNN were evaluated for parameters like entropy, precision, recall, specificity and F-measure. And all the parameters are found to be excellent in terms of their values and thus showcase the adequacy of the indexing model.

The lodes are parallel to a pre-mineralization dextral strike-slip shear-zone network, which is itself parallel in places {{to an early}} greenschist-facies cleavage in basement schists. The cleavage, shear zone and veins are all cut by dextral strike-slip faults. High Au grades correlate with areas of obliquity between the shear-zone fabrics and the cleavage, and plunge at approximately 40 ° SE in {{the plane of the}} lodes – coincident with <b>minor</b> fold <b>axes</b> related to a crenulation cleavage in the basement rocks. This clear structural history shows that gold mineralization was confined to a particular late structural event, but lode geometry was influenced by all previous structures, as well as being displaced by post-mineralization faulting. The north–south shortening recorded through most of the tectonic history can be related to Tertiary convergence along the major plate boundary located approximately 15 km north of the mine. However, mineralization occurred under a different tectonic regime from the current north–south convergence, when there was a change of tectonics between 9 and 6 Ma, possibly related to delamination...|$|R
