Some poutineries even boast dozens of variations of poutine. More upscale poutine with three-pepper sauce, <b>merguez</b> <b>sausage,</b> foie gras or even caviar and truffle can be found, a pre-Millennium trend that is credited to David MacMillan of 'Joe Beef' and 'Globe' restaurants fame. Some variations eliminate the cheese, but most Québécois would call such a dish a frite sauce ("french fries with sauce") rather than poutine. Shawinigan {{and some other}} regions have patate-sauce-choux where shredded raw cabbage replaces cheese. Fast food combination meals in Canada often have the options of getting french fries [...] "poutinized" [...] by adding cheese curds (or shredded cheese in the Prairies and Western Canada) and gravy, or subbing the fries for a poutine.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of organic acids on the shelf life and on the hygienic quality of <b>Merguez</b> <b>sausages</b> was studied. A commercial organic acid; Acetolac TM consisting of a mixture of sodium lactate (90 %) and sodium acetate (10 %) was added at different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 g kg - 1) to the butter mixture for sausage making. Microbiological enumerations (total aerobic count, coliforms, fecal streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and sulfite reducing clostridia) along with the pH and Total Volatile Basic nitrogen (TBV-N) were monitored during storage at refrigeration temperature (~ 8 °C) for 15 days. The {{results showed that the}} addition of organic acids reduced significantly (p TM. Thereafter, a significant (p S. aureus whose cfus remained practically constant. Concomitantly, the pH and TBV-N content have increased throughout the whole period of storage. As for the shelf life, control samples (without added Acetolac TM) were altered at day 5 of cold storage as judged by a sensory panel on the basis of perceivable sensory attributes. However, such perceivable alterations were delayed at least 5 days in samples treated Acetolac TM at levels ranging between 10 and 20 g kg - 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Merguez</b> is a <b>sausage</b> {{made with}} {{uncooked}} lamb, beef, or a mixture stuffed into a lamb-intestine casing. It is heavily spiced with cumin and chili pepper or harissa (which gives it its characteristic piquancy and red color) {{as well as}} other spices such as sumac, fennel, and garlic.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the fat content of fresh {{sausages}} (merguez), the effects of both reducing beef fat level (by konjac gel-KG) and incorporing olive oil (in a konjac matrix-OKM) on nutritional, quality characteristic and refrigerated storage stability were studied. Fat reductions in merguez sausages of between 53 and 76 % were achieved when beef fat was replaced with KG; the proportion reached 34 - 49 % using OKM as a beef fat replacer, where 23 to 36 % of total fat in the merguez was from olive oil. The merguez contained substantial amounts of some minerals (Mg and Fe). Sensory analysis revealed {{no significant differences between}} the control and the reformulated products, which had relatively low levels of lipid oxidation. Shelf life and biogenic amines of <b>merguez</b> <b>sausage</b> were not affected by formulation during refrigerated storage. Therefore, the use of konjac materials as fat replacers could reduce total caloric energy by replacing/reducing beef fat and improving sausage formulation to achieve healthier merguez products.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{nutritional}} values and stability during refrigerated storage of fresh beef <b>merguez</b> <b>sausage</b> as {{affected by a}} reformulation process which modified the fat content both by reducing fat (replacing beef fat with konjac gel) and incorporating olive oil (replacing beef fat with olive oil stabilized in a konjac matrix) and by reducing sodium content, replacing sodium chloride with a salt mixture (containing potassium chloride, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride). A preservative (sodium metabisulphite) was also used to extend the shelf-life of the product. The fat was reduced by 32 to 80 % and sodium by over 36 %. The reformulation did not negatively affect the sensory evaluation. Low microbiota growth rate and biogenic amines were attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} sodium metabisulphite. This preservative could be used in the reformulation to enhance safety and/or extend the shelf-life of this type of product. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
