5|$|After the North Korean {{infiltration}} on September 7 was repelled, the North Korean {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War. Her actions, in part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> defended than had been anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's {{wife died}} in 1826 after a {{protected}} illness; {{the couple had}} no children. Jennings was deeply saddened by her loss and began to drink liquor <b>more</b> <b>heavily.</b> Later that year he married Clarissa Barbee, but his drinking condition only worsened and he was frequently inebriated.|$|E

50|$|Bedhead's final LP, Transaction de Novo was {{recorded}} from May 2, 1997 to May 9, 1997, and engineered by Steve Albini. In {{a departure from}} their usual sound, Transaction De Novo featured <b>more</b> up-tempo, <b>heavily</b> distorted songs than its predecessors.|$|R
5|$|P. m. malaccensis, {{described}} by Alphonse Dubois in 1885, is found {{from the southern}} Himalayas east to Hainan and Indonesia. It is a dark race, like P. m. saturatus, but is smaller and <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> streaked on its upperparts.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marathon was a {{watershed}} in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten. It also highlighted {{the superiority of}} the <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> armoured Greek hoplites, and showed their potential when used wisely.|$|E
5|$|The West also {{suffered}} <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> from {{the instability of}} the 3rd century AD. This distinction between the established Hellenised East and the younger Latinised West persisted and became increasingly important in later centuries, leading to a gradual estrangement of the two worlds.|$|E
50|$|Gifford's work on cinema {{included}} both original research on cinema, such as The British Film Catalogue, 1895-1970 and British Animated Films, 1895-1985: a Filmography, which has considerable academic credibility, and <b>more</b> popular, <b>heavily</b> illustrated books, often on genre films, such as Movie Monsters.|$|R
50|$|Wallabies {{are widely}} {{distributed}} across Australia, particularly in <b>more</b> remote, <b>heavily</b> timbered, or rugged areas, less {{so on the}} great semi-arid plains that are better suited to the larger, leaner, and more fleet-footed kangaroos. They also {{can be found on}} the island of New Guinea.|$|R

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of the ten}} {{events is}} worth 1,000 points, for a {{possible}} 10,000-point individual total. Only the top two scores from the Honors, Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score. Until 2013, 60,000 was the maximum possible team score. In 2013, Super Quiz became a 10,000 point event that only counts for the team score, making the maximum possible team score 70,000. With the exception of math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted <b>more</b> <b>heavily,</b> with 35 questions worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively. Starting in 2013, the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions, each worth approximately 333.3 or 166.7 questions respectively. The written test was sometimes omitted {{at the state level}} even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay <b>more</b> <b>heavily.</b> Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near-perfect scores. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity). All tying participants are awarded medals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vulnerability}} of satellites to debris {{and the possibility}} of attacking LEO satellites to create debris clouds, has triggered speculation that it is possible for countries unable to make a precision attack [...] An attack on a satellite of 10 tonnes or <b>more</b> would <b>heavily</b> damage the LEO environment.|$|R

5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E
5|$|From 2013, Anarky {{began to}} be {{featured}} <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> in media adaptations of DC Comics properties, across multiple platforms. In July, a revamped version of Anarky was debuted as the primary antagonist in Beware the Batman, a Batman animated series produced by Warner Bros. Animation. In October, the character made his video game debut in , as a villain who threatens government and corporate institutions with destruction. Anarky made his live action debut in the Green Arrow television series Arrow in 2015, portrayed by Alexander Calvert, once again as a villain.|$|E
5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{lakes in}} Ontario, Stony Lake was created {{during and after}} the last ice age. The lake {{straddles}} the border between the Canadian Shield and the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Lowlands land forms. The lake is influenced both by the rugged granite of the Canadian Shield to the north, and by the <b>more</b> gentle, <b>heavily</b> forested Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Lowlands to the south.|$|R
5000|$|The Jews {{will always}} be {{grateful}} to it. What other great country has saved {{a million and a}} half Jews from Hitler's hands, and shared its last piece of bread? What country abolished antisemitism? What other country devoted at least a piece of land as an autonomous region for Jews who want to live there? All this, and <b>more,</b> weighs <b>heavily</b> on the scales of history.|$|R
60|$|Rachel and Grace {{united in}} sending Mary Morris, the other child; they really {{could do nothing}} <b>more,</b> so <b>heavily</b> had their means been drawn upon for the first expenses; but Rachel trusted to do more for the future, and {{resolved}} that her dress should henceforth cost no more than Alison Williams's; indeed, she went {{through a series of}} assertions by way of examining Alison on the expenses of her wardrobe.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1933 Amir was {{recalled}} to Langkat, {{where the}} Sultan informed him of two conditions {{which he had}} to fulfil to continue his studies: be a diligent student and abandon the independence movement. Despite the Sultan's disapproval, Amir became <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> involved in the nationalist movement, bringing him under increasing Dutch scrutiny. He continued to publish in Poedjangga Baroe, including a series of five articles on Eastern literatures from June to December 1934 and a translation of the Bhagavad Gita from 1933 to 1935. His legal studies, however, were delayed, and by 1937 he had still not graduated.|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E

5|$|Libia {{marked a}} major {{advancement}} over earlier designs, owing {{in large part}} {{due to the fact that}} the ship was originally ordered by the Ottoman Navy. Based on the British-built , the ship was to have been named Drama, but the Ottoman government failed to make payments so construction stopped, and she was seized after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War and completed for the Regia Marina. She was significantly larger, faster, and <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> armored than the other Italian protected cruisers, but she carried a weaker main battery.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> {{in the minds of the}} review panel.|$|E
5|$|SMS Kaiser Karl VI ("His Majesty's Ship Kaiser Karl VI") was {{the second}} of three armored cruisers built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was {{commissioned}} into the fleet. Kaiser Karl VI represented a significant improvement over the preceding designbeing faster and <b>more</b> <b>heavily</b> armed and armored. She {{provided the basis for}} the third design, , which featured further incremental improvements. Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Flash and Silverlight, Cinder is {{generally}} {{used in a}} non-browser environment.
