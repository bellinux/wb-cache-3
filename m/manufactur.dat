40|$|Knowledge {{has been}} {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} important resources that contribute to the competitive advantage of an organisation. Many firms have reached the conclusion that effective management (acquisition) of knowledge is the only way to leverage their core competencies and achieve competitive advantage. On the other hand, there is extensive literature which argues that leadership often exhibits high performance coupled with job satisfaction, organisational commitment and trust. This triggered intensive interest from both academia and practitioners in studying knowledge management and leadership effectiveness. Despite this interest, there is little empirical research to support the relationship between leadership and knowledge management. This is in part because in the dynamic nature of knowledge capture, dissemination, reward, and creation, leadership does not provide active means (supportive environment) that will advance knowledge acquisition. It 2 ̆ 7 s about creating a climate in which sharing knowledge is encouraged, or even demanded. Workers must understand why the organisation has turned to knowledge management and what payoff exists. In view of the increasing internationalisation and globalisation of many organisations this research started by asking; Which leadership style best supports knowledge management (acquisition) ? Which leadership style facilitates the management of knowledge? Does leadership have a clear understanding of the strategic role of knowledge management? The answer to these questions is one of the objectives of this paper. The research reported in this paper investigates the relationship between Knowledge Management and the newer leadership dimensions measured by the Manz and Sims 2 ̆ 7 s (1987) Self-Management Leadership Questionnaire (SMLQ). It also explores the relationship between Knowledge Management and the more established dimensions of Transformational and Transactional leadership style, Initiating Structure and ConSideration, as measured by Bass 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) Multi-factor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and Stogdill 2 ̆ 7 s (1963) Leadership Behaviour Description Questionnaire (LBDQ). Questionnaires containing items measuring the above leadership style dimensions and knowledge management were distributed to a large <b>manufactUring</b> organisation. These were subjected to a series of correlational and regression analyses. The analyses conducted produced mixed results: the leadership styles that are characterised by participative behaviour and mutual trust and respect for subordinates 2 ̆ 7 ideas and feelings are correlated stronger with knowledge acquisition when compared with the leadership styles that are characterised by task oriented and autocratic behaviour. Implied in this statement is the leadership style that folds Knowledge Management into the strategy set if the enterprise is to take advantage of the knowledge available in impacting effiCiency, effectiveness, productivity, and competitive position. Such leaders do not manage knowledge but they carry out their mission to effectively apply "and use knowledge from a variety of traditional positions located throughout the enterprise.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was: (1) To {{determine}} the relevant processing times for clinical practice. (2) To analyze the flow properties of several elastomeric impression materials depending on these clinically measured times by means of the modified sharkfin test. Methods and materials: (1) Clinical trial: The processing times of 86 clinical cases were measured by the same person. The impressions were taken by 14 different clinicians with the one-step technique (Impregum-Penta as regular body and Permadyne Garant 2 : 1 as light body). (2) Laboratory trial: On the basis of the clinical results, the sharkfin test was performed at the times of the 10 th and 90 th precentiles and the median value at 50 s, 26 s, and 81 s. 11 impression materials were tested: Regular materials (1. Aquasil Ultra Monophase. 2. Aquadyn Medium Soft Quick. 3. Aquadyn Medium Soft regular. 4. Aquadyn Medium Transfer. 5. Impregum Penta. 6. Impregum Penta Soft. 7. Impregum Penta Soft Quick. Light materials (1. Aquasil Ultra LV. 2. Aquadyn Light. 3. Impregum Garant L DuSoft. 4. Permadyne Garant 2 : 1). Two sizes of molds were used, 2 mm wide at the base for regular materials and 1 mm for light materials. The materials and the receptacle were brought to 23 °C and the entire assembled housing unit was brought to 35 °C to simulate the clinical conditions. Five experiments were made with each material and each of the three clinically measured times. Results and discussion: The experiments produced sharkfins and yielded flowcurves. The heights of the sharkfins were measured, and from the flowcurve data difference curves were made, in order to calculate the equilibrium points. Mean values, mean flow curves, and statistical analysis of all results at each clinically measured time were made. The longest clinically measured time (81 s) was regarded the most important one to characterize the flow properties. The results of every material at each time were compared to each other. Therefore, all the tested materials at all clinically measured times performed acceptable sharkfins. However, a very important point was significantly noticed, that Aquasil light and regular body gave very poor results compared to the other materials. At 81 seconds Aquasil Ultra Monophase was barely sufficient). The light materials showed better flow properties than regular materials. The materials of polyether base show such a high ability of flowing independent of the temperature of the entire assembled unit which was adapted to the mouth temperature. The impregum-P-S-Q showed superior flow property, in addition to a reasonable sharkfin. According to the <b>manufactur’s</b> recommended working time (60 seconds), Impregum-P-S-Q was not supposed to give good results at 81 seconds. This study showed that the new materials on silicon base have a similar behavior like polyether concerning the flow properties.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{endurance}} testing for rescue and safety robotics. Endurance testing {{is a form of}} acceptance testing that verifies whether the robot can operate correctly over the intended period of operation. A six-hour endurance test was developed for the commercially available ASR micro-VGTV Extreme rescue robot. The test uncovered failures consistent with those previously encountered in the field but under conditions that captured the source of the failures. In addition, the data captured identified subtle design and manufacturing issues. Based on these results, this paper proposes that endurance testing become an additional requirement for standards for rescue and safety robotics and that developers adopt endurance testing as a general design and <b>manufactur</b> ing d iagnost ic method. Spec i f ic recommendations on endurance testing are presented. I...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{positive}} influence of two selected extremely halophilic archaea strains {{in the production}} of salted anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus, L., 1758) was highlighted. Methods and Results: Anchovies produced with salt artificially contaminated with halophiles exhibited lower loads of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria, and a reduced content of histamine as well as an improved organoleptic acceptance. Conclusions: The findings of this survey are expected to enhance the safety of salted anchovies, with regard to the histamine formation during ripening, and to improve the sensory attributes of this product. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study represents the first report on the {{positive influence}} of halophilic archaea in traditional salted anchovies production, thus suggesting new perspectives about a conscious employment of properly selected haloarchaea strains in this traditional <b>manufactur...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse the re-use of dam silt as a {{supplementary}} binder for self-compacting concrete (SCC). When burnt, silt becomes more reactive because the kaolin it contains is converted into metakaolin. Portland cement, calcined or burnt silt and ground granulated {{blast furnace slag}} were used in this research. Cement pastes were prepared with blends containing {{two or three of}} these materials. The replacement ratio for burnt silt in both cases was 10 % and 20 % by cement weight and the ratio for the slag was a constant 30 % by weight of the blend. Rheological and zeta potential tests were conducted to evaluate paste electrokinetics and rheological behaviour. The findings showed that burnt silt is apt for use as an addition to cement for SCC <b>manufactur...</b>|$|E
