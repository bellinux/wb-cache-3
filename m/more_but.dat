5|$|Cardiff City is yet {{to return}} to the FA Charity Shield, which was renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. However, between 2001 and 2006, the match was held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. The closest Cardiff City has come so far to {{returning}} to the match was in 2008 when they reached the FA Cup Final once <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> lost by a goal to nil against Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Despite Queen's Park {{entering}} the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers {{who won the}} game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during play, and the referee later {{said that they had}} scored once <b>more</b> <b>but</b> as the players did not attempt to claim it, he had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were {{at the center of a}} broad regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of Clisby's {{total number}} of {{victories}} in his short career range from nine to twenty or <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> the most common—and official—score attributed to him is sixteen. The loss {{of much of the}} RAF's documentation in the chaotic retreat through France and across the English Channel in May 1940 meant that many squadron records and combat claims had to be reconstructed from the memory of surviving personnel. Even the date of Clisby's death is unclear, some sources (including the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) claiming 14May rather than the following day. Regardless of the exact date, he was the first RAF ace of the war to be lost in action. Clisby was buried in the military cemetery at Choloy in north-eastern France. His name appears on Supplementary Panel12 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to serve as High Commissioner in London when his term expired in 1921, but Hughes did not permit it. Upon his return to Australia, there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> he {{was not interested in}} doing so. In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park, Hampstead, for the remainder of his life. In his final years, Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia, such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name. He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter against Navy, Scarbath scored on a quarterback keeper. Before the half, he {{completed}} passes to ends Stan Karnash and Pete Augsburger for 44- and 59-yard touchdowns. In the third quarter, the Midshipmen responded with a score of their own. In the final period, Maryland end Elmer Wingate returned an interception 34 yards for another touchdown. Then, 54 seconds later, end Lew Weidensaul recovered a Midshipmen fumble, which allowed Ed Modzelewski to rush five yards for the final score by the Terrapins. Navy scored twice <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> Maryland held on to win, 35–21.|$|E
5|$|Marshal's sons {{inherited}} the castle after their father's death; Marshal left the castle to his eldest son, William, {{who in turn}} gave it to his younger brother, Walter. After William's death, however, Marshal's second son, Richard, took over the castle. Richard led the baronial opposition to Henry III and allied himself with the Welsh, resulting in King Henry besieging Goodrich Castle in 1233 and retaking personal control for a period. Walter was eventually given Goodrich back once <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> died shortly afterwards in 1245.|$|E

5|$|On 10 November the 57th Independent Battalion {{advanced}} {{against the}} TO in Veliki Miletinac (east {{of the area}} captured in Operation Swath-10), capturing the village the same day. The neighbouring Mali Miletinac was captured by the HV the following day, and on 12 November the HV captured the villages of Bastajski Brđani and Rekići. Two days later the TO counterattacked, killing nine HV troops and wounding about ten <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> the HV defence held. Another effort to recapture Bastajski Brđani {{was made by the}} TO, reinforced with 50 paramilitary White Eagles. It failed (despite being well prepared and supported by artillery) because the defending HV force was alerted by signals intelligence of the attack and reinforced. The White Eagles lost 46 killed in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> many of the top drivers elected not {{to go out on}} a second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted <b>more</b> <b>but</b> smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E

5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and {{at no point}} were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes {{to go in the}} final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she {{extended}} her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} factor {{is affected by}} several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's swept area. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost <b>more</b> <b>but</b> generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} system {{developed on}} February28 in the Australian region south of February28, and moved westward. On March7, the JTWC initiated advisories {{on the system}} as Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65km/h (40mph) the next day. Soon after, the system weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward along {{the northern edge of}} a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March16. That day, it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed to develop <b>more,</b> <b>but</b> after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March16, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.|$|E
