25|$|After Cowherd's {{death in}} 1881 which {{resulted}} in the closure of his Brantford factory, a mechanical production department was created within the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and production of Canadian telephones and telephone equipment was transferred to Montreal in 1882, due to restrictions on importing telephone equipment from the United States. In addition to phones, four years later, the department started manufacturing its first switchboard, a 50 line Standard Magneto Switchboard. The small <b>manufacturing</b> <b>department</b> expanded yearly with the growth and popularity of the telephone to 50 employees in 1888. By 1890 it had been transformed into its own branch of operations with 200 employees, and a new factory was under construction.|$|E

40|$|MBA - WBSThe project {{research}} {{investigated the}} inhibitors and facilitators {{of the relationship}} that exists among the marketing and the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>departments</b> in a South African manufacturing company. The increase in volume of sales due to the construction boom in local markets combined with the expansion of overseas markets, {{as well as a}} significant increase in customer demand for ‘made-toorder’ products, has placed unprecedented demand on the manufacturing and logistics functions. More importantly, the already strained relationship between manufacturing and marketing had deteriorated further, requiring some form of intervention. Functional objectives and priorities differed among the divisions and were the cause of conflicts. The aim of the research was to identify opportunities to enhance the relationship between the marketing and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>departments.</b> The research was qualitative in nature and was conducted among a sample population from marketing, manufacturing and senior management using a structured questionnaire. The results were consolidated and analysed to determine the factors. The main findings of the research were that while good communication and personal relationships contributed {{to the success of the}} relationship between marketing and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>departments,</b> the lack of common objectives and understanding of each other’s objectives, forecast accuracy and stock policies were the key factors affecting the relationship negatively. One of the key proposals presented by the participants was the need for improvements of the communication factors, although it transpired that the main factors inhibiting the relationship between marketing and manufacturing were of a structural and process nature. Improvements on the definition of aligned objectives and improvements on the level of personal relationship were also high on the list of suggestions. Recommendations based on the information gathered were offered with a view to ameliorate the relationship between marketing and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>departments</b> and hence reduce the potential for conflict and simultaneously improve the effectiveness of the organisation...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the 1930s Britain's {{ordnance}} {{manufacturing capability}} had been concentrated within the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. In {{the late nineteenth}} century the term 'Royal Ordnance Factories' began to be used collectively of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>departments</b> of the Arsenal (principally the Royal Laboratory, Royal Gun Factory and Royal Carriage Works) which, though they shared the same site, operated independently of one another. This use of the term is seen {{in the name of the}} Royal Ordnance Factories Football Club (founded 1893) and it continued through the First World War.
