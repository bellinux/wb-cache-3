25|$|As PMCs {{begin to}} undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the lamina which binds them dissolves {{to begin the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> of the cells. Expression of the {{membrane}} protein that binds laminin, integrin, also becomes irregular {{at the beginning of}} ingression. The microvilli which secure PMCs to the hyaline layer shorten, as the cells reduce their affinity for the extraembryonic matrix. These cells concurrently increase their affinity for other components of the basal matrix, such as fibronectin, in part driving the movement of cells inward. The apical junctions which bind PMCs to their neighboring epithelial cells become disrupted during this transition, and are absent in cells that have fully ingressed into the blastocoel. Because staining for cadherins and catenins in ingressing cells decreases and develops as intracellular accumulations, apical junctions are thought to be cleared by endocytosis during ingression.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aid versus a finger tab must be {{accounted}} for in a compound bow's tuning and sighting, as well as {{choice of a}}rrow rest, as finger-released arrows will group in a different spot when using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aid versus a finger tab. Likewise, the choice of arrow rest for a compound bow depends on whether a finger release archery tab or <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aid is used. For a finger-released arrow, a plunger pin is most commonly used as the arrow rest, to impart a tuned impulse laterally to the arrow {{at the moment of}} release to improve point-of-impact groupings. In contrast, for a release aid configuration, a Whisker-biscuit arrow rest is very commonly used with a compound bow.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> {{permits a}} {{single point of contact}} on the string instead of three fingers as most {{commonly}} used with finger tabs. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release. This is primarily because the most successful types operate with positive pressure, whereas the conventional 'fingers' release is negative pressure. Some archers prefer three fingers under the arrow with a finger tab, whereas the split-finger approach, having one finger above the arrow and two fingers below the arrow is the most commonly used finger shooting method amongst English and modern North American archers, who do not use <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aids.|$|E

50|$|In {{the past}} 25 years, {{with the advent}} of the {{compound}} bow, <b>mechanical</b> <b>releases</b> have become popular. The mechanism is usually attached to the wrist; it holds the string, and releases it when triggered. They offer a cleaner release and require no finger strength. However, finger releases must be used for bows other than compounds in most tournaments (including the International Archery Federation) and thus are still widely used.|$|R

We use scaling relations to estimate the <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>released</b> by 16 radio-active galactic nuclei located inside X-raydetected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field. By comparing this energy output to the host groups’ gravitational binding energy,we find that radio galaxies produce sufficient energy to unbind a significant fraction of the intragroup medium. This unbinding effect is negligible in massive galaxy clusters with deeper potential wells. Our results correctly reproduce the breaking of self-similarity observed in the scaling relation between entropy and temperature for galaxy groups...|$|R
50|$|In archery, {{a release}} aid, <b>mechanical</b> <b>release,</b> or release is {{a device that}} helps to fire arrows more precisely, by using a trigger to release the bowstring, rather than the archer's fingers. It is {{used to make the}} release of the bowstring quicker and {{reducing}} the amount of torque put onto the bowstring from the archer's fingers.|$|E
50|$|The arrow is {{typically}} released by relaxing {{the fingers of}} the drawing hand (see Bow draw), or triggering the <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also {{pay attention to the}} recoil or follow through of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> {{retains the}} string by a gate or loop of cord. The gate or cord is {{released}} by {{operation of the}} trigger, allowing the string to push open the gate or cord. Consequently, any sideways movement of the string, and hence arrow nock, {{is likely to be}} less than if fingers were used, although, if a consistent finger tab release is performed, the differences are often negligible in terms of practical hunting accuracy at ranges up to 30 yards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Transfer is the {{critical}} issue of producing high-quality and scalable graphene electronic devices. However, conventional transfer processes require the removal of an underlying metal layer by wet etching process, which induces significant economic and environmental problems. We propose the etching-free <b>mechanical</b> <b>releasing</b> of graphene using polymer adhesives. A fracture mechanics approach was introduced to understand the releasing mechanism and ensure high-yield process. It is shown that the thickness of adhesive and target substrate affect the transferability of graphene. Based on experimental and fracture mechanics simulation results, we further observed that compliant adhesives can reduce the adhesive stress during the transfer, which also enhances the success probability of graphene transfer...|$|R

5000|$|Compound archers {{often use}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aid {{to hold and}} release the string. (This is mostly used on Compound Bows.) This {{attaches}} to the bowstring near {{the point where the}} arrow attaches, the nocking point, and permits the archer to release the string with a squeeze of a trigger or a slight increase of tension. The use of a release aid gives a more consistent release than the use of fingers on the string as it minimises the arrow oscillation which is inevitable when the bowstring is released directly from the fingers.|$|E
50|$|The bowstring {{and arrow}} are held with three fingers, {{or with a}} {{mechanical}} arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. Instinctive shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in {{the first or second}} joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.|$|E

50|$|Nikon {{abandoned}} the earlier mechanically operated shutter of the F2 for a modern, electronically controlled, horizontally traveled metal curtain design. The new shutter {{proved to be}} equally reliable and less maintenance-intensive overall, though the decision to retain the horizontal-travel design significantly limited its top flash sync speed (1/80 sec.) compared to other Nikons, some of which used the Copal shutter. This decision forced many disappointed press photographers to use Nikon's semi pro bodies (FM, FE, FM2, FE2 etc.) instead when higher sync speeds were needed, usually for fill flash in daylight situations. The F4 finally solved this sync speed deficiency with Nikon's pro grade SLR offerings with its 250th sync. In contrast to the manually operated F2, the F3's electronic shutter required battery power to operate, although the camera included a small backup <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> lever that tripped the shutter at 1/60 sec.|$|E
50|$|The AN/MSQ-77 control {{algorithm}} continually commanded the A/C so the BTG simulated bomb impact point, which was plotted {{separately from the}} A/C track, would move toward the target.

Instead of releasing from the A/C position corresponding to the nearest predicted impact point, the AN/MSQ-77 began the bomb release sequence just prior, which accounted for the delay in generating the radio command, in transmitting the command, and in the A/C effecting the <b>mechanical</b> <b>release.</b> The delay time was based on calibration testing of the AN/MSQ-77 with A/C bomb release circuity (e.g., mean bomb release time for salvo drops from B-52s).|$|E

5000|$|Single-position lap bars {{on wooden}} roller {{coasters}} are {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "buzz bars," [...] a slang term named for the buzzing sound that some bars make as they lock or release. The term can be misleading as the buzzing sound only occurs on Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) trains when the solenoid that releases the bar is out of alignment. There are other train types, such as NAD and even some PTC trains, that feature a single-position lap bar that has a <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> and therefore does not produce a buzzing sound. Most parks have switched to individual ratcheting lap bars, similar to the lap bars found on steel coasters. Ironically some of the earlier ratcheting lap bar conversions use a solenoid release and can also produce a buzzing sound. It can be argued that single-position buzz bars give more air time on roller coasters, as ratcheting lap bars tend to lock further during the ride in many installations.|$|E
50|$|In this setup, {{the most}} common, the speargun is {{attached}} to the shaft by a line. The line is usually a heavy monofilament (300-400 lb test), spectra, or other spectra-like material (braided line) with 400-600+lb rating. The line wraps around the bottom or side of the gun upon loading and releases via a <b>mechanical</b> <b>release</b> or tension release to allow the line to travel with the spear after firing. There are typically two different methods of connecting the line to the spear shaft, either a slide ring that travels up and down the shaft to machined stopping points or via a hole drilled through some portion of the shaft (usually the rear). This is the most common method for taking fish by speargun and the majority of the other types of setups use the mentioned connection options to the shaft. Some newer setups offer an option to quickly attach line to, or disconnect from, a shaft making for a line or free shaft option on a single speargun.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the time-scale invariant changes in electromagnetic and <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>releases</b> {{prior to a}} rock failure or a large earthquake.

Irreversible thermodynamics applied to the damage mechanics reveals that the damage evolution produces the variations in charge, dipole and electromagnetic signals in addition to <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>release,</b> and yields the time-scale invariant patterns of Benioff electromagnetic radiation and cumulative Benioff strain-release.

MethodsThe native starches were modified by acetylation and pregelatinization. The tablets were assessed using friability (Fr), crushing strength (Cs), disintegration time (Dt) and dissolution parameters. ResultsStarch acetylation produced paracetamol tablets that were stronger and had the best balance of mechanical and disintegration properties, while pregelatinization produced tablets that were more friable but had a better overall strength in relation to disintegration than formulations made from natural starches. Correlations mainly existed between Dt and the dissolution parameters t 80, t 2 and k 1 in the formulations. ConclusionsModification of the experimental starches improved the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>release</b> properties of directly compressed paracetamol tablet formulations.
