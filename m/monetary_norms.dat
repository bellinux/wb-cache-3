The effectiveness of a certain compensation strategy (e. g., repaying money, sharing loss, etc.) may vary {{as a function of the}} social norm/relationship. Previous studies have shown that two types of norms (or relationships), monetary/exchange and social/communal, differentially characterize people’s appraisal of and response to social exchanges. In this study, we investigated how individual differences in preference for these norms affect individuals’ perception of others’ as well as the selection of their own reciprocal behaviors. In a two-phase experiment with interpersonal transgression, we asked the participant to perform a dot-estimation task with two partners who occasionally and unintentionally inflict noise stimulation upon the participant (first phase). As compensation one partner give money to the participant 80 % of the time (the monetary partner) and the other bear the noise for the participant 80 % of the time (the social partner). Results showed that the individuals’ preference for compensation (repaying money versus bearing harm) affected their relationship (exchange versus communal) with the partners adopting different compensation strategies: participants tended to form communal relationships and felt closer to the partner whose compensation strategy matched their own preference. The participants could be differentiated into a social group, who tended to form communal relationship with the social partner, and a monetary group, who tended to form communal relationship with the monetary partner. In the second phase of the experiment, when the participants became transgressors and were asked to compensate for their transgression with money, the social group offered more compensation to the social partners than to the monetary partners, while the monetary group compensated less than the social group in general and showed no difference in their offers to the monetary and social partners. These findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of compensation varies as a function of individuals’ preference for communal versus <b>monetary</b> <b>norm</b> and that <b>monetary</b> compensation alone does not heal all wounds...|$|R

These autonomous vehicles have private goals they want to achieve, which might conﬂict {{with the goals of}} the traﬃc system designers. To ensure that the goals of the system are met, the vehicle behavior needs to be inﬂuenced. Since the vehicles are autonomous, their behavior cannot be controlled di- rectly. One way of inﬂuencing behavior indirectly is through norms. A norm is a violable rule that describes correct behavior. Vehicles who do not com- ply with the norm may receive a sanction, such as a <b>monetary</b> ﬁne. The <b>norms</b> are issued to the vehicles by traﬃc control systems, which monitor the vehicles and sanction them when norm violations are detected. In this thesis, we present a formal model and a corresponding imple- mentation for a norm-based multi-agent system for traﬃc. We created a formal model of vehicles, traﬃc regulations and traﬃc controllers and im- plemented this in an extension of a state-of-the-art traﬃc simulator named SUMO. The features of this extension are presented in several demonstrative experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} an early 20 th century central banker, {{had he been}} alive {{at the turn of}} the 21 st century, would have {{predicted}} the 2007 - 08 crisis and its severity. This paper is Part II of a series which contends that early 20 th century banking theory is a valuable framework for understanding the relationship between banks, financial markets, and the central bank. This paper builds on Part I which explained that because a social norm supports the circulation of bank deposits as money, deposits are a network good and this makes possible monetary finance, or the expansion of the money supply as a source of funds for banks to lend. This paper first analyses the British model of monetary finance, the structured interaction of banks, the money market, and the central bank that formed its core, and the means by which this structure made possible the origination of safe, privately-issued assets. Then, the analysis turns to the macroeconomic implications of monetary finance: in order to protect the <b>monetary</b> social <b>norm,</b> both financial instability and inflation must be avoided. The real bills principle addressed the former by proscribing monetary finance of long-term assets and the latter by requiring careful monitoring and control of the growth of money market instruments that were not real bills. Thus, the modern integration of money and capital markets is seen through traditional banking theory to be a recipe for financial instability, because it undermines the ability of banks and the money market to be joined together in the production of safe, privately-issued assets. This theory indicates that restabilizing the financial system will require structural reform and that only after such reform has been implemented can we expect macro-prudential regulation to succeed...|$|R

Although point-of-use sand filters provide an effective technical solution for mitigating arsenic exposure, the actual reduction in health risk also depends on psychological factors that influence behaviors related to this device. For example, acquiring a sand filter must be preferred to competing options for investing effort and money and, once installed, the users must regularly maintain the filters. These key behaviors of sustainable use are related to psychological factors, such as problem awareness, benefits and costs, social and affective influences, {{and the perception of}} practical difficulties. This study investigated the sustainable use of arsenic-removing sand filters in Vietnam. Based on questionnaire surveys, data were gathered in 319 rural households and analyzed with regression models. Psychological factors explained significant variance in the investigated key behaviors. Significant factors included perceived improvements in water healthiness and taste, <b>monetary</b> costs, social <b>norms,</b> and affective influences. In questions with open answers, interviewees mentioned various practical problems, particularly those related to the inflexibility of the device and the effort of changing the sand. Interestingly, many interviewees operate the sand filters for removing iron from the water but are unaware of problems with arsenic...|$|R

First, law's addressees consider their potential legal liability in case they don't abide the <b>norm.</b> <b>Monetary</b> sanctions, incentives and other deterrence measures are essential. Second, the morally persuasive role that is inherent to law, `it's the right thing to do'. Sometimes the `threat' of punishment is not the main reason for conformity, and non-pecuniary considerations must be taken into account. Individuals belong to communities, and share general respect for a system of values and norms. Norms are seen as a re ection of the set of behaviors that are desirable or legitimate in the shared view of society, and whose violation elicits at least informal disapproval. This socio-cultural aspect of law has deep implications in terms of policy: instilling a norm in countries where it currently does not prevail nor is culturally accepted may be a daunting task. This leads us to the third aspect of normative behavior proposed in this manuscript: the procedural aspect. Once the norm is established and the efficacy of its deterrence methods evaluated, authorities must find an adequate way to deal with cases of possible liability resulting from non-compliance. In order to disentangle the real nature and dynamics of normativity, the first issue requires finding the proper way to study the development of such phenomena: is it a spontaneous process over which individuals have little control, and which depends on psycho-cognitive human characteristics, or is it a more complex phenomenon? My suggestion is that it should be con- ceived within a social learning approach, emphasizing the cognitive out- comes of cultural learning. Furthermore, I believe that an interdisciplinary approach to the issue, mainly based on theories of social and customary norms and agent-based modeling, could offer fresh new insights...|$|R
