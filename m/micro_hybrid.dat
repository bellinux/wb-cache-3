To extract the maximum available power from PV panels and wind turbines, Maximum power point Tracker (MPPT) has been included. This MPPT uses the “Standard Perturbs and Observe” technique. By using PQ Theory with ANN Controller, the Reference currents are generated which are to be injected by Shunt active power filter (SAPF) to compensate the current harmonics in the non linear load.

50|$|GM {{launched}} a hybrid {{version of the}} Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of <b>micro</b> <b>hybrid</b> design. The electric motor housed within the transmission flywheel housing, serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck {{comes to a stop}} and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12 V valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{bidirectional}} switched boost converter is proposed. Conventional Z-source converter (ZSC) requires two inductors and two capacitors of equal inductance and capacitance which {{is difficult to}} realize in practice.

But power flow is limited to one direction in case of SBC. In AC-DC <b>hybrid</b> <b>micro</b> grid and in some energy storage applications bidirectional power flow is the most essential requirement. Proposed bidirectional switched boost converter (BSBC) retains the advantage of SBC and provides additional advantage of bidirectional power flow which makes it more suitable for AC-DC <b>hybrid</b> <b>micro</b> grid. Unaltered voltage gain is achieved at the AC bus and DC bus in both the directions of power flow. The Matlab simulation results are shown to verify the operation and theoretical analysis of proposed BSBC converte...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>micro</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{propulsion}} (MHP) {{systems are}} recognized as a feasible solution for off-highway construction machines (OHCMs), {{there is still a}} lack of understanding how existing MHP technologies can be transferred effectively from the automotive sector to the construction sector. To fill this gap, this paper is the first of a two-part study which focuses on <b>micro</b> <b>hybrid</b> construction machines paying attention to a novel idle-stop-start control (ISSC) strategy. Part A presents the system concepts and design procedure while Part B studies on a hardware-in-the-loop test platform for a comprehensive analysis on the potential fuel/emission saving of the proposed system in real-time. In this study—Part A—different types of OHCMs are briefly discussed to identify the target machine. The procedure to model the machine powertrain is also concisely introduced. Next, to minimize the fuel consumption and emissions without degrading the machine performance, a prediction-based idle-stop-start control (PISSC) approach is properly designed. The core of the PISSC is to estimate online the future engine working state changes in order to directly shut down the engine or shift it to low power regions during idle periods. Numerical simulations have been carried out to validate the potential of the proposed PISSC method. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>micro</b> {{machine tools}} are {{increasingly}} {{in demand for}} manufacturing microproducts made of hard-to-machine materials, such as ceramic air bearing, bio-implants and power electronics substrates etc. These machines can realize hybrid machining processes which combine one or two non-conventional machining techniques such as EDM, ECM, laser machining, etc. and conventional machining techniques such as turning, grinding, milling on one machine bed. Hybrid machine tool developers tend to mix and match components from multiple vendors for the best value and performance.
