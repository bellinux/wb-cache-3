Ross {{said that he would}} be interested in a <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> such as J.Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for floatation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E

50|$|An {{independent}} pharmacy is {{a retail}} pharmacy {{that is not}} directly affiliated with any chain of pharmacies and is not owned (or operated) by a publicly traded company. Independent pharmacies are pharmacist-owned, privately held businesses in varying practice settings. They include single-store operations, pharmacist-owned <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> locations, franchise, compounding, long-term care (LTC), specialty, and supermarket pharmacy operation. Independent pharmacy owners generally have high standards of customer service and strive to outperform chain pharmacy competitors.|$|E
50|$|Planograms {{are mostly}} used in retail. A planogram defines where {{and in what}} {{quantity}} products are placed on a shelving unit. The rules and theories {{for the creation of}} a planogram are set under the terms of merchandising. Manufacturers often send planograms to stores ahead of new products. This is useful when a retailer wants <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> displays to have the same look and feel. Often, a consumer-packaged goods manufacturer will release a new suggested planogram with their new product to show how the product relates to existing products.|$|E

5000|$|Both the Communal Dining Building and Monumental Civic Building were {{supplied}} by adjacent service complexes, comprising <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> rooms (with food provisions stored in decorated pithoi) and kitchens equipped with large stone-lined hearths. The Service Building of the Monumental Civic Building also contained a well-preserved olive press facility—the earliest documented lever-and-weights press, or beam press, in the post-Bronze Age Aegean. Although an Archaic beam {{press has been}} reported from excavations at the Greek city of Klazomenai, the evidence for olive pressing at Azoria includes a press bench, press beds, sockets for wooden beams, a press weight, roller-crusher and mortar block, a collection basin, a small trapetum mortarium, a hearth and cooking stand, oil-separation vessels, and quantities of press cake (crushed olive pits, collected after grinding and pressing for use as fuel for hearths).|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} release options of a rack a pilot can select release mode for {{releasing}} one or multiple stores. Stores can be jettisoned selectively in single mode or ripple mode or salvo mode. The term ripple {{applies to the}} single- or ripple and single- continuous release mode from one or from mirror stations. Salvo release mode applies {{to a combination of}} several stations together e.g. adjacent stations. For <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> release an interval timer can be set to release stores in fixed time steps. For an external store emergency release there is for example a panic button in the F-4 Phantom II, a feature found on all naval aircraft in case an engine or catapult fails during launch; in such cases, a pilot can press the [...] "panic button", and jettison all stores, reducing weight and hopefully allowing the aircraft to avoid hitting the sea, and to climb away to decide on further action. Land-based aircraft often have a similar feature, for similar reasons, although the situation is generally not quite as critical as a failure during a catapult launch.|$|E
50|$|The more traditional, fixed bomb rack, a {{conventional}} bomb rack {{like that of}} the B-52 would have mounted stores in vertical columns making individual store selection and release impossible without releasing all stores ahead in the column line. The advantage of {{a conventional}} bomb rack is a prompt release of all stores in short order.Bombers like the B-52, the B-1 or the B-2 use custom designed bomb rack support structures with their own designation e.g. Common Bomb Rack (CBR), Common Bomb Module (CBM), or Smart Bomb Rack Assembly (SBRA). These bomb racks may have special store release control mechanisms. Aside from the release options of a rack a pilot can select release mode for releasing one or multiple stores. Stores can be jettisoned selectively in single mode or ripple mode or salvo mode. The term ripple applies to the single- or ripple and single- continuous release mode from one or from mirror stations. Salvo release mode applies to a combination of several stations together e.g. adjacent stations. For <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> release an interval timer can be set to release stores in fixed time steps. For an external store emergency release there may be a panic button to release all of the weapons.|$|E
50|$|There are {{intermediate}} {{policies as}} well. The cache may be write-through, but the writes may {{be held in}} a store data queue temporarily, usually so that <b>multiple</b> <b>stores</b> can be processed together (which can reduce bus turnarounds and improve bus utilization).|$|R
40|$|In smooth muscle, Ca 2 + {{release from}} the {{internal}} store into the cytoplasm occurs via inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR). The internal Ca 2 + stores containing IP 3 R and RyR may be arranged as multiple separate compartments with various IP 3 R and RyR arrangements, or {{there may be a}} single structure containing both receptors. The existence of <b>multiple</b> <b>stores</b> is proposed to explain several physiological responses which include the progression of Ca 2 + waves, graded Ca 2 + {{release from the}} store and various local responses and sensitivities. We suggest that, rather than <b>multiple</b> <b>stores,</b> a single luminally-continuous store exists in which Ca 2 + is in free diffusional equilibrium throughout. Regulation of Ca 2 + release via IP 3 R and RyR by the local Ca 2 + concentration within the stores explains the apparent existence of <b>multiple</b> <b>stores</b> and physiological processes such as graded Ca 2 + release and Ca 2 + waves. Close positioning of IP 3 R on the store with mitochondria or with receptors on the plasma membrane creates ‘IP 3 junctions’ to generate local responses on the luminally-continuous store...|$|R
40|$|Virtual malls allow {{consumers}} to shop and purchase {{products on the}} World Wide Web from <b>multiple</b> <b>stores.</b> This paper presents a virtual mall in which stores may be distributed across <b>multiple</b> Web sites. <b>Stores</b> participate in the virtual mall by communicating with a mall coordinator. The virtual mall allows shoppers to perform actions across <b>multiple</b> <b>stores</b> simultaneously such as viewing product availability. Multiple purchases across different stores can be coordinated using multi-phase commits. The mall coordinator can authenticate clients on all stores participating in the virtual mall while only requiring clients to provide authentication information once. State information is preserved using dynamic argument embedding which is compatible with all browsers and servers supporting HTTP and is less obtrusive than cookies. The distributed virtual mall concept and infrastructure {{can be applied to}} other distributed electronic commerce applications on the Web. 1 Introduction Electronic com [...] ...|$|R

We find that consumers may systematically visit multiple stores to take advantage of two types of store complementarity.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} that single-purpose <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> shopping {{is not only}} driven by opportunistic, promotion-based motivations, but may also {{be part of a}} longer term shopping planning process based on stable store characteristics. Starting from a utility-maximizing shopping behavior model, we find that consumers systematically visit multiple stores to take advantage of two types of store complementarity. With 'fixed cost complementarity', consumers alternate visits to highly preferred but high fixed cost-stores, with in-between trips to less appealing, low fixed cost- stores. This compromise strategy allows them to balance transaction and holding costs against acquisition costs. 'Category preference complementarity' occurs when different stores offer the 'best value' for different product categories. It is found to be an important driver of <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> shopping, and a necessary condition for combined (chained) shopping trips. Tying these <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> shopping motivations to characteristics of different grocery store formats leads to interesting new insights into the nature of retail competition and the strategic role of more quality-oriented retail marketing mix instruments. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} e-commerce adoption {{trends in}} the Zimbabwean retail sector. Data were collected using questionnaire and interviews of 170 retailers and 73 customers selected in Harare. Zimbabwe’s retail sector lags behind in e-business adoption. Key application areas are in administration, accounting, management and controlling. Barcode driven systems and debit card swipe technologies are most common. Mismatch between the demand for ebusiness solutions by customers and the supply of such solutions by retailers and a pronounced digital divide between <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> and single store retailers {{in the areas of}} network technologies were identified. The impact of e-business on business processes and company productivity is positive for <b>multiple</b> <b>store</b> and minimal for single store operators. Internal work organisation, procurement costs of supply goods and quality of product and services impacts are minimal. Scope exists for improved adoption and development of e-business for Zimbabwean retailers through better policies and supportive legislation...|$|E
