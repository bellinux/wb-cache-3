5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after viewing an installment of the news series 60 <b>Minutes</b> <b>that</b> dealt with American secret agents the CIA left behind during the Vietnam War. The eventual concept that the assassin could create blind spots came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother. The entry featured a finished replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and various Canadian locales substituted for various locations in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|The 27 <b>minutes</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} played the {{previous}} day had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this he brought tall forward John Toshack into the starting team demoting the small build of Brian Hall to appearing only as a late substitute. In the 21st minute Peter Cormack's throw-in on the right fed Chris Lawler to cross to the back post. Toshack's header across the penalty area set up Kevin Keegan's headed opening goal.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{played for}} the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Summer League in 2010. He saw limited action due to the same ankle injury that {{impaired}} his draft status. After being an undrafted player from Michigan for about 3 months, Harris joined the Cleveland Cavaliers with a #6 jersey number as a non-guaranteed free agent member of the 20-man preseason roster. Harris made the final roster. Me made his debut on October 29 against the Toronto Raptors in which he scored 8 points. Harris' agent is Henry Thomas. After compiling a 714 record in the first 21 games, head coach Byron Scott shuffled the lineup on December 8, and Harris played twenty-one <b>minutes</b> <b>that</b> night.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg and Williams both {{watched a}} rough cut of the film to {{determine}} what scenes would have music. The two decided to leave music out of the fighting sequences, in favor of playing it over long sequences of eight to nine <b>minutes</b> <b>that</b> lack action. The playing of music between fighting sequences gives a moment of reflection for what happened. Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams. This caused the musicians to shuffle their feet in appreciation.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in <b>minutes.</b> <b>That</b> draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E

5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 <b>minutes,</b> <b>that</b> Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, manager Antonio Conte left Juventus {{to take charge of}} the Italy {{national}} team, with former Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri called in as his replacement. Juve opened the 2014–15 season with a 1–0 away win over Chievo, with Buffon keeping a clean sheet and saving from Maxi López in the second half. On 27 September, Buffon saved a Germán Denis penalty in a 3–0 away win over Atalanta, helping Juventus to keep their fifth consecutive clean sheet in Serie A. He was eventually beaten by a Francesco Totti penalty in a 3–2 home win over Roma on 5 October after going unbeaten for 616 <b>minutes</b> <b>that</b> season. Including the previous season, Buffon managed to go 801 minutes in total without conceding a league goal; at the time, this record had only been bettered by Dino Zoff and Sebastiano Rossi. On 29 October, Buffon made his 500th appearance for Juventus in a 1–0 away loss to Genoa. On 1 November 2014, Buffon made his 400th League appearance with Juventus (37 of which were in Serie B, and 363 of which were in Serie A), keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 away win over Empoli. On 24 November, Buffon was nominated for the 2014 FIFPro World XI for a record tenth time. He is currently the only goalkeeper to have been nominated for the award every year since its inception in 2005. The same week, Buffon was also nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season Weber {{began his}} rookie season with the Rockets. Early into the campaign, Weber established a physical presence, often fighting opposing players. Overall he had 167 penalty <b>minutes</b> <b>that</b> season, the most in his entire playing career. Offensively, Weber finished {{his rookie season}} with eighteen points in seventy games played. He also scored five points in nineteen playoff games as the Rockets won the franchise's first Ed Chynoweth Cup as WHL champions, defeating the Red Deer Rebels in the finals. As WHL champions, the Rockets represented the WHL at the 2003 Memorial Cup in Quebec City, Quebec where they were defeated by the Hull Olympiques 2–1 in the semifinal game. At the completion of his rookie WHL season, Weber was eligible to be drafted into the National Hockey League at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Heading into the draft, he was ranked 42nd among North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, and 54th overall by International Scouting Services. On June 21, 2003, Weber was drafted in the second round, 49th overall, by the Nashville Predators.|$|E

Anquetil, who had the talent to predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 <b>minutes.</b> <b>That</b> was eight minutes faster than the distance had ever been ridden, the record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23.
