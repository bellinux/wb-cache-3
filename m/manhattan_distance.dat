Usually kd-tree search algorithm is selected when the similarity function is the Euclidean or the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>distances.</b> Generic fast search algorithms (algorithms that works with any distance function) are only used when there is not specific fast search algorithms for the involved distance function.

40|$|Similarity {{search in}} {{applications}} such as multimedia databases has been gaining {{a lot of attention}} in recent years. Due to the curse of dimensionality, it is hard to improve the query cost of similarity search in a high dimensional space. The problem is getting even worse when objects are represented using sets of local feature vectors, since the distance measurement among vector sets is the minimum matching distance. In the minimum matching distance, the vectors from two sets are paired to minimize the sum of the distance of all pairs while the distance measurements over single feature vectors do not need the process of pairing. In this paper, we extend the minimum matching distance to the Euclidean minimum matching <b>distance</b> and the <b>Manhattan</b> minimum matching <b>distance</b> since Euclidean and <b>Manhattan</b> <b>distances</b> are commonly used in similarity search over single feature vectors. Then we propose a novel filtering technique to reduce the query cost of similarity search on both Euclidean and <b>Manhattan</b> minimum matching <b>distances.</b> The experimental results show that our technique reduces the query cost significantly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{geometric}} semantic crossover operators {{in a wide range}} of symbolic regression problems. First, it analyses {{the impact of}} using <b>Manhattan</b> and Euclidean <b>distance</b> geometric semantic crossovers in the learning process. Then, it proposes two strategies to numerically optimize the crossover mask based on mathematical properties of these operators, instead of simply generating them randomly. An experimental analysis comparing geometric semantic crossovers using Euclidean and <b>Manhattan</b> <b>distances</b> and the proposed strategies is performed in a test bed of twenty datasets. The results show that the use of different distance functions in the semantic geometric crossover has little impact on the test error, and that our optimized crossover masks yield slightly better results. For SGP practitioners, we suggest the use of the semantic crossover based on the Euclidean distance, as it achieved similar results to those obtained by more complex operators...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{important}} functions over strings can {{be represented}} as finite-state string transducers. In this paper, we present an automata-theoretic technique for algorithmically verifying that such a function is robust to uncertainty. A function encoded as a transducer is defined to be robust if for each small (i. e., bounded) change to any input string, {{the change in the}} transducer’s output is proportional to the change in the input. Changes to input and output strings are quantified using weighted generalizations of the Levenshtein and <b>Manhattan</b> <b>distances</b> over strings. Our main technical contribution is a set of decision procedures based on reducing the problem of robustness verification of a transducer to the problem of checking the emptiness of a reversal-bounded counter machine. The decision procedures under the generalized <b>Manhattan</b> and Levenshtein <b>distance</b> metrics are in Pspace and Expspace, respectively. For transducers that are Mealy machines, the decision procedures under these metrics are in Nlogspace and Pspace, respectively. ...|$|R
