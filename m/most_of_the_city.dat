5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City,</b> and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have been heard in the docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E
5|$|British {{forces in}} Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, {{withdrawing}} from <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> while still maintaining {{control over the}} port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled {{by a combination of}} local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz, by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel. The operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa's Arab population. According to The Economist at the time, only 5,000–6,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948.|$|E
5|$|Buford {{is a city}} in Gwinnett and Hall {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 12,225. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> is in Gwinnett County, {{which is part of}} the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta Metropolitan Statistical Area. The portions of the city in Hall County are not part of Atlanta's metropolitan statistical area, but are part of Atlanta's larger Combined Statistical Area, which includes Hall County.|$|E

5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre shops {{had been destroyed}} and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of the third day, the U.S. {{launches}} a full-scale assault on Al-Asad's presidential palace, aware of the SAS warning about the possible nuclear device. As U.S. Navy SEALs invade the palace, the Marines engage Al-Asad's ground forces. The assault, however, ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly detonates, wiping out <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> along with everyone in it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all {{the water out of}} the city.|$|E

The {{district}} operates two prekindergarten centers, 24 elementary schools, four middle schools, {{and three}} high schools – Eisenhower, Lawton, and MacArthur. In 2008, Lawton Public Schools had an enrollment of about 16,000 students with about 1,000 teachers. Two independent districts, Bishop and Flower Mound, serve portions of Lawton. Bishop operates a single PK–6 elementary campus and Flower Mound has a PK–8 campus. Secondary students living in these districts attend Lawton Public Schools. A {{small portion of}} far-west Lawton is served by Cache Public Schools.|$|E
5|$|The second {{official}} residence for the state's governor {{was built in}} the center of Indianapolis where the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument now stands. It was designed by Alexander Ralston, who also laid out <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The mansion cost $6,500 and was completed in 1827 during the term of Governor James B. Ray. Ray's wife refused to live in the home because of its lack of privacy; it was never used by a governor. It was inhabited by Indiana Chief Justice Isaac Blackford from around 1830 until the 1850s. It was demolished in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Monsabert's attempt to {{liberate}} Marseille commenced. At first, a German force at Aubagne was defeated before French troops attacked the city directly. Unlike Toulon, the German commander at Marseille did not evacuate the civilian population, which became increasingly hostile. The resulting fighting with FFI troops further weakened the German units, which were exhausted from partisan fighting. The Wehrmacht {{was not able}} to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints. On 27August <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was liberated, with only a few small strongpoints remaining, and on 28August German troops issued the official surrender. The battle caused 1,825 French casualties, but 11,000 German troops were captured. In both harbours, German engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their use to the Allies.|$|E
50|$|Finally, <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> St. Vladimir, {{technically}} {{located in}} <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Vishenki, is <b>the</b> closest to <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> residential neighborhoods.|$|R

5|$|At the {{southeast}} end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive, which {{provides some of}} the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area. Houseboats are docked along the Ohio River {{on the south side of}} Riverside Drive. The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential. Unlike the other prominent streets, Riverside drive is outside the flood-wall that surrounds <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater public access to the acropolis, with {{stairways}} communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city)</b> keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, {{but he says it}} is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, {{the player}} must swing through 3 checkpoints {{and drive to}} the finish line within a time limit. The Circuit mode curtains off <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. The Checkpoint mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city at their own pace. All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread over <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City,</b> destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|Reportedly, the Lower East Side Conservancy {{was trying}} to raise an {{estimate}} $4.5 million for repairs, {{with the intent of}} turning the building into an educational center. It was granted $215,000 by the United States Department of Education and was promised an equal amount by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Several years earlier the Conservancy had also been promised a total of $980,000 from New York State, the City Council, Mayor Bloomberg, and the Manhattan Borough President's office, but had yet to receive <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> funds. The group was also trying to raise $400,000 from private donors for {{the first phase of the}} renovation, which would secure the structure and roof. Led by Greenbaum, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was down to around 20 regularly attending members, and was sharing facilities with a congregation on Henry Street.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{decades after}} the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally {{captured}} by Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his 250,000 soldiers and over 100 ships subsequently, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was razed {{to the ground and}} its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul, to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the district (Sanjak), becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule also introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, increasing the city's Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vračar plateau; in the 20th century, the Temple of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.|$|E
5|$|The city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{is covered}} by a citywide {{broadband}} wireless internet network, sometimes called Wireless Minneapolis. The network was first proposed in 2003, at which point only a few other cities nationwide had such systems in place. Local firm US Internet beat out EarthLink to build and operate the network, with a guaranteed ten-year, multimillion-dollar contract from the city itself as the network's anchor tenant. Construction began on the project in 2006, but encountered several delays. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was covered by the network by 2010, and USI Wireless, the subsidiary of US Internet responsible for the system, set up numerous free internet access points at public locations around Minneapolis.|$|E
