Aposematic individuals can similarly make use of conspicuous mating displays.|$|E
5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust a Groove features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> than typical rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher began {{attending}} lunches {{regularly at}} the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), {{a think tank}} founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she {{was influenced by the}} ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> for business and consumers.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher {{returned}} to the backbenches as a constituency parliamentarian after leaving the premiership. Her domestic approval rating recovered after her resignation; the balance of public opinion was that her government had been good for the country. Aged 66, she retired from the House at the 1992 general election, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> to speak her mind.|$|E
5|$|The plague {{was carried}} by fleas on sailing vessels {{returning}} from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly {{due to lack of}} proper sanitation: the population of England, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy <b>more</b> <b>freedom.</b> To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.|$|E
5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> to choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
50|$|He {{has been}} {{involved}} in several prominent court cases against the government, including a 2001 ruling that gave syndicates <b>more</b> <b>freedoms,</b> a 2010 case he won that mandated a higher minimum wage for workers, and a case leading to the nationalization of three large companies that had been privatized.|$|R
50|$|Prisoner Rations and Living Conditions (inside the fort)High-ranking Confederate {{officers}} and some political prisoners were housed in former laundress quarters and open-bay barrack rooms inside the fort.

50|$|When {{it comes}} to the rights of women within Islamic society, oftentimes, they were looked to have <b>more</b> <b>freedoms</b> than women from other {{countries}} - for example the freedom to divorce - and often saw marriage as a chance to change their social status. In other cases, many atrocities occurred against women who were enslaved.|$|R
5|$|When Jardine {{went on to}} {{play for}} Surrey that season, a strong batting side, he played with <b>more</b> <b>freedom.</b> Batting at number five, he had to adapt his style {{depending}} on the match situation. He was successful, playing long defensive innings or sacrificing his innings {{in an attempt to}} hit quick runs. His captain Percy Fender retained him in the role {{for the rest of the}} season. He scored his first century for Surrey against Yorkshire and was awarded his County Cap, making 916 runs at an average of 38.16 in the whole season.|$|E
5|$|With the {{enhanced}} {{features of the}} 32X, the developers were given <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> in designing Knuckles' Chaotix compared to previous games. To {{take advantage of the}} more powerful hardware, several levels feature dynamic sprite-scaling effects, and the game's special stages were rendered with 3D polygons. A complex palette system was implemented as well, allowing each level to load its own unique palette.|$|E
5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E

50|$|Mongol women enjoyed <b>more</b> <b>freedoms</b> {{than those}} in their foreign vassal countries. They refused to adopt the Chinese {{practice}} of footbinding and wear chadors or burqas. The Mongolian women were allowed to move about more freely in public. Toward {{the end of the}} Mongol Empire, however, the increasing influence of Neo-Confucianism, Buddhism and Islamicization saw greater limits placed on Mongol women.|$|R
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E

5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{creating}} a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, {{in and around the}} city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> {{in creating}} effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.|$|E
50|$|A 2001 {{judgment}} {{in a case}} spearheaded by Ali saw labor syndicates gain <b>more</b> <b>freedoms.</b> His victory winning the renationalization of large companies, sold by the former regime in corrupt deals, included retailer Omar Effendi, the Nile Cotton Weaving Company and several other factories. Ali also served on the legal team that halted the privatization of Egypt's national health insurance and presided over the legal team advocating for transparency and protection of public insurance and pension funds.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish singlewomen from virginal nuns, another group of husbandless women. Although unmarried, not all singlewomen were celibate virgins and virginal nuns practiced very different lives than everyday singlewomen. Widows also differed from singlewomen, as they often had greater economic security and occupational opportunity. While widows and singlewomen both lived without a spouse {{at some point in}} their lives, their lifestyles were very different and widows were often awarded <b>more</b> <b>freedoms</b> and opportunities.|$|R
50|$|This had {{the effect}} of seriously {{weakening}} the coherence of the political message and, consequently, the credibility of the regime, a fatal blow from which, as later events would show, it never recovered. At the same time, during Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, some of the junta constraints were removed from the body politic of Greece and that led to demands for <b>more</b> <b>freedoms,</b> and political unrest, in a society well used to democratic action prior to the dictatorship.|$|R
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played {{from the perspective}} of Artyom, the player-character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above ground. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and hostile humans. Areas are larger in Last Light compared to 2033, and the game encourages exploration by having multiple routes. The game offers <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> to players, allowing them to utilize different tactics to combat enemies. It features destructible environments, in which certain objects, such as pillars, collapse after being shot. Numerous diary entries, written by Artyom, providing additional insight regarding the game's story, are scattered throughout environments for players to collect.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have <b>more</b> <b>freedom</b> in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Bahraini {{authorities}} summoned the Lebanese ambassador in Bahrain {{to file a}} complaint against a conference held by Bahrain Rebellion Movement in Beirut. In the conference, opposition activists called for civil disobedience and mass protests, the BNA reported. A number of Bahraini opposition politicians and human rights activists have based their activities in Beirut where they enjoy <b>more</b> <b>freedom.</b> The BNA added that the Lebanese ambassador said his government was not supportive of the conference and {{that they did not}} wish to interfere in Bahraini internal affairs. A day earlier, the salafist Al Asalah Islamic Society had criticized Lebanon for hosting the conference.|$|E
