25|$|A {{practical}} {{application of the}} Coriolis effect is the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> an instrument that measures the mass flow rate and density of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that {{gives rise to the}} Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{mass flow}} meters, {{also known as}} thermal {{dispersion}} or immersible mass flow meters comprise a family of instruments for the measurement of the total mass flow rate of a fluid, primarily gases, flowing through closed conduits.

50|$|The {{animation}} on {{the right}} represents how curved tube mass flow meters are designed. The fluid is led through two parallel tubes. An actuator (not shown) induces equal counter vibrations on the sections parallel to the axis, to make the measuring device less sensitive to outside vibrations. The actual frequency of the vibration depends {{on the size of}} the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> and ranges from 80 to 1000 Hz.

50|$|The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{does not}} measure the volume per unit time (e.g., cubic meters per second) {{passing through the}} device; it {{measures}} the mass per unit time (e.g., kilograms per second) flowing through the device. Volumetric flow rate is the mass flow rate divided by the fluid density. If the density is constant, then the relationship is simple. If the fluid has varying density, then the relationship is not simple. The density of the fluid may change with temperature, pressure, or composition, for example. The fluid {{may also be a}} combination of phases such as a fluid with entrained bubbles.Actual density can be determined due to dependency of sound velocity on the controlled liquid concentration.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{is being}} pumped through the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> When there is mass flow, the tube twists slightly. The arm through which fluid flows {{away from the}} axis of {{rotation}} must exert a force on the fluid, to increase its angular momentum, so it bends backwards. The arm through which fluid is pushed back to the axis of rotation must exert a force on the fluid to decrease the fluid's angular momentum again, hence that arm will bend forward. In other words, the inlet arm (containing an outwards directed flow), is lagging behind the overall rotation, the part which in rest {{is parallel to the}} axis is now skewed, and the outlet arm (containing an inwards directed flow) leads the overall rotation.|$|E
50|$|Temperature {{affects the}} density of fluids. In most cases, an {{increase}} in temperature indicates that {{the density of}} the media will decrease. This indicates that temperature and density are inversely proportional to each other.
