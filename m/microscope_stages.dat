40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} for creating virtual slides that incorporates the positioning accuracy of the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> in the optimization step. To capture a complete slide in microscopy, {{a large number of}} fields of view have to be acquired by moving the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> in a controlled way. These fields of view are aligned {{in such a way that}} a globally consistent virtual slide is formed. However, depending on the positioning repeatability of the stage and the accuracy of the stage calibration, this results in alignment errors. These errors are usually resolved by applying a mosaicing algorithm. Our algorithm extends known mosaicing approaches by analyzing the positioning accuracy of the stage and incorporating this knowledge to make the mosaicing process more robust...|$|R

In vitro palatal formation {{is similar to that}} observed in vivo. Organ culture procedures frequently have been used to study the formation of the secondary palate. '- 9 Ultrastructure studies have concentrated on palate formation in vivo. 1 D- 22 In previous studies, terminology used to describe secondary palate formation (after the palatal processes are horizontal and united in the midline) varied with the author and emphasis of the report. The most common terms are epithelial fusion and connective tissue fusion; 4 ' 2 ' partial fusion and complete fusion; 9 epithelial fusion and mesenchymal replacement; 23 and laminated fusion and penetrated fusion. 24 Farbman' 5 used the term prefusion in an attempt to recognize the changing state of the palatal processes. We believe that the union of the second-ary palate of the mouse can be separated into at least five stages: epithelial contact, epithelial adherence, epithelial reorganiza-tion, epithelial disruption, and mesenchymal fusion.

40|$|Characterisation of the {{physical}} environment embryos are exposed to throughout in vitro culture for treatments involving in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has been limited due to measurement difficulties (since the position of an embryo {{is the point of}} interest) and the lack of a theoretical framework. Temperature, oxygen concentrations and pH are all important factors in an oocyte’s and an embryo’s environment which, if away from desired levels, may impact on embryo viability. The development of mathematical models provides a structured approach which helps to overcome measurement difficulties. The IVF process was broken down into 70 discrete back-to-back steps, from oocyte aspiration to embryo transfer, which could be modelled. Models of heat transfer were developed for a Petri dish, 4 -well dish, Pasteur pipette (un-pulled and pulled), plastic pipette tip (two sizes), denuding pipette and transfer catheter. Models of oxygen and carbon dioxide mass transfer were developed for the Petri dish, in which oocytes and embryos spend the majority of their time in culture. The models were solved by the finite element method in the software package COMSOL Multiphysics 3. 3 a used in conjunction with MATLAB R 2006 a. Models were then validated against experimental data. There is considerable variation in the embryology culture process, with respect to the number and timing of steps, both between and within laboratories. Of all the factors in an embryo’s environment embryology practice has the greatest impact on temperature. Embryos are cultured in dishes in incubators which maintain the required gaseous and thermal environment. While paraffin oil, which overlays culture media in a dish, successfully buffers embryos from great changes in oxygen and pH when dishes are removed from an incubator, maintenance of embryo temperature is dependent on numerous factors including the setting of the surface temperature of <b>microscope</b> <b>stages,</b> whether the lid is on or off the dish, the embryo position across the floor of the dish, the dish’s foot height, the time out of incubator and the depth of liquid in the dish. For a period of 5 minutes out of an incubator in a standard Petri dish set up, the pH an embryo is exposed to will not likely rise from pH 7. 33, as in an incubator, to above pH 7. 38. However, the temperature an embryo is exposed to may change by ± 10 °C in 10 seconds. Use of plastic pipette tips instead of glass pipettes is beneficial for maintaining embryo temperature as the temperature will fall by approximately 3 °C in 10 seconds, 7 °C less than in the glass pipette under the same conditions. This work identified many simple practical steps, {{such as the use of}} plastic pipette tips instead of glass, which minimise temperature changes embryos are exposed to throughout the culture process. Applying the Model of mass transfer of O 2 in a Petri dish disproved the belief that equilibration of gas in the dish occurs significantly faster without a lid. The model of O 2 transport in a Petri dish demonstrated that it takes ˜ 1 hour to reach 67 % and ˜ 4 hours to reach 95 % full equilibration of oxygen between atmospheric and 5 vol % O 2 at 37 C. Modelling mass transport of CO 2 provided a means to predict pH changes within a media drop in a Petri dish. In equilibration from atmospheric to 6 vol % CO 2, the pH reached within 0. 1 unit of the final value in ˜ 1. 5 hours. An important finding of this work was that sufficient equilibration of gas may be achieved in ˜ 2 hours and therefore the pre-equilibration time for dishes (currently overnight) may be shortened, reducing the degradation of amino acids, which occurs at 37 °C, to ammonium (embryo toxic). There is considerable variation in embryology practice. This work successfully utilised engineering knowledge and mathematical modelling to describe {{the physical}} environment of temperature, oxygen and pH that oocytes and embryos may be exposed to throughout an open embryo culture system, used by the majority of IVF clinics worldwide. The findings here provide a basis for establishing best practice. Further work is needed to quantify the effects on the embryo of fluctuation in the embryo’s environment but this work demonstrates that mathematical modelling of the embryo’s environment in IVF is a viable tool for improving laboratory practice...|$|E

40|$|Background: Current malaria {{diagnosis}} {{relies primarily}} on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained {{thick and thin}} blood films. This method requires vigorously trained technicians to efficiently detect and classify the malaria parasite species such as Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) for an appropriate drug administration. However, accurate classification of parasite species is difficult to achieve because of inherent technical limitations and human inconsistency. To improve performance of malaria parasite classification, many researchers have proposed automated malaria detection devices using digital image analysis. These image processing tools, however, focus on detection of parasites on thin blood films, which may not detect the existence of parasites due to the parasite scarcity on the thin blood film. The problem is aggravated with low parasitemia condition. Automated detection and classification of parasites on thick blood films, which contain more numbers of parasite per detection area, would address the previous limitation.

40|$|High resolution, in vivo optical imaging of {{the mouse}} brain over time often {{requires}} anesthesia, which necessitates maintaining the animal's body temperature and level of anesthesia, as well as securing the head in an optimal, stable position. Controlling each parameter usually requires using multiple systems. Assembling multiple components into the small space on a standard <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> can be difficult and some commercially available parts simply do not fit. Furthermore, it is time-consuming to position an animal in the identical position over multiple imaging sessions for longitudinal studies. This is especially true when using an implanted gradient index (GRIN) lens for deep brain imaging. The multiphoton laser beam must be parallel with the shaft of the lens because even a slight tilt of the lens can degrade image quality. In response to these challenges, we have designed a compact, integrated in vivo imaging support system to overcome the problems created by using separate systems during optical imaging in mice. It is a single platform that provides (1) sturdy head fixation, (2) an integrated gas anesthesia mask, and (3) safe warm water heating. This THREE-IN-ONE (TRIO) Platform has a small footprint and a low profile that positions a mouse’s head only 20 mm above the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage.</b> This height is about one half to one third the height of most commercially available immobilization devices.

Counting is done within counting frames {{placed on a}} pair of sections (disector technique). But this requires that the thin sections are taken from comparable brain regions and the disectors are placed in a uniform random fashion. Small brain areas like the polymorph layer of the mouse dentate gyrus are difficult to encounter, and manually moving the <b>microscope</b> <b>stage</b> for placing the micrographs seems arbitrary. New methodHere the polymorph layer was approximated with 20 μm thin, Nissl-stained vibratome sections.

ResultsEnvironmental enrichment significantly decreased the numerical density of dense-core vesicles and synaptic cleft widths within the polymorph layer, associated with behavioral improvement in the Morris water maze, a hippocampus-dependent task of spatial learning and memory.
