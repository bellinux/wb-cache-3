Being a cider-boy I thought wine was a namby-pamby drink. But I was gripped as John started talking to me, this dumb yokel, about wine. His command of English just rolled off him. He got out some cheese and said this goes best with that wine. 'Go on,' he'd say, have a taste.' Our incredible friendship started and he became <b>my</b> <b>mentor.</b> These days they call 'em life-gurus or some such crap." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{began his}} career with bit parts in smaller movies, {{including}} Myra Breckinridge, Coma, and The Seven Minutes. He also appeared {{in a number of}} TV series, mini-series and TV movies. Still struggling as an unfamiliar, television actor, Selleck also had a recurring role in the 1970s as [...] "too good to be true" [...] private investigator Lance White in The Rockford Files. An avid James Garner fan, since childhood, who also watched his mentor's show, Selleck's Lance was very trusting and always lucky, much to the annoyance of Jim Rockford. White would frequently say to Rockford, [...] "Don't worry, Jim; clues will turn up," [...] and then a clue would just turn up, much to Rockford's consternation, for whom obtaining clues required hard work and hard knocks. Selleck's character was based on one played in Garner's earlier TV series Maverick (1957) by Wayde Preston in the episode [...] "The Saga of Waco Williams". Despite appearing in only 2 episodes, and in later interviews, Selleck credited Garner [...] "as a mentor," [...] and continued to stay friends with him, for over 35 years, until his childhood movie hero's, mentor's and friend's death, on July 19, 2014. Upon his death, he said of his TV private investigator: [...] "Jim was a mentor to me and a friend, and I will miss him." [...] Two years after Garner's death, Selleck also said, prior to filming his then 6th season of his top-rated series, Blue Bloods: [...] "It’s kind of like <b>my</b> <b>mentor,</b> who never wanted to hear he was <b>my</b> <b>mentor</b> (James Garner), I don’t accept the mentor role. That they feel that way is, I think flattering although it adds a certain amount of pressure." ...|$|E

40|$|Recently I {{was asked}} to articu-late <b>my</b> <b>{{mentoring}}</b> philosophy,and I {{had to admit that}} I didn’t have a mentoring philosophy. Of course, I do have some mentoring experiences—I have read books and articles about mentoring, I have had many mentees of my own, I have written about self-mentoring, and I even had a mentor.

I don't think it did him much good." [...] He also recalled in 1995 that [...] "Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's <b>my</b> <b>mentor,</b> and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ikeda's most {{well-known}} publication is the novel The Human Revolution (Ningen Kakumei), which was serialized in the Soka Gakkai's daily newspaper, the Seikyo Shimbun. The book's original English-edition foreword {{was written by}} British philosopher and historian Arnold J. Toynbee. The Human Revolution has been translated into English, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean and Dutch and has sold over seven millions copies worldwide. In the preface to The Human Revolution, the author describes the book as a [...] "novelized biography of <b>my</b> <b>mentor,</b> Josei Toda." [...] The author's official website describes the book as an [...] "historical novel [...] portrays {{the development of the}} Soka Gakkai in Japan, from its rebirth in the post-World War II era to the last years of its second president, Josei Toda." [...] In the preface to the 2004 edition, the author stated the narrative was edited to bring it in line with recent developments in the history of Nichiren Buddhism, and that he hoped [...] "such revisions will help readers to better appreciate the original message of the book." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 May 1950 at Ambli-Vali Pol in Ahmedabad, Shastriji Maharaj {{appointed}} Shastri Narayanswarupdas, then merely 28 {{years of}} age, as the administrative president ("Pramukh") of BAPS. [...] After that Shastri Narayanswarupdas was widely known as [...] "Pramukh Swami." [...] At the ceremony, Shastriji Maharaj placed his own shawl around Shastri Narayanswarupdas’s shoulders, and asked Yogiji Maharaj to bless him. Shastri Narayanswarupdas then addressed the group, [...] "I feel {{overwhelmed by the}} kindness and love showered upon me so lavishly here by my guru, Shastriji Maharaj, and by <b>my</b> <b>mentor</b> Yogiji Maharaj. [...] Always will this day remain sacred for me, in that I am considered worthy of so great a trust and confidence by the two most noble souls of our fellowship, and by you all despite my young age." [...] Despite being appointed {{the president of the}} organization just hours before, that evening, Shastri Narayanswarupdas was found washing the cooking utensils and dishes used by the devotees who had attended the ceremony. This incident was emblematic of the humble style of servant-leadership that would characterize the next six decades of his presidency.|$|E
40|$|Making a {{film is a}} {{collaborative}} effort, the product of many and not just one. This idea was evidenced as I tried to do as many things as I possibly could on my film set, but I could not have accomplished this effort without the dedication, humor, and support of my crew. I hope that the final product of this film will meet their expectations and reflect the hard work invested. I also must give credit to all <b>my</b> <b>mentors</b> at this institution, not just those limited to this project. I may disagree with them from time to time, but <b>my</b> <b>mentors</b> know that I made these choices because of the knowledge they instilled within me.

2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem.

That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was <b>my</b> <b>mentor</b> before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game.

Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E

There was some uncertainty, being in a foreign place with not a lot of resources that I would say I would be comfortable with on a medical level. Aside from that, the structure was not very sound. It was literally moving side to side at least six inches from one side to the other from the wind. So I was definitely humbled by a lot more than what I was going to do on a skateboard that day. I don’t think it’s a ritual for me, but I tried to have a moment to think about all the good things in my life. That definitely made me check in with myself for a second.

60|$|Once a year Lady Anne Newcome (about whom <b>my</b> <b>Mentor</b> {{was much}} more circumspect; for I somehow used to remark that as the rank of persons grew higher, Major Pendennis spoke of them with more caution and respect)--once or twice in a year Lady Anne Newcome opened her saloons for a concert and a ball, at both of which the whole street was crowded with carriages, and all the great world, {{and some of the}} small, were present.

I had just come out of jail, where I had been three days, and I knew that if the police [...] "pinched" [...] me again, I'd get good and [...] "soaked." [...] On the other hand, I couldn't show the white feather. I'd been over the hill, I was running full-fledged with the push, and {{it was up to me}} to deliver the goods. So I accepted Bob's advice, and he came along with me to see that I did it up brown.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} I was out again in the plantation, with doves in {{hundreds}} moving over the ground all about me and taking no notice of me. It was a joyful and exciting moment when I started operations, but I soon found that when I tossed a handful of salt at the bird's tail it never fell on its tail--it fell on the ground {{two or three or}} four inches short of the tail. If, I thought, the bird would only keep still a moment longer! But then it wouldn't, and I think I spent quite two hours in these vain attempts to make the salt fall on the right place. At last I went back to <b>my</b> <b>mentor</b> to confess that I had failed and to ask for fresh instructions, but all he would say was that I was on the right track, that the plan I had adopted was the proper one, and all that was wanted was a little more practice to enable me to drop the salt on the right spot. Thus encouraged I filled my pockets again and started afresh, and then finding that by following the proper plan I made no progress I adopted a new one, which was to take a handful of salt and hurl it at the bird's tail. Still I couldn't touch the tail; my violent action only frightened the bird and caused it to fly away, a dozen yards or so, before dropping down again to resume its seed-searching business.|$|E
60|$|Though {{we already}} have Cicero's letters {{arranged}} for us in a chronological sequence which may be held to be fairly correct for biographical purposes, still there is much doubt remaining as to the exact periods at which {{many of them were}} written. Abeken, the German biographer, says that this year, B.C. 55, produced twelve letters. In the French edition of Cicero's works published by Panckoucke thirty-five are allotted to it. Mr. Watson, in his selected letters, has not taken one from the year in question. Mr. Tyrrell, who has been <b>my</b> <b>Mentor</b> hitherto in regard to the correspondence, has not, unfortunately, published the result of his labors beyond the year 53 B.C. at the time of my present writing. Some of those who have dealt with Cicero's life and works, and have illustrated them by his letters, have added something to the existing confusion by assuming an accuracy of knowledge in this respect which has not existed. We have no right to quarrel with them for having done so; certainly not with Middleton, as in his time such accuracy was less valued by readers than it is now; and we have the advantage of much light which, though still imperfect, is very bright in comparison with that enjoyed by him. A study of the letters, however, in the sequence now given to them affords an accurate picture of Cicero's mind during the years between the period of his return from exile B.C. 57 and Milo's trial B.C. 52, although the reader may occasionally be misled as to the date of this or the other letter.|$|E
