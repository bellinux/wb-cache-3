5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Lateral {{movement}} of reclamations and ground adjoining rivers and foreshores can {{occur as a}} result of earthquake shaking. The mechanism of this lateral movement is discussed and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> used are presented. Both empirical and mechanics based <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> are used. Case studies <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>of</b> construction works to mitigate the effects of lateral movement are presented. The mechanics based and empirical <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> include simplifications and assumptions. It is concluded that any assessment of lateral movement potential should include as many <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> as practical and include sensitivity checks on the assumed parameters. Ultimately, these methods provide support to engineering judgement to assess the likely performance of a site. ...|$|R

The innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not commute. In 1847 Boole published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, the first of his works on symbolic logic.|$|E
25|$|The main {{contributions}} of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. Tjalling C. Koopmans and David Cass modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of population growth at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model where the objective now is to maximise household's utility function.|$|E
25|$|Russell and Moore {{were devoted}} to clarity in {{arguments}} by breaking down philosophical position into their simplest components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and science as the principal tools of the philosopher. Russell did not {{think we should have}} separate methods for philosophy. Russell thought philosophers should strive to answer the most general of propositions about the world and this would help eliminate confusions. In particular, he wanted to end what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's Razor, as a central part of the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

25|$|The XCH-62 {{prototype}} was in {{an advanced}} state of assembly in 1975, being readied for a planned initial flight in 1976. Failures in the spiral bevel gearing of the main transmission were experienced in tests because the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> employed had not considered the effect of rim bending. Consequently, new gears with strengthened rims were designed and fabricated. For a more accurate prediction of the load capacity of the gears, an extensive Finite Element Method (FEM) system was developed. The U.S. Army's XCH-62 HLH aft rotor transmission was finally successfully tested at full design torque and speed, but the US Congress cut funding for the program in August 1975. The designers of the Mil Mi-26 avoided similar problems by using a split-torque design in the main rotor transmission.|$|E
25|$|And this {{contradictory}} {{nature of}} media, is in turn {{due to the}} ways that media are mediated in modern-day culture: “In short, mass-mediated products are determined by various factors—the systems of ownership, the process of cultural production, the level of struggle, the state of consciousness in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture” (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by social actors, or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media {{is the key to}} the age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{so-called}} post-structuralist and postmodernist theory, {{drawing upon}} structuralism and phenomenology {{as much as}} classical social science, made a considerable impact on frames of sociological enquiry. Often understood simply as a cultural style 'after-Modernism' marked by intertextuality, pastiche and irony, sociological analyses of postmodernity have presented a distinct era relating to (1) the dissolution of metanarratives (particularly {{in the work of}} Lyotard), and (2) commodity fetishism and the 'mirroring' of identity with consumption in late capitalist society (Debord; Baudrillard; Jameson). Postmodernism has also been associated with the rejection of enlightenment conceptions of the human subject by thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Claude Lévi-Strauss and, to a lesser extent, in Louis Althusser's attempt to reconcile Marxism with anti-humanism. Most theorists associated with the movement actively refused the label, preferring to accept postmodernity as a historical phenomenon rather than a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> if at all. Nevertheless, self-consciously postmodern pieces continue to emerge within the social and political sciences in general.|$|E

25|$|Newer studies {{sometimes}} use mercury vapor analysis {{instead of}} the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, Consumer Reports has reported {{that this is not}} an accurate <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled. Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and not found to be valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva and swallowed, some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled. Of these amounts, {{it is important to note}} that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury whereas only about 0.01% of swallowed mercury vapour is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

Cort state that anekāntavāda is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars {{not to accept}} other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint.
