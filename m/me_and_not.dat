25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{performed}} [...] "Not Afraid" [...] alongside Porter at the 2011 Bonnaroo Music Festival. He {{arrived in}} a Bad Meets Evil T-shirt, camouflage shorts, a black hoodie and a black hat. His set list included other hits from previous years, including [...] "Cleanin' Out My Closet", [...] "The Real Slim Shady", [...] "Without Me" [...] and [...] "Like Toy Soldiers"; he also performed with Bad Meets Evil partner Royce da 5'9" [...] for [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and [...] "Lighters". Almost 80,000 {{members of the audience}} chanted [...] "Shady!" [...] for five minutes until Eminem returned to perform an encore with [...] "Lose Yourself". Before performing [...] "Not Afraid", Eminem told the audience, [...] "All jokes aside... Thank you for sticking by <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> giving up on me." [...] At one point during the show, he told them, [...] "Everybody here tonight, I just wanna say thank you for sticking by <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> giving up on me." [...] News sources praised the performance; James Montgomery of MTV News wrote, [...] "what stood out the most about Em's performance was the sheer tenacity with which he attacked it." [...] News agency Associated Press said that [...] "Bonnaroo's crowd may be a hippie enclave, but you wouldn't have known it Saturday night". HitFix blog's Katie Hasty considered the [...] "Not Afraid" [...] performance [...] "triumphant, perhaps due to crowd buzz". Patrick Doyle of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Eminem's hour-and-a-half set was a triumph, with the rapper constantly bouncing across the stage, performing hit after hit with the energy of a prizefighter." ...|$|E

On Facebook the administrator explained {{that he could not}} continue collaborating at Valor por Tamaulipas because of his inability to properly manage the page. [...] "In my case, organized crime won, but it has defeated <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> society; it has defeated me and my family, but it has not defeated that thousands of contributors who trusted this page and reported despite their fears", the administrator said. He also talked about his experience and the lessons he learned as head of the page, and then thanked those who supported and trusted him for over a year. The administrator concluded by asking his followers to forgive him.|$|E

500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E
500|$|Slovak {{returned}} to the Chili Peppers for their second album, Freaky Styley, which was released on August 16, 1985. What is This? had finally disbanded, and Irons {{returned to}} the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired. Flea, Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained. Flea recalled that [...] "it began to seem ugly to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> fun; our communication was not healthy". Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving {{the rest of the}} group to work on much of the album's material by themselves. The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album, where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use. [...] When Slovak was under the influence, he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a [...] "shuffling" [...] fashion, which became the inspiration for the song [...] "Skinny Sweaty Man" [...] from the band's next album. [...] After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab, he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Slovak felt a deep connection to the album; he reflected in his diary [...] "It was so fun. I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] Slovak was the subject of the songs [...] "Skinny Sweaty Man", [...] "Me and My Friends", & [...] "No Chump Love Sucker". He was nicknamed [...] "Slim Bob Billy", [...] "Slim", or [...] "Huckleberry", and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo. [...] On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Slovak experimented with different musical styles, playing the sitar on the song [...] "Behind the Sun".|$|E

2500|$|Funk {{musician}} George Clinton {{was hired}} to produce the band's second album, Freaky Styley (1985). The strong chemistry between Clinton and the Chili Peppers was felt instantly. Flea later referred to Clinton as [...] "the warmest, kindest man in the world". Freaky Styley was released in August 1985. It received only a bit more attention than The Red Hot Chili Peppers with roughly 75,000 copies sold by year's end. Flea was somewhat indifferent to the poor album sales as he had recently proposed to girlfriend Loesha Zeviar, who was pregnant with their child. The band hired Michael Beinhorn, their last resort among potential producers, {{to work on their}} next album. What Is This? had finally disbanded, and drummer Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid-1986 after Martinez was fired.

2500|$|Stern {{began to}} air on WJFK-AM in Baltimore and KLSX in Los Angeles, owned by Infinity and Greater Media respectively, in 1991. The show aired {{live on the}} West Coast from 3:00am PST {{followed}} by a tape delay replay from 6:00am PST. A complaint {{was sent to the}} FCC in February 1992 from Al Westcott, a listener in Torrance, California who supplied 60 hours of recordings and a 19-page single-spaced transcript. Upon review of his letter, Greater Media was issued with a NAL worth $105,000 for the [...] "apparent wilful and repeated violation" [...] of the Section 1464 standard at hours when children may be in the audience. The FCC found comments that were actionable from 12 shows between October 30 and December 6, 1991, including those about masturbating to a picture of Aunt Jemima, rectal bleeding, a sexual fantasy with actress Michelle Pfeiffer, the shaving of pubic hair, paedophilia and the arrest of actor Paul Reubens for indecent exposure. Westcott hailed the fine as a [...] "mammoth victory... not for <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> against Howard Stern but purely on behalf of the children of the country". After the fine was issued it became apparent to some KLSX listeners that portions of the show was being edited. Executives at Greater Media admitted to have removed comments from the 6:00am replay that they found questionable from the New York feed to avoid the risk of further fines as the [...] "safe harbor" [...] rulings came into effect at that time. A settlement was reached between the FCC and Greater Media in 1997 that involved the fine being paid and the complaint dismissed.|$|E
2500|$|Funk {{musician}} George Clinton {{was hired}} to produce the band's second album, Freaky Styley, as Slovak returned on guitar.

Flea recalled that [...] "it began to seem ugly to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> fun; our communication was not healthy". Kiedis became dependent on heroin, leaving Flea and Slovak to work on much of the album's material by themselves. Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions, which grew worse as the band was preparing to record The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. [...] Due to his addiction, Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically, and appeared at rehearsal [...] "literally asleep". He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation. [...] During that time, the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award, which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey. He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance, who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance. Kiedis checked into a Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids, an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him. [...] He moved in with his mother after twenty days at the clinic, a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was eleven years old. After Kiedis completed his stint in rehabilitation, he felt a [...] "whole new wave of enthusiasm" [...] due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song titled [...] "Fight Like a Brave" [...] on the flight home.|$|E
