5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping {{with the lack of}} {{resources}} available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and <b>misoprostol</b> as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
25|$|A {{letter from}} Searle {{generated}} some {{controversy over the}} use of <b>misoprostol</b> in labor inductions. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists holds that substantial evidence supports the use of <b>misoprostol</b> for induction of labor, a position it reaffirmed in 2000 in response to the Searle letter. <b>Misoprostol</b> is also on the WHO essential drug list for labor induction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> is {{used for}} {{self-induced}} abortions in Brazil, where black market prices exceed US$100 per dose. Illegal medically unsupervised <b>misoprostol</b> abortions in Brazil {{are associated with a}} lower complication rate than other forms of illegal self-induced abortion, but are still associated with a higher complication rate than legal, medically supervised surgical and medical abortions. Failed <b>misoprostol</b> abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases. Low-income and immigrant populations in New York City have also been observed to use self-administered <b>misoprostol</b> to induce abortions, as this method is much cheaper than a surgical abortion (about $2 per dose). The drug is readily available in Mexico. Use of <b>misoprostol</b> has also increased in Texas in response to increased regulation of abortion providers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> is {{also used}} to prevent and treat post-partum bleeding. Orally {{administered}} <b>misoprostol</b> was marginally less effective than oxytocin. The use of rectally administered <b>misoprostol</b> is optimal in cases of bleeding; it was shown to be associated with lower rates of side effects compared to other routes. Rectally administered <b>misoprostol</b> was reported in a variety of case reports and randomised controlled trials. However, it is inexpensive and thermostable (thus does not require refrigeration like oxytocin), making it a cost-effective and valuable drug to use in the developing world. A randomised control trial of <b>misoprostol</b> use found a 38% reduction in maternal deaths due to post partum haemorrhage in resource-poor communities. <b>Misoprostol</b> is recommended due to its cost, effectiveness, stability, and low rate of side effects. Oxytocin must also be given by injection, while misprostol can be given orally or rectally for this use, making it much more useful in areas where nurses and physicians are less available.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{difference}} in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and <b>misoprostol</b> and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 9 weeks gestation. Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog <b>misoprostol</b> alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of mifepristone and <b>misoprostol</b> or surgical abortion.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} using oxytocin is that {{it needs}} to be kept below a certain temperature which requires resources such as fridges which are not always available particularly in low-resourced settings. When oxytocin is not available, <b>misoprostol</b> can be used. <b>Misoprostol</b> {{does not need to be}} kept at a certain temperature and research into its effectiveness in reducing blood loss appears promising when compared with a placebo in a setting where it is not appropriate to use oxytocin. <b>Misoprostol</b> can cause unpleasant side effects such as very high body temperatures and shivering. Lower doses of <b>misoprostol</b> appear to be safer and cause less side effects.|$|E
25|$|Studies in mice, rats, {{and rabbits}} {{revealed}} teratogenicity for rabbits, but not rats or mice. The rate of birth defects in human infants exposed in utero to mifepristone and <b>misoprostol</b> is very low, {{and may be}} due to <b>misoprostol</b> alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> is most {{effective}} when it is used with methotrexate or mifepristone (RU-486). <b>Misoprostol</b> alone is less effective (typically 88% up to eight-weeks gestation). It is not inherently unsafe if medically supervised, but 1% of women will have heavy bleeding requiring medical attention, some women may have ectopic pregnancy, and the 12% of pregnancies that continue after <b>misoprostol</b> failure {{are more likely to}} have birth defects and are usually followed up with a more effective method of abortion.|$|E
25|$|Between 2002 and 2012, a <b>misoprostol</b> vaginal insert was studied, and was {{approved}} in the EU. It was not approved {{for use in}} the USA, and the US FDA still considers cervical ripening and labor induction to be outside of the approved uses for <b>misoprostol.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{even in the}} {{treatment}} of NSAID-induced ulcers, omeprazole proved to be at least as effective as <b>misoprostol,</b> but was significantly better tolerated, so <b>misoprostol</b> should not be considered a first-line treatment. Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need for multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} early first-trimester medical {{abortion}} regimens use mifepristone {{in combination with}} a prostaglandin analog (<b>misoprostol</b> or gemeprost) up to 9 weeks gestational age, methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone. Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than <b>misoprostol</b> alone. This regime is effective in the second trimester. Medical abortion regiments involving mifepristone followed by <b>misoprostol</b> in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days' gestation.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone {{followed}} by a prostaglandin analog (<b>misoprostol</b> or gemeprost) is used for medical abortion.|$|E
25|$|A Guttmacher Institute {{survey of}} {{abortion}} providers estimated that medical abortions accounted for 17% of all abortions and slightly over 25% of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in the United States in 2008 (94% of nonhospital medical abortions used mifepristone and <b>misoprostol,</b> 6% used methotrexate and <b>misoprostol).</b> Medical abortions accounted for 32% of first trimester abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} reported adverse effect {{of taking a}} <b>misoprostol</b> by mouth {{for the prevention of}} stomach ulcers is diarrhea. In clinical trials, an average 13% of patients reported diarrhea, which was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days) and was usually self-limiting (often resolving within 8 days), but sometimes (in 2% of patients) required discontinuation of <b>misoprostol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. It acts upon gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid by G-protein coupled receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels and decreased proton pump activity at the apical surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, <b>misoprostol</b> is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. <b>Misoprostol</b> is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of gastric ulceration (e.g. with diclofenac in Arthrotec).|$|E
25|$|Most large studies {{recommend}} a protocol {{for the use}} of <b>misoprostol</b> in combination with mifepristone. Together they are effective in around 95% for early pregnancies. <b>Misoprostol</b> alone may be more effective in earlier gestation. WHO guidelines recommend for pregnancies up to 12 weeks to use 12 tablets of 200 mcg (micrograms).The woman should put 4 tablets of <b>misoprostol</b> under the tongue or far up the vagina and let them dissolve for 30 minutes.She should wait 3 hours and repeat with 4 pills under the tongue or in the vagina for 30 minutes.She should wait 3 hours and repeat once more. It works in 90% after first attempt and, in case of failure, the attempt may be repeated after a minimum of 3 days.|$|E
25|$|People who {{are taking}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) may also be {{prescribed}} a prostaglandin analogue (<b>misoprostol)</b> {{in order to help}} prevent peptic ulcers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol,</b> a {{prostaglandin}} analogue, binds to myometrial {{cells to}} cause strong myometrial contractions leading to expulsion of tissue. This agent also causes cervical ripening with softening and dilation of the cervix. <b>Misoprostol</b> binds to and stimulates prostaglandin E1 receptors, prostaglandin EP3 receptor and prostaglandin EP4 receptor but not Prostaglandin EP1 receptor and therefore {{is expected to}} have a more restricted range of physiological and potentially toxic actions than prostaglandin E2 or other analogs which activate all four prostaglandin receptors.|$|E
25|$|The largest medical {{malpractice}} award of nearly $70 million was awarded {{due to the}} use of <b>misoprostol</b> to induce labor in a California hospital.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> {{can also}} be used to dilate the cervix in {{preparation}} for a surgical abortion, particularly in the second trimester (either alone or in combination with laminaria stents).|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} the mother in the case of fetal death which did not result in miscarriage. Further {{research}} is needed to establish a safe, effective protocol.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{evidence-based}} clinical guideline by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) says medical abortion using mifepristone {{followed by}} the prostaglandin analog <b>misoprostol</b> is effective and appropriate at any gestational age.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{has long}} been used as the {{standard}} agent for labor induction, but does not work well when the cervix is not yet ripe. <b>Misoprostol</b> also {{may be used in}} conjunction with oxytocin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> is {{commonly}} used for labor induction. It causes uterine contractions and the ripening (effacement or thinning) of the cervix. It can be less expensive than the other commonly used ripening agent, dinoprostone.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{technical}} and policy guidance {{book and a}} 2014 clinical practice handbook by the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend mifepristone followed by the prostaglandin analog <b>misoprostol</b> for first and second trimester medical abortions.|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate is an {{abortifacient}} and {{is commonly}} used to terminate pregnancies during the early stages, generally in combination with <b>misoprostol.</b> It {{is also used to}} treat ectopic pregnancies, provided the fallopian tube has not ruptured.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{complaints}} {{are most often}} noted. The development of ulceration and/or bleeding requires immediate termination of treatment with diclofenac. Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment (<b>misoprostol,</b> ranitidine 150mg at bedtime or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime).|$|E
25|$|Cytoprotective {{agents are}} {{designed}} to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine. They include the medications sucralfate and <b>misoprostol.</b> If NSAIDs are being taken regularly, one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken. Another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate.|$|E
25|$|In delayed or {{incomplete}} miscarriage, treatment {{depends on}} the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus that was not expelled. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with vacuum aspiration or <b>misoprostol.</b> Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent infection.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin is {{typically}} used {{right after the}} delivery of the baby to prevent PPH. <b>Misoprostol</b> {{may be used in}} areas where oxytocin is not available. Early clamping of the umbilical cord does not decrease risks and may cause anemia in the baby, thus is usually not recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> {{should not}} be taken by {{pregnant}} women with wanted pregnancies {{to reduce the risk of}} NSAID-induced gastric ulcers because it increases uterine tone and contractions in pregnancy, which may cause partial or complete abortions, and because its use in pregnancy has been associated with birth defects.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone, {{also known}} as RU-486, is a {{medication}} typically used with <b>misoprostol</b> to bring about an abortion. This combination is more than 95% effective during the first 50 days of pregnancy. It is also effective in the second trimester of pregnancy. Effectiveness should be verified two weeks after use. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misoprostol</b> is {{regularly}} {{used in some}} Canadian hospitals for labour induction for fetal deaths early in pregnancy, and for termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. A low dose is used initially, then doubled for the remaining doses until delivery. In {{the case of a}} previous Caesarian section, however, lower doses are used.|$|E
25|$|The {{next most}} {{commonly}} reported {{adverse effects of}} taking <b>misoprostol</b> by mouth {{for the prevention of}} gastric ulcers are: abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, headache, dyspepsia, vomiting, and constipation, but none of these adverse effects occurred more often than when taking placebos. In practice, fever is almost universal when multiple doses are given every 4 to 6 hours.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{abortion}} used to {{be available}} in Canada but on a limited basis using methotrexate and <b>misoprostol.</b> Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, mifepristone was found to act faster. Health Canada gave approval to mifepristone in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|One {{clinical}} study has demonstrated {{the efficacy of}} IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though {{it should be noted}} that differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for <b>misoprostol,</b> while other have shown that gabapentin, venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective, but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.|$|E
