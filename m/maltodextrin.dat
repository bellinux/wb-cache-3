40|$| Conclusions. On {{the basis}} of this study, the {{retrogradation}} dependence on the kind of starches and the <b>maltodextrins</b> was established and the author stated that all the <b>maltodextrins</b> have a much less ability to retrogradation than the native starches. |$|R
50|$|<b>Maltodextrins</b> are {{classified}} by DE (dextrose equivalent) {{and have a}} DE between 3 and 20. The higher the DE value, the shorter the glucose chains, the higher the sweetness, the higher the solubility, and the lower heat resistance.

40|$|Wild-type Escherichia coli K- 12 {{was found}} to grow equally well on maltose and on <b>maltodextrins</b> {{containing}} up to seven glucose residues. Three classes of mutants unable to grow on <b>maltodextrins,</b> but still able to grow on maltose, were investigated in detail. The first class, already known, was composed of phage lambda-resistant mutants, which lack the outer membrane protein coded by gene lamB. These mutants grow on maltose and maltotriose but not at all on maltotetraose and longer <b>maltodextrins</b> which cannot cross the outer membrane. A second class of mutants were affected in malE, the structural gene of the periplasmic maltose binding protein. The maltose binding proteins isolated from the new mutants were altered in their substrate binding properties, {{but not in a}} way that could account for the mutant phenotypes. Rather, the results of growth experiments and transport studies suggest that these malE mutants are impaired in their ability to transport <b>maltodextrins</b> across the outer membrane. This implies that the maltose binding protein (in wild-type strains) cooperates with the lambda receptor in permeation through the outer membrane. The last class of mutants described in this paper were affected in malG, or perhaps in an as yet undetected gene close to malG. They were defective in the transfer of <b>maltodextrins</b> from the periplasmic space to the cytoplasm but only slightly affected in the transport of maltose...|$|R

40|$|Leucine is {{well known}} to {{regulate}} protein metabolism in muscle. We recently reported that enteral leucine infusion decreased proteasome activity in human duodenal mucosa and enhanced intestinal cell proliferation, but its effects on gut proteome remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effects of an enteral leucine infusion on the whole proteome of duodenal mucosa. In this work, 5 healthy volunteers received for 5 h, on 2 occasions and in random order, an enteral supply of <b>maltodextrins</b> (0. 25 g kg(- 1) h(- 1)) or <b>maltodextrins</b> supplemented with leucine (0. 035 g kg(- 1) h(- 1)). At the end of infusion, endoscopic duodenal biopsy samples were collected and analyzed by 20 -PAGE. Eleven protein spots were differentially and significantly (P< 0. 05) expressed {{in response to the}} leucine-supplemented <b>maltodextrins</b> compared with <b>maltodextrins</b> alone. Forty percent of identified proteins by mass spectrometry were located in mitochondria. Four proteins were involved in lipid metabolism: HADHA, ACADVL and CPT 2 expressions were reduced, whereas FABP 1 expression was increased. In addition, the expression of DHA kinase involved in glycerol metabolism was also downregulated. Finally, leucine supplementation altered the duodenal mucosal proteome by regulating the expression of several enzymes mainly involved in lipid metabolism. These results suggest that leucine supplementation may slowdown fatty acid beta-oxidation in human duodenal mucosa. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHomogeneous maltoporin (lamB protein), an Escherichia coli outer {{membrane}} spanning protein, {{was incorporated}} in phospholipid planar bilayers. It generates aqueous channels distinct from those {{formed by the}} non-specific porin (OmpF) or by phosphoporin (phoE protein). The single conductance, 150 pS in 1 M NACl, is much smaller {{than that of the}} porins. The channels, which are poorly selective for cations and voltage independent, are specifically inhibited by maltose and <b>maltodextrins.</b> This inhibition, observed in the absence of maltose binding protein, demonstrates that the selectivity of maltoporin for maltose and <b>maltodextrins</b> is an intrinsic property of the protein...|$|R
25|$|Like {{many other}} peptides, {{aspartame}} may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids {{under conditions of}} elevated temperature or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in <b>maltodextrin.</b> The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life {{is only a few}} days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as saccharin.|$|E

500|$|While McDonald's {{had been}} trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its {{mainline}} competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of [...] "upscale" [...] sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole leaf lettuce. Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as <b>maltodextrin</b> and sodium phosphates. The new sandwich is in response to consumer-based market trends of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} glucose and its {{oligomers}} (<b>maltodextrins)</b> on {{the stability of}} sonicated liposomes during freeze-drying were studied by monitoring the retention of the fluorescent dye, Calcein, entrapped in the liposomal inner aqueous phase and {{by the use of}} differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Glucose showed weak cryoprotective effects on dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) or egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (eggPC) liposomes, while it had a relatively high cryoprotective effect on dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes. Maltose and maltotriose showed high cryoprotective effects on eggPC liposomes, while other maltodextorin, longer oligomers, showed low cryoprotective effects. No saccharide was effective to protect DOPC liposomes. The fluidity and/or packing of lipid membranes had considerable influences on the stability of liposomes during the lyophilization. <b>Maltodextrins</b> showed relatively high cryoprotective effects on DPPC liposomes at low saccharide/lipid molar ratios, although the cryoprotective effects decreased with the increase in the molar ratios. Size measurements suggested that glucose and maltose completely prevented the aggregation and/or fusion of liposomes during lyophilization, and that other <b>maltodextrins</b> induced them due to their weak hydrophobic properties...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{retrogradation}} {{which occurs}} during the processes food storage {{is an essential}} problem in food industry. In this study, the ability to retrogradate of native starches and <b>maltodextrins</b> of different botanical origin was analysed. |$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{the genome}} {{sequence}} of Caulobacter crescentus predicts 67 TonB-dependent outer membrane proteins. To demonstrate that among them are proteins that transport nutrients other than chelated Fe 3 + and vitamin B 12 —the substrates hitherto known to be transported by TonB-dependent transporters—the outer membrane protein profile of cells grown on different substrates was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Maltose induced the synthesis of a hitherto unknown 99. 5 -kDa protein, designated here as MalA, encoded by the cc 2287 genomic locus. MalA mediated growth on <b>maltodextrins</b> and transported [14 C]maltodextrins from [14 C]maltose to [14 C]maltopentaose. [14 C]maltose transport showed biphasic kinetics, with a fast initial rate and a slower second rate. The initial transport had a Kd of 0. 2 μM, while the second transport had a Kd of 5 μM. It is proposed that the fast rate reflects binding to MalA and the second rate reflects transport into the cells. Energy depletion of cells by 100 μM carbonyl cyanide 3 -chlorophenylhydrazone abolished maltose binding and transport. Deletion of the malA gene diminished maltose transport to 1 % of the wild-type malA strain and impaired transport of the larger <b>maltodextrins.</b> The malA mutant was unable to grow on <b>maltodextrins</b> larger than maltotetraose. Deletion of two C. crescentus genes homologous to the exbB exbD genes of Escherichia coli abolished [14 C]maltodextrin binding and transport and growth on <b>maltodextrins</b> larger than maltotetraose. These mutants also showed impaired growth on Fe 3 +-rhodotorulate as the sole iron source, which provided evidence of energy-coupled transport. Unexpectedly, a deletion mutant of a tonB homolog transported maltose at the wild-type rate and grew on all <b>maltodextrins</b> tested. Since Fe 3 +-rhodotorulate served as an iron source for the tonB mutant, an additional gene encoding a protein with a TonB function is postulated. Permeation of maltose and maltotriose through the outer membrane of the C. crescentus malA mutant was slower than permeation through the outer membrane of an E. coli lamB mutant, which suggests a low porin activity in C. crescentus. The pores of the C. crescentus porins are slightly larger than those of E. coli K- 12, since maltotetraose supported growth of the C. crescentus malA mutant but failed to support growth of the E. coli lamB mutant. The data {{are consistent with the}} proposal that binding of <b>maltodextrins</b> to MalA requires energy and MalA actively transports <b>maltodextrins</b> with Kd values 1, 000 -fold smaller than those for the LamB porin and 100 -fold larger than those for the vitamin B 12 and ferric siderophore outer membrane transporters. MalA is the first example of an outer membrane protein for which an ExbB/ExbD-dependent transport of a nutrient other than iron and vitamin B 12 has been demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|In this study, two {{crystallized}} <b>maltodextrins</b> {{were generated}} that consist {{of the same}} oligoglucan pattern but differ strikingly in the physical order of double helices. As revealed by x-ray diffraction, they represent the highly ordered A- and B-type allomorphs. Both crystallized <b>maltodextrins</b> were similar in size distribution and birefringence. They were used as model substrates to study the consecutive action of the two starch-related dikinases, the glucan, water dikinase and the phosphoglucan, water dikinase. The glucan, water dikinase and the phosphoglucan, water dikinase selectively esterify glucosyl residues in the C 6 and C 3 positions, respectively. Recombinant glucan, water dikinase phosphorylated both allomorphs with similar rates and caused complete glucan solubilization. Soluble neutral <b>maltodextrins</b> inhibited the glucan, water dikinase-mediated phosphorylation of crystalline particles. Recombinant phosphoglucan, water dikinase phosphorylated both the A- and B-type allomorphs only following a prephosphorylation by the glucan, water dikinase, and the activity increased with the extent of prephosphorylation. The action of the phosphoglucan, water dikinase on the prephosphorylated A- and B-type allomorphs differed. When acting on the B-type allomorph, by far more phosphoglucans were solubilized {{as compared with the}} A type. However, with both allomorphs, the phosphoglucan, water dikinase formed significant amounts of monophosphorylated phosphoglucans. Thus, the enzyme is capable of acting on neutral <b>maltodextrins.</b> It is concluded that the actual carbohydrate substrate of the phosphoglucan, water dikinase is defined by physical rather than by chemical parameters. A model is proposed that explains, at the molecular level, the consecutive action of the two starch-related dikinases...|$|R
40|$|The maltose {{system in}} Escherichia coli {{consists}} of cell envelope-associated proteins and enzymes that catalyze the uptake and utilization of maltose and alpha, 1 - 4 -linked <b>maltodextrins.</b> The {{presence of these}} sugars in the growth medium induces the maltose system (exogenous induction), even though only maltotriose has been identified in vitro as an inducer (O. Raibaud and E. Richet, J. Bacteriol., 169 : 3059 - 3061, 1987). Induction is dependent on MalT, the positive regulator protein of the system. In the presence of exogenous glucose, the maltose system is normally repressed because of catabolite repression and inducer exclusion {{brought about by the}} phosphotransferase-mediated vectorial phosphorylation of glucose. In contrast, the increase of free, unphosphorylated glucose in the cell induces the maltose system. A ptsG ptsM glk mutant which cannot grow on glucose can accumulate [14 C]glucose via galactose permeases. In this strain, internal glucose is polymerized to maltose, maltotriose, and <b>maltodextrins</b> in which only the reducing glucose residue is labeled. This polymerization does not require maltose enzymes, since it still occurs in malT mutants. Formation of <b>maltodextrins</b> from external glucose as well as induction of the maltose system is absent in a mutant lacking phosphoglucomutase, and induction by external glucose could be regained by the addition of glucose- 1 -phosphate entering the cells via a constitutive glucose phosphate transport system. malQ mutants, which lack amylomaltase, are constitutive for the expression of the maltose genes. This constitutive nature is due to the formation of maltose and <b>maltodextrins</b> from the degradation of glycogen...|$|R
