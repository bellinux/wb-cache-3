5|$|Al-Talaba {{finished}} as runners-up in the 2002–03 season, finishing {{two points}} behind champions Al-Shorta. In the 2002–03 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, {{they reached the}} final but were defeated 1–0 by Al-Shorta. Al-Talaba's Ahmad Salah was named the best player of the tournament. They retained the Iraq FA Cup by defeating Al-Mina'a 1–0 with Alaa Kadhim's goal in the closing <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> defeating Al-Shorta in the final 1–0 at the Franso Hariri Stadium with Ahmad Salah's goal in the 26th minute.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 <b>minutes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E

5|$|The leftmost division, {{advanced}} on La Haye Sainte. The farmhouse was {{defended by}} the King's German Legion. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out {{to either side}} and, {{with the support of}} several squadrons of cuirassiers, succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.|$|E
5|$|The onslaught {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced {{it in the air}} to point. Yardley dived forward and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202halfway to the required totalwith 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, once they are clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Some {{studies in}} dental {{research}} {{have shown that}} knocked out teeth that have been dry for up to one hour will have less resorption if they are soaked in a HBSS for 30 minutes prior to replantation. In these studies, dog’s teeth were extracted and left dry for 30, 45 and 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> soaked in HBSS for 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reimplanted. These teeth showed 50% less replacement resorption following reimplantation. It {{has also been shown}} that keeping the teeth cold while in the HBSS does not affect success.|$|E
25|$|The crowd were roaring their applause {{at every}} run now as Australia swept to 152 for 3 in 140 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Chappell, hooking and driving and cutting with a will, took 14 of 17 from D'Oliveira's sixth over.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Namu {{developed a}} bacterial infection which damaged his nervous system, {{causing him to}} become nonresponsive to people. During his illness he charged full-speed into the wire mesh of his pen, thrashed violently for a few <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> died.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting often {{occurs during}} the first hour or two of {{treatment}} with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration {{since most of the}} fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> start to give the solution again more slowly.|$|E
25|$|Rice bran is {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} guano {{for the purpose of}} exfoliation. The powder is mixed with water yielding a paste. The paste is massaged into the skin for a few <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> it is rinsed off. The facial is usually rather odorless and sanitized. The added rice bran can also neutralize the slight musky odor.|$|E

25|$|The {{ceremony}} {{began with}} a race between the track-layers and crews from the eastern and western ends of construction. The last mile had been left unfinished and each crew was timed to see who could complete their last half mile the fastest. The eastern crew won {{by a margin of}} only a few <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the western crew placed the last rail.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{replaced}} Harragin. The South Wales side {{consisted of}} players from Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. The game was virtually won {{on the first}} day when the West Indians won the toss, scored 324 and had the South Wales team at 93/6. The tourists were 23/4 but Sydney Smith again batted well scoring 140* in 145 minutes. He added 126 with Lebrun Constantine in 65 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> 110 with Richard Ollivierre in 70 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The patrol ships took up station one {{either side}} of Gulflight, Iago close on the {{starboard}} side and Filey further ahead on the port. While under escort, Gulflight's second officer, Paul Bowers, reported sighting a submarine ahead some 28 minutes before the ship was hit. He reported this to the captain who decided that the submarine must be British, as the escorts had not reacted to its presence. The submarine was visible for 5 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> disappeared.|$|E

25|$|The {{first tour}} match {{was against the}} Bay of Plenty Steamers on 4 June in Rotorua. The Lions started the match strongly, with Josh Lewsey scoring a try after two <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a second four minutes later. The Lions were up 17–0 after 11 minutes but the Steamers {{recovered}} for a 17–17 half-time score. The Lions controlled the second half and won 34–20. A significant injury was the fractured ankle suffered by experienced back-rower Lawrence Dallaglio, who had {{to withdraw from the}} tour.|$|E
25|$|As Premier League teams, both Manchester United and Newcastle United {{entered the}} 1998–99 FA Cup in the Third Round Proper, with Newcastle drawn {{at home to}} First Division Crystal Palace, and Manchester United at home to fellow Premier League side Middlesbrough, the last team to beat them all season. Despite having goalkeeper Shay Given sent off within the first 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> going 1–0 down, Newcastle were able to come from behind to beat Crystal Palace in their tie, while Manchester United also came from behind against Middlesbrough to win 3–1.|$|E
25|$|The game {{started off}} well for Scotland, student James How scoring after just four <b>minutes.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> minutes later Tait doubled the Bravehearts lead. But the Russia Bears dragged {{themselves}} {{back into the}} match, stand-off Victor Netchaev scoring first, and in the 30th minute Alexander Otradnov scored. Scotland were ahead though at half-time by four points because Russia had failed to convert their tries. In the second half it was all Scotland with only Andrey Scheglov's drop goal adding to the Bears points. On the other hand, former Great Britain international Hugh Waddell, Ali Blee and Tait again all scored to seal a Scottish victory.|$|E
