5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> within three months. Following a general election, the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice.|$|E

Beginning on August 21, {{the commissioners}} met with a committee of westerners that included Brackenridge and Gallatin. The government commissioners told the committee that it must unanimously agree to renounce violence and submit to U.S. laws, and that a popular referendum <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> {{to determine if the}} local people supported the decision. Those who agreed to these terms would be given amnesty from further prosecution.|$|E

The tungsten electrode <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold.

5|$|The next presidential {{election}} in Croatia is due to be held no more than 60 and no less than 30 days before the expiry of the incumbent president's term, {{as stated in the}} Constitution of Croatia. If the current president serves out her full term, which began on 19 February 2015 and lasts for 5 years, the election <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> on a date between 21 December 2019 and 20 January 2020.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} President falls vacant upon the expiry of the incumbent's six-year term {{or if the}} President is for some reason unable to {{complete}} his or her term; for example, due to death, resignation or removal from office for misconduct or mental or physical infirmity. If the office of President becomes vacant before the incumbent's term expires, a poll for an election <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> within six months. In other cases, an election can take place any time from {{three months before the}} expiry of the incumbent's term of office.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E

5|$|In case {{of death}} or {{resignation}} {{submitted to the}} President of the Constitutional Court and communicated to the Speaker of the parliament, or in cases when the Constitutional Court decides to terminate the presidential term through impeachment, the Speaker of the parliament becomes acting president. In those circumstances, new legislation is countersigned by the prime minister instead {{of the president and}} a new presidential election <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> within 60 days. This situation occurred after the death of Franjo Tuđman on 10 December 1999, when Vlatko Pavletić became the acting president. After the parliamentary elections of 2000, the role was transferred to Zlatko Tomčić, who filled the office until Stjepan Mesić was elected President of Croatia in 2000.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{she ought to be}} sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.|$|E
5|$|The President must {{declare the}} office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy. A general election <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> within three months after the dissolution of Parliament. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls.|$|E

5|$|Sabah (together {{with its}} {{neighbour}} of Sarawak) {{has a certain}} level of autonomy in administration, immigration, and judiciary which differentiates it from the West Malaysian Peninsula states. The Yang di-Pertua Negeri sits {{at the top of the}} hierarchy followed by the state legislative assembly and the state cabinet. It is the head of state although its functions are largely ceremonial. The chief minister is the head of government as well the leader of the state cabinet. The legislature is based on the Westminster system and therefore the chief minister is appointed based on his or her ability to command the majority of the state assembly. While local authorities being fully appointed by the state government owing to the suspension of local elections by the federal government. Legislation regarding state elections are within the powers of the federal government and not the state. The assembly meets at the state capital, Kota Kinabalu. Members of the state assembly are elected from 73 constituencies which are delineated by the Election Commission of Malaysia and may not necessarily result in constituencies of same voter population sizes. A general election representatives in the state assembly <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> every five years, when the seats are subject of universal suffrage for all citizens above 21 years of age. Sabah is also represented in the federal parliament by 25 members elected from the same number of constituencies. The present elected state and federal government posts are held by Barisan Nasional (BN), a coalition of parties which includes United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP), United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO), Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS), Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA).|$|E
5|$|The 48th Battalion {{returned}} to its former positions on the railway embankment {{on the night of}} 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company in a trench called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the embankment. He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning.|$|E
