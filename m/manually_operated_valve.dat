50|$|A {{piston valve}} can also {{refer to a}} 2-way 2-position, {{pilot-operated}} spool valve. The term is extremely popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back {{by the force of}} the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valve.</b> Functionally these types of valves are comparable to quick exhaust valves.|$|E

This paper investigates the accidental simultaneous closure of two automatic control valves during initial testing of the test rig. The simultaneous closure of both valves has induced upsurge and downsurge at the same time. Large water hammer and column separation have caused failure of pipe supports and leakage at pipe joints. The incident was caused by a fault in an electronic conversion box due to power failure.

40|$|The {{sanitation}} agent container, {{which was}} selected {{in a trade}} off study, employs two chambers, a rigid outer container and an inner flexible bladder. The bladder contains the sanitation agent formulation and its release is controlled by a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valve.</b> The outer container holds a high pressure vapor. There is no void in the bladder which makes the package operation independent of orientation and therefore usable in zero gravity. Foam is developed by a low boiling point fluid or dissolved in the product. When the product is dispensed at atmospheric presure, the evolved gas or vapor whips up a goam in the valve. The sanitation agents were initially formulated with freons which produces an excellent foam.

40|$|The figure depicts an {{apparatus}} for mechanical testing of nuts. In the original application {{for which the}} apparatus was developed, the nuts are of a frangible type designed for use with pyrotechnic devices in spacecraft applications {{in which there are}} requirements for rapid, one-time separations of structures that are bolted together. The apparatus {{can also be used to}} test nonfrangible nuts engaged without pyrotechnic devices. This apparatus was developed to replace prior testing systems that were extremely heavy and immobile and characterized by long setup times (of the order of an hour for each nut to be tested). This apparatus is mobile, and the setup for each test can now be completed in about five minutes. The apparatus can load a nut under test with a static axial force of as much as 6. 8 x 10 (exp 5) lb (3. 0 MN) and a static moment of as much as 8. 5 x 10 (exp 4) lb in. (9. 6 x 10 (exp 3) N(raised dot) m) for a predetermined amount of time. In the case of a test of a frangible nut, the pyrotechnic devices can be exploded to break the nut while the load is applied, in which case the breakage of the nut relieves the load. The apparatus can be operated remotely for safety during an explosive test. The load-generating portion of the apparatus is driven by low-pressure compressed air; the remainder of the apparatus is driven by 110 -Vac electricity. From its source, the compressed air is fed to the apparatus through a regulator and a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valve.</b> The regulated compressed air is fed to a pneumatically driven hydraulic pump, which pressurizes oil in a hydraulic cylinder, thereby causing a load to be applied via a hydraulic nut (not to be confused with the nut under test). During operation, the hydraulic pressure is correlated with the applied axial load, which is verified by use of a load cell. Prior to operation, one end of a test stud (which could be an ordinary threaded rod or bolt) is installed in the hydraulic nut. The other end of the test stud passes through a bearing plate; a load cell is slid onto that end, and then the nut to be tested is threaded onto that end and tightened until the nut and load cell press gently against the bearing plate...|$|E

50|$|The de Rivaz engine had no timing {{mechanism}} {{and the introduction}} of the fuel mixture and ignition were all under manual control. The compressed hydrogen gas fuel was stored in a balloon connected by a pipe to the cylinder. Oxygen was supplied from the air by a separate air inlet. <b>Manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> allowed introduction of the gas and air at the correct point in the cycle. A lever worked by hand moved a secondary, opposed, piston. This evacuated the exhaust gases, sucked in a fresh mixture and closed the inlet and exhaust valves. A Volta cell was used to ignite the gas within the cylinder by pressing an external button that created an electric spark inside the cylinder. The explosion drove the piston freely up the vertically mounted cylinder, storing the energy by lifting the heavy piston to an elevated position. The piston returned under its own weight and engaged a ratchet that connected the piston rod to a pulley. This pulley was in turn attached to a drum around which a rope was wound. The rope's other end was attached to a second drum on the charette's front wheels. The weight of the piston during its return down the cylinder was enough to turn the drums and move the charette. When the return stroke was over, the ratchet allowed the top drum to disconnect from the piston rod ready for the next powered lift of the piston.|$|R

50|$|A similar {{situation}} {{occurred during the}} Chernobyl disaster: after the reactor was destroyed and began to burn, a liquid corium mass from the melting core began to breach the concrete floor of the reactor vessel, which was situated above the bubbler pool (a large water reservoir for emergency pumps, also designed to safely contain steam pipe ruptures). The RBMK had no allowance or planning for core meltdowns, and the imminent interaction of the core mass with the bubbler pool would have produced a massive steam explosion, likely destroying the entire plant (vastly increasing the spread and magnitude of the radioactive plume). It was therefore necessary to drain the bubbler pool before the corium reached it. However, the initial explosion had broken the control circuitry which allowed the pool to be emptied. Three volunteer divers were required to <b>manually</b> <b>operate</b> the <b>valves</b> necessary to drain this pool, and later images of the corium mass in the pipes of the bubbler pool's basement reinforced the heroic necessity of their actions.|$|R
40|$|A {{processing}} {{facility in}} Trenton, Ky owned by HydroSolutions {{is in need}} of modernization in order to increase efficiency in the mixing process, improve the safety of the facility, and give the facility the ability to expand in the future. The main idea of HydroSolution’s processing strategies is based on a lean manufacturing policy, and as such this zero waste mentality must be maintained after the modifications have been completed. The plant produces a number of chemical combinations that are provided mainly to rendering facilities, as well as other companies in order to remove odors and unwanted chemicals from air streams. For the facility to accomplish the goals listed previously, modifications to existing equipment as well as the addition of new equipment have been recommended. The mixing station within the facility will be refabricated, utilizing semi-permanent vessels to hold raw material, as well as involve two larger storage vessels outside for the raw materials that are used more often. Pumps will be installed to load and unload every vessel. The entire mixing system will switch from a gravity driven system using <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> to a pump driven system that utilizes automatic valves. A new software system will be implemented to connect the valves with flow meters in order to mix the product combinations accurately and automatically. The entire system will be designed to create the smallest amount of waste possible in order to fulfill the demands of HydroSolutions. These modifications will greatly improve the efficiency of the facility. A process that would usually be done by two or more operators manually will now be replaced by a process that will be done automatically by one operator. The amount of possible leaks and drip sites on the mixing station has been reduced, increasing the safety and cleanliness within the facility. With these new modifications, the facility will be able to produce more product than ever before, and do so while wasting little to no raw material...|$|R
40|$|Any {{detectable}} leakage {{emanating from}} the argon storage dewar is undesirable; not only from a safety standpoint (eg, cryogenic burns, asphyxiation, etc.), but also small amounts of air back diffusing through leaks can render the argon unsuitable for the future physics experiments to take place within the cryostats. Whereas leakage {{through some of the}} control and <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> on the dewar does not necessarily infroduce any of the above hazards directly, it could be high enough to be an economical, and perhaps an operational nuisance. Contained in the following is a compilation of the final leakage rates associated with the dewar during the period of January through May of 1990 and the raw data from which they were derived from. Also contained is a calculation of the total maximum allowable leakage rate int%ut of the dewar. The general strategy employed while leak checking the dewar was to eliminate all leaks found which could be relatively easily stopped and to reduce the more difficult ones to an acceptable level. Leakage past the seats/plugs of control and main relief valves in addition to leakage past the ball seals in the diverter valve fell into the latter category. Helium mass spectrometer leak detector (HMSLD), rate of rise (ROR) method, and throughput calculations based on effective pumping speeds were the means used to determine leakage rates. Usually the HMSLD method was used to detect the numerous smaller leaks (1 OE-S to 1 OE- 1 0 std eels) which were eventually stopped by thread tightening, gasket replacement. redesign, etc. The ROR method helped measure the leakage past valve plugs and establish outgassing rates for volumes deemed as being tight; ie, no detectable leakage using the HMSLD. The throughput calculation was used only to determine the relatively large leak past the plug/seat of the vaporizer valve. A sample calculation of each leakage rate determining method is attached to this note. All leakage rates are given for helium gas at one atm differential...|$|R
