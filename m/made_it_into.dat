The Undertaker {{defeated}} Kama {{in a dark}} match at In Your House 1, and again in a casket match at In Your House 2. He then won another casket match against Kama at SummerSlam 1995 to end the feud.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a rich history, having {{played a role in}} the French and Indian War, the American Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. Italian inventor, Guglielmo Marconi {{received}} the first transatlantic wireless signal in St. John's. Its history and culture have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|After his {{problems}} in the first session, Vettel was fastest in the second session on Friday afternoon. Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to stop their session early.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{has barely}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his new flat in London {{when his father}} dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
50|$|Both Asterix and The Smurfs {{were much}} more popular in Europe, {{and most of the}} games in their {{respective}} series never <b>made</b> <b>it</b> over <b>into</b> the North American market.|$|R

5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. Although none of these proposals ever <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E
50|$|In {{the kickoff}} classic on August 29, Nebraska routed {{defending}} national champion Penn State, 44-6. Penn State opened with 3 losses and never <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>into</b> the top 20. They were replaced {{in the top}} 5 by Notre Dame.|$|R
25|$|The Iowa Women's Ultimate team, Saucy Nancy, {{has also}} been very {{successful}} in years past. In 2011 the team tied for 5th at the College Championship in Boulder, Colorado. Then in 2013, Saucy <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>into</b> the College Championship in Madison, Wisconsin, and this time tied for 3rd.|$|R
50|$|The PC {{version was}} {{actually}} developed before the 3DO version, {{but due to}} {{a limited number of}} copies being <b>made</b> <b>it</b> faded <b>into</b> obscurity; <b>it</b> however was uploaded to archive.org and {{can be found on the}} Internet Archive. It features higher-quality audio than the 3DO version and uncensored cutscenes.|$|R
5|$|The 2007–08 {{season was}} the 110th season of {{competitive}} football played by Arsenal. The club ended their Premier League campaign in third position, having led {{the table for}} two-thirds of the season. Arsenal <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League, but were eliminated on aggregate score against Liverpool. The team exited the FA Cup in the fifth round to Manchester United and lost in the semi-finals of the League Cup to Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage and the {{condition}} of West Bridge led to some erroneous reports of her loss. News articles on 24 August in both The New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune reported the loss of West Bridge, and the mistaken information also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> book form. Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson, in their work The Road to France: The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies, 1917–1918, repeat the misinformation {{about the loss of}} West Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} the three {{companies}} of 4-503 were chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion. On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved out to take the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the PAVN trench line but were ordered to pull back as darkness fell.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, on the {{occasion}} of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Opus released another version of [...] "Live Is Life", which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> again <b>into</b> the top ten in Austria. The song was re-recorded once more by the group in 2008, both in a solo version and featuring Jerry.|$|R

5000|$|Comedian Allan Sherman was the producer, and Stefan Hatos was {{executive}} producer; The shows {{theme music}} was [...] "The Comedians," [...] an orchestral composition by Dmitri Kabalevsky. The oversensitivity {{of the show}} towards advertisers and political correctness complaints, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> fall <b>into</b> a hoax of the satirical magazine The Realist, in 1960.|$|R
5|$|The walrus and {{polar bear}} hunts were filmed in July 1932 at Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea. Walrus {{carcasses}} {{were used as}} dog food and to attract polar bears. Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted polar bears by roping and drowning them, but little of this footage <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the picture.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's songs Mistä löydän ystävän ("Where Do I Find a Friend") and Maanantaitango ("Monday Tango") {{had already}} been {{recorded}} by Katri Helena in 1963 before Vainio's military service. After leaving the army, Vainio befriended composer and music journalist Sauvo Puhtila (known to the Finnish public by the pseudonym Saukki), who told him that Yleisradio {{was in need of}} lyricists. Eager to leave his job as a teacher, Vainio quit and started collaborating with musician Reino Markkula. Their song Sä kuulut päivään jokaiseen ("You Belong in Every Day"), composed by Markkula with lyrics by Vainio, was given to Eino Grön who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a hit.|$|E
5|$|Vettel set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} second part of {{qualifying}} as well, being two-tenths faster than second placed Daniil Kvyat. While Max Verstappen <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, his teammate Sainz hit the wall in turn 19 close to the end of the session, damaging his suspension and front wing, with parts of debris left on the track. With the session ending under yellow flags, both Force India and both McLaren drivers joined Sainz in elimination, with Nico Hülkenberg fastest in eleventh place on the grid. Everyone behind Sainz failed to finish their laps, including Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.|$|E
50|$|In July, {{she played}} the {{semifinal}} of Istanbul (beating - amongst others - Francesca Schiavone and Alizé Cornet) and the quarterfinal of Baku. Thanks to these two good results, she <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>into</b> the top 100. She proceeded to play the final of 100k ITF Vancouver, where she lost to Johanna Konta from Britain.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} Idol, Erik {{released his}} debut single, [...] "Higher", which debuted at {{number one on}} Sverigetopplistan. One week later, his self-titled debut album [...] "Erik Grönwall" [...] was released, which included songs performed during the Idol shows. The album <b>made</b> <b>it</b> right <b>into</b> the number one spot on Sverigetopplistan. The album has been certified with platinum.|$|R
60|$|Its {{bright colors}} pleased the Chink, who ripped <b>it</b> up and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> over <b>into</b> a Chinese robe, with flowing draperies falling to his heels. He dressed {{himself in his}} new costume and, being proud of {{possessing}} such finery, {{sat down on a}} bench outside his door so that everyone passing by could see how magnificent he looked.|$|R
5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.|$|E
5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
50|$|If {{the show}} is popular or lucrative, {{and a number of}} episodes (usually 100 episodes or more) are <b>made,</b> <b>it</b> goes <b>into</b> {{broadcast}} syndication (in the United States) where rights to broadcast the program are then resold for cash or put into a barter exchange (offered to an outlet for free in exchange for airing additional commercials elsewhere in the station's broadcast day).|$|R
50|$|On April 25, 1861, Syren {{was beating}} out of San Francisco, near the {{entrance}} to the Golden Gate, when she struck Mile Rock two times. Syren <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back <b>into</b> the harbor with four feet of water in her hold. She was nearly sinking {{by the time she was}} beached on the mud flats. Repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard cost $15,000.|$|R
50|$|Eight or so {{species from}} only two {{families}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{almost to the}} end of the Cretaceous, the order having gone through a more or less steady decline since the middle of the period. Six other families <b>made</b> <b>it</b> well <b>into</b> the upper Maastrichtian (uppermost stage of the Cretaceous), but were extinct well before the end. All told, 11 families entered the Maastrichtian, a decline from the 19 families known from the Cenomanian in the middle of the Cretaceous.|$|R
