50|$|The {{beach is}} {{extremely}} planar and composed of comparatively well-sorted fine and <b>medium</b> <b>sand,</b> {{with a few}} stray cobbles of uncertain but probable ice-rafted origin. Dunes occur in the back beach, stabilized by grass, attaining a height of ca. 4 m. The sand is considered by geologists to reflect multiple sources. Its most common constituent, a fine quartose sand is most dense on the shallow shelf north of Bering Strait and reflects a complex history. A significant amount of Yukon River sand entered the southern Chukchi Sea during the Holocene transgression, hypothetically forming and reworking a series of early Holocene barriers into a retreat massif {{similar to that of}} the mid-Atlantic.|$|E
5000|$|ISO 14688 grades sands as fine, {{medium and}} coarse with ranges 0.063 mm to 0.2 mm to 0.63 mm to 2.0 mm.

These sizes {{are based on}} the Krumbein phi scale, where size in Φ = -log2D; D being the particle size in mm. On this scale, for sand the value of Φ varies from −1 to +4, with the divisions between sub-categories at whole numbers.|$|E
50|$|A {{secondary}} {{source of}} sand {{may be as}} a fluvial addition from south-trending paleo-Noatak and Kobuk rivers cross the exposed subcontinent of Beringia, and reworked into Pleistocene dunes during lower sea levels. The dark <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> reflects updrift bluff erosion of a tephraeous maar eruption about 17,000 years ago. Sand supply is maintained by onshore transport during a five-month open water period from June to November. Although in the long-term, as established by geological 14C ages, over the last 4000 years, sand transport is onshore and progradational, in the short term, storms and transient current reversals lead to offshore transport and erosion of Espenberg beaches. Locally, beaches have witnessed significant width and depth reductions {{in the last five}} years; current reversals are also possibly more common.|$|E

The mean grain sizes in the coarse and <b>medium</b> <b>sands</b> dominate in the first 100 m from the shoreline. Further landward, the maximum mean grain size is in the medium and the fine sand classes.

30|$|The spatial {{distributions}} of magnetic susceptibility and ARM intensity data obtained {{at the peak}} AF of 100  mT (Fig.  2 b, c) showed higher values along the lakeshore at water depths less than 5  m, and this area included the sites around {{the mouth of the}} Shichinohe-gawa and Sadoro-gawa rivers in the southwest part of the lake and the sites near the Takase-gawa River in the northeast part. The bottom sediments at these sites are dominated by <b>medium</b> <b>sands</b> (Fig.  2 a), which suggests that magnetic minerals of detrital origin were transported into the lake both from the watershed to the southwest and by erosion of the sandbar on the Pacific coast near the mouth of the Takase-gawa River.|$|R
30|$|The {{aquifers}} mainly {{consist of}} quaternary alluvial deposits, principally sandy gravels, <b>medium</b> and fine <b>sands,</b> sandy clays and silts. Underlain {{and surrounded by}} structurally disturbed base rocks of pre-Quaternary and older epochs, the thickness of aquifer varies from 50 to 300  m. Generally speaking, the thickness of sediments around the Suibin city in the west {{part of the study}} area is about 300  m and the size of deposits is coarser than other parts. The sediment around the line of Tongjiang-Fujin-Shuangyashan is mainly <b>medium</b> <b>sands</b> in a range of 50 – 100  m in thickness and the pre-Quaternary rocks crop out can be found beside the Fujin area (Yang et al. 2008). Vertically, the grain size of quaternary deposits in the layer above 60  m in depth is coarse, constituting the main aquifer in Sanjiang plain. Based on the 14 C (Yi and Wang 2004) and CFCs (Cao et al. 2013) age dating results, the groundwater samples in this study have been classified into shallow groundwater and deep groundwater samples with sampling depth smaller than 50  m and larger than 50  m, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{grain size}} for these well-sorted, very fine to <b>medium</b> <b>sands</b> is about 0.06 to 0.5 mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and {{anchored}} by vegetation, {{as are the}} corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.|$|R

It consists of complexly interbedded, thin, and discontinuous beds of basalt, hyaloclastite, and sandstone. Within {{the lower part}} of the Cardenas Basalt, the basaltic lavas are highly fractured and weather into rubble that is about 10 to 30 cm in diameter. The lava within this unit consists of pahoehoe lava flows of olivine-rich basalt. Within {{the lower part of}} the Cardenas Basalt, the lava is highly altered and might have been glassy at one time. Near the top of the lower unit the basalt is more massive and less altered. The hyaloclastite is highly altered, and contains secondary chlorite, epidote, talc, and zeolites. Although this unit is highly altered and weathered, many of the primary features are preserved. Thin discontinuous sandstone beds are interbedded with lava flows and hyaloclastite. The brown, maroon, purple sandstones consist of texturally immature, planar-bedded, poorly sorted quartz and feldspar in a matrix of mica and clay. The coarser grains range from <b>medium</b> <b>sand</b> to silt.|$|E
