5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as <b>maternal</b> <b>inheritance.</b> This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or <b>maternal</b> <b>inheritance)</b> was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E

25|$|This type of inheritance, {{also known}} as <b>maternal</b> <b>inheritance,</b> applies to genes encoded by {{mitochondrial}} DNA.

25|$|Currently, few {{extensive}} phylogenetic {{studies of}} the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker et al. explored subfamily and tribe relationships using chloroplast DNA from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes.

The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested {{the lack of a}} fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, homoplasy in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard DNA markers, and character polarization. However, hybridization has been observed among Orbignya and Phoenix species, and using chloroplast DNA in cladistic studies may produce inaccurate results due to <b>maternal</b> <b>inheritance</b> of the chloroplast DNA. Chemical and molecular data from non-organelle DNA, for example, could be more effective for studying palm phylogeny.|$|E

500|$|When Henry II {{was born}} in 1133, his grandfather, Henry I, was {{reportedly}} delighted, saying that the boy was [...] "the heir to the kingdom". The birth reduced {{the risk that the}} King's realm would pass to his son-in-law's family, which might have occurred if the marriage of Matilda and Geoffrey had proved childless. The birth of a second son, also named Geoffrey, increased the likelihood that, in accordance with French custom, Henry would receive the English <b>maternal</b> <b>inheritance</b> and Geoffrey the Angevin paternal inheritance. This would separate the realms of England and Anjou. In order to secure an orderly succession, Geoffrey and Matilda sought more power from Henry I, but quarrelled with him after the King refused to give them power that might be used against him. When he died in December 1135, the couple were in Anjou, allowing Matilda's cousin Stephen to seize the crown of England. Stephen's contested accession initiated the widespread civil unrest later called the Anarchy.|$|E
500|$|As society {{became more}} prosperous and stable in the 11th century, {{inheritance}} customs developed [...] that allowed daughters (in {{the absence of}} sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler Ralph de Diceto noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest. The marriage of Geoffrey to {{the daughter of a}} king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context. [...] It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito’s rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as Theobald II, Count of Champagne or Stephen of Blois who in the event did seize King Henry’s English crown. King Henry’s great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as [...] "the heir to the Kingdom", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the <b>maternal</b> <b>inheritance</b> passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, Geoffrey.|$|E

These mechanisms were tested by determining {{the modes of}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance and transmission {{in the absence of}} mating locus heterokaryon incompatibility following crosses of uninucleate strains of Neurospora tetrasperma with trichogyne (trichogyne inoculated by conidia) and without trichogyne (hyphal fusion). <b>Maternal</b> uniparental mitochondrial <b>inheritance</b> was observed in 136 single ascospore progeny following both mating with and without trichogyne using mtDNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms to distinguish parental types.

Following hyphal fusion, mututally exclusive nuclear migration permitted investigation of reciprocal interactions.

40|$|The {{majority}} of angiosperms display <b>maternal</b> plastid <b>inheritance.</b> The cytological mechanisms of {{this mode of}} inheritance have been well studied, but {{little is known about}} its genetic relationship to biparental inheritance. The angiosperm Chlorophytum comosum is unusual in that different pollen grains show traits of different modes of plastid inheritance. About 50 % of these pollen grains exhibit the potential for biparental plastid inheritance, whereas the rest exhibit <b>maternal</b> plastid <b>inheritance.</b> There is no morphological difference between these two types of pollen. Pollen grains from different individuals of C. comosum all exhibited this variability. Closer examination revealed that plastid polarization occurs, with plastids being excluded from the generative cell during the first pollen mitosis. However, the exclusion is incomplete in 50 % of the pollen grains, and the few plastids distributed to the generative cells divide actively after mitosis. Immunoelectron microscopy using an anti-DNA antibody demonstrated that the plastids contain a large amount of DNA. As there is a considerable discrepancy between the exclusion and duplication of plastids, resulting in plastids with opposite fates occurring simultaneously in C. comosum, we propose that the species is a transitional type with a mode of plastid inheritance that is genetically intermediate between the maternal and biparental modes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of maternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance in animals {{can be said}} to be the selective elimination of sperm mtDNA via the elimination factor of the egg and a sperm mitochondria-specific factor. In 2005, we clarified that t-tpis (Spag 1 isoform 1) is a mitochondria-specific translocator and the sperm factor, and furthermore estimated that the elimination factors of the egg are the divalent cation-dependent endonuclease and s-tpis (Spag 1 isoform 2 and isoform 3) as the elimination system-specific chaperone [K. Hayashida, K. Omagari, J. Masuda, H. Hazama, Y. Kadokawa, K. Ohba, S.

This time, using a recombinant Spag 1 isoform 1 protein, a pull-down assay of ovary cytosol was performed and the elimination factors searched for. Surprisingly, an endogenous retroviral integrase fragment (Eri 15) was identified using mass spectrometry of the electrophoresis band of the pull-down protein. Eri 15 was detected as a complex of approximately 500 kDa with Spag 1 isoform 2 or isoform 3 in native PAGE of the ovary cytosol.

40|$|Epifluorescence {{microscopic}} {{detection of}} organelle DNA in the mature generative cell is a rapid method {{for determining the}} potential for the mode of cytoplasmic inheritance. We used this method to examine 19 of the known 22 to 27 species in the genus Syringa. Organelle DNA was undetectable in seven species, all in the subgenus Syringa, but was detected in the 12 species examined of the subgenera Syringa and Ligustrina. Therefore, species within the genus Syringa display differences in the potential cytoplasmic inheritance. Closer examination revealed that the mature generative cells of the species in which organelle DNA was detected contained both mitochondria and plastids, but cells of the species lacking detectable organelle DNA contained only mitochondria, and the epifluorescent organelle DNA signals from the mature generative cells corresponded to plastid DNA. In addition, semiquantitative analysis was used to demonstrate that, during pollen development, the amount of mitochondrial DNA decreased greatly in the generative cells of the species examined, but the amount of plastid DNA increased remarkably in the species containing plastids in the generative cell. The results suggest that all Syringa species exhibit potential <b>maternal</b> mitochondrial <b>inheritance,</b> and a number of the species exhibit potential biparental plastid inheritance. The difference between the modes of potential plastid inheritance among the species suggests different phylogenies for the species; it also supports recent conclusions of molecular, systematic studies of the Syringa.
