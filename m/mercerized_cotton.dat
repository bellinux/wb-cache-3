The strongest conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the strongest mercerized yarn of a given count from a given quality of cotton is obtained under the following conditions: 1. use of low-twist yarn obtained with twist multipliers from 2. 2 to 3; 2. thorough pretreatment of the yarn to remove all extraneous materials; 3. mercerization at a temperature of 0 C or lower; 4. use of sufficient tension during mercerization to prevent the yarn from contracting more than 3 percent. 5. Use of caustic solution having a concentration of 10 percent or higher; 6. the time of mercerization to be 5 minutes.

40|$|The present work {{shows for}} the first time {{worldwide}} that sucrose can be easily placed by simple techniques within the micropores or nanostructure of the <b>mercerized</b> non-dried <b>cotton</b> linter fibers to create a low-cost cellulose substitute. Such sucrose-containing nanocomposites find suitable use as specialty absorbent paper. Relative to the sucrose-free paper, the sucrose-containing counterparts exhibit greater breaking length and remarkably high water uptake (WRV) up to a sucrose content of 8 – 15 % w/w. Mercerization of cotton linters before incorporating them with sucrose greatly enhanced the retention of sucrose in the prepared paper nanocomposites as compared to the case of unmercerized cotton linters. We assume that regions of the cell wall lamellae, {{on both sides of the}} sucrose spacers, are stressed during drying because the sucrose spacers hinder them to relax. This leads to a strain, which makes some microfibrils partially released and protrude out of the fiber. Thus, a sort of fiber beating takes place. We called this phenomenon incorporation beating or encapsulation beating to differentiate it from chemical and mechanical beatings, and it explains the great increase in breaking length of the paper nanocomposites prepared from the mercerized non-dried sucrose-loaded linters...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. seams stitched with threads of (a) <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton,</b> (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. seams stitched with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. seams stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. seams stitched with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton</b> thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton</b> thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|E

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of an investigation initiated by Brown and Purves (1). They found that the nitrogen content of a cellulose nitrate from solventextracted cotton, linters could be varied by pre treatments of the starting material, using strictly physical methods which could promote no change in chemical composition. A <b>mercerized</b> sample of <b>cotton</b> linters which had a high nitration reactivity could be converted to a topochemical modification with a lower nitration reactivity by the simple operation of drying from water rather than through the solvent exchange series : water - methanol - benzene. It was the immediate purpose of the present work to examine in detail the dependency of the reactivity toward nitration on the pretreatment of cellulose, to increase or diminish the magnitude of the effect if possible, and to study the phenomenon in terms of a number of nitration variables. In a broader sense, therefore, the present work employed nitration as a means of studying the structure of cellulose in the range of magnitudes between the X-ray crystallites and the microscopically visible morphological building units. The main body of the work involved the preparation of several hundred samples of cellulose nitrates from cotton linters or from wood pulp variously treated prior to nitration and under various conditions of nitration.

40|$|The {{collection}} of human odor volatiles {{is of interest}} to forensic applications as a path to investigate canine scent discriminations in legal investigations. A study using a selected array of previously identified human odor compounds has been conducted to determine the retention and release capabilities of five (5) natural and synthetic fabric types, <b>cotton</b> (<b>mercerized</b> fabric and gauze matrix), polyester, rayon and wool. A direct spike approach as well {{the use of a}} dynamic airflow device were the two approaches used for the {{collection of}} the selected volatile organic mix. The direct spike experiment showed how natural, cellulosic fibers such as viscose rayon showed an enhanced ability to release a reproducible volatile odor profile. Rayon demonstrated to be the fabric type with the highest recovered scent mass amounts, followed by wool and polyester. As was expected cotton showed the lowest recovered amounts, possibly due to its complex fiber morphology which enhances the possibility of chemicals to be retained in higher rates within the structure of the cotton fiber. Samples collected on the same fabric substrate showed a reproducible odor profile as measured via hierarchical clustering which corroborates previous live human odor studies and which can be pivotal in forensic biometric measurements. The introduction of an airflow variable to volatile collection decreased the amounts recovered for all fiber types. The reproducibility for each fabric type between replicate sampling was also reduced and a statistical significant difference (P< 0. 001) was observed in the interaction between airflow speed and fabric type. The cotton fabric was the material which showed enhance collection at the low airflow speed as observed by the recovered mass amount. In conclusion, these findings d...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{application}} of cellulase enzymes in the textile industry is quite popular, the morphological changes in cotton caused by the cellulase are not fully understood. The purpose {{of this research was}} to study the effects of cellulase enzymes on cotton. More specifically, the goals were {{to examine the effects of}} enzyme hydrolysis on cotton 2 ̆ 7 s (1) morphological properties such as crystallinity, porosity, and degree of polymerization, and (2) sorption of direct dyes. The influence of surface area on enzymatic hydrolysis was also of interest. Since mercerization is widely known to improve the dyeability of cotton and to change some morphological properties, <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton</b> was included in this study. ^ Hydrolysis conditions consisted of three enzyme concentrations and four treatment times. Glucose concentration, weight loss, and breaking strength loss increased with increasing enzymatic treatment time and with increasing enzyme concentration. The degree of polymerization decreased with increasing enzyme treatment time. Enzyme treated cotton had the highest crystallinity index (CrI) value and <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton</b> fabric had the lowest CrI. The increase in CrI for enzyme hydrolyzed cotton was attributed to the decrease of amorphous regions. The higher total pore volume and total surface area found after mercerization concurred with the higher dye uptake of <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton.</b> Cellulase treatment decreased the total pore volume, particularly in the 10 - 80 A range, and total surface area. Enzyme hydrolysis did not significantly enhance direct dye color yield. ^ The surface area modification study investigated the influence of surface area on susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis. The results show that the magnitude of increase in surface area is higher after mercerization than after physical pretreatment, e. g., cutting and milling. ^ These fundamental observations give a practical tool and a practical rationale for enzyme treatment of textiles. The goals of future processing should be to (1) increase amorphous character (use decrystalling enzymes, not hydrolytic ones), and (2) increase the number of 60 A or larger pores in the amorphous regions. These guiding features should be useful to the industry as it attempts to optimize new formulations of enzyme reagents for treating cotton textiles. ...|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{probably}} the denim fabric {{employed in the}} present study was subjected during its production to a chemical treatment to confer it a softer touch, which at the same time increased its hydrophilicity and, possibly, its affinity to the indigo dye. As a hypothesis, the denim fabric may have been subjected to mercerization in the secondary stage of textile processing. The process of mercerizing consists in applying cold concentrated caustic soda (sodium hydroxide - NaOH) on the tensioned fabric. The caustic soda reacts with the cellulose fibers of the cotton causing a swelling, leaving them with a more rounded profile and decreasing the amorphous regions of the cellulose. The regain of <b>mercerized</b> <b>cotton</b> is approximately from 10 to 12 % (Saville, 2007; Kolpak et al. 1978).|$|E

The rate of denim softness, water absorption and moisture regain increase due to catalytic hydrolysis by the cellulase (fibers are loosened by the enzyme).
