This study conducted an experiment to evaluate graphs using two different color combinations. The participants perceived the high luminance contrast Red-Green-Blue graph is more useful than the low luminance contrast Orange-Green-Cyan graph for complicated tasks using <b>multiple</b> <b>lines.</b> There was no difference of perceived usefulness across simple tasks including using a single line. Despite of the results, participants' actual task completion time shows {{there is no difference}} in terms of graph reading complexity between the two different color contrast groups...|$|R
