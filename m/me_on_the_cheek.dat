6000|$|As {{a matter}} of course I was proud of being thus {{received}} by my elders, but when my father came up hurriedly, taking me in his arms and kissing <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> as if I had been a mere child, truly was my cup of happiness running over! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My good child, don't {{distress}} yourself! don't make mountains out of molehills!" [...] She patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> {{with two}} plump white fingers which felt deadly cold. [...] "I {{was not always}} prudent, Mina, when I was your age. Besides, your curiosity is naturally excited about a servant who is--what shall I call him?--a foundling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The saints {{be good to}} us," [...] said Terence, [...] "if it isn't the King's own drum he has." [...] And sure enough, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head of it gleamed {{the royal}} arms of England, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side, as we turned it over, the device of a regiment. They flung the sling about my neck, and the next day, when the little army drew up for parade among the stumps, there I {{was at the end}} of the line, and prouder than any man in the ranks. And Colonel Clark coming to my end of the line paused and smiled and patted <b>me</b> kindly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And she has hit <b>me</b> a box <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> which I {{have had}} to put up with.

[...] "I tell you that she would have it into a fellow in no time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} he is getting fond of me?" [...] she asked, the last thing at night; taking her gold vase to bed with her, poor dear--exactly as she might have taken a new toy to bed with her when she was a child. [...] "Give him time, my love," [...] I answered. [...] "It isn't {{everybody}} who can travel at your pace in such a serious matter as this." [...] My banter had no effect upon her. [...] "Go away with your candle," [...] she said. [...] "The darkness makes no difference to me. I can see him in my thoughts." [...] She nestled her head comfortably <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillows, and tapped <b>me</b> saucily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> as I bent over her. [...] "Own the advantage I have over you now," [...] she said. [...] "You can't see at night without your candle. I could go all over the house, at this moment, without making a false step anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my love, are not you a most {{unreasonable}} little man?" [...] said Mrs. Bullfrog, patting <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b> [...] "Ought a {{woman to}} disclose her frailties earlier than the wedding day? Few husbands, I assure you, make the discovery in such good season, and still fewer complain that these trifles are concealed too long. Well, what a strange man you are! Poh! you are joking." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What else is it but a tragedy," [...] he demanded, [...] "the kiss {{that is a}} lie--or worse? You {{brought me}} here, you let me hold you in my arms, you filled my brain with mad thoughts, you drove {{everything}} good and worth having out of life, you filled it with what? Yourself! And then--you pat <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> and tell me to come, and be kissed some other day, when you feel in the humour, a wet afternoon, perhaps, or when you are feeling bored, and want to hunt up a few new emotions! It may be the way {{with you and your}} kind. I call it hellish!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Zoff's {{greatest}} accomplishment, however, {{came in the}} 1982 World Cup in Spain, {{where he}} captained Italy to victory in the tournament {{at the age of}} 40, making him the oldest ever winner of the World Cup; throughout the tournament, he kept two clean sheets, and produced a crucial goal-line save in the final minutes of the last second-round group match against favourites Brazil on 5 July, which enabled the Italians to earn a 3-2 victory and advance to the semi-finals of <b>the</b> competition. <b>On</b> 11 July, at the age of 40 years and 133 days, he became the oldest player ever to feature in a World Cup final; following Italy's 3-1 victory over West Germany at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in Madrid, he followed in the footsteps of compatriot Gianpiero Combi (1934) as only the second goalkeeper to captain a World Cup-winning side (later Iker Casillas repeated this feat for Spain in the 2010 World Cup). Due to his performances, he was voted as the Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament. Regarding Zoff's importance during Italy's victorious World Cup campaign, his manager Enzo Bearzot said of him: [...] "He was a level-headed goalkeeper, capable of staying calm during the toughest and the most exhilarating moments. He always held back both out of modesty and respect for his opponents. At the end of the Brazil match, he came over to give <b>me</b> a kiss <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> without saying a single word. For me, that fleeting moment was the most intense of the entire World Cup." ...|$|R

5000|$|A red <b>cheek</b> or hatchings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> {{represent}} blushing, usually {{used when}} embarrassed by romantic feelings, while oval [...] "blush dots" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheeks</b> represent rosy cheeks.

Sometimes when the character is expressing strong emotions, such as sadness, a long blush through the nose would appear.|$|R
6000|$|Falseron was daunted at this blow. [...] "Verily," [...] thought he, [...] "this is a miracle." [...] Uliviero did not {{press on}} among the Saracens, his wound was too painful; but Orlando now put {{himself and his}} whole band into motion, and you may guess what an uproar ensued. The sound of the {{rattling}} of the blows and helmets {{was as if the}} forge of Vulcan had been thrown open. Falseron beheld Orlando coming so furiously, that he thought him a Lucifer who had burst his chain, and was quite of another mind than when he proposed to have him all to himself. On the contrary, he recommended himself to his gods; and turning away, begged for a more auspicious season of revenge. But Orlando hailed and arrested him with a terrible voice, saying, [...] "O thou traitor! Was this the end to which old quarrels were made up? Dost thou not blush, thou and thy fellow-traitor Marsilius, to have kissed <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> like a Judas, when last thou wert in France?" ...|$|E

'None for my friend,' she replied: 'his {{strong head}} will {{keep him from}} danger; a little for Hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this evening has {{reconciled}} me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry rebellion against Providence. Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, {{he would have been}} taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I. However, it's over, and I'll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive slap <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> I'd not only turn the other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a proof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly. Good-night! I'm an angel!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{the orphan}} {{daughter}} of a shopkeeper of Sandwich. My father died, leaving to his widow and child an honest name and a little income of L80 a year. We kept on the shop--neither gaining nor losing by it. The truth is nobody would buy our poor little business. I was thirteen {{years old at the}} time; and I was able to help my mother, whose health was then beginning to fail. Never shall I forget a certain bright summer's day, when I saw a new customer enter our shop. He was an elderly gentleman; and he seemed surprised to find so young a girl as myself in charge of the business, and, what is more, competent to support the charge. I answered his questions in a manner which seemed to please him. He soon discovered that my education (excepting my knowledge of the business) had been sadly neglected; and he inquired if he could see my mother. She was resting on the sofa in the back parlor--and she received him there. When he came out, he patted <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b> [...] "I have taken a fancy to you," [...] he said, [...] "and perhaps I shall come back again." [...] He did come back again. My mother had referred him to the rector for our characters in the town, and he had heard what our clergyman could say for us. Our only relations had emigrated to Australia, and were not doing well there. My mother's death would leave me, so far as relatives were concerned, literally alone in the world. [...] "Give this girl a first-rate education," [...] said our elderly customer, sitting at our tea-table in the back parlor, [...] "and she will do. If you will send her to school, ma'am, I'll pay for her education." [...] My poor mother began to cry at the prospect of parting with me. The old gentleman said: [...] "Think of it," [...] and got up to go. He gave me his card as I opened the shop-door for him. [...] "If you find yourself in trouble," [...] he whispered, so that my mother could not hear him, [...] "be a wise child, and write and tell me of it." [...] I looked at the card. Our kind-hearted customer was no less a person than Sir Gervase Damian, of Garrum Park, Sussex--with landed property in our county as well! He had made himself (through the rector, no doubt) far better acquainted than I was with the true state of my mother's health. In four months from the memorable day when the great man had taken tea with us, my time had come to be alone in the world. I have no courage to dwell on it; my spirits sink, even at this distance of time, when I think of myself in those days. The good rector helped me with his advice--I wrote to Sir Gervase Damian.|$|E

6000|$|... ‚Äú‚ÄòTo be with me?‚Äô I asked. And he said: ‚ÄòTo be with you! No. My people don‚Äôt {{know what}} I do.‚Äô I can‚Äôt tell why, but I was annoyed. So instead of raising a clamour of pity over him, which I suppose he {{expected}} me to do, I asked him if the thrashing hurt very much. He got up, he had a switch in his hand, and walked up to me, saying, ‚ÄòI will soon show you.‚Äô I went stiff with fright; but instead of slashing at me he dropped down by my side and kissed <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b> Then he did it again, {{and by that time}} I was gone dead all over and he could have done what he liked with the corpse but he left off suddenly and then I came to life again and I bolted away. Not very far. I couldn‚Äôt leave the goats altogether. He chased me round and about the rocks, but of course I was too quick for him in his nice town boots. When he got tired of that game he started throwing stones. After that he made my life very lively for me. Sometimes he used to come on me unawares and then I had to sit still and listen to his miserable ravings, because he would catch me round the waist and hold me very tight. And yet, I often felt inclined to laugh. But if I caught sight of him at a distance and tried to dodge out of the way he would start stoning me into a shelter I knew of and then sit outside with a heap of stones at hand so that I daren‚Äôt show the end of my nose for hours. He would sit there and rave and abuse me till I would burst into a crazy laugh in my hole; and then I could see him through the leaves rolling on the ground and biting his fists with rage. Didn‚Äôt he hate me! At the same time I was often terrified. I am convinced now that if I had started crying he would have rushed in and perhaps strangled me there. Then as the sun was about to set he would make me swear that I would marry him when I was grown up. ‚ÄòSwear, you little wretched beggar,‚Äô he would yell to me. And I would swear. I was hungry, and I didn‚Äôt want to be made black and blue all over with stones. Oh, I swore ever so many times to be his wife. Thirty times a month for two months. I couldn‚Äôt help myself. It was no use complaining to my sister Therese. When I showed her my bruises and tried to tell her a little about my trouble she was quite scandalized. She called me a sinful girl, a shameless creature. I assure you it puzzled my head so that, between Therese my sister and Jos√© the boy, I lived in a state of idiocy almost. But luckily {{at the end of the}} two months they sent him away from home for good. Curious story to happen to a goatherd living all her days out under God‚Äôs eye, as my uncle the Cura might have said. My sister Therese was keeping house in the Presbytery. She‚Äôs a terrible person.‚Äù ...|$|E
