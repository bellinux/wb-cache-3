40|$|The {{integration}} of micro fabrication and micro-moulding techniques {{contributed to the}} massifica-tion of microsystems in several domains of activity at feasible costs. In this study the <b>mouldability</b> of microdetails generated by microEDM, micromilling and laser milling in microinjection moulding blocks is assessed. For that purpose, a polyacetal for precision microparts is used to evaluate how mi-crofeatures are replicated in microinjection mould-ing. The mouldings were produced in a instru-mented micromould with two interchangeable moulding blocks, enabling the test of various mould inserts. The processing conditions were simulated with the Moldex 3 D commercial software. Despite the commercial success of microinjection moulding, the process involves microscale phe-nomena that make the polymer flow different from the conventional flow at the macro scale. The mi-croinjection tests and the simulation allowed the gathering of knowledge to incorporate on mathe-matical models and simulation software, enabling the filling simulations at this scale being more ac-curate.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} analyses of <b>mouldability</b> for feedstocks used in powder injection moulding are performed. This study covers two main analyses. (i) The experimental analysis: the barrel temperature, injection pressure, and flow rate are factors for powder injection moulding (PIM). Powder-binder mixture used as feedstock in PIM requires {{a little more}} attention and sensitivity. Obtaining the balance among pressure, temperature, and especially flow rate {{is the most important}} aspect of undesirable conclusions such as powder-binder separation, sink marks, and cracks in moulded party structure. In this study, available feedstocks used in PIM were injected in three different cavities which consist of zigzag form, constant cross-section, and stair form (in five different thicknesses) and their <b>mouldability</b> is measured. Because of the difference between material and binder, measured lengths were different. These were measured as 533 mm, 268 mm, 211 mm, and 150 mm in advanced materials trade marks Fe– 2 Ni, BASF firm Catamould A 0 -F, FN 02, and 316 L stainless steel, respectively. (ii) The theoretical analysis: the use of artificial neural network (ANN) has been proposed to determine the <b>mouldability</b> for feedstocks used in powder injection moulding using results of experimental analysis. The back-propagation learning algorithm with two different variants and logistic sigmoid transfer function were used in the network. In order to train the neural network, limited experimental measurements were used as training and test data. The best fitting training data set was obtained with three and four neurons in the hidden layer, which made it possible to predict yield length with accuracy at least as good as that of the experimental error, over the whole experimental range. After training, it was found that the R 2 values are 0. 999463, 0. 999445, 0. 999574, and 0. 999593 for Fe– 2 Ni, BASF firm Catamould A 0 -F, FN 02, and 316 L stainless steel, respectively. Similarly, these values for testing data are 0. 999129, 0. 999666, 0. 998612, and 0. 997512, respectively.

Also, the effect {{of each of the}} ingredients individually as well as their interactions on cooking characteristics, texture, colour and sensory properties of low-fat beef burgers were investigated. The results of this study revealed that the increase of inulin content in the formulations of burgers led to lower cooking yield, moisture retention and increased lightness, overall acceptability, <b>mouldability</b> and desired textural parameters. In contrast, incorporation of β-glucan increased the cooking yield, moisture retention and decreased lightness, overall acceptability, <b>mouldability</b> and desired textural parameters of burger patt ies. The interaction between inulin and β-glucan improved the cooking characteristics of the burgers without significantly negative effect on the colour or sensory properties. The results of the study clearly stated that the optimum mixture for the burger formulation consisted of (in g per 100 g) : inulin 3. 1, β-glucan 2. 2 and breadcrumbs 2. 7.

40|$|This thesis {{characterizes the}} effects on {{shrinkage}} in microinjection moulding. The literature review considers four branches of investigation (material properties, processing parameters, mould design and specimen design). Two research gaps rise from {{the analysis of the}} literature review: the absence of a standardized methodology for measuring shrinkage of moulded parts at the micro-scale, and the absence of optimization stage that implements multiple quality criteria. Adequate research routes are set in order to address these gaps. The conventional standard for determining shrinkage at the macro scale is adapted to the micro-scale and this bridges the first gap. The micro-mould replicates the same design of the standard, and a preliminary stage solves some <b>mouldability</b> problems: the implemented mould extended the <b>mouldability</b> range of processing parameters for improving the reliability of results. After the micro-mould validation, the study of shrinkage at the micro-scale considers the influence of five processing parameters: the mould and melt temperature, the holding time and pressure, then the injection pressure. The design of experiment approach identifies the critical parameters that affect moulding, post-moulding and total shrinkage in parallel to and normal to the flow direction within an interval of confidence of 95 % for POM and 90 % for 316 L feedstock. Statistical tools analyse the results, and the trends of critical factors found confirmation in the literature. This methodology at the micro-scale can fill the first gap because it is on purpose designed for the micro-scale. Moreover, the binder of feedstock is a mixture of POM based polymers, and the use of a common platform permits to compare directly the two materials and highlight the influence of powder loading. The optimization stage adopts desirability functions for achieving optimized values that simultaneously fulfil two requests: minimize shrinkage and maximize moulded part mass. The analysis of the literature review shows that few papers adopt multiple quality criteria approach as methodology for optimizing the results, and none consider jointly part mass and shrinkage. The optimized processing parameters allow moulding “optimized specimens”, and results demonstrate that their total shrinkage and part mass achieve the requests. Even if the use of desirability functions produce results thatrepresents a compromise between the requests, the results show that overall shrinkage decreases and part mass increases. This approach demonstrates its reliability and bridges the second gap. The last part of the thesis investigates the 316 L feedstock behaviour for filling micro-features parallel to and normal to the flow oriented. The moulded features are investigated for studying the replication quality and the effect of the orientation of channels with dimension close to the feedstock lower <b>mouldability</b> value. These informations are available in the literature only for polymers, and the contribution of this part of thesis is to fill this gap by analysing a feedstock. The statistical approach permits to identify the critical factors that affect the feature replication quality. Optical investigations allow to identify the 316 L feedstock lower <b>mouldability</b> value and to observe the influence of the orientation of features with dimensions near the lower limit...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a new technique which enables a novel type of front panel for female body armour to be engineered, providing female contour, high level protection, and therefore comfort in wearing. The traditional cutting and stitching method can be used to form a dome shape to accommodate the bust area but it gives rise to weakness against projectile impact at the seams. A novel type of fabric with the advantage in <b>mouldability</b> is needed as an alternative to the conventional plain woven fabric in making female body armour without the need of cutting or folding but ease in manufacture. Dome-shaped fabric and angle-interlock woven fabric are two potential candidates. The analysis and comparisons determine the selection of the fabric with superior dome depth which is more suitable for the female body armour application. Ballistic evaluations on the selected fabric were carried out from two aspects: the overall ballistic performance investigation and the parametric study. The result provided a better understanding of kinetic energy absorption capability of single-piece selected fabrics. Additionally, the ballistic performance of fabric panels was further evaluated in the factory in order to ensure the selected fabric could achieve the commercial requirement. After the investigations of <b>mouldability</b> and ballistic resistance of the selected fabric, a mathematical model was created, which determines the pattern geometry for the front panel of the female body armour. This mathematical model takes the body figure size and bra size as the input, and the output is the profile of the front panel of female body armour. This work enables the speedy creation of a front panel of the female body armour in the selected fabric. This is an important advance and a novel approach for making seamless female body armour with satisfactory ballistic performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{issues to}} be {{highlighted}} here is to fundamentally evaluate the potential of using waste polystyrene as a backbone binder in Metal Injection Moulding (MIM.) This is {{by the fact that}} the earth has tons of polystyrene disposed every day and researcher believes such waste can be converted into more beneficial industrial product. Thus this research investigates the potential uses of polystyrene as a novel binder system in metal injection moulding. Stainless steel SS 3 16 L was used which is polystyrene and palm kernel acts as binder system. Feedstock with different composition 0. 60 % and 0. 55 % (60 / 40, 30170, 20180) powder loading (PL) were tested to know the feedstock characteristics. The homogeneity of the feedstock was investigated by using binder bum out test with Termogravimetic analysis (TGA). From the test it was found that PL 0. 60 % 70130 is the best homogeneity. The rheology test was being held for better proven. The rheology properties are investigated using Shimadzu Flowtester CFT- 5 OOD capillary rheometer. The optimization of the pMIM rheological properties as a function of stainless steel powder loading concentration are evaluated by flow behavior exponent, activation energy and <b>mouldability</b> index. The result show all the feedstock is a pseudo-plastic while no dilatant behaviour, it is no powder binder separation. Polystyrene are suitable acted as a binder system in metal injection moulding. Furthermore, it could reduce the cost of binder system. The feedstock achieved desirable injection moulding characteristics, such as homogeneous, stable, flow behaviour exponent, n < 1, moderate activation energy (E) and high <b>mouldability</b> index (a).

Covalent bonding between the functionalised PCLT and PPC enhanced moduli and strength, while also reducing creep and flow within PPC. Co-polymers displayed increased storage moduli, glass transition temperatures and damping properties. Additionally, PCLT-PPC co-polymers were flexible and easily moulded into shapes while maintaining their form and structural integrity. By imparting a relatively small concentration of functionalised-PCLT, the existing material properties (damping), as well as those previously seen as a hindrance to greater PPC application (poor thermal stability, cold flow, poor strength) were enhanced, while new characteristics (<b>mouldability)</b> were introduced.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Global competitiveness challenges manufacturing industry to bring to market well designed and manufactured new products at competitive prices, in as short a lead time as possible. To achieve this, inputs are needed from experts in a multitude of disciplines {{as well as from}} customers and suppliers. The overall design must be well orchestrated and integrated which has led to the evolution of the philosophy of Concurrent Engineering where the decisions about different aspects related to the product's life cycle, must be considered simultaneously. While the use of design teams is achieving some success {{there is a need for}} modern software tools which support the design process to be radically improved. Typically design for manufacture software systems provide only support for a single process e. g. design for assembly, design for machining, design for fixturing etc. However, when the full breadth of design for manufacture is considered there are many aspects that must be addressed. This leads to the need for information systems to be able to support multiple views of a product, where each view provides the appropriate representation to support at least one manufacturing perspective. This research has investigated the potential of product model based systems to support multiple viewpoints in Design for Manufacture. The research has focused on the design for manufacture of plastic injection moulded products and has explored the particular viewpoints of <b>mouldability,</b> mould design and mould manufacturing. The approach taken has been to explore particular information structures to support each Design for Manufacture application. Subsequently, the relationships between these information structures have been investigated and sets of translating mechanisms to convert information from one view to another have been designed. An experimental Product Model has been implemented using an object-oriented database. This contains a <b>mouldability</b> view, cavity and core design views and cavity and core machining views. Translation mechanisms between views have been implemented using Visual C++ language. The concept and implementation of this research have been tested through experiments using both rotational and prismatic products. This research has therefore shown that multiple viewpoint design for manufacturing can be supported by a combination of product model data structures and specific sets of translation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The achievement of "better, faster, cheaper" product designs is heavily dependent on providing appropriate information to design teams. One of the essential parts of the information is the manufacturing process information. The aim of this research has been to explore {{the representation of the}} capability of the injection moulding process in a software form. The resulting model termed a Manufacturing Model must provide a common source of information to a range of interacting Design for Manufacture applications. These applications in turn would produce feedback advice as the design evolves, to the users in order to assist in their design decisions. The manufacturing information to support injection moulding process has been categorized as <b>mouldability</b> features, mould elements and injection mould machine elements which represent the main entities of the Manufacturing Model. The EXPRESS language and EXPRESS-G have been used to provide a formal non-software dependent representation of the underlying structure of the Manufacturing Model. To explore the use of the Manufacturing Model information to support Design for Manufacturing (DFM) applications the Object-Oriented methodology of Booch has been used. Three DFM applications have been considered, these being Desigu for <b>Mouldability,</b> Supporting Mould Design and the Selection of Injection Machine. An experimental Manufacturing Model, based on the EXPRESS representation, and related DFM applications have been implemented in Object-Oriented form using LOOPS (Xerox 1988). This has been used to show that the capability of the injection moulding process has been captured in the Manufacturing Model and provides support to a range of interacting Design for Manufacture applications. While the EXPRESS language has provided a good tool to capture the structure of the Manufacturing Model, further work has been required to define the functional interactions between entities within the model. Using the object oriented paradigm to implement the Manufacturing Model has been demonstrated. The Booch methodology in addition to EXPRESS has provided the basis to model the functional interaction between the Manufacturing Model entities. As an implementation tool, LOOPS has proven to provide adequate object oriented capability. However there is requirement for software tools which can readily be integrated with other software tools. The research has provided a contribution to a structured, and extensible, approach which should influence future CAB system structures aiming to provide support to Concurrent Engineering...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{research}} project Hybridmould 21, studies on the <b>mouldability</b> of structural foams using hybrid moulds have been carried out. Hybrid injection moulds are an increasingly considered alternative for prototype series or short production runs of large dimension parts. In this solution for injection moulds the moulding elements (blocks or other inserts) are manufactured in alternative metallic materials or in synthetic materials typically using rapid prototyping techniques. Structural foams, known since the 70 s, are moulded by injection moulding without using the high pressures typically used in injection moulding. The formation of the structural foam results from the dispersed gaseous phase, which derives from the expansion of a chemical blowing agent usually compounded in a compatible masterbatch. In this project various thermoplastics and thermosets were used, namely, PP, ABS and PUR, us-ing a hybrid mould instrumented for the monitoring of temperature, pressure and expansion force.

40|$|The {{traditional}} methods of combining fibrous reinforcement with resin matrix have been dictated by {{the properties of the}} matrix. If a thermoset matrix is used the low viscosity of the unreacted system can be exploited to either mix in quantities of short fibre reinforcement, as with bulk moulding compound, or to infiltrate the resin through reinforcement as with resin transfer moulding, however it is necessary to ensure that the moulded article is formed into its final shape before the resin cures. If a thermoplastic resin is selected then the high viscosity of material means that the blending of reinforcement and fibre must usually be performed under condition of high temperature and shear, as for example by compounding extruder or calendaring. This paper describes a method of exploiting the soluble nature of certain biodegradable polymers to produce an injection mouldable short fibre reinforced material without a mechanical compounding stage. This method combines the low viscosity advantages of thermoset systems with the continuing <b>mouldability</b> of thermoplastics.

Materials based on liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) appeared to be favourable in view of their excellent flow characteristics, inherent inflammability and <b>mouldability.</b> Initially tested materials derived from BASF developmental LCP exhibited sufficient thermal conductivity and low ion content levels. The additional requirements of stability towards hydrolysis and soldering as well as good welding line strength, however, were met only by blends of LCP with poly(aryletherketone) s (PAEK). Adherence of these materials to lead frame metal surfaces was investigated by a team of the Fraunhofer Institute of Applied Materials Research (FhG-IFAM). A minimised temperature difference between thermoplast melt and mould was recognised to be decisive for good adherence. The structural stability was significantly enhanced by introducing a polyimide layer between thermoplast and lead frame. The developmental materials were evaluated by SIEMENS for direct and indirect (premoulded packaging) sheathing. With direct sheathing using the LCP/PAEK blends ''wire sweeps'' were unavoidable. Promising results were obtained with the same materials under conditions of premoulded packaging techniques, among which heated tool welding proved to be the best suited welding process.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{effects of}} {{defatting}} on the chemical, functional and pasting properties of starches from cowpea and soybean and their application in stiff porridge preparation were studied. Conventional cassava starch served as standard. Defatting of cowpea and soybean resulted in higher yield. Defatted starches also had higher amylose contents with low protein, fat and ash contents than full fat starches. In addition, defatted starches from cowpea and soybean had higher water absorption capacity, swelling power, blue value index and low bulk density, higher peak viscosity, trough, final viscosity, setback values than full fat cowpea and soybean starches while cassava starch had higher peak time and pasting temperature than the legume starches. The full fat starches from soybean and cowpea had high breakdown and low setback values than the defatted samples and control. The extensibility values of defatted starches were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than full fat starches but lower than control. There {{was no significant}} (p≥ 0. 05) difference in texture and appearance of stiff porridges prepared from cowpea, soybean and cassava starches. Similarly, {{there was no significant}} (p≥ 0. 05) difference in <b>mouldability,</b> stickiness and overall acceptability between defatted starches and control but significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) with the full fat starches.

40|$|Abstract — Concrete {{is a vital}} {{ingredient}} in infrastructure development with its versatile and extensive applications. The Indian construction industry today is consuming about 400 million tons of concrete every year {{and is expected to}} reach a billion tons in less than a decade. It is the most widely used construction material because of its <b>mouldability</b> into any required structural form and shape due to its fluid behaviour at early ages. However, {{there is a limit to}} the fluid behaviour of normal fresh concrete. Thorough compaction, using vibration, is normally essential for achieving workability, the required strength and durability of concrete. Inadequate compaction of concrete results in large number of voids, affecting performance and long term durability of structures. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) provides a solution to these problems. As the name signifies, it is able to compact itself without any additional vibration or compactive effort. However, wide spread applications of SCC have been restricted due to lack of standard mix design procedure and testing methods. It is pertinent to mention that only features of SCC have been included in Indian Standard Code for the present. Slump flow test, L-box test, V-funnel test, U-box test, Orimet test & GTM Screen test are recommended by EFNARC (European Federation for Specialist Construction Chemicals and Concrete system) for determining properties of SCC in fresh state.

Swollen cellulose pulp {{in the form}} of gel was solidified with two different anti-solvents: distilled water and a combination of 2 -propanol and deionized water. The solid cellulose material was further moulded in a custom-built prototype mould. The role of the anti-solvent was to solidify the swollen cellulose fibres and prepare mouldable solid specimens. The anti-solvent was chosen based on the following criteria, viz., recoverability, stable chemical reactivity, availability, cost and previous research in the anti-solvent area. The choice of solidification solvent had a great influence on the structure and mechanical properties of the final cellulose material. Results of different characterisation techniques showed that when the cellulose gel was washed with distilled water, it had a significantly higher number of lithium cations (ICP-MS and Raman), amorphous structure (X-ray) and lower mechanical properties (nanoindentation) compared to samples washed with a combination of 2 -propanol and deionized water. An increase in viscosity as previously reported and changes in the NMR and IR spectra of DMAc upon LiCl suggested the formation of an ion-dipol complex, where lithium cations reside adjacent to the oxygen of the carbonyl group of DMAc. The formed macrocation [DMAcn + Li]+ was preserved between cellulose chains in cellulose specimens washed with distilled water and had an essential role in the disruption of initial bonds, thus enhancing <b>mouldability.</b> Electron microscopy (FE-SEM) studies showed that the surface of cellulose after mechanochemical treatment was rough with no presence of fibre...|$|E
40|$|Despite of {{the great}} {{interest}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have aroused in engineering fields since their official discovery {{more than two decades}} ago, composite (polymer/CNT) applications are far beyond their potential spread. Due to their mechanical and physical properties, CNTs can work as reinforcement, thermal stabilizer and conductive network in a polymeric matrix. However, they are difficult to disperse since they easily form stable aggregates or bundles. Many research efforts went in the production of CNT composites for functional and structural applications and many processing methodologies have been experimented. Twin-screw extrusion appears to be the most realistic from the perspective of production scale up and commercialization of these composites. Nevertheless, despite of the massive literature about nanocomposites, few papers focus on the interaction between the compounding process and the following microinjection moulding transformation processes to obtain a final micro-device. This paper aims at analyzing the extrusion process configuration and correlated parameters in order to assess some characteristic and technological properties of resulting nanocomposites for micro-injection. Taking advantage of the modularity of a laboratory-scale twin screw extruder, two different combinations of screw elements have been tested to incorporate CNTs in a Polyoxymethylene (POM) grade typically used in micro-injection moulding. Indeed, the design of screw profile strongly affects the flow within the extruder and, consequently, the dispersion and distribution of the fillers within the matrix. The effects of the process set up and conditions have been observed studying the rheology and the electrical properties of the nano-composites as well as the <b>mouldability</b> of compound, evaluated in microinjected ribs characterized by very high aspect ratio.

The following Introduction {{is devoted to}} the presentation of the main process problems concerning the production of composite materials and the most important applications. The first part of the thesis is dedicated to an introduction to continuum mechanics. In the first three chapters the basic theory of a single component continuum is presented, introducing some geometrical and kinematics tools, the balance equations in both a three dimensional and a two dimensional continuum, and the constitutive theory, stressing the principle of thermal admissibility. The fourth chapter is dedicated to a general introduction to the theory of multiphase systems. The second part is focused on applications. The first chapter presents the main results of the theory of porous media which are used to build the models of composite materials discussed in the subsequent chapters. The second chapter is dedicated {{to the study of the}} inertial terms in a problem of infiltration of a resin in a reinforcement matrix during a pressure driven RTM process. As a consequence of the application of the pressure, the border in which the resin permeates starts to oscillate. A qualitative and quantitative study of the oscillations is given, proving that inertial terms influences the dynamics of the process only at the beginning and then their effects decay. Based on such an observation, the third chapter takes into account a system in which the inertia is completely neglected, focusing on the infiltration of a reactive resin into a solid preform. The <b>mouldability</b> diagram (which gives a window of applicability in the space of the process parameters) is presented and an analytic approximated expression for the infiltration velocity is give...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to develop a}} novel technique for creation of composite riot helmet shells with reinforcing fibre continuity for better protection against low velocity impacts. In this research an innovative, simple and effective method of making a single-piece continuously textile reinforced helmet shell by vacuum bagging has been established and discussed. This technique also includes the development of solid collapsible moulding apparatus from non-woven fibres. Angle-interlock fabric due to its good <b>mouldability,</b> low shear rigidity and ease of production is used in this research. Several wrinkle-free single- piece composite helmet shells have been manufactured. Low-velocity impact test on the continuously reinforced helmet shells has been carried out. For this purpose an in-house helmet shell testing facility has been developed. Test rig has been designed {{in such a way}} that the impact test can be carried out at different locations at the riot helmet shell. Low-velocity impact test has been successfully conducted on the developed test rig. The practical experimentation and analysis revealed that the helmet shell performance against impact is dependent on the impact location. The helmet shell top surface has better impact protection as compared to helmet shell side and back location. Moreover, the helmet shell side is the most at risk location for the wearer. Finite Element models were created and simulated in Abaqus software to investigate the impact performance of single-piece helmet shells at different impact locations. Models parts have been designed in Rhinoceros software. Simulated results are validated by the experimental result which shows that the helmet top position is the safest position against an impact when it is compared to helmet back and helmet side positions.

40|$|Inconel 718 {{components}} are typically cast or machined from solid in various industries. The properties of Inconel 718 make {{the processing of}} small complex parts very difficult. 1 – 4 There is an emerging interest in metal injection moulding (MIM) of Inconel 718. 5 – 11 MIM is a manufacturing process best used for the batch production of small complex components. The process involves mixing fine metal powders {{with a series of}} binder components to produce a pelletised feedstock. This feedstock can then be processed using an injection moulding machine to produce moulded parts. The parts then need to be solvent debinded and then sintered close to the melting temperature to fully densify the metal powder. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common component of water soluble feedstock for metal injection moulding. The processability of Inconel 718 MIM feedstocks using PEG with varying molecular weight was investigated in this work. Inconel 718 powder was formulated with different molecular weight PEG, poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and stearic acid (SA) to produce a homogenous pelletized feedstock. The powder loading for each feedstock as well as the concentration of PMMA and SA were unchanged for the entirety of this work, the only variable being the molecular weight of PEG used. The rheological behaviour of each of these feedstocks was analysed to determine injection moulding parameters and stability. Investigations into the <b>mouldability</b> of tensile bar components, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characteristics as well as debinding behaviour were all carried out. Parts were sintered and heat treated with density and dimensional measurements taken throughout, in order to identify the effect of PEG molecular weight on the different processing steps. Metallography and mechanical testing was carried out to compare the properties of each feedstock with industrial standards. One of the key findings from this work was that the molecular weight of PEG used had an effect on the debinding time of the moulded parts. Parts moulded from a higher molecular weight PEG require {{a longer period of time}} in a water bath in order to achieve 100...|$|E
40|$|Background : Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPC) {{are apparently}} good candidates for periodontal treatment {{by virtue of}} their biocompatibility, <b>mouldability</b> and osteoconductivity. However, the clinical efficacy in this regard has not been established. This study is aimed at the evaluation of the efficacy of a formulation of CPC in healing human periodontal intraosseous defects in comparison with hydroxyapatite ceramic granules. Materials and Methods : In this clinical study, 60 patients with periodontal defects were divided into 2 test groups and 1 control group. The defect sites in the test groups were repaired with CPC and hydroxyapatite ceramic granules (HAG). Debridement alone was given in the control group. The progress was assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months observation intervals through soft tissue parameters (probing depth, attachment level and gingival recession). Results: CPC showed significantly better outcome. Probing depth reduction values of CPC, HAG and Control at 6 months were 5. 40 &# 177; 1. 43, 3. 75 &# 177; 1. 71 and 2. 90 &# 177; 1. 48, and those at 12 months were 6. 20 &# 177; 1. 80, 4. 5 &# 177; 1. 91 and 2. 95 &# 177; 1. 73. Clinical attachment gain values of CPC, HAG and Control at 6 months were 5. 15 &# 177; 1. 50, 3. 45 &# 177; 1. 96 and 2. 25 &# 177; 1. 52, and those at 12 months were 5. 80 &# 177; 2. 02, 3. 55 &# 177; 2. 06 and 2. 30 &# 177; 1. 78, In both cases the P value was < 0. 001 showing high significance. The gingival recession over 12 months, for the CPC group is lesser than that in the HAG group and the value for the control group is marginally higher than both. Soft-tissue measurements were appended by postoperative radiographs and surgical re-entry in selected cases. Conclusions: Calcium phosphate cement is found to be significantly better than hydroxyapatite ceramic granules. The material could be considered as a "barrier-graft"...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MIng (Meganies)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1995. The {{injection}} moulding process {{is one of}} the most popular means of mass producing components to very small tolerances. Before the advent of the affordable computer, the methods used in injection mould design were empirical in nature. Computational fluid dynamics offers the mould designer a tool to predict and verify the <b>mouldability</b> of a part before any metal is cut on the actual mould. This thesis describes the development of a thin gap numerical model that can be used by mould designers. The thin gap assumption enables the Navier-Stokes equations to be simplified by the Hele-Shaw approximation enabling the flow variables to be solved more efficiently, without a significant loss of accuracy. Finite element solutions of the thin gap model are well documented and are well suited to solving problems with complex geometries but in general finite element methods require more memory and are slower in execution than finite-difference and finite volume methods. A personal computer based program utilising the finite volume method for solving the Hele-Shaw flow problem is developed in this thesis, which simulates the filling stage of the plastics {{injection moulding}} process. The basic model was first developed on a two dimensional constant thickness Cartesian coordinate domain using a constant tiscosity. This Newtonian model was then extended with the Volume-of-Fluid method to include the moving boundary or free front. A suitable material model was chosen to predict the viscosities of various grades of plastic at different temperatures and pressures. Once this model produced accurate results it was extended to include generalised curvilinear coordinates in order to solve problems on complex three dimensional geometries. The program is tested and verified extensively with numerical experiments and experimental data from previous published work and excellent results are obtained. The final product of this thesis is a computer program which simulates the moving boundary during the filling stage of the injection moulding process. This work contributes to the development and understanding of finite volume and finite-difference methods in the simulation of plastic injection moulding. Master...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} (BC), an exo-polysaccharide {{produced by}} Acetobacter xylinum, shows numerous properties such as purity, nano size, higher mechanical strength, absorbancy, crystallinity and <b>mouldability</b> than plant cellulose. Hence it exhibits {{number of applications}} in medical and industrial fields. In this study, Acetobacter xylinum species isolated from Kombucha, a mixed culture was identified and isolated by streak plate method, Gram staining, morphology and formation of HALO area on CaCO 3 added differential media. It was confirmed by its ability to form pure cellulose in static fermentation. Optimum storing temperature of Acetobacter xylinum {{was found to be}} – 70 °C, retaining its activity and purity. In media optimization, control sample showed a dry yield of 1. 08 g/l/cm 2 at pH 5. 0 which was comparable with the yields of BC in coconut water supplemented with different carbon and nitrogen sources. Chemical structure of BC fibrils biosynthesized in different media confirmed a structure similar to pure cellulose by FTIR spectroscopy and SEM confirmed nano size and network structure. Mechanical tests revealed increased tensile strain from 0. 09 to 0. 339, decreased tensile stress from 52. 89 to 10. 93 Nm- 2 and Young’s modulus from 588. 93 to 32. 3 MPa when moisture content of BC was increased from 0 to 25 %. Fluid re-absorption in 24 hours decreased with increasing moisture content from 1342. 83 % to 175. 83 % and 919. 72 % to 114. 88 % in deionized water and saline respectively. Therefore dried BC could hold 7 - 8 times fluid capacity than wet BC. Mechanical test applied on dried (2 - 3 % moisture) and wet (25 - 30 % moisture) BC at swollen state in deionized water and saline at 24 hours confirmed Young’s modulus and fluid re-absorption tend to decrease with increasing moisture content. This study confirms coconut water by itself as a nutriently rich substrate for BC production. Further, investigations proved the ability to produce cellulose based biomaterial consisting nano-scale fibre structure with considerable strength as appropriate for wound dressing applications.

40|$|The centre {{fuselage}} has {{a complex}} geometry with doubly curved surfaces. This presents a greater {{challenge in the}} realization of airworthy composite components. The <b>mouldability</b> of composites is exploited to produce composite tools, which capture the complex geometry. The stiffened composite parts on these composite tools are made by co-curing technology involving the bonding of stiffeners to the skin in a single operation. These stiffeners on contoured components need to be aligned vertically with the required spacing. Most of these parts have non-developable surfaces, which are not amenable for lay-up with computer generated transfer foils. The lay-up is done using prepregs pf smaller width, {{which is similar to}} tow placement, to facilitate the lay-up. The heart of co-curing technology lies in the design and fabrication of tooling. The tools should have precise contour and dimensional stability. NAL has adopted a unique philosophy in the tooling technology based on the experience of cocuring such components. The lay-up tools of stiffeners are stiff so that they maintain the required contour and alignment. The curing tools are different from layup tools and are flexible enough to achieve the required compaction of the web of stiffener. This concept allows the uniform application of autoclave pressure on webs of stiffeners and skin. The stiffeners and joint configurations vary from part to part. Some of the parts have stiffeners running orthogonal to each other and both are continuous at their junctions. The co-curing technique has to be suitably modified to redesign the layup and curing tools. Some of the parts have a Y joint, which allows the integration of floor of fuel tank without a mechanical joint in that region avoiding fuel leakage through joints. This is achieved by an innovative design using assembly of external moulds during lay-up. One of the parts has stiffeners, which are curved in height and curved in length to follow spine contour. The tools are fabricated to suit the contour and the required stiffener spacing. The technology to produce these complex composite components is developed over a period of time. The tools required for the layup at critical areas like bermuda triangle, assembly of cores on skin and fixtures for curing etc. are developed to facilitate faster and controlled production. The fine tuned process for Production of LCA is documented in greater details with step-by-step operations augmented with figures to assist the production at shop floor...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The application of a powder injection moulding process {{to the production of}} fully sintered hardmetal components has been studied. Salient, highly interdependent process variables investigated include; powder and binder characteristics, mixing techniques, feedstock rheological characteristics, mould design features, moulding parameters, debinding and sintering parameters. Fundamental studies were conducted to determine the effect of powder and binder characteristics on the powder loading capacity of feedstocks. Various methods of mixing were investigated. The most favourable methods were identified from the rheological response of their respective feedstocks as determined by capillary rheometry. Thermogravimetric analyses were used to; (a) identify binders and feedstocks essig beneficial debinding kinetics, (b) in the study of suitable debinding atmospheres and (c) to develop thermal debinding profiles for selected feedstocks. A spiral mould was used to assess the <b>mouldability</b> and optimum moulding parameters of selected feedstocks. Feedstock properties and mould design features which promoted moulding defects were identified and solutions developed. It was found that the maximum hardmetal powder loading achievable in a given feedstock was dependent on the powder size, size distribution and level of agglomeration. Low viscosity binders with high dielectric permittivities were found to promote highly loaded feedstocks. Feedstock viscosity increased with powder concentration. This relationship was modelled by a simple exponential power function over a narrow range of shear and powder concentration. Compounding methods utilising high shear melt mixing principles were found most effective in producing low viscosity feedstocks of consistent rheological response. Feedstock compositions of high powder concentrations and based on single, crystalline, wax binder systems were found to exhibit a high thermal dependence of viscosity, high activation energies of viscous flow, a high shear sensitivity and tended to segregate when subjected to shear. Such propensities were found detrimental to moulding behaviour. Spiral mould analysis revealed feedstock compositions were sensitive to changes in thermal parameters. Compositions based on multi-component binder systems were found most preferential in producing defect free mouldings of sound integrity and offered favourable debinding characteristics. Thermal debinding of mouldings was only completely effective by careful control of heating rates and when performed in hydrogen rich atmospheres. The reaction order and activation energy of the binder volatilisation was found to be dependent on the level of binder decomposition. Melt wicking was most effective using a hydrated magnesium aluminium silicate substrate. Sintered engineering components were produced by an injection moulding process with near theoretical densities and acceptable microstructures...|$|E
40|$|Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{elastomer}} {{is widely}} used in dynamic biological microfluidic applications. Hydrophobic pristine PDMS does not support cell attachment and culture, especially in dynamic conditions. Regardless, PDMS has too many useful properties as a base material for dynamic cell culture systems to be easily replaced. The good elastic properties, <b>mouldability,</b> transparency, chemical inertness, and biocompatibility of PDMS are enough to justify its use in large scale in the biomedical field. Therefore, PDMS surface treatment is nowadays considered as an essential step in using the material, especially for longer culture periods and dynamic culture conditions. To understand cell behaviour and stem cell differentiation better during cyclic stretching, {{it is important to}} study different durable surface treatment methods. The primary goal of this thesis work was to covalently bind collagen type I to cell culture substrates fabricated from Sylgard® 184 PDMS composite for long term cell stretching experiments with methods found in the literature. The secondary goal was to propose a novel surface treatment method to improve upon the existing methods. Seven different surface treatment methods, four of which were novel ascorbic acid (AA) based methods, were studied in this thesis using immunofluorescent imaging and cell culture experiments. The experiments were divided in five phases in chronological order to reflect the evolution of the surface treatment methods and the experiments. In phase one (P 1), physisorption and Covalent Method 1 were imaged using fluorescent microscope. In phase two (P 2), a novel Covalent Method 2 in two variations was proposed and subsequently imaged using fluorescent microscope. In phase three (P 3), physisorption, Covalent Method 1, and Covalent Method 2 in three variations were tested in static human adipose stem cell (hAdSC) culture for 14 days. In phase four (P 4), Covalent Method 1 and Covalent Method 2 in two variations were tested in static and dynamic hAdSC culture for 13 days. Phase five (P 5) introduced Covalent Method 3 that was imaged with fluorescent microscope and tested in static hAdSC culture for four days. Collagen type I was successfully labelled and imaged from all of the coatings. Cells were also successfully cultured in static and dynamic environments. The results showed that the novel AA crosslinked Covalent Method 2 was superior to the physisorption method and Covalent Method 1 in immobilizing collagen as well as in cell culture tests. The cell culture tests were conducted and PDMS surface treatment methods were developed for Human Spare Parts project funded by Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation and WoodBone project funded by the Academy of Finland...|$|E
40|$|For the {{development}} of photoluminescent materials for LEDs, <b>mouldability,</b> insensitivity to air and moisture and resistance to high temperatures are of primary importance, besides improved optical properties. In the present work, {{a new approach to}} obtain homogeneous, thermally stable and formable photoluminescent materials starting from silicon-based polymers through heat-treatment at low temperatures (200 - 700 °C) is presented. These commercially available or laboratory synthesized polymers are usually employed in the PDC route and annealed at temperatures beyond 1000 °C. In the present work, the polysiloxane Wacker- Besil®PMS MK, the polysilazanes KiON Ceraset (PUVMS), KiON VL 20 and KiON S, four polysilylcarbodiimides and a copolymer polysilazane-polysilylcarbodiimide were heat-treated up to 700 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere. The structural rearrangements during annealing lead to materials with tunable photoluminescence properties. The maximum emission spectra of many of the polymers investigated show a bathochromic shift as the annealing temperature increases, indicating {{the development}} of new luminescent centers with smaller band gap. For MK, Ceraset and VL 20, UV emission is detected after heat-treatment up to 400 °C, and it was observed to be strictly related to the crosslinking extent of the polymers. For heat-treatments from 500 °C, the materials emit in the visible range and this was related to the formation of aromatic agglomerations, precursors of the free carbon phase. At 700 °C for MK and at 600 °C for Ceraset and VL 20, the emission range is further red-shifted and the intensity is decreased, due to the concentration quenching related to {{the development of}} free carbon in higher amounts. In the dried KiON S, a visible emission is obtained after annealing at a temperature as low as 300 °C, but the aromatic solvent, still present after drying, has an influence on the fluorescence properties. All four polysilylcarbodiimides show luminescence properties in the polymer state, due to the presence of phenyl groups. As the treatment temperature increases, red-shifted emission ranges are analyzed for the two polymers which can be crosslinked, while no red-shift was observed for the ones which cannot. After annealing at 500 °C, the fluorescence is quenched in all polymers due to the development of free carbon in high amounts. The copolymer polysilazane-polysilylcarbodiimide is very interesting because it shows the maximum emission intensity among all heat-treated polymers analyzed, in the visible range and after heat-treatment at a temperature of just 200 °C. A new luminescent center arises after annealing, formed via crosslinking of the polymer. At 600 °C the luminescence is quenched due to the formation of free carbon. Therefore, our studies have clearly shown that the luminescence properties are related to structural rearrangements occurring during the polymer to the ceramic transformation, namely crosslinking and formation of sp 2 carbon. The formation of dangling bonds was also considered as a possible source of luminescence, but was demonstrated not to have an influence on the photoluminescent properties...|$|E
