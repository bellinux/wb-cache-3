500|$|Scott Wells, {{a racing}} correspondent, wrote in The Speedhorse Magazine that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> [...] "grew up lean and hard-boned, long-bodied and long-hipped, {{but not the}} best looking horse in the world. Not the best looking, just the best." [...] <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> had a {{reputation}} for being difficult to handle. His trainer once told Walt Wiggins, Sr. that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was [...] "jes plain mean as a bear most of the time". Throughout his racing career, <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> stayed mean. One of his jockeys, Robert Strauss, recalled later that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> [...] "was ornery from the day I met him, but he was the greatest horse I ever rode".|$|R
500|$|In 1955, when <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was a two-year-old, A.B. Green bragged that he {{intended}} to buy the horse from Ferguson. [...] Although Ferguson did not want to sell, he felt he had to at least set a price. [...] After hearing rumors that Green was prepared with a cashier's check for $40,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ), Ferguson set the price at $42,000 cash (approximately $ as of [...] ) and twenty-onebreedings to the stallion. To Ferguson's surprise, Green had that much cash available; Ferguson felt compelled to sell <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> Two years later, at a Los Alamitos race meet, Green claimed that his newest horse, Double Bid, could outrace <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> This incensed Ferguson, who had just entered <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> full brother Mr Mackay in a race with Double Bid. Ferguson bet Green $42,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ) against <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> that Mr Mackay would beat Double Bid in the upcoming race. Mr Mackay won the race, and Ferguson regained ownership of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> Later in 1960, because he also owned <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> full brother, father, and mother, he sold <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> to Frank Vessels Sr. and Bill and Harriet Peckham for $125,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ). Later, however, all three horses retained by Ferguson died prematurely.|$|R
5|$|Neither of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> parents raced. His sire (father), the Thoroughbred {{stallion}} Top Deck, was bred by the King Ranch. His dam (mother) {{hailed from}} Louisiana; <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> {{is thought to}} have gained his swiftness on the track from her. For the first years of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> racing career, his owner faced difficulty in registering him with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a matter that remained unresolved until 1958.|$|R

In the second innings, he took two early wicketincluding Comptonto reduce the hosts to 3/27 before ending with 2/28 as Australia bowled Middlesex out for 135.

500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people to come along and tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico.

5|$|The Company briefly {{considered}} {{sending a}} revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front, but the British Army promptly rejected this idea, {{saying that the}} unit would be impractical for trench warfare because of its small size.

5|$|In {{the first}} Test at Trent Bridge, Woodfull struck 26 and two. Australia led by 106 {{on the first}} innings and {{although}} Woodfull was so concerned with batting England out of the match that he declared with less than five hours remaining on the final day, his <b>men</b> <b>went</b> on to win by 238 runs, albeit with only ten minutes of play remaining. England struck {{back in the second}} Test at Lord's. Woodfull made 22 as Australia replied to England's 440 with 284. The hosts enforced the follow on as rain breathed life into the pitch, and Woodfull made 43 as Australia were all out for 118 in an innings defeat.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, {{the guerrillas}} assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, {{displaying}} his severed {{head in the}} town market. The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing {{had the effect of}} intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's <b>men</b> <b>went</b> into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.|$|E
5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|R

5|$|The first prosecutions in {{relation}} to the riot began at Manchester Crown Court on 14 January 1992.

5|$|Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, {{escaped from}} slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman {{had been hired}} out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large {{plantation}} in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge Democrat, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have just become a father. The two <b>men</b> <b>went</b> back, forcing Tubman to return with them.|$|E
5|$|Under Vasey's command, the 7th Division recaptured Kokoda on 2 November. It {{pushed on}} towards {{the north coast}} of Papua, only to be stopped by the Japanese short of their {{ultimate}} objective.

After the campaign, the 7th Division returned to Australia. The <b>men</b> <b>went</b> on leave before reassembling for training on the Atherton Tableland.

5|$|Between Tests, McCool was {{recalled}} for {{the match}} against Northamptonshire. He took 1/19 {{in the first}} innings before coming in at {{the fall of the}} fifth wicket and scoring an unbeaten 50 as Australia declared at 8/352. McCool only bowled three overs in the second innings and went wicketless as Australia won by an innings. Johnson, the incumbent Test spinner, took 4/59. In the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire, McCool made only four and seven not out before Australia declared in their second innings. After not being bowled in the first innings, he took 2/33 in the last hour of the match as Yorkshire ended at 4/85 to secure a draw. McCool was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded the same XI that had won the First Test by eight wickets. Bradman's <b>men</b> <b>went</b> on to complete a crushing win by 409 runs, and Johnson registered match figures of 3/75.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the <b>men</b> <b>went</b> ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three <b>men</b> <b>went</b> {{in search of the}} animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E

5|$|Matabele culture {{mirrored}} {{that of the}} Zulus in many aspects. The Matabele language, Sindebele, {{was largely}} based on Zulu—and just like Zululand, Matabeleland had a strong martial tradition. Matabele <b>men</b> <b>went</b> through a Spartan upbringing, designed to produce disciplined warriors, and military organisation largely dictated the distribution of administrative responsibilities. The inkosi (king) appointed a number of izinDuna (or indunas), who acted as tribal leaders in both military and civilian matters. Like the Zulus, the Matabele referred to a regiment of warriors as an impi. The Mashona people, who had inhabited the north-east of the region for centuries, greatly outnumbered the Matabele, but were weaker militarily, and so {{to a large degree}} entered a state of tributary submission to them. Mzilikazi agreed to two treaties with the Transvaal Boers in 1853, first with Hendrik Potgieter (who died shortly before negotiations ended), then with Andries Pretorius; the first of these, which did not bear Mzilikazi's own mark, purported to make Matabeleland a virtual Transvaal protectorate, while the second, which was more properly enacted, comprised a more equal peace agreement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 15, 1832, Captain Snyder and his men were in Kellogg's Grove when Native Americans were {{discovered}} in the area, during the night a horse was stolen. The next day, June 16, Snyder and his men pursued the Native Americans to the southwest; they came upon four natives and killed them. During the ensuing skirmish, Private William B. Mecomson was fatally wounded. The militia men put the wounded man on a litter and began to carry {{him back to the}} Kellogg cabin, along the way Mecomson asked that the group stop to rest. The group stopped and some of the <b>men</b> <b>went</b> for water while the rest waited with Mecomson. As they waited, a large group of Native Americans came upon them; a short battle followed and two more militia members were killed. After the short skirmish, the natives left the area and the militia men returned to the Kellogg cabin and buried their dead the next day.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{came from}} an {{affluent}} seafaring family, grew up in Poole and Bristol, and served a marine apprenticeship to a Bristol sea captain. His father held shares in many ships, but he died when Rogers was in his mid-twenties, leaving Rogers {{in control of the}} family shipping business. In 1707, Rogers was approached by Captain William Dampier, who sought support for a privateering voyage against the Spanish, with whom the British were at war. Rogers led the expedition, which consisted of two well-armed ships, Duke and Duchess, and was the captain of Duke. In three years, Rogers and his <b>men</b> <b>went</b> around the world, capturing several ships in the Pacific Ocean. En route, the expedition rescued Selkirk, finding him on Juan Fernandez Island on 1 February 1709. When the expedition returned to England in October 1711, Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, while retaining his original ships and most of his men, and the investors in the expedition doubled their money.|$|E
