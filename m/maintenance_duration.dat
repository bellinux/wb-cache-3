40|$|Abstract It {{is common}} {{practice}} in the hydropower industry to either shorten the <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration</b> or to postpone maintenance tasks in a hydropower system when there is expected unserved energy based on current water storage levels and forecast storage inflows. It is therefore essential that a maintenance scheduling optimizer can incorporate the options of shortening the <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration</b> and/or deferring maintenance tasks {{in the search for}} practical maintenance schedules. In this article, an improved ant colony optimization-power plant maintenance scheduling optimization (ACO-PPMSO) formulation that considers such options in the optimization process is introduced. As a result, both the optimum commencement time and the optimum outage duration are determined for each of the maintenance tasks that need to be scheduled. In addition, a local search strategy is presented in this article to boost the robustness of the algorithm. When tested on a five-station hydropower system problem, the improved formulation is shown to be capable of allowing shortening of <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration</b> in the event of expected demand shortfalls. In addition, the new local search strategy is also shown to have significantly improved the optimization ability of the ACO-PPMSO algorithm...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarger wind {{turbines}} {{are believed to}} be advantageous from an investment and installation perspective, since costs for installation and inner cabling are dependent mainly on the number of {{wind turbines}} and not their size. Analogously, scaling up the turbines may also be argued to be advantageous from an operation and maintenance (O&M) perspective. For a given total power production of the wind farm, larger wind turbines give a smaller number of individual machines that needs to be maintained and could therefore give smaller O&M costs. However, the O&M costs are directly dependent on how failure rates, spare part costs, and time needed by technicians to perform each maintenance task and will develop for larger wind turbines. A simulation study is carried out with a discrete-event simulation model for the operational phase of an offshore wind farm, comparing the O&M costs of a wind farm consisting of 5 MW turbines with a wind farm consisting of 10 MW turbines. Simulation results confirm that O&M costs decrease when replacing two 5 MW turbines by one 10 MW turbine, if the total production capacity and all other parameters are kept equal. However, whether larger wind turbines can contribute to a reduction of cost of energy from an O&M perspective is first and foremost dependent on how the failure rates and <b>maintenance</b> <b>durations</b> for such wind turbines will develop compared to 5 MW wind turbines. Based on the results of this analysis, it is concluded that higher failure rates and <b>maintenance</b> <b>durations</b> rapidly are counterbalancing the benefits of larger wind turbines...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that impairments of temporal duration processing after frontal lobe lesions reflect deficits in executive monitoring functions rather than a domain-specific deficit in the <b>maintenance</b> of <b>duration</b> information in working memory.

40|$|The {{traditional}} approach for maintenance scheduling concerns single-resource (machine) maintenance during production {{which may not}} be sufficient to improve production system reliability as a whole. Besides, in the literature many researchers schedule maintenance activities periodically with fixed <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration.</b> However, in a real manufacturing system maintenance activities can be executed earlier and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration</b> will become shorter since less time and effort are required. A practical example is that in a plastic production system, the proportion of machine-related downtime is even lower than mould-related downtime. The planned production operations are usually interrupted seriously because of the mismatch among the maintenance periods between injection machine and mould. In this connection, this paper proposes to jointly schedule production and maintenance tasks of multi-resources in order to improve production system reliability by reducing the mismatch among various processes. To integrate machine and mould maintenance tasks in production, this paper attempts to model the production scheduling with mould scheduling (PS-MS) problem with time-dependent deteriorating maintenance schemes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a genetic algorithm approach to schedule maintenance tasks jointly with production jobs for the PS-MS problem, so as to minimise the makespan of production jobs.

The periodontal statuses of the patients were determined by periodontal clinical measurements and radiographical evaluations. The levels of myeloid-related protein- 8 and myeloid-related protein- 14 in the gingival crevicular fluid were assessed using enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. The myeloid-related protein- 8 and myeloid-related protein- 14 levels in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (non-smoker and smoker) were found to be statistically higher than patients with chronic periodontitis (non-smoker and smoker) and patients with gingivitis (non-smoker and smoker). Myeloid-related protein- 8 and myeloid-related protein- 14 levels of non-smokers were significantly higher than smokers in all types of periodontitis and gingivitis. The decreased myeloid-related protein- 8 and myeloid-related protein- 14 level could have prevented the haemostasis of calcium which plays a significant role in the migration of neutrophiles.

40|$|Age-related {{decline in}} {{cognitive}} capacities has {{been attributed to}} a generalized slowing of processing speed and a reduction in working memory (WM) capacity. Nevertheless, it is unclear how age affects visuospatial WM recognition and its underlying brain electrical activity. Whether age modulates the effects of memory load or information <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration,</b> which determine the limits of WM, remains also elusive. In this exploratory study, performance in a delayed match to sample task declined with age, particularly in conditions with high memory load. Event related potentials analysis revealed longer N 2 and P 300 latencies in old than in young adults during WM recognition, which may reflect slowing of stimulus evaluation and classification processes, respectively. Although there were no differences between groups in N 2 or P 300 amplitudes, the latter was more homogeneously distributed in old than in young adults, which may indicate an age-related increased reliance in frontal vs parietal resources during WM recognition. This was further supported by an age-related reduced posterior cingulate activation and increased superior frontal gyrus activation revealed through standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography. Memory load and <b>maintenance</b> <b>duration</b> effects on brain activity were similar in both age groups. These behavioral and electrophysiological results add evidence in support of age-related decline in WM recognition theories, with a slowing of processing speed that may be limited to stimulus evaluation and categorization processes -with no effects on perceptual processes- and a posterior to anterior shift in the recruitment of neural resourcesThis work was financially supported by the Ministerio de EducaciÃ³n (BES 2008 - 005929) and Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad (PSI 2010 - 22224 -C 03 - 03), Gobierno de EspaÃ±a; and by the ConsellerÃ­a de EconomÃ­a e Industria (10 PXIB 211070 PR), and ConsellerÃ­a de EducaciÃ³n e OrdenaciÃ³n Universitaria (Ref: GPC 2014 / 047), Xunta de Galicia.

It is well known that online diagnosis systems and intelligent maintenance strategy play an important role to support maintenance and production in the modern manufacturing industry. Among numerous issues related to manufacturing maintenance, we address three major challenging problems: 1) an adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for condition-based maintenance, 2) more accurate stochastic models for preventive maintenance, and 3) joint maintenance and production scheduling for a multiple product and multiple station system. Adaptive anomaly detection allows us to conduct not only the online degradation assessment but also anomaly diagnosis in the presence of unknown faults. This algorithm is realized by using the hidden Markov model with reinforcement learning techniques. Online machine health information can further be investigated for the relationship on the product quality and equipment deterioration. Based on impact of machine condition to the product quality, we develop an integrated maintenance and dynamic product sequencing policy that can be applied to a multiple product and multiple station system. For preventive maintenance, the traditional degradation models only focus on a single machine system and ignore <b>maintenance</b> <b>durations.</b> We perform analytical and numerical examination of production lines with the Markov process framework, focusing on the more accurate dynamic behavior modeling and multiple maintenance tasks. Non-exponential holding time distributions in Markov chain are approximated by inserting multiple intermediate states based on a phase-type distribution.
