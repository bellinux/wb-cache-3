500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{chorus of}} [...] "Workingman's Blues" [...] {{features}} the line, [...] "Meet {{me at the}} bottom, don't lag behind, bring me my boots and shoes." [...] The unusual phrasing {{appears to have been}} borrowed from cool jazz singer June Christy's 1946 song [...] "June's Blues", which contains the words, [...] "Meet me in the bottom, bring me my boots and shoes". Dylan has shown an affinity for Christy's music, and played a number of her songs throughout the course of his Theme Time Radio Hour XM program. The line also appears as [...] "Meet me in the bottom, bring me my running shoes", in the Willie Dixon song [...] "Down in the Bottom" [...] (itself an adaptation of [...] "Rollin' and Tumblin' [...] "), recorded by Howlin' Wolf. A similar variant appears in Big Joe Williams' song [...] "Meet <b>Me</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> Corner" [...] ("Meet <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner, bring me my boots and shoes").|$|E

2500|$|Madison Square Garden's six-day {{event in}} 1896 {{was the longest}} race Taylor had ever entered. After Taylor refused to {{continue}} racing {{on the final day}} of the long-distance competition, exhausted from physical exertion and lack of sleep, a Bearnings reporter overheard him comment: [...] "I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ring with a knife in his hand." [...] Taylor completed a total of [...] in 142 hours of racing to finish in eighth place. Teddy Hale, the race winner, completed [...] and took home $5,000 in prize money. Taylor never competed in any other six-day race.|$|E
2500|$|Drug-taking in cycling predates the Tour de France. [...] "It existed, it {{has always}} existed", said the French {{reporter}} and author, Pierre Chany, who followed 49 Tours {{before his death in}} 1996. The exhaustion of six-day races on the track was countered by the riders' soigneurs (the French word for [...] "carer"), helpers akin to seconds in boxing. Among the treatments they supplied was nitroglycerine, a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing. Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion Major Taylor refused to continue the New York race, saying: [...] "I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ring with a knife in his hand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, Shorty," [...] he said, [...] "I'm not going. That trip {{will take}} ten days, {{and before that}} time I hope to have my system in proper working order.

60|$|But Tom {{killed the}} snake, {{and we made}} ready to use the cabin that night and the next day. For the horses were to be rested and meat was to be got, as we could not use our guns so freely {{on the far side}} of Cumberland Gap. In the morning, before he and Weldon left, Tom took <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> end of the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’ll bet {{he has no}} {{appetite}} for supper,” I heard Wolf Larsen’s voice, which came to <b>me</b> from <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of the galley. “Stand from under, you, Johansen! Watch out! Here she comes!” ...|$|R

60|$|At last {{came the}} dark. She led <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mossy {{shoulder}} of a canyon wall that out-jutted among the trees. After that we penetrated a dense mass of underbrush that scraped and ripped me in passing. But she never ruffled a hair. She knew the way. In {{the midst of}} the thicket was a large oak. I was very close to her when she climbed it; and in the forks, in the nest-shelter I had sought so long and vainly, I caught her.|$|E
60|$|Here, I felt, I could defy an army, for but {{a single}} foeman could advance upon me at a time, nor could he know that I was {{awaiting}} him until he came full upon <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of the turn. About me lay scattered stones crumbled from the cliff above. They were of various sizes and shapes, but enough were of handy dimensions for use as ammunition in lieu of my precious arrows. Gathering a number of stones into a little pile beside {{the mouth of the}} cave I waited the advance of the Sagoths.|$|E
60|$|MR. T. S. FRISBIE,--Dear Sir: The {{picture has}} reached me, and has moved me deeply. That was a steady, {{sympathetic}} and honorable team, {{and although it}} was not swift, and not showy, it pulled <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> globe successfully, and always attracted its proper share of attention, {{even in the midst of}} the most costly and fashionable turnouts. Princes and dukes and other experts were always enthused by the harness and could hardly keep from trying to buy it. The barouche does not look as fine, now, as it did earlier-but that was before the earthquake.|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} extremely positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{gave it a}} 9.2 out of 10 saying [...] "'Spend' was a damn solid episode that, in {{just one}} week, flipped <b>me</b> <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> whole 'Rick taking over Alexandria' situation.

6000|$|... "I tell you, Algar is {{no match}} for the Godwinssons. If the monk-king died to-morrow, neither his earldom nor his life would be safe. When I saw your father Asbiorn lie dead at Dunsinane, I said, 'There ends the glory of the house of the bear;' and if you wish to make my words come false, then leave England to founder and rot and fall to pieces,--as all men say she is doing,--without your helping to hasten her ruin; and seek glory and wealth too with <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world!

6000|$|Five {{hundred yards}} away or so, raged this {{struggle}} to the death, but about <b>me,</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> gates of Montezuma's palace on the hither side of the square, was a different scene. Here were gathered a vast crowd, among them many women and children, waiting to see me die. They came with flowers in their hands, {{with the sound of}} music and joyous cries, and when they saw me they set up such a shout of welcome that it almost drowned the thunder of the guns and the angry roar of battle. Now and again an ill-aimed cannon ball would plough through them, killing some and wounding others, but the rest took no heed, only crying the more, 'Welcome, Tezcat, and farewell. Blessings on you, our deliverer, welcome and farewell!' ...|$|E
60|$|But why was I in {{the middle}} of Canada going west, when my {{grandparents}} lived in England? Promptly I created a married sister who lived in California. She would take care of me. I developed at length her loving nature. But they were not done with me, those hard-hearted policemen. I had joined the Glenmore in England; in the two years that had elapsed before my desertion at Montreal, what had the Glenmore done and where had she been? And thereat I took those landlubbers around the world with me. Buffeted by pounding seas and stung with flying spray, they fought a typhoon with me off the coast of Japan. They loaded and unloaded cargo with me in all the ports of the Seven Seas. I took them to India, and Rangoon, and China, and had them hammer ice with <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Horn and at last come to moorings at Montreal.|$|E

6000|$|There was no {{possible}} {{way of getting}} out of it, and so, in deep humiliation, I set about preparing to [...] "answer" [...] a mass of baseless charges and mean and wicked falsehoods. But I never finished the task, for the very next morning a paper came out with a new horror, a fresh malignity, and seriously charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with all its inmates, because it obstructed the view from my house. This threw me into a sort of panic. Then came the charge of poisoning my uncle to get his property, with an imperative demand that the grave should be opened. This drove me to the verge of distraction. On top of this I was accused of employing toothless and incompetent old relatives to prepare the food for the foundling hospital when I was warden. I was wavering--wavering. And at last, as a due and fitting climax to the shameless persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me, nine little toddling children, of all shades of color and degrees of raggedness, were taught to rush onto the platform at a public meeting, and clasp <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> legs and call me PA! ...|$|E
60|$|Next Day. Sure enough, it has happened. Yesterday it was September 8, Sunday; to-day, per the bulletin-board at {{the head}} of the companionway, it is September 10, Tuesday. There is {{something}} uncanny about it. And uncomfortable. In fact, nearly unthinkable, and wholly unrealizable, when one comes to consider it. While we were crossing the 180th meridian it was Sunday in the stern of the ship where my family were, and Tuesday in the bow where I was. They were there eating the half of a fresh apple on the 8th, and I was at the same time eating the other half of it on the 10th--and I could notice how stale it was, already. The family were the same age that they were when I had left them five minutes before, but I was a day older now than I was then. The day they were living in stretched behind them half way round the globe, across the Pacific Ocean and America and Europe; the day I was living in stretched in front of <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> other half to meet it. They were stupendous days for bulk and stretch; apparently much larger days than we had ever been in before. All previous days had been but shrunk-up little things by comparison. The difference in temperature between the two days was very marked, their day being hotter than mine because it was closer to the equator.|$|E
60|$|We {{emerged into}} the glistening {{thoroughfare}} {{in front of}} the vast hotels, and I was struck, as I never fail to be, with its futile and unmeaning splendour. I think there is nothing in our dun-coloured civilisation prettier than that habit the ladies have in Saratoga of going out on the street after dark in their bare heads. When I first saw them wandering about so in the glitter of the shop-windows and the fitful glare of the electrics everywhere, I thought they must be some of those Spanish-Americans mistaking the warm, dry air of the Northern night for that of their own latitudes; but when I came up with them I could hear, if I could not see, that they were of our own race. Those flat and shapeless tones could come through the noses of no other. The beauty and the elegance were also ours, and the fearless trust of circumstance. They sauntered up and down before the gaunt, high porticoes of the hotels, as much at home as they could have been in their own houses, and in much the same dress {{as if they had been}} receiving there. The effect is one of incomparable cheer, and is a promise of social brilliancy which Saratoga no more keeps than she does that of her other characteristic aspects; say the forenoon effect of the same thoroughfare, with the piazzas banked with the hotel guests, and the street full of the light equipages which seem peculiar to the place passing and repassing, in the joyous sunlight and out of it, on the leaf-flecked street. Even the public carriages of Saratoga have a fresh, unjaded air; and to issue from the railway station in the midst of those buoyant top-phaetons and surreys, with their light- limbed horses, is to be thrilled by some such insensate expectation of pleasure as fills the heart of a boy at his first sally into the world. I always expect to find my lost youth waiting for <b>me</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of the United States Hotel, and I accuse myself of some fault if it disappoints me, as it always does. I can imagine what gaudy hopes by day and by night the bright staging of the potential drama must awaken in the breast of a young girl when she first sees it, and how blank she must feel when the curtain goes down and there has been no play. It was a real anguish to me when that young girl with the Deerings welcomed my wife and me with a hopeful smile, as if we were the dramatis personae, and now the performance must be going to begin. I could see how much our chance acquaintance had brightened the perspective for her, and how eagerly she had repaired all her illusions; and I thought how much better it would have been if she had been left to the dull and spiritless resignation in which I had first seen her. From that there could no fall, at least, and now she had risen from it only to sink again.|$|E
