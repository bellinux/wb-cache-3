As an agent to induce accidental ninvolution of the thymus an alarming dose of formalin was used. In was observed that with the progress of thymic involution, the cellularity of lymphocytes in the parenchyma became scanty, whereas thenumber of <b>myelocytes</b> per unit area of parendhma in sections (here termed the concentration of <b>myelocytes)</b> was considerably increased, so that not infrequently the histological picture of the thymic parenchyma was reminiscent of hypoplastic bone marrow. Even in such instances, however, the total amount of <b>myelocytes</b> per thymus did not increase, because the reduction in tha mass of thymic parenchyma took place to a greater extent. This implies that a high concentration of <b>myelocytes</b> of the thymus in an advanced satgeof involution in a result of condensation of there cells in the reduced parenchyma. The concentration of <b>myelocytes</b> in the parenchyma was reduced to the normal level coincident with the commencement of regenration of the thymic lymphocytes.

40|$|Abstract. In specific-pathogen-free {{chickens}} {{infected with}} the highly virulent HPS- 2 strain or virulent reference GBF- 1 strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), pathologic changes of the bone marrow were investigated. On histologic examination, bone marrow lesions were prominent in the HPS- 2 group but only mild in the GBF- 1 group. The bone marrow of the HPS- 2 group showed severe lysis and depletion of heterophil <b>myelocytes</b> with pyknotic nuclear alteration 2 – 3 days after inoculation. On examination with an electron mi-croscope, heterophil <b>myelocytes</b> were characterized by shrinkage of the cytoplasm and peripheral condensation of nuclear chromatin. IBDV particles were not detected in altered <b>myelocytes.</b> A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling method demonstrated a positive reaction in only heterophil <b>myelocytes.</b> In contrast, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HPS- 2 –infected bone marrow cells was indiscernible by agarose gel electrophoresis. These findings indicate that lysis of bone marrow cells is selectively induced in heterophil <b>myelocytes</b> {{at an early stage}} after IBDV infection and independent of virus replication.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{systems for}} chromosomal analysis or {{the detection of}} fusion genes are generally not available in Indonesia. Therefore, bone marrow (BM) morphological analysis should be developed and applied to get an accurate diagnosis. In this study the BM smears of eight (8) cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) which had already been known to have t(8; 21) (q 22;q 22), were morphologically evaluated {{in order to find}} out the characteristics, which might be used to predict t(8; 21) (q 22;q 22) or the presence of AML 1 -ETO(MTG 8) fusion gene. All of the cases belonged to AML-M 2. The morphological characteristics, indicative of t(8; 21) were pink colored cytoplasm in mature neutrophil (75 %), neutrophilic <b>myelocytes</b> or metamyelocytes without granules or with scarce granules (2. 3 %), eosinophilia (eosinophilic <b>myelocytes</b> and metamyelocytes) (above 5 %), <b>myelocytes</b> with abundant granules 8. 5 %, and low percentage of type I blasts (below 10 %).

5000|$|The common myeloid {{progenitor}} can differentiate in {{the bone}} marrow into red blood cells and megakaryocytes (leading to platelets) as well as mast cells and myeloblasts, the latter leading to the myelocytic line (granulocytes) and to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. The granulocytes, also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of their multilobed nuclei, are three short lived cell types including eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. A granulocyte differentiates into a distinct cell type by a process called granulopoiesis. In this process it first transforms from a common myeloblast (myeloid progenitor) to a common promyelocyte. This promyelocyte {{gives rise to a}} unique <b>myelocyte</b> {{that for the first time}} can be classified as an eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil progenitor based on the histological staining affinity (eosinophilic, basophilic, or neutral granules). The unique <b>myelocyte</b> next differentiates into a metamyelocyte and then a band cell, with a [...] "C" [...] shaped nucleus, before becoming a mature eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil. Macrophages come from monoblast progenitors that differentriate into promonocytes, which mature into monocytes. Monocytes eventually enter the tissues and become macrophages.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{understand}} {{the expression of}} NADPH oxidase components during neutrophil maturation, we examined the expression of mRNAs and proteins for NADPH oxidase components, and the superoxide-producing activity using HL- 60 cells incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Northern blot and Western blot analyses revealed that gp 91 phox, p 67 phox, and p 47 phox were expressed after <b>myelocyte</b> stages, whereas p 22 phox, p 40 phox, and rac- 2 were expressed from the promyelocyte stage. Furthermore, immunocytochemical staining of DMSO-induced HL- 60 cells indicated that gp 91 phox, p 67 phox, and p 47 phox were detected only after <b>myelocyte</b> stages (myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band cells, and segmented cells), whereas p 22 phox, p 40 phox, and rac- 2 were detected from the promyelocyte stage. In addition, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay showed that superoxide could be produced after <b>myelocyte</b> stages but not produced before promyelocyte stages. Moreover, almost the same results as those with DMSO-induced HL- 60 cells were obtained using human bone-marrow cells by immunocytochemical staining and NBT assay, except that p 22 phox was detected by immunocytochemical staining after <b>myelocyte</b> stages in bone-marrow cells. Together, these observations indicate that all the components for NADPH oxidase are expressed, and the superoxide-producing activity is obtained after <b>myelocyte</b> stages during neutrophil maturation.

When neutropenia was partially or completely corrected by splenectomy the label disappeared more slowly. In patients with stable neutrophilia the label disappeared slowly and a terminal plateau in the LSA curve was encountered.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that HL- 60 cells exposed to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) after treatment with a non-cytotoxic concentration of vincristine (VCR) result in granulocytic maturation and differentiation, suggesting that VCR might exhibit a synergistic action with ATRA {{in the treatment}} of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this report, leukemic cells obtained from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia were exposed to 20 nM VCR for 1 h followed by 1 mu M ATRA for 6 days. An increase in the expression of mature <b>myelocyte</b> antigens, CD 11 b and CD 15, was observed as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Treatment of VCR or ATRA alone, however, did not have any effect on the expression of these mature <b>myelocyte</b> antigens of the leukemic cells.

40|$|Neutrophilic leukocytes (PMN) {{and their}} {{precursors}} from normal human marrow and blood were examined by histochemical staining and by electron microscopy and cytochemistry {{in order to}} determine the origin and nature of their cytoplasmic granules. Human neutrophils contain two basic types of granules, azurophils and specifics, which differ in morphology, contents, and time of origin. Azurophils are large and may be spherical or ellipsoid, the latter with a crystalline inclusion. They are produced in the first secretory stage (promyelocyte), contain peroxidase and various lysosomal enzymes, and thus correspond to modified primary lysosomes. Specifics are smaller, may be spherical or elongated, and are formed during a later secretory stage (<b>myelocyte).</b> They lack lysosomal enzymes and contain alkaline phosphatase and basic protein; their contents remain largely undetermined. Specifics outnumber azurophils in the mature PMN because of reduction in numbers of azurophils per cell by cell division in the <b>myelocyte</b> stage. The findings indicate that the situation is basically the same as described previously in the rabbit, insofar as the origin, enzymic activity, and persistence in the mature cell of the two types (azurophil and specific) of granules are concerned. The main difference between PMN of the two species is in the morphology (size, shape, and density) of the granules, especially the azurophils...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{understand}} the gene expression of CAP 18 (18 -kDa cationic antibacterial protein), {{a member of}} cathelicidins, we evaluated mRNA and protein expression of CAP 18 using human bone marrow cells and mature neutrophils. Northern blot analysis revealed that CAP 18 mRNA was expressed more abundantly in bone marrow cells than mature neutrophils, whereas Western blot analysis indicated that CAP 18 protein was more abundant in mature neutrophils than bone marrow cells. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization using bone marrow cells demonstrated that the expression of CAP 18 mRNA was neutrophil lineage-specific and was observed primarily in myelocytes (G 95 %) with limited expression in more immature cells (promyelocytes) and mature cells (metamyelocytes, band cells, and segmented neutrophils). Furthermore, immunohistochemical study indicated that, coincident {{with the increase of}} CAP 18 mRNA levels, CAP 18 -positive cells increased markedly at <b>myelocyte</b> stage, and the increased levels remained almost constant (G 95 %) in metamyelocytes, band cells, and segmented neutrophils, although the mRNA levels were remarkably reduced in these cells. Together these observations indicate that CAP 18 gene transcription likely occurs lineageand stage-specifically at the <b>myelocyte</b> stage of neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow and results in the synthesis and cytoplasmic accumulation of CAP 18, which is present in the subsequent stages of neutrophil maturation.

Age of exposure to wave {{is also an important}} factor. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of radiation leakaged from microwave oven on hemopoitic bone marrow cells at pre and post pubertal. Methods: Fourteen male mature (2 months old) and 14 male immature rats(one month old) were randomly divided in to four groups (control and test). Test groups were exposed, three times a day each time 30 min for 60 days, to microwaves produced by microwave oven. After sixty days, animals were sacrified and bone marrow samples were collected from femural bones. Percent of variose cells type and their morphology were evaluated in 500 cells of each smear. Results: exposure to microwave did not exert visible morphological alteration. In the immature experimental group significant decrease in percent of basophilic rubricyte, polychromatic rubricyte, meta rubricyte and all the erythroid cell types observed(P< 0. 05), whereas, meta <b>myelocyte,</b> notrophilic band, total myeloid cell types and prolifrative cells, other cell types and the myeloid/erythroid ratio significantly increased(P< 0. 05).
