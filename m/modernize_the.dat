5|$|Because New Jersey {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to <b>modernize</b> <b>the</b> battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E
