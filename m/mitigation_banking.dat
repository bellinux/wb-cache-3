5000|$|Environmental mitigation, {{compensatory}} mitigation, or <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking,</b> are terms {{used primarily}} by the United States government and the related environmental industry to describe projects or programs intended to offset known impacts to an existing historic or natural resource such as a stream, wetland, endangered species, archeological site or historic structure. To [...] "mitigate" [...] means to make less harsh or hostile. Environmental mitigation is typically a part of an environmental crediting system established by governing bodies which involves allocating debits and credits. Debits occur in situations where a natural resource has been destroyed or severely impaired and credits are given in situations where a natural resource has been deemed to be improved or preserved. Therefore, when an entity such as a business or individual has a [...] "debit" [...] {{they are required to}} purchase a [...] "credit". In some cases credits are bought from [...] "mitigation banks" [...] which are large mitigation projects established to provide credit to multiple parties in advance of development when such compensation cannot be achieved at the development site or is not seen as beneficial to the environment. Crediting systems can allow credit to be generated in different ways. For example, in the United States, projects are valued based on what the intentions of the project are which may be to preserve, enhance, restore or create (PERC) a natural resource.|$|E
50|$|Current {{plans call}} for Lake Powell to be {{restored}} utilizing both a tax leveled on lake shore property owners and public funding. The tax had been voted for unanimously by the home owners. Since its initial break, the cost of restoring the lake has {{been a matter of}} contention with numerous estimates given, some ranging as high as $2.8 million. However, these appear to be considerable overestimations, with the actual cost closer to $750,000. As part of using tax dollars to fund the repair, Lake Powell would be open to public recreation for the first time. Most recently, an additional proposal has been made to turn the lake into a nutrient bank. This would function in a similar way as the failed <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> scheme in that population mitigation credits would be sold to bidding companies; however, in this case, the dam would have to be rebuilt and the lake restored, thus satisfying lake shore property owners. Plans for the restoration of Lake Powell have been affected by the competing aims of involved parties. Lake shore property owners have been adamant in having the lake restored to return both the aesthetic effects and use of the lake and to reverse the steady decline in property values which have occurred since the break. The lake's owners, however, stood to benefit considerably from the transformation of the former lake into wetlands credits. In addition to opposition from lake shore property owners who oppose any plan which does not lead to restoration of the lake, state officials opposed the wetlands bank proposal based on concerns about how property lines are affected due to the altered position of the lake banks. As it currently stands, restoration of the lake with the addition of public finances seems the most likely outcome.|$|E

Data were collected and analyzed for a project supported, in part, by a Disciplinary Research Grant from the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station. During summer and fall of 2003, primary data were collected using semi-structured interviews with wetland bank managers responsible for 59 percent of the nation's <b>mitigation</b> <b>banks.</b> A stratified, random sample of potential participants was drawn from 380 wetland <b>mitigation</b> <b>banks.</b> After receiving a pre-notification letter from the researcher, the managers were contacted by the researcher by phone to arrange the interviews. Altogether, 140 interviews were undertaken with mangers responsible for about 250 established or proposed <b>mitigation</b> <b>banks.</b> The semi-structured interviews each took about one-half hour to complete, followed a specially prepared script, used qualitative interviewing protocols, were audio recorded, and were subsequently transcribed.

40|$|<b>Mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> {{has been}} used as a means of facilitating the permit process by {{removing}} the negotiation of appropriate mitigation for development from the confines of the permit process. A developer with frequent needs to mitigate for losses associated with Section 404 and Section 10 requirements may, using a mitigation bank, consolidate mitigation and in so doing, potentially reduce mitigation costs. As a result of route maintenance, as well as expansion requirements, ports were considered to be good candidates for sponsoring mitigation bank efforts. Port use of <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> has not been as expected due to a lack of available mitigation sites, regulatory restrictions, and high costs. This thesis supports the hypothesis that the number of mitigation banks has grown significantly since 1988, when the last inventory of mitigation banks in the U. S. had been conducted. This growth can be attributed largely to the increase in the number of department of transportation-sponsored banks.

40|$|Stream <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} a major {{driver of the}} stream restoration industry, particularly in the Southeast. Like other types of <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> regulated by the Clean Water Act Section 404 program, stream <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> (SMB) gives developers the option to offset construction impacts by purchasing “credits. ” These credits are generated by for-profit companies that restore damaged streams on a speculative basis and are approved by federal regulatory agencies. In states such as North Carolina, SMB has now eclipsed wetlands banking in terms of number of credits bought and sold. SMB is becoming a major private-sector source of stream restoration funding, perhaps presaging {{a major shift in}} what has been until now a predominantly publicly funded market. In addition to its growing eco-nomic importance, the emerging practice of SMB is worth attention because many of the tensions and debates that have been settled in the more established practice of wet-lands <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> are still unresolved, and thus potentially open to input from practitioners and scientists.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} risks associated with using <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> for the conservation of wetlands in Florida in the United States. First, we attempt to identify and summarize the main ecological and socio-economic risks regarding <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> that have been discussed in previous studies.

We have used empirical evidence including interviews and data analysis to assess the effectiveness of these responses. Our main findings are that the recent regulatory responses adopted to face risks associated with <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> seem to be more effective than what is often assumed. These responses are underpinned by the emergence of a hybrid mode of governance that combines market characteristics and regulatory constraints, and which contributes to enforcing wetland compensation in Florida. However, we also observed some risks inherent in this system, in particular the redistribution of ecosystem services, as the distance between impact sites and compensation sites seems to have increased in Florida in the last several years.

Numerical simulation of the model provides a sensitivity analysis of how model parameters of restoration costs, stochastic biological growth, interest rate, and the market value of credits affect the trajectory of investment and the optimal stopping state of wetlands quality when the investment ends. The analysis reveals that restoration of the whole site will occur when there is a reduction in restoration costs, an increase in biological uncertainty or an increase in the value of wetlands credits. Continued restoration is harder to justify with a higher interest rate. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1998 option value, stochastic control, wetlands <b>mitigation</b> <b>banks,...</b>|$|R

Compensatory wetland <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking,</b> in particular, {{is concerned with}} in-perpetuity management and protection - the basic concerns of the Queensland public about its unique environment. The process has actively engaged the North American market and become a thriving industry that (for the most part) effectively designs, creates and builds (or enhances) environmental habitat. A methodology was designed to undertake {{a comprehensive review of}} the history, evolution and concepts of the North American wetland <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> system - before and after the implementation of a significant new compensatory wetland <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> regulation in 2008. The Delphi technique was then used to determine the principles and working components of wetland <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking.</b> Results were then applied to formulate a questionnaire to review Australian marketbased instruments (including offsetting policies) against these North American principles. Following this, two case studies established guiding principles for implementation based on two components of the North American wetland <b>mitigation</b> <b>banking</b> program. The subsequent outcomes confirmed that environmental banking is a workable concept in North America and that it is worth applying in Queensland. The majority of offsetting policies in Australia have adopted some principles of the North American mitigation programs. Examination reveals that however, they fail to provide adequate incentives for private landowners to participate because the essential trading mechanisms are not employed. Much can thus be learnt from the North American situation - where private enterprise has devised appropriate free market concepts. The consequent environmental banking process (as adapted from the North American programs) should be implemented in Queensland.
