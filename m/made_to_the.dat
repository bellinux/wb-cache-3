5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tower, {{and it became a}} magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Macmillan went to Zürich in May 1919 as a {{delegate}} to the International Congress of Women. The Congress strongly condemned the harsh surrender terms that were being planned for Germany in the Treaty of Versailles to be signed the next month. Macmillan carried the Congress' condemnation to the ongoing Paris Peace Conference, but no changes were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> treaty.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E

5|$|Although Shankar {{initially}} {{claimed that}} Enthiran {{would be made}} for all audiences, including those lacking computer literacy, the film is influenced by and makes references to many scientific principles relating to the fields of engineering, computer science and robotics, including terabytes and Asimov's laws of robotics. Visual references are <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> science books A Briefer History of Time (2005) and Freakonomics (2005).

Flight tests of the model in the clean and in the slats-and-flaps-extended conditions were made over a lift-coefficient range from about 0. 5 through the stall. Only low-altitude conditions were simulated and no attempt was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> effect on the stability characteristics of freeing the controls. Static force tests were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> static longitudinal and lateral stability derivatives and rotary force tests were <b>made</b> <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> dynamic rolling derivatives. Calculations were also <b>made</b> <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> damping of the lateral oscillation for correlation with the flight results...|$|R

France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basic design after this date—namely {{the substitution of}} 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
