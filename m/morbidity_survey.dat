40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Psychiatric <b>Morbidity</b> <b>Surveys</b> include English {{cross-sectional}} household samples {{surveyed in}} 1993, 2000 and 2007. AIMS: To evaluate frequency of common mental disorders (CMDs), service contact and treatment. METHOD: Common mental disorders were {{identified with the}} Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised (CIS-R). Service contact and treatment were established in structured interviews. RESULTS: There were 8615, 6126 and 5385 participants aged 16 - 64. Prevalence of CMDs was consistent (1993 : 14. 3 %; 2000 : 16. 0 %; 2007 : 16. 0 %), as was past-year primary care physician contact for psychological problems (1993 : 11. 3 %; 2000 : 12. 0 %; 2007 : 11. 7 %). Antidepressant receipt in people with CMDs more than doubled between 1993 (5. 7 %) and 2000 (14. 5 %), with little further increase by 2007 (15. 9 %). Psychological treatments increased in successive surveys. Many with CMDs received no treatment.
