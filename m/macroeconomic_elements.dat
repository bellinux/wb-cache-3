40|$|The {{persistent}} {{increase of}} government debt in Malaysia {{in the recent}} years has raised con-cerns as to whether the borrowings have spurred the economy or became a drag on econom-ic growth. The present paper investigates the real effect of government debt on sustainable economic growth in Malaysia using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach for the period of 1970 - 2015. The results show there are positive significant long- and short-run relationships between government debt and sustainable economic growth. There is also a unidirectional causality running from government debt to sustainable economic growth. The findings indicate that Malaysia’s government debt is an important <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>element</b> for sustainability of economic growth in Malaysia. There is no evidence, however, to con-clude that the level of government debt had any adverse impacts on sustainable economic growth...|$|R

To ensure the stability of neoliberal order and their hegemony, the United States use militarism as an economic means of regulation. We will question about the concept of war like factor of progress and social cohesion in Report from Iron Mountain. On the Possibility and Desirability of Peace by John Kenneth Galbraith. Neoliberalism and militarism take the form of contradictory injunctions in USA (Missile Defense and positive peace, permanent war and impossible peace) and in Europe (legal order and positive peace, absence of European Missile Defense and un-desirable peace). Face with the increase of world disorders, militarism would be a <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>element</b> of regulation in a process of profitable destruction. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the structuralist tradition in economics, emphasizing {{the role that}} structures play in the economic growth of developing countries. Since the subject at hand is evidently too large to cover in a single article, an emphasis has been brought to bear upon the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>elements</b> of such a tradition, while also exploring its methodological aspects. It begins by analysing some general aspects of structuralism in economics (its evolution and origins) associated with ECLAC thought, in this instance focusing on {{the dynamics of the}} center-periphery relationship. Thereafter, the macroeconomic structuralism derived from the works of Taylor (1983, 1991) is presented, followed by a presentation of neo-structuralism. Centred on the concept of systemic competitiveness, this approach defines a strategy to achieve the high road of globalization, understood here as an inevitable process in spite of its engagement being dependent on the policies adopted. The conclusions show the genuine contributions of this tradition to economic theory...|$|E
40|$|Among great {{challenges}} in handling European financial crisis, restoration of investors’ confidence and improving employment situation are the priorities. Real estate {{investment in a}} business portfolio is becoming popular due to its risk hedging characteristics and is considered as a potential threshold for uncertain days. By monitoring the global as well as country level economy, {{it is possible to}} reform CRE investment policies in better ways. In this regard, it is important to analyze the impacts of the macroeconomic forces, e. g., GDP, inflation, employment condition and investment costing on real estate return, especially, when the impact varies due to geographic differences. In this thesis, I aim to find the macroeconomic condition differentials of European countries and their impact on real estate. I choose three north-European countries, Finland, Sweden and UK for my study. In this research, I concentrate on the impact of the macroeconomy on commercial real estate. The focus of the thesis is finding the value appreciation of commercial real estate return due to macroeconomic changes over time. This study compares from cross-country perspective- the macroeconomic impacts on the commercial real estate markets. In this thesis, I would like to conduct a quantitative experiment for the empirical part. After I unsmooth the data, necessary tests are done before making it stationary. Different statistical methods are explored and applied before applying panel data analysis where random effect model is found to be appropriate. For cross-country comparison, I measure covariances and correlations between variables. VAR model is also applied to find out significant variable for each country. The main conclusions of the thesis are that the real estate capital return mainly depends on GDP, long-term interest rate and short-term interest rate among the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>elements.</b> According to the random effect model, GDP and long-term interest rate impact capital return positively and the short-term interest rate, inflation and unemployment rate impact the capital return negatively. For Finland and Sweden, GDP is found to be the only significant force. However, for the UK, the short-term interest rate is also found to be significant along with GDP among the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>elements.</b> From the country-level analysis, the vector autoregression models for individual countries could not detect any significant macroeconomic variables...|$|E

Three-ME is a new model of the French economy especially designed to evaluate the medium and long term impact of environmental and energy policies at the macroeconomic and sector levels. To do so Three-ME combines two important features. Firstly, it has the main characteristics of neo-Keynesian models by assuming a slow adjustment of e ective quantities and prices to their notional level, an endogenous money supply, a Taylor rule and a Philips curve. Compared to standard multi-sector CGEM, this has the advantage to allow for the existence of under-optimum equilibria such as the presence of involuntary unemployment.

40|$|Japanese Foreign Direct Investment {{has largely}} {{followed}} {{the principles of}} the mainstream FDI theories in particular those of the eclectic theory, which emphasizes Ownership of higher technology, Internalisation of production, and, exploitation of Local advantages such as cheap labour (OLI). The upsurge of investment since the Mid- 1980 s, however, has overstepped many of these principles. This flood of FDI is variously attributed to the particular circumstances of the Japanese economy such as higher value of the Yen, lower interest rates at home, overproduction, empire-building efforts at the Eastern wing of the Triad, and so on. These special features have led many researchers to relate the Japanese FDI only to some other <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>elements</b> of the Japanese economy such as trade, GNP, domestic demand etc., while other FDI economists have attempted to relate it to the globalisation process in which Japan is a big player. In explaining the special character of the Japanese FDI, researchers with a business-economic slant, tend to gravitate to the following issues: export/domestic sales proportions, profit retention / repatriation, HQ/subsidiary relationships, the role of domestic input, technology, strategy, culture, quality, and so on. Some valuable large-scale studies (though in dire need of updating) exist that deal with these issues. These are of course largely based on ‘arms-length...|$|E

Key <b>elements</b> of this research were two questionnaire-based surveys conducted in late 2007 /early 2008. One survey questionnaire, filled out by experts from national central banks in 23 European countries 1, was aimed at collecting information on wage bargaining institutions that prevailed in 2006 and a decade earlier in 19952. The second survey questionnaire sought information on wage and price-setting behavior at the firm level, and was filled out by firms in 17 European countries. The harmonized questionnaire included a common set of “core” questions for all countries, but some countries adapted the questionnaire to account for specific country characteristics and differences in institutional framework by including fewer or additional “non-core” questions 3. A third follow-up WDN survey was conducted during the summer of 2009 in a sample of 10 countries to examine firms’ perception of the financial crisis and their actual responses to it.|$|R

Hofman of the Economic Projections Center of the Statistics Division, and Heriberto Tapia research assistant {{in the office}} of the Executive Secretary of ECLAC. The views expressed in this document, which has been reproduced without formal editing, are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Organization [...] Abstract Potential output estimates are becoming increasingly important in policy design in Latin America (ECLAC, 2002) and the objective of this paper is to make a methodological contribution to this field of work. For a proper evaluation of the macroeconomic situation in a certain point in time it is important to have an idea of the level of potential output. For monetary policy decisions it is important to know what the level of potential output is compared to the effective output. In an era in which inflation targeting has become widespread in Latin America it has become increasingly important to estimate potential output. In projections of economic growth the output gap can be a very important input. Estimates of potential output are of course only one of many indicators to be used in macroeconomic policy evaluation. In most developed countries an array of measures about the economic cycle are used among which the most important are measures of capacity use, delivery lags and the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment) and direct measures of inflation. In the evaluation of the <b>macroeconomic</b> situation additional <b>elements</b> that might affect the economy (terms of trade, external situation) must be taken into consideration the whole complex environment of the economy internal and external. The work on economic growth has experienced a rapid expansion in the last few decades. Interesting new ideas have been developed and older somewhat forgotten ones have come to the focus of attention again. The growth performance of nations shows a great variety in results and these differences can be explained, among other causes, by differences in accumulation of production factors and multi factor productivity on one level and institutional factors and the international context on an other. In the context of these new approaches in the analysis of economic growth concepts like catching-up and potential growth are becoming increasingly important. In estimating potential output two approaches can be distinguished. In the first one a variety of statistical detrending techniques are applied, in our case using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, and in the second approach the output gap is estimated on the basis of structural relationships. The Hodrick-Prescott filter defines a "trend" output. The second part on production functions indicate more towards a concept of production frontier or the maximum possible production given certain factors. The paper estimates potential output in a group of nine countries in Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. These countries cover around 80 % of the Latin American territory and about 90 % of its GDP. A new aspect of our estimates is that they introduce the concept of structural change in the production function.

40|$|After {{overcoming}} various {{financial crises}} in the mid- 90 's and early millennium (Tequila, Asian, Russian, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador) Latin America found a proper environment conducive to reach sustained growth and <b>macroeconomic</b> stability. Endogenous <b>elements</b> - such as credit growth, {{the implementation of}} countercyclical funds, prudential public finances management, the establishment of inflation targets, the incentive to accumulate reserves, healthier external balances- and exogenous factors, mainly linked {{to an increase in}} commodity prices and low international interest rates, favored a scenario of higher output growth for the region as a whole. During these last years Latin American companies have been able to increase their production capacity, expand regionally and globally. Governments have made huge investment projects related to infrastructure and communications. The latter was facilitated by the context described above as well as the optimism created by greater political stability. Correspondingly, it was also driven by the amount of new funding instruments that have been available. There is whole range of financial products; from local to global emissions, settled in foreign or local currency, extension of liquidity lines, mixed instruments powered by multilateral banks, use of collateral for export finance, structured asset-backed securities are just a glimpse of all the financial spectrum of possibilities. These changes have provided governments the necessary tools to mitigate the impacts of the global financial crisis, especially on their most vulnerable populations. However, in the advent of a potential decline in growth from 2011 - 2013 -with respect to the strong rebound in 2010 - it is expected that a number of factors will limit the margin of actions that the authorities have to implement further countercyclical policies. Thus, the delayed recovery of the U. S., the deepening of the European crisis, a possible reversal of the terms of trade, less favorable external accounts and domestic inflationary processes will undermine the responsiveness of governments to the new situation. In this context it is of great importance to understand and appreciate relevant trends in some of the sources capable of enabling growth financing, while encouraging investment and job creation. This paper focuses on the characteristics and trends in Latin American debt capital markets, highlighting the importance of having domestic sources of funding as well as local currency issues. The investigation continues the discussion presented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2008) about "the forgotten history of domestic debt" and research studies elaborated by Serge Jeanneau and Camilo Tovar (2008) in relation to local currency bond issues. It also exhibits {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these trends; revisiting E. Cavallo’s question (2010) on how safe is really the new debt composition. To introduce the analysis of debt markets in a framework and a chronological conjuncture, the starting point of this study is an assessment form based on the behavior of key macroeconomic variables. First the macroeconomic fundamentals that underpin the functioning of financial markets are measured, examining whether major changes have occurred or just temporary responses have been randomly implemented (something common in the region). Secondly, an overview of the Latin American debt markets will be presented, focusing on the factors that have allowed their recent development. Afterwards, the main characteristics of local bond markets and current trends will be exhibit. This includes revealing trends in local currency debt issuances, prevailing actors as well as discussing the role of regional and multilateral banks. This work is intended to be "communicated" to a diverse audience: academia, public policy makers and private sector. In this sense it has sought to provide concrete examples that account for the trends found. Data sources used include ECLAC statistics, the database of the Inter-American Development, Bank of International Settlements (BIS), World Bank database, multiple International Monetary Fund (IMF) datasets, OECD reports and statistics, the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Emerging Markets Trading Association (EMTA), official data from central banks, investment banks research and rating agencies. Data from Bond Radar, Bloomberg and Dealogic was also utilized, as well as data sets constructed by researchers. ...|$|R
