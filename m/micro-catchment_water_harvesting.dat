In Syria, {{it was found that}} only a fraction of total runoff from a catchment is collected, with no significant effect on water supply downstream. Therefore, it is less sensitive to spatial-scale variations (rainfall, topography, soils) and it is less likely to create upstream-downstream water-use conflicts. <b>Micro-catchment</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> established fodder shrubs, with 3 - 7 fold growth improvement and 27 to 90 % survival rate. In contrast, spatial rainfall and geo-hydrological variations greatly influenced the potential of water harvesting at the watershed scale in north-west Egypt. The study revealed the importance of scientific data and appropriate assessment methods. Due to potential socio-economic disputes, the institutional arrangements for water allocation and conflict resolution are critical at this scale. At the farm scale, the low-cost farm runoff structures (US$ 48 per structure), effectively regulated the runoff, reduced terrace damage and improved field soil moisture, and were shown to be suitable for water harvesting on terraces in Barani, Pakistan. The study infers that water harvesting in the drylands is a viable option to improve productivity and conserve natural resources, if it is appropriately implemented. Nevertheless, the size of the water harvesting system and the spatial scale at which it is to be implemented determine the options for water harvesting. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

The primary {{objective of this}} study was to isolate and evaluate the grain yield performance of these cultivars. Additional measurements were also taken on transpiration rate (TR), leaf water potential (0), stress degree day (SDD), and crop water stress index (CWSI), during the period 24 October to 2 November, between two irrigations, in search of possible physiological mechanisms of drought adaptability and their impact on production. The system's performance in terms of economical crop growth is subject to further research. The analysis of grain yield indicates a significant varietal difference. Physiological parameters monitored also show trends of differences among cultivars. It was found that cultivars capable of maintaining a higher plant water content, by preserving their TR, Ψ 1, CWSI, and SDD are not necessarily the better yielding cultivars. Possible justifications of this phenomena are discussed.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A simple water balance model was applied to a <b>micro-catchment</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> system for a semi-arid area in the North-Eastern part of Jordan. Two Negarim <b>micro-catchment</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems were built at Al-Khanasri research station. A Randomized complete block design (RCBD) in factorial combination was used with six treatments and three replicates. Each plot was divided into two parts; a runoff area, and a run-on area. Two different treatments {{were used for the}} catchment area, these were: compacted (T 1) and Natural treatments (T 2). Three treatments were used for the run-on area, these were: disturbed (S 1), stones (S 2), and crop residue mulch (S 3). Soil water content was measured over a depth of 0 - 1 m during the seasons 96 - 97 in these micro-catchments. In this model; daily rainfall, runoff, and evaporation were used. Runoff was calculated by the curve number method; evaporation was calculated by the Penman equation, the Priestley and Taylor method and the Class A pan approach. The least squares method was used for optimizing model parameters. The performance of the model was assessed by different criteria, such as root mean square error, relative root mean square error, coefficient of determination and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency method. The performance of the micro-catchments system was also evaluated. Results showed that with limited but reliable hydrological data good agreement between predicted and observed values could be obtained. The ratio of water storage in a one meter soil depth to the rainfall falling on each catchment indicated that T 1 S 2 and T 1 S 3 have the highest values in size 1 plots while T 2 S 1 and T 2 S 2 have the highest values in size 2 plots. Modelling results showed that for all the size 1 plots, the required ratio of the cultivated to catchment area, (C/CA), required to ensure sufficient harvested water, was less than the actual ratio used in the experimental design. For the size 2 plots this was only true for the T 1 treatments. Consequently for the majority of plot sizes and treatments, the results showed that a smaller catchment area is capable of providing sufficient harvested water to meet crop growth requirements. The experimental ratio was based on a typical yearly design rainfall for the region having either a 50 % or 67 % probability of occurrence. Results also indicated that using stones and crop residue as mulch on the soil surface in the cultivated area was effective in decreasing the evaporation rate. S 3 was more efficient than S 2 as it stored more water due to the higher infiltration rate (12. 4 cm/hr) when compared to S 2 (4. 1 cm/hr) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Micro-catchment</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> (MCWH) {{requires}} {{development of}} small structures across mild land slopes, which capture overland flow and store it in soil profile for subsequent plant uses. Water availability to plants {{depends on the}} micro-catchment runoff yield and water storage capacity of both the plant basin and the soil profile in the plant root zone. This study assessed the MCWH potential of a Mediterranean arid environment by using runoff micro-catchment and soil water balance approaches. Average annual rainfall and evapotranspiration of the studied environment were estimated as 111 and 1671 Â mm, respectively. This environment hardly supports vegetation without supplementary water. During the study period, the annual rain was 158 Â mm in year 2004 / 2005, 45 Â mm in year 2005 / 2006 and 127 Â mm in year 2006 / 2007. About 5000 MCWH basins were developed for shrub raising on a land slope between 2 and 5 % by using three different techniques. Runoff at the outlets of 26 micro-catchments with catchment areas between 13 and 50 Â m 2 was measured. Also the runoff was indirectly assessed for another 40 micro-catchments by using soil water balance in the micro-catchments and the plant basins. Results show that runoff yield varied between 5 and 187 Â m 3 Â ha- 1 for various rainfall events. It was between 5 and 85 % of the incidental rainfall with an average value of 30 %. The rainfall threshold for runoff generation was estimated about 4 Â mm. Overall; the soil water balance approach predicted 38 - 57 % less water than micro-catchment runoff approach. This difference {{was due to the}} reason that the micro-catchment runoff approach accounted for entire event runoff in the tanks; thus showed a maximum water harvesting potential of the micro-catchments. Soil water balance approach estimated water storage in soil profile and did not incorporate water losses through spillage from plant basins and deep percolation. Therefore, this method depicted water storage capacity of the plant basins and the root zone soil profile. The different between maximum water harvesting potential and soil-water storage capacity is surplus runoff that can be better utilized through appropriate MCWH planning.

Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7. 66 t/ha (median). <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> therefore, {{can play an important}} role in increasing local- to regional-scale food security through increased and more stable food production and generation of extra income from the sale of cash crops.

The results are mixed, although the estimated marginal product values between onions and tomatoes show that farmers on average allocate water economically across these two crops. The descriptive data show that the share of irrigated land is lower at larger farms. Because farm size may increase in the future, it is interesting to investigate what determines the share of irrigated land in relation to farm size. A random-effects tobit model is appropriate to estimate this relationship. The result shows that access to both credit and markets, farm-size, region, aridity, and plot distance to water source all affect the share. Encouraging <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> requires flexible and effective variables that will work also for larger farms. Despite its weather-risk reducing advantage, the average disadoption rate of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technology between 2005 and 2010 was as high as 42 %. To find out why farmers disadopt, binary choice models are estimated to investigate the factors that cause disadoption. Based on the estimation results, it is concluded that increasing availability of plastic sheets and labour-saving equipment (water pumps), easier market and credit access, and the cultivation of perennials can reduce disadoption. The last empirical chapter focuses on the relation between <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> and fertilizer use. Due to weather risk, farmers may limit the use of purchased fertilizer, thereby continuing to grow a high share of low-risk and low-yield crops. To establish whether <b>harvested</b> <b>water</b> encourages fertilizer use, two variants of random-effect models are estimated. The results strongly support the idea that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technology induces fertilizer use, indicating that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> can increase fertilizer use- and hence crop yields- in Ethiopia. The concluding chapter discusses the results against the background of the research objective: what are the economics of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> at micro level?    ...|$|R
