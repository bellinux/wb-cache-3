I wish that {{he had been able to}} offer his advice and support in person along the way, and there are still many things I'd love to be able to ask him. Instead, I thank him for all his love and devotion, and the lessons I learned from him that helped <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> to the starting point. My dedication also to "Ursula", another I lost along the way. u Acknowledgements A number of people gave me support and assistance during the completion of this study and the writing of this thesis. Their time and care was invaluable, and without it, I feel that I could not have completed the many tasks required. I would like to give sincere thanks to my supervisor, Dr. Vanda Fortunato, w h o m I have grown to know during the course of our academic relationship, and who has given me so much time, support and encouragement. Thanks must also go to Dr. Dennis Hemphill, m y co-supervisor. I would also like to thank the young men and women w h o m I interviewed. Without their willingness to give me their time, honesty and insights into their life experiences, I would not even have been able to begin my research. A number of other individuals provided advice, encouragement and support along the way to completing this thesis. These include: Sara Glover and Allison Bone, important sounding boards and motivational triggers; Laurie Griffin, for her support from afar; my workmates at Bogong Equipment for their many different perspectives; all m y four-footed friends for their devotion; and of course the rest of my family and who have stood by me through all the ups and downs involved in work of this kind. Finally, I would like to thank my mother, Joan Mok, my partner, Helen McManus, and m y friend Janet Devlin for their constancy, their love and their support. Love to all of you. ii...|$|E

[...] The eclectic musical background of each member of the band lends itself to the different stylistic and technical approaches from song to song.

I'm still tempted, although probably that would be construed as an even greater sell-out. But, as a teenager, soul music {{was one of the things}} that made me want to be a musician. It was really passionate and exciting… Wayne Jackson, who plays on that track, was also with Otis Redding and was touring with him when I saw them in London. So that was a thrill for <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> to <b>get</b> a whole lot of fan stories.

[...] — Williams, ESPN interview, 2001 Williams has gained a reputation as a recruiter who almost exclusively goes after less-heralded players and develops them into Division I talents. An opposing coach, Dave Odom, once said in a newspaper interview that Williams [...] "has made a living off of the player who is maybe one or two tools short of the complete package (say, height or leaping ability), but who competes hard and plays with a chip on his shoulder."

Before the album's title was officially revealed, fans had already been calling Lamar's major label debut Good Kid, Mad City or Good Kid in a Mad City, as it was a nickname Lamar had given himself. The album's title mainly refers to Lamar's childhood innocence, and how Compton affected his life. After keeping the album title's acronym concealed, Lamar later revealed M.A.A.D is an acronym with two meanings: [...] "My Angry Adolescence Divided" [...] and [...] "My Angels on Angel Dust", with Lamar stating: [...] "That was me, it's the reason why I don't smoke.
