5|$|The {{midbrain}} (or <b>mesencephalon)</b> {{contains the}} two optic lobes. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as rainbow trout and cichlids.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrate}} brains share {{a common}} underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at {{the front end of}} the neural tube; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the prosencephalon, <b>mesencephalon,</b> and rhombencephalon, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.|$|E
5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, <b>mesencephalon</b> and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), <b>mesencephalon</b> (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (<b>mesencephalon)</b> and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. <b>mesencephalon).</b> In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
25|$|The spinal trigeminal nucleus sends pain-temperature {{information}} to the thalamus and sends {{information to}} the <b>mesencephalon</b> and the reticular formation of the brainstem. The latter pathways are analogous to the spinomesencephalic and spinoreticular tracts of the spinal cord, which send pain-temperature information {{from the rest of}} the body to the same areas. The <b>mesencephalon</b> modulates painful input before it reaches the level of consciousness. The reticular formation is responsible for the automatic (unconscious) orientation of the body to painful stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The rhombencephalon divides into a metencephalon and myelencephalon. The ventricles {{contained}} within the rhombencephalon become the fourth ventricle, and the ventricles {{contained within}} the <b>mesencephalon</b> become the aqueduct of Sylvius.|$|E
25|$|The periaqueductal gray is {{the gray}} matter located around the {{cerebral}} aqueduct within the tegmentum of the midbrain. It projects to the nucleus raphe magnus, and also contains descending autonomic tracts. The ascending pain and temperature fibers of the spinothalamic tract send {{information to the}} PAG via the spinomesencephalic tract (so-named because the fibers originate in the spine and terminate in the PAG, in the <b>mesencephalon</b> or midbrain).|$|E
25|$|The medial reticular {{formation}} and lateral {{reticular formation}} are two columns of neuronal nuclei with ill-defined boundaries that send projections through the medulla {{and into the}} <b>mesencephalon</b> (midbrain). The nuclei can be differentiated by function, cell type, and projections of efferent or afferent nerves. Moving caudally from the rostral midbrain, {{at the site of}} the rostral pons and the midbrain, the medial RF becomes less prominent, and the lateral RF becomes more prominent.|$|E
25|$|With {{increasing}} pressure and {{progression of the}} hernia there will be distortion of the brainstem leading to Duret hemorrhages (tearing of small vessels in the parenchyma) in the median and paramedian zones of the <b>mesencephalon</b> and pons. The rupture of these vessels leads to linear or flamed shaped hemorrhages. The disrupted brainstem can lead to decorticate posture, respiratory center depression and death. Other possibilities resulting from brain stem distortion include lethargy, slow heart rate, and pupil dilation.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} development, the human {{central nervous system}} is often {{classified}} based on the original three primitive vesicles from which it develops: These primary vesicles form in the normal development of the neural tube of the embryo and initially include the prosencephalon, <b>mesencephalon,</b> and rhombencephalon, in rostral to caudal (from head to tail) orientation. Later in development {{of the nervous system}} each section itself turns into smaller components. During development, the cells that migrate tangentially to form the basal ganglia are directed by the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences. The following table demonstrates this developmental classification and traces it to the anatomic structures found in the basal ganglia. The structures relevant to the basal ganglia are shown in bold.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya’s cetripedal theory {{identified}} {{that the effects}} always begin at {{the surface of the}} brain in mild injury and extend inward to affect the diencephalic- mesencephalic core in more severe injury. His work showed that both translational and rotational acceleration produce focal lesions but that only rotational acceleration produced diffuse axonal injury. When damage is found in the rostral brainstem it is also associated with diffuse hemispheric damage. Prior to his work it was believed that the mechanism of concussion was linked to primary brainstem injury. However, the brainstem and <b>mesencephalon</b> are the last structure to be affected in severe injury, and rotational rather than translational forces produce concussion. Contact phenomenon {{contribute to the development of}} focal lesions, e.g. frontal and temporal lesions due to contact with the sphenoid bone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have supported these theories. They have confirmed that the distribution of lesions follows a centripetal pattern that follows injury severity identified by the Glascow Coma Score.|$|E
500|$|So-called [...] "angiogram-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage", SAH {{that does}} not show an {{aneurysm}} with four-vessel angiography, carries a better prognosis than SAH with aneurysm; however, it is still associated with a risk of ischemia, rebleeding, and hydrocephalus. Perimesencephalic SAH (bleeding around the <b>mesencephalon</b> in the brain), however, has a very low rate of rebleeding or delayed ischemia, and the prognosis of this subtype is excellent.|$|E
2500|$|... After the episode, normal EEG {{patterns}} return. Functional MRI scans {{have shown}} that the <b>mesencephalon</b> and pons may be involved in the loss of motor control seen during an RMD episode, which is similar to other movement disorders ...|$|E
2500|$|Above are the Allen Human Brain Atlas {{expression}} data on CCDC142, {{with red}} indicating lower expression and green indicating higher expression. In the Homo sapiens brain, {{it was found}} that CCDC142 is lowly expressed in the cerebellar cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus. CCDC142 is also highly expressed in the substantia nigra, pons, claustrum, and <b>mesencephalon.</b> There is also relatively higher expression of CCDC142 in the mouth and thymus.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} several swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system, and are three in number: the prosencephalon, <b>mesencephalon</b> and rhombencephalon. These in turn divide into five sections. As these sections develop around the neural canal, the inner neural canal becomes known as primitive ventricles. These form the ventricular system of the brain: [...] The neural stem cells of the developing brain, principally radial glial cells, line the developing ventricular system in a transient zone called the ventricular zone.|$|E

50|$|Late in {{the fourth}} week, the {{superior}} part of the neural tube flexes {{at the level of}} the future midbrain—the <b>mesencephalon.</b> Above the <b>mesencephalon</b> is the prosencephalon (future forebrain) and beneath it is the rhombencephalon (future hindbrain).|$|E
5000|$|Wohlfart (1961) {{hypothesized}} that klazomania {{is caused by}} an irritating lesion in the <b>mesencephalon</b> and a malfunction in {{the control of the}} motor circuit from the substantia nigra in the <b>mesencephalon</b> to the globus pallidus in the striatum (mesostraital pathway). This circuit becomes overstimulated during a mesencephalic [...] "fit".|$|E
50|$|The {{cerebral}} aqueduct, {{also known}} as the aqueductus mesencephali, mesencephalic duct, sylvian aqueduct or the aqueduct of Sylvius is within the <b>mesencephalon</b> (or midbrain), contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and connects the third ventricle in the diencephalon to the fourth ventricle within the region of the <b>mesencephalon</b> and metencephalon, located dorsal to the pons and ventral to the cerebellum.|$|E
50|$|Late in {{the fourth}} week, the {{superior}} part of the neural tube flexes {{at the level of}} the future midbrain - the <b>mesencephalon.</b> Above the <b>mesencephalon</b> is the prosencephalon (future forebrain) and beneath it is the rhombencephalon (future hindbrain). The optical vesicle (which will eventually become the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon.|$|E
50|$|The diencephalon, <b>mesencephalon</b> and rhombencephalon {{constitute}} the brain stem of the embryo. It continues to flex at the <b>mesencephalon.</b> The rhombencephalon folds posteriorly, which causes its alar plate to flare and form the fourth ventricle of the brain. The pons and the cerebellum {{form in the}} upper part of the rhombencephalon, whilst the medulla oblongata forms in the lower part.|$|E
50|$|Some {{animals have}} had {{parts of their}} bodies {{remotely}} controlled, rather than their entire bodies. Researchers in China stimulated the <b>mesencephalon</b> of geckos (G. gecko) via micro stainless steel electrodes and observed the gecko's responses during stimulation. Locomotion responses such as spinal bending and limb movements could be elicited in different depths of <b>mesencephalon.</b> Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray area elicited ipsilateral spinal bending while stimulation of the ventral tegmental area elicited contralateral spinal bending.|$|E

50|$|The neural tube {{gives rise}} to both brain and spinal cord. The {{anterior}} (or 'rostral') portion of the neural tube initially differentiates into three brain vesicles (pockets): the prosencephalon at the front, the <b>mesencephalon,</b> and, between the <b>mesencephalon</b> and the spinal cord, the rhombencephalon. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the telencephalon and diencephalon; and the rhombencephalon divides into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The spinal cord {{is derived from the}} posterior or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Main {{structures}} of the developing brain: the prosencephalon (forebrain) consists of the telencephalon and diencephalon, the <b>mesencephalon</b> is the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon is the hindbrain.|$|E

50|$|The <b>mesencephalon</b> is {{considered}} part of the brainstem. Its substantia nigra is closely associated with motor system pathways of the basal ganglia. The human <b>mesencephalon</b> is archipallian in origin, meaning that its general architecture is shared with the most ancient of vertebrates. Dopamine produced in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area plays a role in excitation, motivation and habituation of species from humans to the most elementary animals such as insects. Laboratory house mice from lines that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running have enlarged midbrains. The midbrain helps to relay information for vision and hearing.|$|E
