40|$|Safe Return to Port (SRtP) {{regulation}} {{entry into}} force introduced new concepts and requirements for large passenger ships (constructed on or after 1 st July 2010, having length of 120 meters or more, or having three or more <b>Main</b> <b>Vertical</b> <b>Zones)</b> deeply affecting their design. In fact, the need of assuring {{a certain level of}} service also in case of fire or flooding events (within certain limits) caused a revolution in systems' design, mainly due to the relevance assumed by the systems' onboard placement. In this paper, motivations and basic concepts of SRtP are explained. A discussion about direct and indirect impacts on design process of such a regulation is then given, focusing in particular on the onboard power system, along with some examples of practical design and building issues...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== In {{the coastal}} waters {{there are three}} <b>main</b> <b>vertical</b> zones: Supralittoral <b>zone,</b> Intertidal zone and subtidal. The supralittoral, or splash zone, covers the area above the high tide mark; in the reserve this is mainly a region for algae, small crustaceans, and some beetles. The {{intertidal}} zone in the reserve is affected by warm temperatures in the summer, but scraped by ice and storms in the winter so that living creatures must cling in cracks and sheltered areas. The subtidal zone in the reserve, down to 200 meters, is the most biologically rich marine zone. Scientists of the Far East Marine Reserve have recorded 200 species of macroalgae, 200 of fish, 300 of molluscs, more than 200 of marine worms, and about 100 species of crustaceans. [...] For birds, the region is the richest in Russia - with over 340 species recorded. Great Pliez Island {{has some of the}} largest rookeries for the Japanese cormorant and black-tailed gull. The reserve is on the Far East flyway for migratory birds. The gulf is also known for its marine invertebrates, including cucumber, crab, and giant octopus. Minke whale, dolphins, and killer whales migrate into the gulf.|$|R

40|$|Scanning two book pages at {{the same}} time helps to {{accelerate}} the scanning process {{but on the other hand}} introduces several difficulties if the user needs to have one page per image. A major difficulty is the appearance of noisy black borders around text areas as well as of noisy black stripes between the two pages. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting the page frames on double page document images. Our aim is to split the image into the two pages as well as to remove noisy borders. First we apply a pre-processing which includes binarization, noise removal and image smoothing. Then, we detect the <b>vertical</b> <b>zones</b> of the two pages. In this stage, we introduce the vertical white run projections which have been proved efficient for detecting <b>vertical</b> <b>zones</b> of text areas. Finally, the horizontal zones of the two pages are detected based on horizontal white run projections. The experimental results on several double page document images from fifteen different books demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. 1...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Suturing in the <b>vertical</b> <b>zone</b> as {{described}} by Koh employs two portals: the left lower and the left Koh point and two KOH needle holders: Right and Left to facilitate intracorporeal suturing of the myoma bed. Multilayer continuous closure using standard 20 cm Polysorb or Vicryl suture on a CT 1 or GS Needle was achieved to obtain full thickness access of the myoma bed avoiding dead space and achieving excellent haemostasis.|$|R

The final layer was performed in a baseball stitch mode, which prevents exposure of the suture and gives pressure on the myoma bed.|$|R
