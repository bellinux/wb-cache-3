One notable development during Crawford's term was the advancement of the School of Industrial Management to a college. In 1966, Arthur G.

25|$|Amid the {{expansion}} of education in post-war Britain the University College, Dundee commissioned the construction of several new buildings {{to cope with the}} increasing numbers of students and academics arriving. The first of these was the Ewing Building which had started planning in 1950 and was officially opened in 1954. Named after Sir James Alfred Ewing, the University's first Professor of Engineering, the building currently houses postgraduate research facilities for the engineering and physics disciplines as well as the NERC Satellite Receiving Station. The Fulton Building gave the civil and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department</b> a dedicated building, it was opened in 1964 and took its name from Angus Robertson Fulton, former principal of University College, Dundee (1939–1946).|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the Industrial Engineering {{department}} branched {{off from}} the <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>department.</b> In 1956, a Civil Engineering Department was formed under Lehigh University graduate Robert L. Ketter, {{who went on to}} become Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University. In 1959, WBFO was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern National Public Radio personalities: Terri Gross and Ira Flatow. In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.|$|E

40|$|This papers {{discusses}} ongoing {{development of}} an aircraft design course designed for <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> students. Almost without exception, aerospace <b>engineering</b> <b>departments</b> operate in conjunction, collaboration, or coexistence with <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>departments</b> at most major American universities. On the other hand, the majority of <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>departments</b> operate alone; i. e., without aerospace <b>engineering</b> <b>departments,</b> thus limiting the undergraduate curricula to traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> topics. Also, 23 states do not offer any form of accredited education in aerospace engineering, restricting native students of those states interested in this field to either seeking education outside of their home state (often not an option) or being content with something “close enough, ” often times <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering.</b> A previous paper (Jacob, 2000) discussed different means of introducing aerospace engineering oriented education into a <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> undergraduate program, including course design, extracurricular activities, and research.

Throughout the school's history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department's development of the world's first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors. [...] In the <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department,</b> Adrian Bejan developed the constructal theory, which explains the shapes that arise in nature. Duke has pioneered studies involving nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complex systems in physics. In May 2006 Duke researchers mapped the final human chromosome, which made world news as the Human Genome Project was finally complete. Reports of Duke researchers' involvement in new AIDS vaccine research surfaced in June 2006. The biology department combines two historically strong programs in botany and zoology, while one of the divinity school's leading theologians is Stanley Hauerwas, whom Time named [...] "America's Best Theologian" [...] in 2001. The graduate program in literature boasts several internationally renowned figures, including Fredric Jameson, Michael Hardt, and Rey Chow, while philosophers Robert Brandon and Lakatos Award-winner Alexander Rosenberg contribute to Duke's ranking as the nation's best program in philosophy of biology, according to the Philosophical Gourmet Report.|$|E

This topic attracted the interest of scientists like Bernard Coleman, James Ferguson, and Frank Matthews Leslie who were attempting to exploit liquid crystals. When Leslie joined him at Johns Hopkins they formed a small group with post-doctoral associates to study liquid crystals.|$|E
