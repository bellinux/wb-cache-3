5000|$|Nalaka Godahewa’s {{appointment}} to SEC as Chairman {{took place at}} a time {{there were a number}} of controversies surrounding the Colombo Stock Exchange. During the last 12 months proceeding his appointment on 28 August 2012, two chairpersons of SEC had resigned due to public pressure following continuous decline in the overall market performance. Once rated the Asia’s second best performing stock market in Asia the CSE had become Asia’s worst performing stock market by mid-2012. The SEC chairmanship became vacant on 17 Aug when Former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Tilak Karunaratne resigned, claiming he had come under pressure from market players being investigated for alleged stock market. On the other hand active investors pointed out that during Karunratne’s tenure the market performance got from bad to worst due to ad hoc decision making and excessive regulations. Same allegation was there for Karunaratne’s predecessor Indrani Sugathadasa, during whose short tenure the market crash actually started. Godahewa on the other hand was seen as a more market friendly regulator respected by both public sector and private sector and the market confidence was visible in the immediate turnaround of the market following his appointment. [...] The new regulator assured that all investigations would continue without interruption but promised a more strategic approach for regulation and market development. [...] Following the introduction of a 10-point action plan for market development, the market bounced back once again All Share Price Index (CSEASI) returned to 6500 mark in June 2013, one year after it hit the bottom. In October 2013 Godahewa presented to the public the first year achievents at SEC which demonstrated that the implementation of the capital market development plan was on track. When capital <b>market</b> <b>vision</b> 2020 was launched in January 2015 with a target of achieving USD 100 B the market performance had reached a peak with ASPI at 7500 plus and performing better than all regional and global indices.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} spatial politics {{of citizenship and}} metropolitan development in California’s Santa Clara Valley. After 1945, residential and industrial developers transformed the Valley from an agricultural region to a sprawling metropolis celebrated for its high-tech economy, christened the Silicon Valley. As highly educated immigrants came {{to work in the}} computer industry, journalists and boosters portrayed the Silicon Valley as the fulfillment of the American Dream. But this process of metropolitan development displaced Mexican American and Japanese American residents who had lived on the semi-rural fringes of the Valley’s central city, San José. Providing a new approach to scholarship on suburban diversity, this study explains how these residents organized legal and political campaigns for metropolitan civil rights and economic citizenship. Civil rights activists challenged the racial and economic inequalities associated with the Alien Land Laws, racial covenants, mortgage policies, urban renewal, and housing desegregation. Debates about citizenship and civil rights were often debates about how to structure the market, particularly in residential real estate. After 1945, many liberals and civil rights activists espoused a colorblind <b>market</b> <b>vision.</b> They envisioned a system in which class rather than race would structure the market, and in the Valley this developed into a legal geography of suburban class exclusivity and racial inclusivity. During the postwar decades, the Valley’s liberal organizations and civil rights groups campaigned for colorblind policies, particularly in housing law. Liberals and middle-class civil rights activists promoted a discourse of colorblindness that conservatives later adopted. The Valley’s working-class activists articulated a different <b>market</b> <b>vision.</b> Mexican American community activists were the most vocal and the best organized, but they were only part of a broad multiracial movement for economic justice in the Valley. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, they promoted a vision of metropolitan government that would allow poor people to live in any part of the metropolis and access the public goods that had become increasingly privatized. As educated immigrants from Asia streamed into the Valley, they settled in exclusive suburbs — several of which became majority Asian American — buying into a spatially and economically bifurcated citizenship...|$|E

30|$|In a {{completely}} effective market, stock market volatility is random. However, through daily observations, {{we find that}} the stock market often shows regular fluctuations, which is counter intuitive. These cyclical fluctuations often occur during a certain period and are known as stock <b>market</b> <b>visions.</b> These phenomena have attracted academic attention because they can no longer be interpreted by traditional methods. The momentum and reversal effect, as two typical stock <b>market</b> <b>visions,</b> have caused heated discussion in the academic community. Retail investors and institutional investors believe that grasping momentum or reversal means that a stock's future returns can be predicted for profit. Some such cases do exist. Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) first discovered and proposed that the US securities market momentum effect exists for three to 12 months and provided a short-term profitability strategy. The authors also found that this strategy can obtain 1 % of the excess return rate within a certain period. Wang Yonghong and Zhao Xuejun (2001) used one month for the smallest sort period and discovered that China's stock market has a clear reversal effect. The authors also proved that the inertial effect of China's stock market is not obvious. However, scholars have not given a definitive answer as to how to grasp these visions. Research is still advancing incrementally. This paper focuses on the interpretation of the above two visions, constructs a model, and identifies a new visions model that {{can be applied to the}} explanation of the two anomalies at the same time. First, we explain several important basic concepts and previous research results.|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper (Webb, 1999) I argued that recent trends in English legal education, {{specifically}} the moves towards mass provision {{of a more}} flexible, performative and outcome-driven curriculum - have been consistent with a shift towards a strongly post-Fordist reconstruction of liberal educationalism. In this paper I intend to develop that argument {{in the context of}} European Union policy on higher education, culminating (thus far) in the Bologna Declaration of 1999. Since the early 1990 s the EU's version of 'a learning society' has evolved into a post-Fordist, <b>market</b> <b>vision</b> for higher education. This paper will focus particularly on the study of EU policy and its implementation as an examplar {{of the ways in which}} (legal) higher education is becoming globalized. Globalization is, of course, a core element of post-Fordist political economy. However, I suggest we should not restrict our attention purely to political economy's concern with the internationalisation (or Americanisation) of education markets. The notion of the 'learning society' suggests a reconfiguring of both the structural forms of social organisation which make up the milieu of legal education, and our conception of academic knowledge itself. This process I will characterise, following Nederveen Pieterse (1995), as one of "structural hybridization". The paper will conclude by reflecting on some of the threats and opportunities such hybridization seems to offer. ...|$|E

The method used was the multi case study. We can highlight the following results: (a) operate with independent international distributors is a way of exporting with broad geographic scope and low investment; it was a way of accelerating the internationalization of the production company; (b) the selection of distributors accepting contractual terms that give the manufacturer more control over marketing key variables, especially those related to positioning and brand image, depends on the desired position, or already conquered, by the distributor; (c) the strategy of direct investment abroad is the result of the <b>market</b> <b>vision</b> sometimes much larger than the one of their country of origin; (d) technology products with high impact on client’s work have the consequence of making the clients establish close relationship with the distributor, buying several other items necessary to a dental office; (e) the issue of exclusivity has more shades than it seems.

First, {{the focus of this}} article is to prove that medium-term momentum and long-term reversal exists and can be explained. Some studies prove that there are two types of visions. However, studies that explain the two visions are few. Second, the main research method we use in this study is the experimental method. We use the MC model with the BM factor, relying on a large number of sample data to prove the existence of medium-term momentum and long-term reversal. Additionally, we explain the existence of two types of visions. This research method is rare in the literature, which emphasizes the uniqueness of this study.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the differential effect of customer orientation and future market focus on organization inertia and firm innovativeness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the business-to-business service industry. It is motivated by the observation that small and medium-sized service firms' proxy to customers may lead to incremental service improvement in response to customer requests for customization and improvement, but may derail programs for more innovative services. Design/methodology/approach – A survey among 217 small and medium-sized service firms is used to test the hypotheses developed. The data are analyzed using a path model and Lisrel software. Findings – The results show that customer orientation breeds inertia, whereas future market focus increases the willingness to cannibalize existing technology, service portfolio and routines, which in turn stimulates firm innovativeness. Research limitations/implications – The results suggest that it is important to distinguish between customer orientation and future market focus, and that particularly small and medium-sized firms may require both orientations for sustained firm performance. Future research may be directed at developing tools for monitoring against inertia and helping managers to decide more objectively when to listen to their current customers and when not to. Practical implications – The results suggest managers should complement customer orientation with activities and management attention geared towards developing future <b>market</b> <b>vision.</b> Originality/value – This study is one of the first to simultaneously investigate the role of customer orientation and future market focus for small and medium-sized firms in the service industry...|$|E

In this paper the following inputs are being given in order to get a clear picture if Macedonian companies are keen on to learning and stimulating the individual and collective learning as to improve the results in general. According to the given results in the research, it is stated that Macedonian companies do not care about the quality, insufficiently pay attention to the continuous education, make small investments in the innovations and over all, the quality system is built in a very small number of companies. In this paper the following model for a successful designing and implementing of the educational system as a subsystem of the house of quality is suggested. This methodology is integral and universal meaning it is applicable to all companies and institutions. Without a given training about TQM (Total Quality Management) philosophy and a continued education provided firstly to the managers and further on to all the employees, the TQM strategy could not be implemented as well as the benefits that come with the quality system.

40|$|<b>Market</b> <b>Vision</b> (MV) and Market Visioning Competence (MVC) are {{critical}} concerns when developing successful, radically-innovative products. The inherent risks and rewards {{associated with such}} high-stake ventures require that firms create a long-term vision to guide their effort. A clear and compelling vision about the product-market opportunities associated with radically new ventures can help firms achieve a significant competitive advantage, which ultimately can lead to superior financial results. Despite today's increased rate of discontinuous innovation and hence {{the importance of having}} effective MV and MVC, there are major gaps in this area of knowledge and research. Thus, the first objective of this dissertation is to develop an in-depth understanding of the concepts that entail MV and MVC for radically new high-tech products. In line with this, the research determines: the specific variables (and associated measures) that comprise these two concepts, to what extent they are distinct, and how they are related. The second objective is to test whether MVC and MV are linked to Early Performance in the development of radically-new, high-tech products. Exploratory and objective empirical research, in addition to a literature review, helped define MV as "a clear and specific mental model/image that organizational members have of a desired and important product-market for a new advanced technology", and MVC as "a set of individual and organizational capabilities that enable the linking of advanced technologies to a future market opportunity". Based on samples of firms involved in early technology development, the measurement study suggests that four factors underly MVC (Networking, Idea Driving, Proactive Market Orientation Market Learning Tools) and five factors comprise MV (Clarity, Magnetism, Specificity, Form, Scope). Structural equation modeling demonstrates that MVC significantly and positively impacts MV and that each of these constructs significantly and positively influences separate elements of Early Performance. In addition, moderators were studied to explore their impact on the main structural relationships. This is the first empirical study to develop scales to measure each of these main constructs and to combine them in a comprehensive model with Early Performance metrics...|$|E
40|$|Background and Problem: The {{number of}} {{companies}} aiming at operating in the international markets right after their inception is at constant growth.  According to Knight and Cavusgil (2004), these firms, which are quite often small and technology-oriented, have the tendency to adopt a global <b>market</b> <b>vision</b> from the initial stage of company’s establishment. The vast and rapid technological change is one crucial reason behind {{the spread of the}} born global phenomenon. Born globals can reach out much earlier and faster to the international market than traditional firms. The phenomenon has been studied earlier, however with a focus on the firm-level drivers of early and rapid internationalization without giving enough importance {{to the role of the}} entrepreneur.     Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to understand the early and rapid internationalization process of born global firms based on the characteristics and the behavior of the entrepreneur managing the firm.   In addition, the research team will contribute to the existing born global literature by applying existing models from the International Business and International Entrepreneurship disciplines.   Methodology: In order to answer the research question presented in this thesis, a qualitative research approach was chosen. The research team included 5 Swedish born global Internet–based companies, namely Klarna, Sqore, the Local, Asket and 46 elks.   Analysis and conclusion:  Our findings concluded that the entrepreneurs of born global firms play a significant role in the early and rapid internationalization of the firm. The entrepreneurs tend to subconsciously use effectuation logic at the early stages of the firm establishment by possessing traits of an entrepreneur such as innovativeness, proactivity and risk-taking behavior. Furthermore the educational background and prior work experience were found to be of equal importance, however international experience and entrepreneurial background were observed to be of an utmost importance. Social and business networks were also noticed to play a significant role in the early stages of a firm. Finally, it was spotted that the entrepreneurs tend to change their effectuation logic to a causation one at later stages of firm development including its expansion to international markets...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes to}} reconsider radically the {{methodology}} {{and history of}} economics, whether present day mainstream or heterodox versions of it. The profession of economists must definitely abandon Cartesian dualism and adopt Vygotskian constructivism. In fact constructivist economics already existed {{in the past and}} was cognitively very successful and socially very useful. It was the economics of Gustav Schmoller’s historico-ethical school and the institutionalist economics of John R. Commons, traditions of which are totally ignored by the contemporary community of economists. The former tradition was based on Dilthey’s hermeneutics and the latter on Peirce’s pragmatism. It is worth to underline that hermeneutics and pragmatism are both predecessors of Vygotskian constructivism. During the last two decades a lot was written by economists on pragmatist, constructivist and discursive approaches to the methodology and history of economics, but those who wrote on these topics viewed them from the dualistic point of view. 	My paper is an appeal to economists to reconsider Methodenstreit. The dispute of methods between Schmoller and Menger can be considered as a repetition of a similar dispute taking place more than two hundred years earlier between Robert Boyle and Thomas Hobbes. Schmoller-Menger dispute started soon after the beginning of the institutionalisation of experimentally-oriented economics which happened with the creation in 1873 of the Verein für Sozialpolitik. Boyle-Hobbes dispute started in 1660, when the Royal Society of London had been founded, the cradle of the institution of science. Schmoller was one of the creators of the Verein and Boyle was {{one of the founders of}} the Royal Society. The activities of both societies were similar in several respects: they represented efforts to collect data, working out of detailed reports and collective evaluation of obtained results. For Hobbes, as for Menger, the model of ‘science’ was geometry. Boyle and Schmoller privileged collecting and analysing data. Boyle did win the dispute, Schmoller did loose. It happened because of different attitudes of powerful groups in societies towards natural scientific experimental research and experimental social research. They were interested in the former and they saw much more danger than benefit for them in the latter. On the contrary they were interested in abstract theoretical constructions justifying the <b>market</b> <b>vision</b> of society and laissez-faire. This kind of constructions corresponded to deeply enrooted scholastic traditions of European universities to teach theology and linked with it philosophy. In the framework of these traditions mathematics was considered as a summit of the scientific approach. 	On the one hand the adoption of constructivism by economists would turn their discipline into a science functionally close to natural sciences.
