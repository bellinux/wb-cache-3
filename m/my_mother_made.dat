2500|$|In 1990, sitting {{president}} George H.W. Bush banned broccoli from Air Force One, stating, [...] "I {{do not like}} broccoli. And I haven't liked it since I {{was a little kid}} and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me eat it, and I'm President of the United States. And Iâ€™m not going to eat any more broccoli." [...] In response to the ban, an estimated ten tons of broccoli were sent to the White House, which Barbara Bush in turn donated to the Capital Area Food Bank. That same year, the president visited the food bank and incorporated it into his Points of Light Foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{also told}} the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a {{reference}} to kosher dieting, [...] "I still had a ham sandwich for lunch. And <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> great pork chops." [...] The Washington Post reported that Allen's mother feared retribution against her family if her religious and ethnic background became public, and had originally asked Allen to keep that information private. Although no mention is made of her mother's religion in Allen's sister's book, she does mention that the Catholic Church, before marrying the couple, required Allen's parents to agree that any children would be raised Catholic, {{and as a result}} they decided to be married by a justice of the peace in the home of a Jewish friend.|$|E
60|$|After breakfast {{that morning}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> a request which startled me {{almost as much}} it delighted me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> have <b>made</b> {{that message}} up between you, to try me!" [...] he burst out. [...] "Damn all underhand work is what I say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Cis, {{with the}} same straightforwardness, sprung of their old fraternal intercourse, [...] "you must quit all love for me save a brother's, Humfrey; for <b>my</b> Queen <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me give her my word on my duty never to wed you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All!' exclaimed Leonard. 'No--no {{words can}} say that! Oh! {{was it for}} such as this that <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> so much of me--and I got through the fever--and I hoped--and I strove--Why--why should I be cut off--for a disgrace and a misery to all! and again came the heart-broken sobs, though less violently.|$|R
60|$|But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> no answer, {{except to}} thank her, and Peggotty went running {{on in her}} own fashion.|$|E
6000|$|O weary lady, Geraldine, [...] 190 [...] I pray you, drink this cordial wine! [...] It is a wine of virtuous powers; [...] <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> it of wild flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I know it--I know it. This affair {{has been}} so unexpected, I have even been at the communion-table, sir: yes, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me commune. Nothing was neglected, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|But a quick {{interrogative}} glance {{kept her}} silent. [...] "She {{was very small}} and delicate, and her father was impatient both of her weakness and mine. I think that was when I began to long for <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> He <b>made</b> me call her Glykera, after his mother. I had taught him to be bitter against mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{really had}} not the least notion that a wetting ruined their crops; and when I would have answered, <b>my</b> godmother and <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me a sign to hold my tongue, while Queen Henrietta spoke: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I am, in part, at least, <b>my</b> girl's <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me. She's {{asleep at}} last, {{and because of}} what she bore it's {{up to me to}} make things {{smoother}} for her daughter. Madam," [...] he added, turning to his companion with a smile, [...] "I have to thank you for doing what you must have figured was your duty; but in the meanwhile we'll--let things slide." ...|$|R
60|$|Haying was a {{delightful}} season to us, for the scythes {{of the men}} occasionally tossed up clusters of beautiful strawberries, which we joyfully gathered. I remember with especial pleasure the delicious shortcakes which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> of the wild fruit which we picked in the warm odorous grass {{along the edge of}} the meadow.|$|E
6000|$|Once I turned, {{when the}} end of the {{quadrangle}} was reached, and I waved my cap to my mother and Fra Gervasio, who stood upon the steps where I had left them. The friar responded by waving back to me. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> no sign. Likely enough her eyes were upon the ground again already ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> {{the young}} man welcome, as she would have done any I might have brought in with me to our home in Pennsylvania, and {{out here in the}} wilderness, where we had not seen a strange, yet friendly, face since my poor father was murdered, she was rejoiced to meet one who might give us news of the outside world.|$|E
6000|$|She reached {{these words}} in the serial: [...] "I cannot forget, Amy, that {{whatever}} I am, <b>my</b> good old <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me, with her untiring care and the gentle words she spoke to me when worried and harassed with doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't {{think they}} were rich,' said Felix. 'I fancy {{they used to be}} very fond of <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and <b>made</b> her promise that the next girl should be named for one of them. There was Miss Bridget, and Miss Martha, and {{something}} else as bad, and Robina was the least objectionable of the lot. I think they used to write to my mother; but it is late in the day for calling.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> {{had left}} her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly, began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in a Dutch clock, until they reached <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> Then she <b>made</b> a frown and a gesture to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> like one who was {{accustomed}} to be obeyed, to come and open the door. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> went.|$|R
60|$|If {{anything}} {{could have made}} our adventure more unpleasant to Mr. and Mrs. Winslow, {{it would have been}} the presence of guests. However, inquiry was suppressed at breakfast, in deference to the signs <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> to enjoin silence before the children, all unaware that Emily was nearly frantic with suppressed curiosity, and Martyn knew more about the popular version of the legend than any of us.|$|E
6000|$|They say cowardice is infectious; {{but then}} {{argument}} is, {{on the other}} hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy; [...] "if none {{of the rest of}} you dare," [...] she said, [...] "Jim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest open, if we die for it. And I'll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful money in." ...|$|E
6000|$|GREGORY [interrupting her]. Yes, Yes: I {{know all}} about that. It's not romantic: it's not Don Juan: it's not advanced; but we feel it all the same. It's far deeper in our blood and bones than all the romantic stuff. My father got into a scandal once: that was why <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me promise never {{to make love to}} a married woman. And now I've done it I can't feel honest. Don't pretend to despise me or laugh at me. You feel it too. You said just now that your own {{conscience}} was uneasy when you thought of your husband. What must it be when you think of my wife? ...|$|E
5000|$|The eldest {{child of}} Leonard and Louise Melfi, owner-operators of the Circle Tavern in Binghamton, New York, Melfi once quipped {{that he had}} {{developed}} his prodigious appetite for alcohol by [...] "working in the family business." [...] In a 1966 radio interview with WBAI's Janet Coleman he confessed [...] "We always talked, and we always cooked together, and while cooking we drank. My father's father was a bootlegger and <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> father <b>made</b> wine in the cellar...I was sort of doomed." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>MY</b> <b>mother</b> {{passed away}} exactly {{a year ago}} last week after being hospitalised for several months at Kuala Lumpur Hospital. She had been hospitalised {{elsewhere}} but had not experienced anything comparable to the care she received under Datuk Dr Zaki Morad and his dedicated staff. It was because of this that the departure of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>made</b> a little easier, {{knowing full well that}} we had tried everything we could to provide the best for her and {{that it was time for}} her to return to God. As believers, we are convinced that there can never be a better place to return to, except to our beloved Creator...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Tyrrwhit, and Mr. Hart, and Mr. Spicer {{could not}} have robbed me of my name. Let them have done what they would with their bonds, I should have been, at any rate, Scarborough of Tretton. My belief is that I need not blush for <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> He has <b>made</b> it appear that I should do so. I can't forgive him because he gives me the chairs and tables." ...|$|R
60|$|My father {{corresponded with}} the old Rector {{about the state of}} the parish, and at last went over to Bath for a {{personal}} conference, but without much satisfaction. The Earlscombe people were pronounced to be an ungrateful good-for-nothing set, for whom it was of no use to do anything; and indeed <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> such discoveries in the cottages that she durst not let Emily fulfil her cherished scheme of visiting them. The only resemblance to the favourite heroines of religious tales that could be permitted was assembling a tiny Sunday class in Chapman's lodge; and it must be confessed that her brothers thought she made as much fuss about it as if there had been a hundred scholars.|$|E
6000|$|What? Well, yes, {{this is good}} coffee, too. If {{they don't}} know much, [...] They do {{know how to make}} coffee, I will say that for these Dutch. [...] But my--oh, my! It ain't the kind of coffee <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made,</b> [...] And the coffee my wife used to make would throw it clear in the shade; [...] And the brand of sugar-cured, canvased ham that she always used-- [...] Well, this Westphalia stuff would simply have made her amused! [...] That so, heigh? I saw that you was United States as soon [...] As ever I heard you talk; I reckon I know the tune! [...] Pick it out anywhere; and you {{understand}} how I feel [...] About these here foreign breakfasts: breakfast is my best meal.|$|E
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. Sure, I {{know she}} would, sir. She {{was always a}} kind friend to the poor. Little her ladyship knew, God help her, the depth of divilment that was in us: we were like a play to her. You see, sir, she was English: {{that was how it}} was. We was to her what the Pathans and Senegalese was to me when I first seen them: I couldn't think, somehow, that they were liars, and thieves, and backbiters, and drunkards, just like {{ourselves}} or any other Christians. Oh, her ladyship never knew all that was going on behind her back: how would she? When I was a weeshy child, she gave me the first penny I ever had in my hand; and I wanted to pray for her conversion that night the same as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> me pray for yours; and-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{may tell}} you, {{now that the}} end seems near. My father was an Arab, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> a noble Frank, a French woman, whom he found {{starving}} in the desert after a fight, and took to his tent and made his wife. The Assassins fell upon us and killed him and her, and captured me as a child of twelve. Afterwards, when I grew older, being beautiful in those days, I {{was taken to the}} harem of Sinan, and, although in secret I had been bred up a Christian by <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> they swore me of his accursed faith. Now you will understand why I hate him so sorely who murdered my father and <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and <b>made</b> me what I am; why I hold myself so vile also. Yes, I have been forced to serve as his spy or be killed, who, although he believed me his faithful slave, desired first to be avenged upon him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> had <b>made</b> it a {{point that}} Jaaf should {{accompany}} me on all occasions when I was sent to any distance from my father. She naturally enough supposed I had the most need of {{the care of a}} faithful attendant, and the black had consequently got to be about half transferred to me. He evidently liked this change, both because it was always accompanied by change of scene and the chances for new adventures, and because it gave him an opportunity of relating many of the events of his youth; events that had got to be worn threadbare, as narratives, with his [...] "ole masser," [...] but which were still fresh with his [...] "young." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>my</b> dear, <b>mothers</b> are <b>made</b> to like {{pain and}} {{trouble for the}} sake of their children. Is it because the singing lessons are so few, and are likely to fall off when the season comes to an end? Success in these things can't come all at once." [...] Mrs. Meyrick did not believe that she was {{touching}} the real grief; but a guess that could be corrected would make an easier channel for confidence.|$|R
6000|$|We {{really felt}} {{it to the}} credit of our country that Sir George Eastwood sent an {{invitation}} to an early dance to please his young daughters; and for this our visitors prolonged their stay. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> Clarence go, {{that she might have}} some one {{to take care of her}} and Emily, since Griff was sure to be absorbed by his lady. [...] Emily had not been to a ball since those gay days in London with Ellen. She shrank back from the contrast, and would have begged off; but she was told that she must submit; and though she said she felt immeasurably older than at that happy time, I believe she was not above being pleased with the pale pink satin dress and wreath of white jessamine, which my father presented to her, and in which, according to Martyn, she beat 'Griff's bird all to shivers.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is no need}} {{to recall}} her {{expressions}} of maternal indignation when she was informed of the step I had taken. On the pacification of Canada, my dear Harry asked for leave of absence, and dutifully paid a visit to Virginia. He wrote, describing his reception at home, and the splendid entertainments which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> in honour of her son. Castlewood, which she had not inhabited since our departure for Europe, was thrown open again to our friends of the colony; and the friend of Wolfe, and the soldier of Quebec, was received by all our acquaintance with every becoming honour. Some dismal quarrels, to be sure, ensued, because my brother persisted in maintaining his friendship with Colonel Washington, of Mount Vernon, whose praises Harry never was tired of singing. Indeed I allow the gentleman every virtue; and in the struggles which terminated so fatally for England a few years since, I can admire as well as his warmest friends, General Washington's glorious constancy and success.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no secret, {{only such}} things are best not brought up again. Camilla Vivian was poor Raymond's grande passion, {{and you may}} imagine what a grief that was to my mother, {{especially}} as the poor brother was then living--one of the most fascinating, dangerous men I ever saw; and the whole tone of the place was ultra gay and thoughtless, the most reckless extravagance. However, he was set upon it, {{and my mother was}} forced to consent to the engagement. She seemed equally devoted to him, till she met Lord Tyrrell at some country house, and then a quarrel was picked, either by her mother or herself, about my mother retaining the headship of her own house. It was a palpable excuse, but it served to break the affair off, and Raymond was cruelly cut up. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>made</b> herself everything to him from that moment, gave up all her former habits to be with him, sent the little boys to school, and fairly dragged him through the trouble!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{we came to}} the Dew-ponds all {{our people}} were there. The men showed their knives and told their tale. The sheep guards also had seen The Beast flying from us. The Beast went west across the river in packs--howling! He knew the Knife had come to the Naked Chalk at last--at last! He knew! So my work was done. I looked for my Maiden among the Priestesses. She looked at me, but she did not smile. She made the sign to me that our Priestesses must make when they {{sacrifice}} to the Old Dead in the Barrows. I would have spoken, but <b>my</b> <b>Mother's</b> brother <b>made</b> himself <b>my</b> Mouth, as though I {{had been one of the}} Old Dead in the Barrows for whom our Priests speak to the people on Midsummer Mornings.' ...|$|R

60|$|Well, I knew Eustace and Meg {{would have}} called me self-willed, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had once <b>made</b> such a noise about our taking shelter from Broussel's mob at the Maison Darpent; {{but this was a}} mere visit of charity and necessity, for it was quite certain that the two good ladies could never have {{understood}} one another without me to interpret for them. Moreover, when Clement Darpent had rescued my sister from the mob, and was always watching to protect us, we surely owed him some return of gratitude, {{and it would have been}} mere bourgeois.|$|R
