25|$|The next {{document}} issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, “FDA is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking {{in the form}} of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not <b>misbranded.</b> FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips.” In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products.|$|E

The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than [...] "placental extract" [...] and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name [...] "placental extract" [...] with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 20th century {{drugs were}} {{generally}} produced by small scale manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims {{of safety and}} efficacy. To the extent that such laws did exist, enforcement was lax. In the United States, increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. [...] The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs. [...] This was followed in 1906 by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or <b>misbranded</b> foods and drugs. A drug was considered <b>misbranded</b> if it contained alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of several other potentially dangerous or addictive drugs, and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs. [...] The government's attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling restricting the federal government's enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug's ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|On September 6, 2016, 44 {{years after}} its initial {{proposed}} rule, FDA issued a final rule establishing that 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic products intended for use with water (aka consumer antiseptic washes) are not {{generally recognized as safe}} and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and are <b>misbranded,</b> and are new drugs for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD Act are required for marketing.

In 1993, the FDA determined that not all over-the-counter topically applied hormone-containing drug products for human use are {{generally recognized as safe}} and effective and are <b>misbranded.</b> An accompanying proposed rule deals with cosmetics, concluding that any use of natural estrogens in a cosmetic product makes the product an unapproved new drug and that any cosmetic using the term [...] "hormone" [...] in the text of its labeling or in its ingredient statement makes an implied drug claim, subjecting such a product to regulatory action.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{national}} and international pharmacopoeias, like the EU and the U.S. pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopeia in the EU is prepared by a governmental organization, and has a specified role in law in the EU. In the U.S., the USP-NF (United States Pharmacopeia – National Formulary) has been issued by a private non-profit organization since 1820 {{under the authority of}} a Convention that meets periodically that is largely constituted by physicians, pharmacists, and other public health professionals, setting standards published in the compendia through various Expert Committees. [...] In the U.S. when there is an applicable USP-NF quality monograph, drugs and drug ingredients must conform to the compendial requirements (such as for strength, quality or purity) or be deemed adulterated or <b>misbranded</b> under the Federal food and drug laws.|$|E
2500|$|With all of Coca-Cola’s success, came fame, {{and with}} the fame came the questions. In 1909, the Pure Food and Drug Act passed, and the United States {{government}} seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup because they considered the added caffeine to be a harmful ingredient. One of the first noted criticisms of Coca-Cola was that it produced serious mental and motor deficits. [...] This resulted in Coca-Cola’s first lawsuit and trial where the official charges were that Coca-Cola was adulterated and <b>misbranded.</b> The trial following the lawsuit, The United States Government v. Forty Barrels, Twenty Kegs Coca-Cola, started in March 1911 {{a year and a}} half after the government had seized the barrels and kegs. Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemist and head of the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture led the lawsuit. Wiley was anti Coca-Cola mainly because he was against the added caffeine. The trial included many studies as well as paid testimonies from both parties and in the end was dismissed by the judge. However, the United States government ended up winning the case when they took it to the Supreme Court 1916. This resulted in the reduction of caffeine content in Coca-Cola.|$|E

50|$|The {{standards}} for food {{sold in the}} United States are set forth in Chapter IV of the Act.

In 1912, Congress responded with the Sherley Amendments, which addressed the perceived lack of enforcement of fraud related to therapeutic claims;: The Act was amended to prohibit false and fraudulent claims of health benefits, but enforcement under the amendment required proof of fraudulent intent, a difficult standard.|$|R
