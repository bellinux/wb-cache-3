40|$|A new {{technique}} allows dynamic measurements of physical, chemical and thermal {{changes in the}} transformation of coal to coke. The endothermic and exothermic processes were indentified by apparent specific heat while the carbonisation was indicated by the estimated thermal conductivity {{as a function of}} temperature of the coal. Evaluations of swelling and permeability of the coal were synchronously evolved as the thermal changes were estimated. Also, the technique allows for continuous quantitative elemental characterization of gases and tars as they were evolved during pyrolysis. Mechanisms and reactions in the transformation of coal to coke are clarified by measuring the properties of one coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrate</b> using this technique...|$|E
40|$|A {{suite of}} coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> were {{prepared}} {{from a single}} coal using a water-based method for two discrete particle size fractions. Coal macerals were produced with the vitrinite content varying from 91. 2 % to 26. 1 % for the 106 – 212 μm particle size fraction and 96. 0 % to 38. 2 % for the 212 – 500 μm particle size fraction. Thermo-swelling of coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> were evaluated by the Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique with extended volumetric measurements. This novel CATA technique allows the apparent specific heat, thermal conductivity, and transient volumetric swelling of the coal sample to be measured simultaneously, {{as a function of}} temperature. The experimental results indicated that the maximum swelling (∼ 510 °C) and high-temperature contraction (600 – 1000 °C), as well as exothermic heat during primary devolatilization and thermal conductivity at maximum swelling all increased with vitrinite content, with the data inferring a linear relationship, and was independent of particle size, when coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> contain more than 63 % vitrinite. A hypothesis for intragranular (within particles) and intergranular (between particles) swelling was used to explain the association of swelling with vitrinite content and particle size. Optical microscopic results of the final pyrolytic residues of different coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> support this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{measured}} coke reactivity index (CRI) and coke strength after reaction (CSR) {{determined in}} experiments based on coke formed in pilot-scale coke ovens {{are the two}} main parameters that are employed to evaluate coke for its potential utilization in the blast furnace. Thermoplasticity, such as swelling, permeability and fluidity, chemical reactions, such as the evolution of gases and tars, and thermal changes, such as heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivity, on coal heating are known to dominate the transformation of coal to coke in the coke oven, and determine the CRI and CSR of coke. Coal properties, such as vitrinite and inertinite components, and coking conditions, such as heating rate and particle size, have also been found to influence the physical, chemical and thermal properties during coking. Many studies have previously investigated the swelling of different coals and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> {{as well as the}} influence of heating rate and particle size on swelling during coking. The literature has highlighted the correlations between swelling, mass loss and the properties of the released tars and gases for a range of coals and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> using a number of techniques. However, the correlations between swelling and the dynamic evolution of total volatiles (gases and tars), and the physical and chemical properties of the evolved tars, are made from data collected from independent experiments and therefore the interpretations are not very clear. Previous work compared heat of devolatilisation between thermal coals and coking coals. For coking coals only, the differences in heat of devolatilisation and thermal conductivities between high fluidity and low fluidity coking coals also were studied. However, reasons for the differences in the thermal properties of different coals are still unclear. In particular, the effects of coal maceral components on heat of coal devolatilisation and thermal conductivity are still unknown. The potential associations of swelling and thermal changes with the properties of tars for coals and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> are scarcely studied. The main objectives of this study are therefore to identify the sequence of physical, chemical and thermal changes of heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke. This work in particular is focused on (a) separation of coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> without using chemicals; (b) simultaneous measurements of swelling and thermal changes of heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> from a single experimental run; (c) characterising the dynamic evolution of gases and tars for difference coal maceral concentrates; (d) revealing the mechanisms in the transformation of coal to coke thereby correlating the physical, chemical and thermal changes of coal and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates.</b> To achieve the objectives, three novel techniques were employed. A water based device called the Reflux Classifier was employed to separate coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> on the basis of varying settling rates of different density particles. The existing Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique was modified to simultaneously estimate swelling and shrinkage, permeability, apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity of heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Swelling and shrinkage of the heating coal and coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> were measured by the contraction and expansion of a compressible spring. The permeability of heating coal pellet was estimated based on Darcy’s law by the measurements of swelling of coal sample bed and the pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed. The pressure drop of gas flowing through the coal sample bed was measured using a pressure sensor. Endothermic and exothermic behaviour of heating samples was evaluated based on the estimated apparent volumetric specific heat. The apparent volumetric specific heat and thermal conductivity were estimated by the measurements of the control, surface and centre temperatures of the heating sample. A new technique, Dynamic Elemental Thermal Analysis (DETA), was used to measure the evolution of total volatiles, gases and tars from different coal maceral components. The released tars of <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> during devolatilisation were condensed using a tar condenser, while the residual tars in char were extracted using solvents of acetone and toluene. The physical properties, such as boiling point, and chemical properties, such as elemental compositions, for condensable and extracted tars also were evaluated using the DETA technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} on the ash formation from the combustion of coals with <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> at various pressures was analyzed. Two coal samples of different lithotypes and maceral-enriched fractions were prepared from samples of the same bituminous coal seam. It was found that pressure and coal petrographic property influenced char and ash formation under the experimental conditions. The results suggest that the extent of coalescence of included mineral matter of inernite-rich coal sample is more significant than that of the vitrinite-rich coal sample...|$|R
40|$|The reflux {{classifier}} is a {{water based}} device designed for classifying and separating particles using inclined plates. Particles of sufficiently high settling rate are refluxed {{back to the}} slurry, while slow settling particles (low density vitrinites) are removed in the overflow. In this study, the reflux classifier was used to separate coal macerals less than 212 μm in size. The thermo-swelling characteristics of separated macerals were evaluated {{on the basis of}} the Computer Aided Thermal Analysis (CATA) technique with extended volumetric measurements. A suite of <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> with various densities, ash contents, particle sizes and vitrinite percentages was obtained, which indicated that the reflux classifier can offer an alternative method of macerals separation/concentration without the use of dense media. The pyrolysis experiments of <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> indicated that the vitrinite-rich macerals showed a higher extent of volumetric swelling, exothermic reactions and thermal conductivity between 400 and 600 °C than inertinite-rich macerals. Addition of inertinite to vitrinite concentrates showed that inertinite can suppress volumetric swelling and shift the swelling to a higher temperature during the primary devolatilization, but does not have a significant influence on high temperature contraction. Further observations about the interaction among different maceral groups were also discussed in this study...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} that allows dynamic measurement of thermal properties, expansion and the elemental chemistry of the volatile matter being evolved as coal is pyrolysed is described. The thermal and other properties are measured dynamically {{as a function}} of temperature of the coal without the need for equilibration at temperature. In particular, the technique allows for continuous elemental characterisation of tars as they are evolved during pyrolysis and afterwards {{as a function of}} boiling point. The technique is demonstrated by measuring the properties of <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> from a coal. The variation in heats of reaction, thermal conductivity and expansion as a function of maceral composition is described. Combined with the elemental analysis, the results aid in the interpretation of the chemical processes contributing to the physical and thermal behaviour of the coal during pyrolysis. Potential applications in cokemaking studies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is a coal {{conversion}} technique {{developed at}} SIUC that solubilizes coal by mild oxidation using molecular oxygen and hydrothermal water. Products are generally low-molecular-weight organic acids {{that could be}} used as chemical feedstocks. This project examined the influence of coal lithotype composition and pure <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> on the OHD process with a focus on reaction rate and products. Hand-picked lithotypes (vitrain, clarain, and fusain) from the Herrin, Springfield, and Murphysboro seams, as well as a cannel coal from the Brazil Block seam were subjected to OHD for 8, 16, 30, and 70 min. The 70 -min run was a completion run whereas other times were pulse (incomplete reaction) runs. No significant differences were found in the OHD products even though previous work suggested maceral composition could affect final products. Most samples produced primarily mono- and di-acids due to the rank of the coal (high volatile bituminous). Pulse runs allowed for petrographic examination of the residue. OHD preferentially reacted with vitrinites and liptinites over the inertinites. Collodetrinite generally developed vacuoles before collotelinite whereas collotelinite developed reaction rims by 8 -min. Liptinites developed reaction rims and loss of fluorescence. Semifusinites showed slight reaction rims at 8 min, though generally, inertinites did not display pronounced reaction rims until 30 min. Samples run under hydrolysis conditions revealed vacuoles and reaction rims could be produced with heat and pressure, but OHD conditions accelerate their production. <b>Maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> produced different OHD products. Vitrinites and inertinites produced a similar suite of products with individual macerals missing a few products. Liptinite macerals (cutinite and sporinite) produced a different suite of products containing aliphatic acids as well as some products common to the vitrinites and inertinites. The cutinite suite was primarily aliphatic containing few aromatic compounds. The sporinite contained a mix of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Vitrinites and inertinites produced a mix of mono-, di-, and tri-acids. Similarities in products between the vitrinites and inertinites are likely due to their origins from similar plant tissues (mostly woody material) that have undergone varying degrees of alteration by partial combustion, oxidation, etc. These similarities suggest that high inertinite coals could potentially produce similar OHD products to coals rich in vitrinite. The different products obtained from the macerals do suggest the potential for the OHD process to be tailored to produce specific compounds by varying the feedstock...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study on}} the behaviour of heating coal macerals has been undertaken using two novel thermal analysis techniques. The apparent specific heat was determined during heating using an inverse calorimetric method (computer aided thermal analysis, CATA) and combined with pressure and displacement measurements to correlate endothermic and exothermic behaviour with measurement of swelling. The second technique used a post-oxidation stage to combust the tars and gases into products which were analysed. This method was used to study the elemental character of volatiles release from coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> in terms of carbon and hydrogen. Extents of swelling and exothermicity during primary devolatilisation {{were found to be}} correlated with vitrinite content and were associated with tar evolution. For the highest vitrinite fraction (of 86. 4 % vitrinite) swelling was initiated at the same temperature range for exothermic reactions, and maximum swelling coincided with the peak release of light gases. Tar evolution was found to change in chemical character (as defined by H/C ratio) during progressive heating, initially rising {{in the early stages of}} tar formation (< 430 °C) to a maximum of 1. 24, then gradually decreasing to a minimum of 0. 64 at 550 °C...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{measurements}} of physical, chemical and thermal {{changes in the}} transformation of coal <b>maceral</b> <b>concentrates</b> were made during heating {{at a rate of}} 10 °C/min to 1000 °C. The endothermic and exothermic processes were identified by {{measurements of}} apparent specific heat while the fluidity was indicated by the estimated thermal conductivity. Measurements of swelling and bed permeability were made, with continuous quantitative elemental analysis of gases and tars as they evolved. Data for two coal concentrates of high and moderate vitrinite indicate that the same reactions and events are occurring for the two samples, but to a greater extent for the high vitrinite sample. The research has noted the significance of evolved tars in the early events, being the lowest temperature event identified, with rapid tar evolution prior to the onset of swelling associated with permeability change. Further tar release and gas evolution is associated with a rapid swelling event, this event being substantially greater for the high vitrinite sample. The data has also quantified contraction at higher temperatures following swelling which is associated with the release of hydrogen containing gases. Evolved tars from the high vitrinite sample showed elevated H/C ratio indicating that vitrinite tars appear to be more aliphatic than those evolved from inertinite. A comparison of measured swelling with estimated volumetric flow rate of the volatiles has indicated that thermo-expansion of coal utilised up to 21 % of the volatiles to drive bubble growth. This utilisation rate varied significantly across the plastic temperature range...|$|R

40|$|The {{mineral matter}} in typical feed coals used in South African {{gasification}} processes and the ash derived from gasifying such coals {{have been investigated}} {{using a variety of}} mineralogical, chemical and electron microscope techniques. The mineral matter in the feed coals consists mainly of kaolinite, with minor proportions of quartz, illite, dolomite, calcite and pyrite plus traces of rutile and phosphate minerals. The calcite and dolomite occur in veins within the vitrinite <b>macerals,</b> and are <b>concentrated</b> in the floats fraction after density separation. Some Ca and Ti also appear to be present as inorganic elements associated with the organic matter. Electron microscope studies show that the gasification ash is typically made up of partly altered fragments of non-coal rock, bonded together by a slag-like material containing anorthite and mullite crystals and iron oxide particles, with interstitial vesicular glass of calcic to iron-rich composition. Ash formation and characteristics thus appear to be controlled by reactions at the particle scale, allowing the different types of particles within the feed coal to interact with each other in a manner controlled mainly by the modes of mineral occurrence. Integration of such techniques provides an improved basis for evaluating ash-forming processes, based on quantitative phase identification, bulk and particle chemistry, and the geometric forms in which the different phases occur...|$|R
