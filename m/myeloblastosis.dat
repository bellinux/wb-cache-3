50|$|Myb {{proto-oncogene}} {{protein is}} a member of the MYB (<b>myeloblastosis)</b> family of transcription factors. The protein contains three domains, an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central transcriptional activation domain and a C-terminal domain involved in transcriptional repression. This protein plays an essential role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and may play a role in tumorigenesis, including the regulation of miR-155 in B-cells.|$|E

50|$|HOXA9 itself regulates a {{vast array}} of genes, such as Flt3, Erg, Myb and Lmo2, all of which exhibit the {{characteristic}} increasing expression pattern through the erythroid lineages displayed by HOXA9. Furthermore, mutations in each of these genes have been implicated in cancers. Flt3 duplication is observed in 20% of AML cases, and along with NUP98 translocation, it is associated with a poor prognosis. Erg and Myb are part of two families of transcription factors which, when mutated, correlate strongly with prostate cancer and <b>myeloblastosis</b> respectively. Lmo2 is associated with T-cell leukemias, and is also essential to erythropoiesis in early developmental stages, as Lmo2 knockout mice experience yolk sac erythropoiesis failure and the embryo dies around 10.5 days post coitus. This seems to contradict with the observed expression of Lmo2 being significantly lower in embryonic stages compared to fetal and adult stages.|$|E
50|$|Fisetin is a polyphenol, {{which is}} a {{flavonoid}} subgroup. Flavonoid synthesis begins with the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which phenylalanine, an amino acid, is transformed into 4-coumaroyl-CoA. This is the compound that enters the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Chalcone synthase, the first enzyme of this pathway, produces chalcone from 4-coumaroyl-CoA. All flavonoids are derived from this chalcone backbone (this family being the so-called chalconoids). The activity of different enzymes, including isomerases and hydroxylases, alter the backbone depending on the subclass of the flavonoid being produced. Transferases help control changes in the flavonoid’s solubility and reactivity by catalyzing the addition of things such as methyl groups and sugars. This allows for controlled fluctuations in physiological activities. Flavonoid biosynthesis gene regulation occurs through the interaction of different transcription factors. Depending on the combination of transcription factor interactions, the structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis are expressed in specific locations of the plant and at specific times. Many <b>myeloblastosis</b> (MYB) transcription factors {{have been identified in}} a variety of fruits and plants, including strawberries, maize, and arabidopsis, as being important in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis and accumulation. These transcription factors continue to be studied in plant model organisms such as maize and Arabidopsis.|$|E

Apparently, the RNA sequences which hybridize rapidly with excesses of cellular DNA are {{not restricted to}} any one region of the avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus 35 S RNA.

40|$|The cupric {{complex of}} isonicotinic acid {{hydrazide}} {{was found to}} be nontoxic to normal yolk sac macrophages upto a concentration of 100 ΜM. At this concentration the complex did not significantly inhibit DNA, RNA or protein synthesis in these cells. The complex inhibited the avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus multiplication in these cells when added 0 – 4 h post-infection as demonstrated by the inhibition of both focus formation and expression of viral specific antigens. This inhibition was not observed when the complex was added 8 and 16 h after avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus infection. The studies carried out on avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus-transformed myeloblasts indicated that the complex had no effect on the colony (focus) formation. The results suggest that the complex inhibits the virus multiplication by interfering in an early event of viral growth cycle, possibly the process of reverse transcription...|$|E
40|$|A {{protein kinase}} {{associated}} with purified virions of avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus, BAI strain A, was highly purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. On {{the basis of}} molecular sieving on Sephadex G- 200, the enzyme protein appeared to have a molecular weight of about 50, 000 to 60, 000; disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels revealed the presence {{of at least two}} polypeptide chains; and isoelectric focusing on acrylamide gels revealed two protein bands with activity. Of the nonviral proteins used as phosphate acceptors, the greatest rate of phosphorylation was obtained with alpha-casein. Potential physiological substrates for this activity included specific virion polypeptide of avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus.

40|$|The role of {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{synthesis}} with the purified DNA polymerase from the avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus has been studied.

The enzyme does not initiate the synthesis of new chains but incorporates deoxynucleotides at 3 ′ hydroxyl ends of primer strands. The product is an RNA·DNA hybrid in which the two polynucleotide components are covalently linked. Free DNA has not been detected among the products formed with the purified enzyme in vitro.

These subsets of the avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus transforming gene have been cloned in the plasmid pBR 322 and used as hybridization probes to investigate the topology of homologous (proto-amv) normal chicken DNA sequences. The results showed that the cellular proto-amv sequences in C/O chicken DNA are interrupted by at least one intervening sequence. A partial arrangement of the proto-amv sequences is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{multiplication}} of fowl-plague {{virus was}} much less sensitive to actinomycin D in chick cells infected with avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus and in hamster cells, transformed by Rous sarcoma virus than in comparable normal cultures. In addition, reproduction of fowl-plague virus was less effectively suppressed by u. v. -irradiation of cells carrying avian myelo-blastoffs or Rous sarcoma virus than of control cultures. These findings could indicate that avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> and Rous sarcoma viruses induce a function of host-cell DNA, whose products can be utilized in reproduction of fowl-plague virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) {{complex of}} the major {{glycoprotein}} of avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus exhibited an anomalously low free electrophoretic mobility {{compared with those of}} non-glycosylated protein standards. The apparent molecular weight of the glycoprotein calculated from the relation between log molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility depended on the acrylamide concentration and reached a lower limit of 80, 000. The molecular weight was also estimated from the retardation coefficients of protein standards and the viral glycoprotein. This method yielded a molecular weight of 64, 000 for the avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus glycoprotein. When gel chromatography in SDS was used to determine the apparent molecular weight of the glycoprotein from its hydrodynamic properties alone, the estimated value was 50, 000. The generally assigned value of 80, 000 daltons for the avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus major glycoprotein, as determined by SDS electrophoresis, may be an overestimate due to its relatively low free electrophoretic mobility and peculiar conformation in SDS...|$|E

The recovered virus had the same biological characteristics as the original avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus (AMV) and produced <b>myeloblastosis</b> and nephroblastomas when injected into chickens. Neutralization experiments with chicken anti-AMV-BAI strain A sera showed an antigenic community between the DNA-transfected virus and the original virus. Virus induced in fibroblasts after treatment with DNA from a viral nephroblastic nephroblastoma line only gave nephroblastoma when injected into chicken.

40|$|Seminalplasmin, an {{antibacterial}} protein {{present in}} bovine seminal plasma, {{is shown to}} be a potent inhibitor of reverse transcriptases (RNA-dependent DNA nucleotidyltransferases). Seminalplasmin inhibits RNA-directed, hybrid-directed, and DNA-directed DNA-polymerizing activities of purified reverse transcriptase from avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus and from crude viral lysates of several retroviruses by binding to the enzyme, at least in the case of avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus. Seminalplasmin does not inhibit significantly DNA synthesis either by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, or a mammalian alpha-DNA polymerase.

The DNA polymerase isolated from crude, detergent-disrupted virions by a single pass through columns of poly(rC) -agarose appears nearly homogeneous (approximately 90 % pure) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Complete recovery of input enzymatic activity was obtained. Results suggest that polyribonucleotide columns may provide a high-yield, rapid method for the purification of oncornaviral DNA polymerase...|$|E
40|$|Chick-embryo cells contain four isoaccepting {{species of}} {{methionine}} transfer RNA (I-IV). One species (I) is the initiator, tRNAfMet, {{and the others}} (II, III, and IV) are the donors of internal methionyl residues (tRNAmMet). Over 85 % of the tRNAMet in purified avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus consists of one tRNAmMet species, which resembles host-cell tRNAMet IV with respect to chromatographic properties on RPC- 5, electrophoretic mobility of the terminal methionyl-oligonucleotide, and activity in cell-free protein synthesis in response to synthetic and natural messenger RNAs. Thus, tRNAMet IV of avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus is structurally indistinguishable from the corresponding host-cell species, and, although not involved in initiation of viral protein synthesis, is able to function in peptide-chain elongation...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} double strandedness of avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus 70 S RNA has been {{determined}} from fluorescence measurements of the intercalation of ethidium bromide. We have shown that 50 % of the nucleotides of 70 S RNA in solution are in a stable helical configuration. This value does not include small helical regions that are too unstable to permit intercalation of the dye. The avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus RNA as it exists within the virion has {{the same degree of}} helicity as the free 70 S RNA. Heating the free 70 S RNA to 55 or 70 C, followed by cooling, does not measurably change the degree of helicity; the subunits therefore have as much helicity as the parent molecule...|$|E
40|$|The {{mutagenic}} potential of apurinic sites in vivo {{has been studied}} by transfection of depurinated phi X 174 DNA containing amber mutations into SOS-induced Escherichia coli spheroplasts. Mutagenicity is abolished by treatment of the depurinated DNA with an apurinic endonuclease from Hela cells, establishing the apurinic site as the mutagenic lesion. The frequency of copying apurinic sites in vitro was analyzed by measuring the extent of DNA synthesis using E. coli DNA polymerase I and avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> DNA polymerase. The inhibition of DNA synthesis by apurinic sites was less with avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> DNA polymerase, suggesting that this error-prone enzyme copies apurinic sites with greater frequency. Consistent with this conclusion is the observation that, upon transfection into (normal) spheroplasts, the reversion frequency of depurinated phi X 174 am 3 DNA copied with avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus DNA polymerase {{is much greater than}} that of the same DNA copied with E. coli DNA polymerase I. Sequence analysis of the DNA of 33 revertant phage produced by depurination indicates a preference for incorporation of deoxyadenosine opposite putative apurinic sites. The combined results indicate that mutagenesis resulting from apurinic sites is associated with bypass of these noncoding lesions during DNA synthesis...|$|E

Of the virus and nonvirus proteins tested as phosphate acceptors, only acidic proteins were phosphorylated. In particular, purified preparations of reverse transcriptase from avian <b>myeloblastosis</b> virus did not accept phosphate.
