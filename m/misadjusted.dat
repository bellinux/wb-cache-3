5000|$|Cone: Cone loading {{is more or}} less {{always used}} with sprung mechanisms. The {{combination}} of these 2 permits a less rigid fixing of the driven member, permitting more movement. The cone is also better able to handle lower frequencies compared to a table-top sized horn. Consequently these speakers have better bass response than small horn speakers. Spring force restrains the moving iron. The downside of greater movement is greater non-linearity, thus higher distortion. Paper cone loaded moving iron speakers were in use pre-war. These suffered some noticeable issues: The magnetic gap was usually manually adjustable to give good sensitivity at any given output volume. Misadjustment was thus common. The iron sometimes stuck to the magnet if overdriven or <b>misadjusted.</b> The result was a loud 'whack' followed by near silence. Loud bass notes caused end-stopping. Unlike modern speakers, which are designed to produce soft end-stopping, the iron in these hitting the pole piece made a noisy resonant chattering sound.|$|E

40|$|Pervasive {{computing}} environments typically change {{frequently in}} terms of available resources and their properties. Applications in pervasive computing use contexts to capture these changes and adapt their behaviors accordingly. However, contexts available to these applications may be abnormal or imprecise due to environmental noises. This may result in context inconsistencies, which imply that contexts conflict with each other. The inconsistencies may set such an application into a wrong state or lead the application to <b>misadjust</b> its behavior. It is thus desirable to detect and resolve the context inconsistencies in a timely way. One popular approach is to detect context inconsistencies when contexts breach certain consistency constraints. Existing constraint checking techniques recheck the entire expression of each affected consistency constraint upon context changes. When a changed context affects only a constraint’s subexpression, rechecking the entire expression can adversely delay the detection of other context inconsistencies. This article proposes a rigorous approach to identifying the parts of previous checking results that are reusable without entire rechecking.

Because it is easy to <b>misadjust</b> exercise intensity with physical condition, it is essential to know the effects of IE on cognitive process because it may have important consequences on people skills and work skills. We investigated the effects of IE on male C 57 B 1 / 6 mice, 3 -mo-old, undergoing 10 days of intense and exhaustive running program on cognition and its possible relationship with brain oxidative stress. Cognition was evaluated by three different cognitive tests: passive avoidance task, contextual fear conditioning, and tone fear conditioning, performed 24 h after the last exercise session. Brain oxidative stress was evaluated by lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. There was a remarkable memory reduction of exercised animals in comparison with the control group, associated with increase in the brain oxidative stress, with no alterations in shock sensitivity, locomotion and anxiety parameters. Concurrent vitamin C and E supplementation fully prevented the memory decrement induced by IE and partially recovered both the increased the brain lipid peroxidation and the protein oxidation. in conclusion, IE- induces a high index of brain oxidative stress and impairs memory in murine model that was prevented by vitamin C and E supplementation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if a widely used proprietary risk-adjustment system, APR-DRGs, <b>misadjusts</b> for severity of illness and misclassifies provider performance. DATA SOURCES: (1) Discharge abstracts for 116, 174 noninstitutionalized adults with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to nonfederal California hospitals in 1991 - 1993; (2) inpatient medical records for a stratified probability sample of 974 patients with AMIs admitted to 30 California hospitals between July 31, 1990 and May 31, 1991. STUDY DESIGN: Using the 1991 - 1993 data set, we evaluated the predictive performance of APR-DRGs Version 12. Using the 1990 / 1991 validation sample, we assessed the effect of assigning APR-DRGs based on different sources of ICD- 9 -CM data. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Trained, blinded coders reabstracted all ICD- 9 -CM diagnoses and procedures, and established the timing of each diagnosis. APR-DRG Risk of Mortality and Severity of Illness classes were assigned based on (1) all hospital-reported diagnoses, (2) all reabstracted diagnoses, and (3) reabstracted diagnoses present at admission. The outcome variables were 30 -day mortality in the 1991 - 1993 data set and 30 -day inpatient mortality in the 1990 / 1991 validation sample. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The APR-DRG Risk of Mortality class was a strong predictor of death (c =. 831 -. 847), but was further enhanced by adding age and sex. Reabstracting diagnoses improved the apparent performance of APR-DRGs (c =. 93 versus c =. 87), while using only the diagnoses present at admission decreased apparent performance (c =. 74). Reabstracting diagnoses had less effect on hospitals' expected mortality rates (r =. 83 -. 85) than using diagnoses present at admission instead of all reabstracted diagnoses (r =. 72 -. 77). There was fair agreement in classifying hospital performance based on these three sets of diagnostic data (K = 0. 35 - 0. 38). CONCUSIONS: The APR-DRG Risk of Mortality system is a powerful risk-adjustment tool, largely because it includes all relevant diagnoses, regardless of timing. Although some late diagnoses may not be preventable, APR-DRGs appear suitable only if one assumes that none is preventable...|$|R
30|$|An {{acoustic}} echo cancellation structure {{with a single}} loudspeaker and multiple microphones is, from a system identification perspective, generally modelled as a single-input multiple-output system. Such a system thus implies specific echo-path models (adaptive filter) for every loudspeaker to microphone path. Due to the often large dimensionality of the filters, which is required to model rooms with standard reverberation time, the adaptation process can be computationally demanding. This paper presents a selective updating normalized least mean square (NLMS)-based method which reduces complexity to nearly half in practical situations, while showing superior convergence speed performance as compared to conventional complexity reduction schemes. Moreover, the method concentrates the filter adaptation to the filter which is most <b>misadjusted,</b> which is a typically desired feature.|$|E

These concepts and knowledge were applied to the district of Angra do Heroísmo in Terceira´s island of the Azores in order to elaborate a map where the areas showing susceptibility to mass movements were identified. This identification and mapping of mass movements is a contribution to the planning and management of the municipality territory, where the natural conditions are favorable to the geomorphic instability. The <b>misadjusted</b> human actions in this vulnerable region can improve the landscape instability. There are several causes for the mass movements starting. Usually, the beginning of a mass movement is attributed to a single factor, as for instance an unusual precipitation, however this does not correspond to the reality, as a complex number of factors are involved. It was given highlight in this study to the human action as a trigger factor, that in a perspective of sustainable management and development, allow to understand how devastation and significant can be his action. In a perspective of identifying the impact of human actions in the mass movements, {{as well as the}} characterization of the geomorphic susceptibility of the area in study, the maximum infiltration areas were delimitated. The maximum infiltration areas {{are one of the most}} important territory management figures to preserve, and several times have <b>misadjusted</b> human occupation. In order to delimitate these areas, as well as to elaborate the mass movements susceptibility map for the district of Angra do Heroísmo, several physical characteristics of the region were analysed: geology/lithology, volcanic activity and seismicity, geomorphology, soils, etc. The Permeability of the geologic formations and the soils was also evaluated. Intervention actions for the area were recommended to implement in the most instable areas, in order to promote its protection, conservation or recuperation.

This system is {{also referred to as}} multiuser filtered multitone (FMT) [1, 2]. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) differs from multiuser FMT since it deploys rectangular time-domain pulses that exhibit a sinc frequency response [3]. The multiuser FMT transmitter can be efficiently implemented using an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) followed by low-rate subchannel filtering [1, 4, 5]. The subchannel frequency confinement makes multiuser FMT more robust than OFDMA in an asynchronous uplink channel, where the signals of distinct users experience independent time offsets from propagation delays, carrier frequency offsets from <b>misadjusted</b> oscillators, or Doppler effects from movement, and propagation through multipath fading channels [6 – 8].|$|E

40|$|Wavelength-conversion is an {{essential}} block in building all-optical networks. Currently, all-optical wavelength-conversion can quite efficiently be performed by means of SOA. In this approach however, a significant shortcoming is the high sensitivity of error-performance to the relative polarization of optical-signals, which imposes rigid tuning requirements. To make conversion insensitive to random fluctuations of polarization, we employ a standard outband-FEC method, in combination with a novel inband-FEC method. The latter, called ""FOCUS"", is best suited for combating burst-form errors. This particular property of ""FOCUS"" matches the error-distribution generated by the associated outband-FEC code, when the two are combined in serial-concatenation. We demonstrate the corrective-power of this FEC-concatenation scheme in protecting a 10 Gb/s lightwave-channel, which undergoes wavelength-conversion {{by means of an}} all-optical, SOA-based Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switch.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{emissions}} from motor vehicles are the major cause of smog in the South Coast Air Basin. In an attempt to reduce the smog a strategy has been adopted by the State of California based on the idea of reducing emissions from each vehicle per mile driven rather than restricting the number of vehicles or the amount any vehicle is operated. The principal elements of this strategy are three. The one is a set of emission standards for new vehicles which becomes more severe with each model year until 1975 when the federal emissions standards become effective. The second is a program whereby existing vehicles are retrofitted with one or more emission control devices whenever the Air Resources Board determines that appropriate devices are both effective and available. The third is a system of tax exemptions designed to encourage the conversion of existing vehicles to burn gaseous fuels. This paper discusses periodic motor vehicle inspection and maintenance as a fourth element which could be incorporated into the strategy to complement the existing measures. There is abundant experimental evidence to show that each of the three measures in the present strategy is capable of materially reducing emissions. Unfortunately there is a growing body of data that shows that the measures are often not as effective as they might be. Usually the reason that a measure is ineffective on a particular vehicle is that the vehicle is malfunctioning or <b>misadjusted.</b> It is a truism that any vehicle will emit more if it is malfunctioning or <b>misadjusted</b> than if it is operating properly. Depending {{on the nature of the}} malfunction or misadjustment the excess in emissions may be anywhere from a few percent to several hundred percent. For the very low emission vehicles to be produced in the latter half of this decade it is expected that certain not too uncommon kinds of malfunction would increase their emissions by several thousand percent. The periodic inspection and mandatory maintenance discussed below is intended to return improperly operating vehicles to proper operation and thus cause each vehicle to achieve its normal level of emissions rather than some higher level...|$|E

Inputs to the {{fuzzy logic system}} are measurement deviations of blade bending and torsion response and vibration from a "good" undamaged helicopter rotor. The rotor system measurements used are flap and lag bending tip deflections, elastic twist deflection at the tip, and three forces and three moments at the rotor hub. The fuzzy logic system uses rules developed from an aeroelastic model of the helicopter rotor with implanted faults to isolate the fault while accounting for uncertainty in the measurements. The faults modeled include moisture absorption, loss of trim mass, damaged lag damper, damaged pitch control system, <b>misadjusted</b> pitch link, and damaged flap. Tests with simulated data show that the fuzzy system isolates rotor system faults with an accuracy of about 90 - 100 %.

Results showed that the parental risk acceptability predict the children risk acceptability but not children risk behavior. Again, we found that when children perceive low maternal warmth and high antagonism, the link between parental and adolescents risk acceptability increase in size. On the contrary, paternal high warmth and low antagonism influences the relationship between two beliefs.

40|$|Nesta pesquisa procuramos reconstituir criticamente o papel da educação na trajetória intelectual de Arthur Ramos. Este autor realizou um intenso trabalho de pesquisa e ações práticas desenvolvidas ao longo de sua experiência profissional e acadêmica. Ramos elaborou uma teoria de base psicanalítica e humanista que resultou em um importante conjunto de conceitos, propostas e intervenção social que extrapolou os limites da escola para atingir a família e a comunidade como um todo, ampliando desta forma o próprio conceito de educação. O mencionado intelectual foi colaborador de Anísio Teixeira na reforma do ensino público junto ao Departamento de Educação do Distrito Federal durante a administração do prefeito Pedro Ernesto Batista na década de 1930. Como parte da reforma de Anísio Teixeira foi instalado o Serviço de Ortofrenia e Higiene Mental chefiado por Ramos. O objetivo do serviço era receber as crianças encaminhadas pelas escolas públicas e consideradas como incapazes de aprender e que apresentavam um comportamento desajustado. Entre os objetivos da presente pesquisa podemos destacar: apresentar Arthur Ramos como um intelectual de seu tempo, envolvido com as polêmicas de sua época no {{interior}} do campo e pensando em formas de superação dos dilemas educacionais e sociais da nação sob o prisma do humanismo e da democracia; analisar suas propostas pedagógicas e de intervenção na escola por meio da higiene mental; referenciar o conceito de criança problema e analisar sua obra de divulgação científica Saúde do espírito de 1939. Como refenciais teórico-metodológicos foram utilizados os conceitos de patrimonialismo, de modernização autoritária, de campo intelectual e habitus. A pesquisa desenvolvida procura utilizar-se da análise da produção intelectual e da prática política de mencionado intelectual a partir de várias fontes documentais como obras publicadas, ensaios, artigos científicos em periódicos e manuais de divulgação. Tudo indica que as propostas de Arthur Ramos estavam além das possibilidades históricas das décadas de 1930 e 1940. O trabalho do médico alagoano de inegável pioneirismo no campo da psicanálise e da antropologia aplicadas à educação, não foi suficiente para impedir que suas realizações fossem condenadas ao ostracismo intelectual a que estiveram entregues durante muitas décadas. O resgate do pensamento e da prática de Ramos é uma forma de retomar a memória intelectual daquele período histórico especialmente do campo do conhecimento da história da educação.

As part of the reform of Anísio Teixeira the Service of Ortofrenia and Mental Hygiene commanded by Ramos was installed. The objective to receive the children who were considered as incapable to learn and who presented a <b>misadjusted</b> behavior directed from the public school. It enters the objectives of the present research we can detach: to present Arthur Ramos as an intellectual of its time, involved with the controversies of its time in the interior of the field and thinking about forms of overcoming of the educational and social quandaries of the nation under the prism of the humanism and the democracy; to analyze its pedagogical proposals and of intervention in the school by means of the mental hygiene; to referential the child concept problem and to analyze its workmanship of scientific spreading Spirit Health of the 1939.
