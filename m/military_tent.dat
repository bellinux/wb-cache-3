500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{explained that}} Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, [...] "keeps his pain {{just below the}} threshold so he can function." [...] In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look [...] "like an amalgam {{of all sorts of}} bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old <b>military</b> <b>tent.</b> His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform." [...] Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look [...] "animalistic". Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.|$|E
2500|$|The Hungarian historians like József Bánlaky, in the 21th {{volume of}} his monumental Military History of the Hungarian Nation (A magyar nemzet hadtörténete), {{although}} he did not make a direct affirmation about the outcome of the battle, by quoting Görgei's report to the Hungarian government about the battle, in which the Hungarian commander names this engagement a victory, without commenting on this, tacitly he accepts Görgei's opinion. In his book about Görgei's military career, László Pusztaszeri speaks about the [...] "failure to achieve a decisive victory", showing that he rather considers this battle as a victory but not a decisive one. Tamás Tarján {{in an article in the}} Hungarian historical magazine, called Rubicon, also consider this battle as a Hungarian victory. Róbert Hermann's opinion is that, although the Hungarian army achieved its plan to relieve the very important fortress, accomplishing its tactical purpose, the Battle of Komárom fought at 26 April 1849 can be accepted rather an undecided battle, because before the battle, the imperial plan was to abandon the siege and to retreat towards Pozsony and Vienna, so the Hungarians did not imposed their will on the enemy, but just forced them to retreat with a few days earlier than they planned. The Hungarian plan to surround and destroy the imperial troops failed because of the arrival and attack of the III. imperial corps led by Franz Schlik. But the loss of much of the siege artillery, and the loss of a whole grenadier division, a huge amount of food, ammunition, 7 heavy siege cannons and mortars, the whole <b>military</b> <b>tent</b> camp, all captured by the Hungarians, was a hard blow for the imperial commanders.|$|E

Four pairs of standard eight-person tents were erected, with a single tent in each pair treated with 0. 1 % Bistar 80 SC as a course spray, and the remainder left as untreated control tents. Carbon dioxide-baited traps were operated in each tent nightly, and biting collections conducted over 8 nights. There was a mean increase in protection of 81 % for mosquitoes entering treated tents and 90. 4 % increase in protection against biting of predominantly Culex annulirostris Skuse.

5000|$|In the military, {{the term}} [...] "tent city" [...] usually refers to {{temporary}} living quarters erected on deployed military bases, {{such as those}} found in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Iraq. Depending on the branch of service {{and the length of}} time the tent city has been in place, the living space may be equipped with most modern amenities. For sanitary reasons, <b>military</b> <b>tent</b> cities place toilet, shower, and laundry facilities at least 50 ft from living quarters. Also, tents are typically divided into clusters of 8-10 to prevent the rapid spread of fire, which is of utmost concern because of the tent and bedding materials.|$|E

2500|$|While {{most large}} summer camps use cabins to house campers, Camp Fitch has long {{held on to}} the {{tradition}} of housing campers in tents; however, by 1986, the cost of repairing canvas and the inconveniences of conventional <b>military</b> <b>tents</b> brought on the need for alternative accommodations. [...] Thus, the cabent (a tent/cabin hybrid) was born. [...] A cabent has a permanent wooden roof with 8" [...] x 8" [...] corner pillars and canvas sides erected over a cement platform. [...] In the early 2000s, most cabents in the camp were upgraded with built-in bunk beds eliminating the need for work crews to move and store bunks in the off seasons.|$|R
