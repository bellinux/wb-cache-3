40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{effectiveness}} of ultrasonication on vaccine delivery, juvenile sea bream, Pagrus major, were treated with eight different ultrasonic methods. A <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> against Vibrio alginolyticus and V. anguillarum was used to immunize the fish.

The ultrasonic methods included continuous or pulsed ultrasound for 3 min, and continuous or pulsed ultrasound for 3 min before and/or after immersion for 3 min. Of all the eight ultrasonic methods tested, 'pulsed ultrasound followed by immersion' and 'immersion, pulsed ultrasound, and followed by immersion again' provided the best protection, which were comparable with protection of fish immunized by intraperitoneal injection. Moreover, the convenience of applying these two ultrasonic methods for immunization was comparable with the immersion method and was much better than intraperitoneal injection. If 2 x 10 (8) CFU mL(- 1) of this <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> was used for vaccination repeatedly five times by ultrasonic methods, it could still produce good protection for the immunized sea bream.

By using chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 and modified vaccinia virus Ankara viral vectored vaccines, we investigated whether incorporating two antigens into one vaccine would result in higher transmission-reducing activity than one antigen. We demonstrated that when Pfs 25 was administered with other antigens Pfs 28 or Pfs 230 C, either concurrently as a <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> or co-expressed as a dual-antigen vaccine, the antibody response in mice to each antigen was comparable to a monoantigen vaccine, without immunological interference.

Dual-antigen vaccines generally only elicited similar transmission-reducing activity to monoantigen vaccines and in one instance had lower transmission-reducing activity.

40|$|Vaccines {{often have}} {{heterogeneous}} actions because of possible {{variation in the}} immune systems of hosts. One must consider such heterogeneity of vaccine action when developing a vaccine efficacy parameter. Addressing this issue the summary model of vaccine action has been proposed in the literature to estimate vaccine efficacy in a randomly mixing population. However, nonrandom mixing is common, particularly in a small-group-mixing population. This article extends the summary model of vaccine action to such a nonrandomly mixing population. The interpretation and estimation of the summary vaccine efficacy were discussed in light of other two models of vaccine action: the leaky and all-or-nothing model. Vaccine efficacy under all models {{is defined as the}} relative reduction in transmission probability due to vaccine. Estimation of the transmission probabilities is described based on a deterministic epidemic model of an acute transmitted disease. This article further discusses, based on the above vaccine models, the estimation of vaccination coverage required to control epidemic. Methods are illustrated using data simulated by considering different patterns of <b>mixing</b> and <b>vaccine</b> action.

40|$|Safe {{vaccines}} should optimally induce both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Recently, it {{has been}} shown that protective cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) can be induced not only with live vaccines, but also with recombinant viral proteins. This report shows in C 57 BL/ 6 (H- 2 b) mice that the recombinant nucleoprotein (N) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induced protective CTLs but no neutralizing antibodies in mice, whereas the recombinant glycoprotein (G) of VSV alone induced neutralizing antibodies but no CTLs. If the N and G of VSV were coinjected, both CTLs and a long-lasting neutralizing IgG response was measurable, demonstrating that <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccines</b> can be used to induce protective CTLs and antibodies with an efficiency comparable to live virus. In an attempt to define optimal conditions for CTL priming, the intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous route of injection were compared. Intravenous injection of recombinant VSV-N induced up to 30 times higher responses than the latter two routes. Finally, we tried to define conditions inducing only CTLs and no antibodies binding to the native protein form, or vice versa, only antibodies and no CTLs. Intravenous injection of boiled VSV-N induced a CTL response but no antibodies specific for the native VSV-N, whereas VSV-N injected subcutaneously in incomplete Freund's adjuvant induced high amounts of anti-VSV-N antibodies but virtually no CTLs.

Recent H 5 disease has {{been caused by}} antigenically divergent H 5 viruses, including A/Indonesia/ 05 / 2005 (a clade 2 H 5 virus). Methods. The influence of schedule on the antibody response to 2 doses of H 5 vaccines (one a clade 1 hemagglutinin protein [HA] vaccine and one a clade 2 HA vaccine) containing 90 lg of antigen was evaluated in healthy adults 18 – 49 years of age. Results. Two doses of vaccine were required to induce antibody titers> 1 : 10 in most subjects. Accelerated schedules were immunogenic, and antibody developed after vaccinations on days 0 and 7, 0 and 14, and 0 and 28, with the day 0 and 7 schedule inducing lower titers than those induced with the other schedules. With <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> schedules of clade 1 followed by clade 2 vaccine administration, the first vaccination primed for a heterologous boost.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{investigate}} the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of three doses of a pentavalent vaccine produced by extemporaneous mixing of diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B virus (DTPw-HBV) and a lyophilized Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) -tetanus conjugate vaccine in one syringe {{in comparison with}} separate, concomitant administration of the same vaccine components in healthy infants at 1. 5, 3, and 5 months of age, following a dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Methods: An open, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken with 269 children allocated to two groups to receive three doses of Hib and DTPw-HBV vaccines as either a syringe mix or as separate injections in opposite arms. Symptoms were solicited on 4 -day diary cards to assess reactogenicity and immunogenicity based on serum samples drawn immediately before the first dose and 1 month after the third dose. Results: There were fewer local and more general symptoms in the <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> group, but {{no statistically significant difference}} in reactogenicity between the two groups. There were no withdrawals due to adverse experiences. Seropositivity rates were similar for all antigens in the two groups, with no clinically relevant differences in titers.

40|$|Background: Rotavirus {{disease is}} the leading global cause of severe {{diarrhea}} in children under 5 years. We examined the association between different rotavirus vaccines doses and severity of diarrhea. Methods: A secondary analysis of surveillance of children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) symptoms during two seasons (January-June) in 2010 and 2011 from three pediatric hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia was conducted. Enrolled children were tested for rotavirus, using EIA (Rotaclone) and vaccination records were collected from the state immunization registry and healthcare providers. Cases were defined as any enrolled child who tested positive for rotavirus. Each enrolled child was assigned a Vesikari score to assess AGE severity. Results: 63. 9 % of participants had severe AGE. Cases {{were more likely to}} have severe AGE than controls (OR 3. 8, 95 % CI: 2. 2 - 6. 5). Receiving a <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> regimen had similar protection against severe disease to receiving only RotaTeq® or Rotarix® (Mixed: OR 0. 1, 95 % CI: 0. 02 - 0. 5; RotaTeq®: OR 0. 1, 95 % CI: 0. 02 - 0. 5; Rotarix®: OR 0. 1; 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 3). When controlling for vaccine type and demographic covariates, three doses of vaccine offered significant protection against severe disease (OR 0. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 2 - 0. 6). Conclusions: Receiving a mixed regimen of rotavirus vaccine is effective in preventing severe AGE.

BRSV-specific antibody responses were measured prior to vaccination and on day 35 by using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), virus neutralization assay (VN), a fusion inhibition assay (FI); and responses were also measured {{for their ability to}} facilitate antibody dependent, complement mediated cytotoxicity (ADCMC) of BRSV infected cells. Sera from day 35 were, in addition, analyzed by use of an IgG 1, IgG 2 isotype specific ELISA. All vaccines induced significant increases in BRSV specific IgG antibody as measured by ELISA, but only one inactivated and the MLV vaccine induced significant increases in VN titers. Fusion inhibiting antibody titers were low or undetected in calves vaccinated with the inactivated vaccines. Vaccination with modified live virus induced significantly higher titers of fusion inhibiting antibodies, which are considered to be most highly correlated with protection. The VN to ELISA and FI to ELISA ratio of the calves that received MLV vaccine were significantly greater than the calves receiving the 3 inactivated vaccines. Vaccination with MLV induced the highest IgG 2 /IgG 1 ratio. This difference was small, and only significant relative to 2 of the inactivated vaccine groups, which were not significantly different from each other. The higher proportion of IgG 2 isotype in the MLV sera was not associated with lower ADCMC, a function not attributed to this isotype. The VN and FI titers, but not the ELISA value of the sera, were most predictive of ADCMC. The inactivation processes apparently alter epitopes and affect the induction of functional antibodies...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} side effects and immune {{responses}} after three serial doses of PRP-T vaccine (a Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib]-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine) given concurrently or mixed with adsorbed DPT vaccine (diphtheria toxoid-pertussis vaccine-tetanus toxoid). DESIGN: Multicentre randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Four public health units in western Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy infants 8 to 15 weeks old at entry {{who were able to}} receive routine primary vaccinations. Of 444 infants enrolled, 433 (98 %) completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: All infants received PRP-T and DPT vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 months of age: half received them mixed in one injection and the others as separate, bilateral injections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Side-effects 24 and 48 hours after each dose and serologic responses to each vaccine component. RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained after all 1312 vaccinations. Fever was infrequent in the two treatment groups. Local adverse effects of the PRP-T vaccine were infrequent and mild (e. g., redness was noted in 5. 9 % of cases and the area of redness was more than 2. 5 cm in diameter in 0. 8 %). The incidence rate of local effects of the DPT-containing vaccines was the same in the two groups except for tenderness, which was more frequent in the group given the <b>mixed</b> <b>vaccine</b> (26. 6 % v. 17. 9 %, p < 0. 001). Serologic data were available for 97 % of the subjects. After the three doses 98. 1 % of the subjects had a PRP antibody level of 0. 15 micrograms/mL or more, and 87. 9 % had a level of 1. 0 micrograms/mL or more, both levels compatible with protection against Hib. Responses to PRP-T were comparable between the treatment groups as were responses to the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Pertussis agglutinin titres were reduced after administration of one of two PRP-T lots mixed with DPT vaccine, but responses to four other pertussis antigens were not impaired. CONCLUSION: PRP-T vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic. Combined PRP-T and DPT vaccines performed satisfactorily and may be the preferred method of administration...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIn 2001 when 7 -valent pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccine (PCV 7) was introduced, {{almost all}} (90 %) young Australian Indigenous children living in remote communities had some form of otitis media (OM), including 24 % with tympanic membrane perforation (TMP). In late 2009, the Northern Territory childhood vaccination schedule replaced PCV 7 with 10 -valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV 10). MethodsWe conducted regular surveillance {{of all forms of}} OM in children in remote Indigenous communities between September 2008 and December 2012. This analysis compares children less than 36 months of age who received a primary course of at least two doses of PCV 7 or PHiD-CV 10, and not more than one dose of another pneumococcal vaccine. ResultsMean ages of 444 PCV 7 - and 451 PHiD-CV 10 -vaccinated children were 20 and 18 months, respectively. Bilaterally normal middle ears were detected in 7 % and 9 % respectively. OM with effusion was diagnosed in 41 % and 51 % (Risk Difference 10 % [95 % Confidence Interval 3 to 17] p =  0. 002), any suppurative OM (acute OM or any TMP) in 51 % versus 39 % (RD − 12 % [95 % CI − 19 to − 5] p =  0. 0004], and TMP in 17 % versus 14 % (RD − 3 % [95 % CI − 8 to 2] p =  0. 2), respectively. Multivariate analyses described a similar independent negative association between suppurative OM and PHiD-CV 10 compared to PCV 7 (Odds Ratio =  0. 6 [95 % CI 0. 4 to 0. 8] p =  0. 001). Additional children in the household were a risk factor for OM (OR =  2. 4 [95 % CI 2 to 4] p =  0. 001 for the third additional child), and older age and male gender were associated with less disease. Other measured risk factors were non-significant. Similar clinical results were found for children who had received non-mixed PCV schedules. ConclusionsOtitis media remains a significant health and social issue for Australian Indigenous children despite PCV vaccination. Around 90 % of young children have some form of OM. Children vaccinated in with PHiD-CV 10 had less suppurative OM than children vaccinated with PCV 7.

The aim of this review is to present a comprehensive examination of the safety and tolerability of ISA 51 containing vaccines. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and clinicaltrials. gov. Eligible studies were categorized into: (A) uncontrolled studies with non-healthy subjects, (B) controlled studies with non-healthy subjects, and (C) controlled studies with healthy subjects. Reported adverse events (AEs) were assessed. 91 studies were included in our review. Generally observed AEs included injection site reaction; injection site pain; myalgia; headache; gastro-intestinal disorders; fatigue and fever - regardless of the administration route and subject characteristic. Specific AEs, e. g. injection site reactions and rash, were more frequently reported from subjects receiving ISA 51 -adjuvanted vaccines than from subjects receiving antigen or ISA 51 only. The reported AEs were mainly mild to moderate in intensity. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 27 % of the uncontrolled trials and 2 trials conducted with healthy subjects.

Glypican- 3 (GPC 3) is overexpressed {{in human}} {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) but not expressed in normal tissues except for placenta and fetal liver and therefore {{is an ideal}} target for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we identified an H 2 -Kb or H 2 -Db restricted and murine GPC 3 (mGPC 3) -derived cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptide in C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice, {{which can be used}} in the design of preclinical studies of various therapies with GPC 3 -target immunotherapy in vivo. First, 11 types of 9 - to 10 -mer peptides predicted to bind with H 2 -Kb or H 2 -Db were selected from the mGPC 3 amino acid sequence based on the binding score as calculated by the BIMAS software. We evaluated the peptide-binding affinity and confirmed that all peptides were able to bind to H 2 -Kb or H 2 -Db by in vitro cellular binding assay. Subsequently, a <b>mixed</b> peptide <b>vaccine</b> and single peptide vaccine were given to B 6 mice to evaluate immunogenic poten-tial of the 11 selected peptides.

There {{are a lot of}} situations in veterinary medicine where it is usefull to potencialize the immune response of individuals, mainly when is desired to increase the resistance to infections and the treatment of immunossupressing or multifactorials infectious diseases. In veterinary medicine some of more used immunomodulators are interferons and interferon inducers, interleukines, Baccilus of Calmett-Guérin (BCG) and its derivated, Propionibacterium acnes (Corynebacterium parvum), <b>mixed</b> bacterial <b>vaccine,</b> PIND-ORF, Phosprenyl, Quillja Saponis, Bordetella pertussis, avridine and the levamizole. The present work review the available scientific literature, regarding the use of different immunomodulators in the prophylaxis and in the therapeutics of infectious diseases in domestic animals. Imunomoduladores são substâncias que atuam no sistema imunológico conferindo aumento da resposta orgânica contra determinados microorganismos, incluindo vírus, bactérias e protozoários, mediante à produção de interferon e seus indutores. Existem muitas situações na medicina veterinária em que se torna desejável potencializar a resposta imune, principalmente quando se pretende aumentar a resistência às infecções e no tratamento de enfermidades imunossupressoras ou de doenças infecciosas multifatorias, ou seja, nas quais vários agentes estão envolvidos e devido a isso, dificilmente obtêm-se sucesso no emprego de tratamentos convencionais.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of effective regimens for a vaccine against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) is urgently needed. In the present study we have produced HIV- 1 gp 120 from a vaccine-relevant primary R 5 isolate in recombinant vaccinia (rVV) -infected Vero cells. We have investigated the effect of boosting with this protein in mixed modality immunisations of rhesus macaques following different immunisation. As reported earlier, animals were primed with codon-optimised HIV- 1 (BX 08) env DNA delivered as plasmid or as replication-deficient recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (rAd 5), which both induced specific antibody and cellular immune responses (1). Boosting with rAd 5 temporarily had increased the anti-gp 120 antibody titres approximately 1 log (rAd 5 +rAd 5) or 3 log (DNA+rAd 5) (1). However, secondary rAd 5 boosting showed less effect due to the induced vector-specific immunity. To further boost the antibody response, the rgp 120 (BX 08) was injected with Quadri A saponin adjuvant. The protein boosting resulted in a 1 - 2 log antibody increase and also boosting of the cell-mediated immune response. Neutralising antibodies to the heterologous HIV- 1 (MN) were detected; however, neutralising antibodies to the primary HIV- 1 (Bx 08) isolate were seen only transiently after rAd 5 but not the rgp 120 immunisation. It is concluded that the rgp 120 (Bx 08) reagent from rVV-infected Vero cells is functional and immunogenic in macaques, inducing both antibody and cellular immunity. The rgp 120 (Bx 08) is a relevant model antigen {{that may be used}} to boost antibody and cellular immunity in <b>mixed</b> modality <b>vaccine</b> regimens against HIV- 1 in higher animals...|$|R

Protocols from the Laboratory were also {{employed}} for the test. Briefly, the gum polymer <b>vaccine</b> <b>mix</b> was dissolved in 8  ml of normal saline; 50  μl of normal saline was dispensed into each microtitre well while 50  μl of the antigenic solution (gum-vaccine mix) was added into the first well in each row. With the micropipette, {{the content of the}} first row was mixed and 50  μl transferred into the second row of well. The procedure was repeated serially for all rows of well with the last 50  μl dispensed off. 50  μl of 0.5  % chicken red blood cell was then added to each well, mixed briefly together on a micro-shaker (Flow Laboratories, GmbH Diezstrabe 10, 5300, Bonn 3) and left on the bench for 30  min. The last dilution which shows Haemagglutination was taken as the titer of the antigen.|$|R
40|$|In {{some parts}} of Africa, 50 % of deaths {{attributed}} to malaria occur in infants less than 8 mo. Thus, immunization against malaria may have to begin in the neonatal period, when neonates have maternally acquired Abs against malaria parasite proteins. Many malaria vaccines in development rely upon CD 8 cells as immune effectors. Some studies indicate that neonates do not mount optimal CD 8 cell responses. We report that BALB/c mice first immunized as neonates (7 days) with a Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein (PyCSP) DNA <b>vaccine</b> <b>mixed</b> with a plasmid expressing murine GM-CSF (DG) and boosted at 28 days with poxvirus expressing PyCSP were protected (93 %) as well as mice immunized entirely as adults (70 %). Protection was dependent on CD 8 cells, and mice had excellent anti-PyCSP IFN-gamma and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. Mice born of mothers previously exposed to P. yoelii parasites or immunized with the vaccine were protected and had excellent T cell responses. These data support assessment of this immunization strategy in neonates/young infants in areas in which malaria exacts its greatest toll...|$|R
40|$|Current split {{influenza}} virus vaccines that induce strain-specific neutralising antibodies provide {{some degree of}} protection against influenza infection {{but there is a}} clear need to improve their effectiveness. The constant antigenic drift of {{influenza virus}}es means that vaccines are often not an exact match to the circulating strain and so levels of relevant antibodies may not be sufficiently high to afford protection. In the situation where the emergent influenza virus is completely novel, {{as is the case with}} pandemic strains, existing vaccines may provide no benefit. In this study we tested the concept of a combination vaccine consisting of sub-optimal doses of split influenza virus <b>vaccine</b> <b>mixed</b> with a cross-protective T-cell inducing lipopeptide containing the TLR 2 ligand Pam 2 Cys. Mice immunised with combination vaccines showed superior levels of lung viral clearance after challenge compared to either split virus or lipopeptide alone, mediated through activation of enhanced humoral and/or additional cellular responses. The mechanism of action of these vaccines was dependent on the route of administration, with intranasa...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of alpha-casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), myoglobin and recombinant protective antigen (rPA) in mono-valent and combination vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was studied by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Green and red fluorescent probes were conjugated to the antigens. Adsorption isotherms of the fluorescently labeled proteins to aluminum hydroxide adjuvant demonstrated that {{incorporation of the}} fluorescent probe did not significantly affect the adsorption. In mono-valent vaccine systems, antigen adsorption occurred within one minute and uniform surface coverage of the adjuvant aggregates was observed within 1 h. Content uniformity was achieved through a cycle of de-aggregation and re-aggregation of the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant aggregates caused by <b>mixing.</b> For combination <b>vaccines,</b> two antigens were adsorbed separately to the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant prior to combination. Following combination, cycles of de-aggregation and re-aggregation occurred due to mixing, which led to uniform {{distribution of}} both antigens.
