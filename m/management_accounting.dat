40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{integrative}} definition of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> (KAM) at the organizational level through a content analysis of the existing definitions of KAM available in the business literatures. A representative pool of definitions of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> was generated through literature review from twenty three journals that covers the divergence of name variety like global <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> strategic <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> national <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> international key <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> key client <b>management,</b> major <b>account</b> <b>management,</b> key customers <b>management</b> and key <b>account</b> <b>management.</b> Relating to the definition of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> various attributes are identified through content analysis and according to the relevance, profile for each attributes are developed. On the basis of these attributes a diagrammatic and textual definition is proposed that covers the different standpoints and aspects of key <b>account</b> <b>management</b> approach and captures its essence as well.

25|$|The {{development}} of joint-stock companies (especially from about 1600) built wider audiences for accounting information, as investors without firsthand {{knowledge of their}} operations relied on accounts to provide the requisite information. This development resulted in a split of accounting systems for internal (i.e. <b>management</b> <b>accounting)</b> and external (i.e. financial accounting) purposes, and subsequently also in accounting and disclosure regulations and a growing need for independent attestation of external accounts by auditors.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over <b>management</b> <b>accounting</b> remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E

2500|$|While {{institutions}} internationally do {{not directly}} {{have the same}} genealogy {{with the idea of}} shared, collegial governance, universities worldwide are loosely organized by similar structures and based on comparable models. [...] McMaster notes the different cultures in universities and the traditional relationships between faculty and administration, characterizing historical transitions and suggesting that universities today are undergoing transitions in culture. [...] Kezar and Eckel point out the substance of governance has changed during the last decades with more emphasis put on high stake issues and more incremental decisions made in a less collegial mode – the reasons for this stem from trends that have devalued the notion of participation and also from the external pressures for more accountability and demands for quicker decision-making (that sometimes is achieved through bureaucracy). [...] McMaster discusses the same changes in university management resulting from the “huge amount of additional administrative work at all levels within the university, and the requirement {{for a wide range of}} specialist skills in areas such as marketing, HR management, <b>management</b> <b>accounting,</b> web development and instructional design” and the difficulties with the tensions that have resulted between collegial and corporate models of management.|$|E
