Amplifiers, record players, tape players, and tuners were fairly faithful to the original sound, but speakers of the time were unable to reproduce the bass notes of records or tapes without distortion. He {{came up with the}} idea for a new form of audio loudspeaker, one that would greatly reduce distortion by replacing the nonlinear mechanical spring with a linear air cushion. This [...] "acoustic suspension" [...] design demonstrated a greater undistorted SPL (sound pressure level) at 25 Hz than any previous loudspeaker type, including bass reflex, infinite baffle, or large horn designs. (Villchur's new and sophisticated understanding of the inexorable relationship among low-frequency extension, efficiency, and cabinet volume was later termed, by Henry Kloss, [...] "Hofmann's Iron Law".) He built a prototype of his new speaker out of a plywood box. The dimensions of the face of the box were taken from a picture frame that Villchur had hanging in his house. His wife, Rosemary, who had been a draftswoman during the war, sewed the pattern for the flexible surround out of <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking.</b> Unable to afford the full services of a patent attorney, he found a patent lawyer who was willing to explain the patent process briefly, and Villchur applied for a patent himself. In 1956, he received [...] for the acoustic-suspension loudspeaker. He tried to sell the idea to several loudspeaker manufacturers, but his idea was rejected as impossible.|$|E

30|$|The direct {{contribution}} of the ticking to the fire threat {{is considered to be}} low because the heat release potential of the ticking is small compared to the mattress. In residential <b>mattresses,</b> <b>ticking</b> is considered as a sacrificial layer, which means it burns quickly and release very little heat. The rapid burning of ticking prevents the flames from staying in any one area sufficiently long to ignite the underlying components of the mattress. The sacrificial concept of ticking implies use of very low weight fabric tickings. However, modern residential mattresses include a variety of material layers into a quilted assembly which forms a top cover. Such composite ticking materials, in addition to arrangement of underlying fire blocking layers, have the potential to alter heat release properties of mattresses. Full-scale open flame testing of residential mattresses with composite tickings have shown that a change in the ticking alone has significantly increased the heat release rate of mattresses by more than 200 % in some cases ([2007 c]).|$|R

Striped cloths {{appear as}} painting supports from the 16 th to the 20 th century {{in and outside}} Europe. These are mostly flax matress ticking, woven into varieties of twill (diagonal weave) and especially reverse twill (herringbone). Only few historical mattresses have been preserved, e. g. those in royal palace interiors {{such as the one}} in Hampton Court in London. Dark blue striped pattern appeared on mattresses as early as the Antiquity, and the terminology for the twill fabrics used (also) for mattress making originated in this period in the regions ruled by the Roman Empire. Reasons for the use of various types of fabrics, including the <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking</b> as painting supports, are not investigated enough, but it does appear that their availability and economic reasons were often the only selection criteria. Although it is impossible to make general conclusions, some documents and examples indicate that the twill fabrics were used for exceptionally large paintings. In the context of painting, <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking</b> is mentioned in Flemish, English and French documents and painter’s manuals published from the 17 th to the 19 th century. In Ita ly, Istria, Dalmatia and Spain, the historical terms for the twill fabrics used for making mattresses and work clothes (traliccio, terlise, trliš, terliz etc.) is of Latin origin (trilix) and initially did not denote the fabric’s designation but {{had to do with the}} type of weave. Variants of these terms are mentioned in the trading documents and archives of textile manufacturers in north Italy, and in connection with the painting commissions in 16 th- and 17 th-century Italy and Spain. The studies of painting supports in Flemish and Dutch art of the 17 th and 18 th century provide the most details about paintings on <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking,</b> with detailed accounts of canvases by Maarten de Vos, Pieter Pieters, Nicolas de Liemaker and Pieter Johannes van Reysschoot. The weave is described as a warp-faced reverse twill (chevron) 3 / 1. The earliest example of a painting on a <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking</b> from blue-striped reverse twill that is known to the author is The Battle of the Spurs by an unknown artist, made in England around 1540 (Hampton Court Palace, London). Also in England, Anthony van Dyck painted several extraordinarily large pieces, and there are known works by other artists on this type of canvas from the 17 th, 18 th and 19 th century. In France, artists had from the 17 th to the 20 th century sometimes painted on a similar support, among them Philippe de Champaigne and François Boucher. The author is aware of only two examples of paintings on canvas with blue stripes in Italy. The paper also touches upon the issue of research of painting canvases. The technology of making a painting, the natural processes of deterioration and historical alterations and treatments make analyses of the structure, colour and finishing difficult, and by that also make it hard to determine the original characteristics and designation of the fabric the painter had used. With still few specialist studies which would have differing approaches to canvas research, the analytical parameters are sometimes hard to compare or apply. Although their number is in continual decline, in Dalmatia there are still paintings that haven 2 ̆ 7 t been restored i. e. lined. Given that indirect methods of analysis of the original canvases for lined paintings still have limitations, amid their many possibilities, each unlined painting represents a precious possibility to study the history of painting supports but also of historical textiles. The differentiation between the warp and the weft is a precondition for a comparison of the parameters of painting canvases; however, selvedges of the fabric are relatively rarely preserved. According to a study by van der Wetering, the differences in the quality of threads that can be seen with some types of handwoven canvases are for the time being the most reliable criterion for differentiating between the warp and weft. The second criterion, that is applicable to canvases without the visible difference in the quality of threads, is the difference in the number of threads. The comparative analysis of several 17 th- and 18 th-century canvases from Dalmatia included these parameters: dimensions of the canvas support, width of the fabric, direction of the warp, description of the characteristics of threads in both directions, number of threads of the warp and weft by centimetre, type and unit of the weave, description of the striped pattern. Parameters for painting canvases are difficult to compare according to the place and time of their origin. They vary considerably within the same period and region, even within a single artist’s body of work. Depending on their original designation, they differ in the quality of the material and making, as well as in the type of weave and treatment. Among Dalmatian examples of 17 th- and 18 th-century paintings on the canvas for mattresses, the one from Šibenik is the oldest. Compared to examples from abroad, it is also among the earliest ones. Out of forty paintings on striped canvas from the 16 th – 18 th century in England, Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, the most were authored by 17 th-century Flemish artists (twenty eight). Judging by the information and examples collected in the research, striped cloths for mattresses with twill pattern from abroad that were described in the paper are much finer than those from Dalmatia (have more threads per cm) and the fabrics are much wider, but they are mostly large-size paintings. With a little over a half of the cases, the warp was set in the length direction of the painting. From the photographs of the canvases of several foreign examples it is evident that the paintings were done on the face of the fabric where the herringbone pattern is more pronounced, as well as the blue stripes. Although this could lead to a conclusion that the choice of the fabric face was a conscious one, owing to its texture, the reasons need to be examined more closely. All Dalmatian paintings featured here were also painted on the fabric face – except the one from Brač that was composed of several assorted pieces of cloth – and with the warp facing opposite directions and the fabric face on opposing sides. Also, there can be observed a rather different relation toward the texture of the canvas – some artists leave it visible, others cover it in a thick painted layer. For now it appears that this research too leads to the conclusions of earlier studies of painting canvases – the reason for choosing striped <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking</b> as painting support may well have been its availability in a certain size, at a particular moment in history...|$|E
40|$|The {{multi-media}} sculptures {{that constitute}} {{this body of}} work are extensions and representations of my perceptions and feelings related to {{the social and political}} mores of the world [...] past, present and future. The messages from newspapers, magazine articles, lectures and television commentaries, are often very disturbing and the cause of much concern. As a result, my work has evolved into a political and social commentary. This is my way of transcending inner feelings and conflicts, making strong observations that might cause people to confront some of the realities of life. It is necessary for me to contemplate each concept {{for an extended period of}} time before beginning fabrication. Mentally, this is difficult because the subject matter is intense and exceedingly draining. In order to present these political and social commentaries I utilize non-specific human forms. This approach started several years ago in Cliff Dwellings (Plates # 1 and # 2), a group of pit-fired vessels, which have Lilliputian saw-dust fired people scaling their mountainous ridges. The more recent works use people to express my ideas; however, they have grown considerably in scale and meaning. I have used clay, glazes, paints, hardware cloth, wood, plexi-glass tubing, metal, etc., to create the sculptures. Red, black and yellow are used in many of the works, red and black denoting power and evil, yellow for its disturbing quality. Among the early works, prior to the master's series, are Things Are Seldom What They Seem, Skim Milk Masquerades As Cream (Plate # 3), Reaganism or Darwin's Theory of Evolution (Plate # 4) and Corporate Capitalism (Plate # 5). They were my initial attempts at political analysis through the sculptural form. The themes include the false god of materialism, the economic recession and the tarnishing of the American dream. In the master's series the portrayal of these and additional political thoughts become considerably darker, more macabre and less hopeful. Animal Farm (Plates # 6, # 7, # 8 and # 9) is inspired by George Orwell's 1946 allegorical novel, which dealt with totalitarianism. Orwell said he tried to "fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole. " This statement applies to my work in general. This work has three sets built like theatre-in-the-round. In the barnyard scene, the pigs and their guard dogs are holding court over the other farm animals, laying down the rules and regulations. The bedroom depicts the pigs sleeping on <b>mattress</b> <b>ticking.</b> Commandment Number Four states "Animals must not sleep in beds with sheets. " The next scene, the farmhouse kitchen, is the final chapter of the story. By now, the pigs are hard to distinguish from the humans with whom they are playing cards and drinking beer. Sitting at the kitchen table, wearing identical clothes, they are both cheating at their game of cards. Of the list of commandments introduced by the pigs, Number Seven, "All animals are equal. But some are more equal than others. ", is the only one left. (See more in text...|$|E
30|$|The {{materials}} and constructions discussed above for passing TB 129 are generally used for institutional mattresses. For institutional mattresses, fire performance {{is more important}} than comfort and aesthetics. However, polyvinyl tickings, fire barriers with fiberglass substrates, and solid core mattresses with densified polyester batting are not preferred choices for residential mattresses due to cost, comfort and aesthetics. Unlike institutional mattresses, comfort and aesthetics are of primary importance in the case of residential mattresses; hence, fire performance must be achieved while still maintaining the comfort and aesthetics. For this reason, highloft barrier materials are more commonly used as fire barriers in residential <b>mattresses.</b> <b>Ticking</b> with polyester or polyester blends that are generally used in residential mattresses behave very differently in presence of fire barriers. The effects of melting and dripping can have a varied impact on the flammability of a mattress. Data for compliance to 16 CFR 1633 for residential mattresses with highloft or other newly engineered barrier materials are currently not available. Several polyester blend tickings are being currently investigated and their fire performance with and without fire barriers is being studied in our laboratories.|$|R
30|$|The {{materials}} and constructions discussed above for passing TB 129 are generally used for institutional <b>mattresses.</b> <b>Ticking</b> with polyester or polyester blends {{that are used}} in many residential mattresses behave very differently in the presence of fire barriers. Moreover, the test methods employed for mattresses used in public occupancies (Cal TB 129) and residential mattresses (16 CFR 1633) use different ignition sources thus the thermal insult seen by tickings in such mattresses would be significantly different. The Cal TB 129 uses single propane gas burner which is applied to the mattress side whereas 16 CFR 1633 uses dual burner (also known as NIST burner) to apply flaming ignition to both the side and top surfaces of the mattress. The NIST burner replicates burning bedclothes on mattress and mimics pool fire caused by melting of bedclothes. The effects of melting and dripping can have a varied impact on the flammability of a mattress. Fire barriers often fail to protect the underlying material when melting and shrinkage occur. This can cause tensile stresses to develop within the barrier material, resulting in breakage that allows flame and heat to penetrate. This particular failure mechanism is a major concern for barriers based on charring organic fibers.|$|R
30|$|Tickings perform {{differently}} in {{the presence or absence}} of fire barrier materials. A majority (~ 80 %) of mattresses with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ticking pass the TB 129 without using a barrier fabric because PVC tickings are active fire barriers with self extinguishing behavior ([Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack 1998]). Approximately 20 % mattresses with PVC coated ticking fail due to antagonistic reactions of highly plasticized PVC coated fabrics with other components of upholstery. <b>Mattresses</b> with cotton/fiberglass <b>ticking</b> do not require an additional fire barrier material to protect the underlying cushioning layer either. In this case, the cotton/fiberglass ticking acts as a passive fire barrier and physically prevents flame and heat transfer to the underlying cushioning layer. On the other hand, <b>mattresses</b> with cotton <b>ticking</b> certainly require a fire barrier in order to pass the open flame test. This is partly because cotton is extremely flammable and cotton tickings burn with a higher rate of flame spread, thereby exposing underlying cushioning layers to the open flames.|$|R
30|$|Unlike <b>mattresses,</b> {{where the}} <b>ticking</b> fabric {{is more of}} an afterthought, for {{residential}} upholstered furniture the cover fabric is critical to the consumer since it is primary component with aesthetic attributes. To satisfy the large breadth of consumers’ preferences, the cover fabric for a given design may be available in a large variety of materials, patterns, and colors, each of which impacts upholstered furniture flammability ([Ohlemiller & Gann 2002]; [Sundström 1995]; [Forsten 1994]; [Damant et al. 1983]; [Memorandum to D 2004]; Coles [2000]). For example, the European study, the Combustion Behavior of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF), showed that the cover fabric is the controlling element in small open flame ignition (e.g., from a candle) of upholstered furniture ([Sundström 1995]). Since the completion of the CBUF study, covering fabrics have changed significantly. This is expected to impact upholstered furniture flammability ([Coles 2000]; [Damant 1995]). Modern fabrics are generally constructed of blends of thermoplastic and regenerated cellulosic fibers, which are known to provide better durability and aesthetics, but in some cases, at the expense of flammability. [Ohlemiller (Ohlemiller & Gann 2002]; [Ohlemiller & Shields 2008]) observed that some thermoplastic fabrics, depending on fabric structure, may split open thereby enabling the underlying components such as PUF and polyester wrap to participate in the fire. This resulted in a rapid increase in HRR and fire growth. To mitigate the increased flammability caused by these covering fabrics, fire blocking technologies were used in this study to delay ignition of the underlying components, thus allowing thermoplastic fabrics to be used while still complying with flammability regulations ([Ohlemiller & Gann 2002]).|$|R
