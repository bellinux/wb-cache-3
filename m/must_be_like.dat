500|$|Star Wars is {{frequently}} referenced in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens, and while {{trying to get out of}} jury duty in Chicago. Star Wars is also referenced when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In this episode, Liz tells Stewart that there are many languages and costumes in the conference room of the United Nations, saying, [...] "it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> working in the Galactic Senate in Star Wars". Stewart responds, [...] "They are similar. We're also concerned about the growing influence of the Sith Lord." ...|$|E
500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} {{two years}} on tour promoting Brown Sugar, D'Angelo found himself stuck with writer's block. On the setback, D'Angelo later stated [...] "The thing about writer's block is {{that you want to}} write so f---king bad, [...] the songs don't come out that way. They come from life. So you've got to live to write." [...] During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song [...] "Your Precious Love" [...] for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's [...] "She's Always in My Hair" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), as well as the Ohio Players' [...] "Heaven <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Like</b> This" [...] for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, [...] "Nothing Even Matters", with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also spent the time lifting weights, smoking weed, and making music.|$|E
500|$|Frank Provo of GameSpot {{reviewed}} the Wii Virtual Console release in 2007, citing the excellent graphics, sound, and general {{intensity of the}} game. He noted initial difficulty adjusting to the controls and game design. However, once accustomed, he said, [...] "you start totally feeling what it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be an army of one trading firepower {{with some of the}} universe's largest, most elaborate creatures. That's a great feeling." [...] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted the game's many similarities to Gunstar Heroes and recommended Alien Soldier to those who enjoyed it. [...] "Alien Soldier is a long-lost piece of Treasure's action gaming legacy," [...] said Thomas. [...] "It's got the fast-firing, high-energy, overly-explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect." [...] Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive. He found the game difficult, but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as [...] "manically-paced" [...] and [...] "bizarrely creative" [...] while also providing a disclaimer that it's [...] "really hectic and difficult if you're not into this sort of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E

500|$|The {{union of}} song and symphonic form in Mahler's music is, in Cooke's view, organic; [...] "his songs flower {{naturally}} into symphonic movements, being already symphonic in cast." [...] To Sibelius, Mahler expressed {{the belief that}} [...] "The symphony <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the world. It must embrace everything." [...] True to this belief, Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works: bird calls and cow-bells to evoke nature and the countryside, bugle fanfares, street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood. Life's struggles are represented in contrasting moods: the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony, suffering and despair by discord, distortion and grotesquerie. Amid all this is Mahler's particular hallmark—the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness, typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march. The trite melody soon changes its character, and in due course re-emerges {{as one of the}} majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict. Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work, calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony [...] "the most farcical {{and at the same time}} the most tragic piece that ever existed... It is as though all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1335, the French {{cardinal}} Jacques Fournier, {{a former}} Cistercian monk {{and the son}} of a miller, was elected and consecrated Pope Benedict XII. [...] The maxim attributed to him, [...] "the pope <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Melchizedech who had no father, no mother, nor even a family tree", is revealing of his character. [...] Benedict was shy of personal power and was devoted exclusively to restoring the authority of the Church. [...] As a Cistercian, he had a notable theological background and, unlike his predecessor John XXII, he was a stranger to nepotism and scrupulous with his appointments. [...] He promulgated a series of regulations to restore the primitive spirit of the Cistercian Order.|$|E
2500|$|Revisiting the {{commercial}} in Harper's Magazine {{thirty years after}} it aired, Rebecca Solnit suggested that [...] "1984" [...] did not so much herald {{a new era of}} liberation as a new era of oppression. She wrote, [...] "I want to yell at the liberatory young woman with her sledgehammer, 'Don't do it!' Apple is not different. That industry is going to give rise to innumerable forms of triviality and misogyny, to the concentration of wealth and the dispersal of mental concentration. To suicidal, underpaid Chinese factory workers whose reality <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> that of the shuffling workers in {{the commercial}}.

2500|$|Hopkins is a {{recovering}} alcoholic; he has stayed sober since he stopped drinking just after Christmas 1975. In 2002, {{he told the}} New York Times that he woke up in a Phoenix hotel room with no memory of having driven from Los Angeles. [...] "It was two days before his 38th birthday. Still, he continued to spiral downward, at times sitting at home for hours without saying a word. He'd climb {{in his car and}} cruise aimlessly for days: once he went on a drive and didn't return for two months. [...] "If there is someone fighting within you, it makes your life unbearable," [...] he said. [...] "Anger has to be converted into something else or it destroys you." [...] He said that a major help in his recovery was his belief in God. He has criticised atheism, saying in 2011 that [...] "being an atheist <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> living in a closed cell with no windows". In an interview with Larry King in 2016, Hopkins described himself as an agnostic and said he believed in a [...] "superior consciousness in all of us". He gave up smoking using the Allen Carr method. In 2008, he embarked on a weight loss program, and by 2010, he had lost 80 pounds.|$|E

2500|$|Joe Morgenstern, {{film critic}} for The Wall Street Journal, opened his review by asking: [...] "Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?" [...] His answer was [...] "Maybe not; there's always Battlefield Earth {{to remind us}} how low the bar can go." [...] Like Morgenstern, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times made note of the film's use of central themes in Scientology before {{concluding}} the film {{was nothing more than}} a [...] "big-screen vanity project". Los Angeles Times reviewer Betsy Sharkey wondered how the elder Smith could have gone from the charismatic performance in the serious film The Pursuit of Happyness, also co-starring his son, to the performance in After Earth. She also saw compounding problems in the creative process leading to a lack of subtlety and nuance: [...] "The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety opined that the film was further proof that Shyamalan had become a [...] "director-for-hire", with [...] "his disinterest palpable from first frame to last". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film one star out of five, calling it [...] "another uncompromisingly terrible film ... featuring a triple-whammy of abysmal acting, directing and story" [...] and saying that Jaden Smith [...] "plays the role throughout with a face like a smacked bum" [...] and [...] "Kitai [...] <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> his dad: show no fear. Or any emotion. Or any acting talent of any sort." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine what it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E
