Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect <b>means.</b> <b>This</b> was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Cycloalkanes {{reported}} as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin. The dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes is highly endothermic (63-69 kJ/mol H2), which <b>means</b> <b>this</b> process requires high temperature. Dehydrogenation of decalin {{is the most}} thermodynamically favored among the three cycloalkanes, and methyl-cyclohexane is second {{because of the presence}} of the methyl group. Research on catalyst development for dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes has been carried out for decades. Nickel (Ni), Molybdenum (Mo) and Platinum (Pt) based catalysts are highly investigated for dehydrogenation. However, coking is still a big challenge for catalyst’s long-term stability.|$|E

25|$|Prince-Archbishop Valdemar confederated {{with the}} free peasants of Stedingen, a region within the Prince-Archbishopric whose {{inhabitants}} rejected to be subjected as serfs, sparing them from socage.

The free peasants of Stedingen agreed to provide Prince-Archbishop Valdemar with mercenaries, who in return retained any further attack on their freedom.|$|E

The planters plotted to murder him, but the plot became known and Knibb's family found refuge {{with one of the}} leading islanders. After his release, for three successive nights a group of 50 white planters stoned his lodging.|$|E

In the wavelength range 3200–8800Â, the energy emission of this star is very similar to the Sun, and thus it is considered a solar analog. The luminosity class 'V' <b>means</b> <b>this</b> is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of the outer envelope of HD 44594 is 5,840K, which is giving it the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star.|$|E

25|$|Cellular {{automaton}} processors are physical implementations of CA concepts, {{which can}} process information computationally. Processing elements {{are arranged in}} a regular grid of identical cells. The grid is usually a square tiling, or tessellation, {{of two or three}} dimensions; other tilings are possible, but not yet used. Cell states are determined only by interactions with adjacent neighbor cells. No means exists to communicate directly with cells farther away. One such cellular automaton processor array configuration is the systolic array. Cell interaction can be via electric charge, magnetism, vibration (phonons at quantum scales), or any other physically useful <b>means.</b> <b>This</b> can be done in several ways so no wires are needed between any elements. This is very unlike processors used in most computers today, von Neumann designs, which are divided into sections with elements that can communicate with distant elements over wires.|$|E
25|$|Such {{detection}} {{would not}} have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close {{to one another in}} time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other <b>means.</b> <b>This</b> complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the <b>means.</b> <b>This</b> means that any sort of research on a human being is justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or a homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E
