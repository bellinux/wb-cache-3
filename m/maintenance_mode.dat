500|$|Prior to the 2016 {{model year}} the Volt {{required}} premium gasoline of (R+M)/2 octane rating of 91 or higher because the higher octane permitted the 10.5:1 compression ratio engine to utilize more ignition timing advance {{in order to}} maximize its fuel efficiency by 5 to 10% as compared to regular gasoline. For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months, the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation, and as a result, the fuel filler has to be depressurized before opening the tank. Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the [...] all-electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system will automatically run the <b>maintenance</b> <b>mode</b> which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine. A configuration with an E85 flex-fuel capable engine is under development and was expected to be available in 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of national economy, China’s needs for electricity are growing and the requirements on quality is also becoming stricter on the power system security, stability and economic operation. Diagnosis {{of the state of}} equipment is mainly based on statistical analysis of large amounts of data. But with {{the development}} of computer technology and artificial intelligence, a diagnostic equipment is formed like an expert system, replacing the past practice by recognizing equipment malfunction by years of data on tests, operations, maintenance and so on. Comparative analysis is done by repeated calls of accident records. It becomes more accurate and reliable to introduce and apply advanced technologies of condition-based maintenance and management into insulation diagnosis of electrical equipment. Two development stages of <b>maintenance</b> <b>modes</b> The developmental history of <b>maintenance</b> <b>modes</b> can be concluded mainly by two stages: corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance.

40|$|AbstractVirtual {{testability}} {{demonstration test}} has many advantages, such as low cost, high efficiency, low risk and few restrictions. It brings new requirements to the fault sample generation. A fault sample simulation approach for virtual testability demonstration test based on stochastic process theory is proposed. First, {{the similarities and}} differences of fault sample generation between physical testability demonstration test and virtual testability demonstration test are discussed. Second, it is pointed out that the fault occurrence process subject to perfect repair is renewal process. Third, the interarrival time distribution function of the next fault event is given. Steps and flowcharts of fault sample generation are introduced. The number of faults and their occurrence time are obtained by statistical simulation. Finally, experiments are carried out on a stable tracking platform. Because a variety of types of life distributions and <b>maintenance</b> <b>modes</b> are considered and some assumptions are removed, the sample size and structure of fault sample simulation results are more similar to the actual results and more reasonable. The proposed method can effectively guide the fault injection in virtual testability demonstration test...|$|R
40|$|Part 8 : Knowledge Creation and ManagementInternational audienceBecause of {{considerable}} high labor cost {{in developed countries}} particularly Japan and Korea, {{the end of life}} products required manual or semi-manual processes have been relocated to developing countries. In addition, the relocation creates an immediate financial profit on old asset sale while it is revalued to 30  % of its initial value in the new relocated factory. The relocation is not only production location change but also the experience in operation and maintenance process to its Foreign Direct Investment affiliate. Since the old product and process are both nearly at their end of life, it needs to extend the life as long as the product still exists in the market. In order to immediately launch the operation as well as to retain the knowledge, therefore, the asset management and new <b>maintenance</b> <b>modes</b> are proposed at all product, process and people aspects to improve reliability of the old asset and to minimize maintenance cost. The research in this paper was carried out on a Korean relocated electronic factory in Thailand.

On four model sections {{of the forest}} road we investigated the short-term alterations of the roadway shape after periodic maintenance with minimal and optimal addition of autochthon gravel and the two methods of pavement: two passes of a roller and paving with truck traffic. On {{the basis of the}} numerical analysis of roadway cross-section data significant decrease of the transverse roughness index (TRI) for thin gravelled profiles and insignificant increase of TRI on unrolled profiles after road use were found. The average carriageway transverse gradient, the average roadway width and the average ditch depth have not significantly changed after applied <b>maintenance</b> <b>modes.</b> The width of longitudinal road drainage installations was in most cases altered at the expense of carriagewaywidth, its depth increased in all applied modes.

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} a role of various <b>maintenance</b> <b>modes,</b> such as enteral tube feeding (ETF) and {{complete}} parenteral feeding in different phases of acute pancreatitis (AP). Subjects and materials. The impact of various modes of nutritional support on pancreatic secretory activity and the course of AP was comparatively analyzed in 774 patients (mean age 45. 3 ± 4. 7 years) with AP. The criteria for evaluation of {{the activities of the}} pancreas and its inflammatory process activity were considered to be clinical and laboratory parameters (pain, body temperature, hemogram, amylasemia, the degree of dynamic ileus and abdominal inflammatory infiltrate, and the level of gastrointestinal peptides), and ultrasonographic and computed tomographic data. The additional impact of different types of protein-calorie provision on pancreatic secretory activity was studied in 23 patients with external pancreatic fistulas, by using debetometry. Results. ETF was shown to have a stimulating effect on pancreatic secretion and AP worsening when it was used in the early phases of the disease. The optimum time of complete parenteral feeding (days 5 — 14 after the onset of the disease) and the criteria for the possible initiation of ETF were determined. Emphasis was laid on the important role of enteral feeding in a package of therapeutic measures in AP in the phase of pyonecrotic lesions. Conclusion. The proposed nutritional support tactics along with mini-invasive surgical treatments could reduce postoperative and overall mortality rates to 4. 2 and 3. 7 %, respectively.
