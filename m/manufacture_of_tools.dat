60|$|This is {{especially}} true of those families of the great red race which inhabited what is now Canada. They spent a primitive existence, living thinly scattered along the sea-coast, and in the forests and open glades of the district of the Great Lakes, or wandering over the prairies of the west. In hardly any case had they any settled abode or fixed dwelling-places. The Iroquois and some Algonquins built Long Houses of wood and made stockade forts of heavy timber. But not even these tribes, who represented the furthest advance towards civilization among the savages of North America, made settlements in the real sense. They knew nothing of the use of the metals. Such poor weapons and tools as they had were made of stone, of wood, and of bone. It is true that ages ago prehistoric men had dug out copper from the mines that lie beside Lake Superior, for the traces of their operations there are still found. But the art of working metals probably progressed but a little way and then was lost,--overwhelmed perhaps in some ancient savage conquest. The Indians found by Cartier and Champlain knew nothing of the melting of metals for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools.</b> Nor had they anything but the most elementary form of agriculture. They planted corn in the openings of the forest, but they did not fell trees to make a clearing or plough the ground. The harvest provided by nature and the products of the chase were their sole sources of supply, and in their search for this food so casually offered they moved to and fro {{in the depths of the}} forest or roved endlessly upon the plains. One great advance, and only one, they had been led to make. The waterways of North America are nature's highway through the forest. The bark canoe in which the Indians floated over the surface of the Canadian lakes and rivers is a marvel of construction and wonderfully adapted to its purpose: This was their great invention. In nearly all other respects the Indians of Canada had not emerged even from savagery to that stage half way to civilization which is called barbarism.|$|E

40|$|The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooling</b> {{using the}} {{electric}} are spray process to spray steel directly onto a master pattern offers substantial {{reductions in the}} lead times required to make complex tooling for polymer injection moulding and other applications. The process of spray forming is fast, efficient, and low cost, and {{has been shown to}} be dimensionally accurate with proper control over the residual stresses that develop during spraying. Poor dimensional control because of high internal stresses in thick are sprayed steel coatings is well known, but these problems can be avoided by the use of correct spraying conditions. This paper describes the STD SPRAYFORM process for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooling</b> for the polymer injection moulding of a component for a leading company in the U. S. The steps in the spray forming process, both before and after spraying, are described. The spray forming route competed directly with a traditional method for toolmaking and considerably reduced the lead time from order to completion. The tooling produced by spray forming has been operating commercially in production in the U. S. and has to date produced in the region of half a million parts without appreciable wear. The incorporation of contoured cooling channels during spraying has enabled plastic injection moulding cycle times to be decreased by 15 %...|$|R

5000|$|Hand tools {{have been}} used by humans since the Stone Age when stones were used for {{hammering}} and cutting. During the Bronze Age tools were made by casting the copper and tin alloys. Bronze tools were sharper and harder than those made of stone. During the Iron Age iron replaced bronze, and tools became even stronger and more durable. The Romans developed tools during this period which are similar to those being produced today.

50|$|Evidence {{seems to}} {{indicate}} that Mal'ta is the most ancient site in eastern Siberia; however, relative dating illustrates some irregularities. The use of flint flaking and the absence of pressure flaking used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools,</b> as well as the continued use of earlier forms of tools, seem to confirm the fact that the site belongs to the early Upper Paleolithic. Yet it lacks typical skreblos (large side scrapers) that are common in other Siberian Paleolithic sites. Additionally, other common characteristics such as pebble cores, wedge-shaped cores, burins, and composite tools have never been found. The lack of these features, combined with an art style found in only one other nearby site, make Mal'ta culture unique in Siberia.|$|E
50|$|Forge welding {{grew from}} a {{trial-and-error}} method, becoming more refined over the centuries. Due {{to the poor}} quality of ancient metals, it was commonly employed in making composite steels, by joining high-carbon steels, that would resist deformation but break easily, with low-carbon steels, which resist fracture but bend too easily, creating an object with greater toughness and strength than could be produced with a single alloy. This method of pattern welding first appeared around 700 BC, and was primarily used for making weapons such as swords, with the most widely known examples being from Damascus, Japanese, and Merovingian swords. This process was also common in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools,</b> from wrought-iron plows with steel edges to iron chisels with steel cutting surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The Neolithic {{economy was}} based on agriculture, the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools,</b> weapons and pottery, domesticating and {{breeding}} animal, hunting and fishing. Therefore, settlements were developed near natural resources. Most Neolithic sites in Kosovo feature dwellings built from materials found near the settlements: huts with wooden frames and sticks, coated with soil and mixed with oat chaff, with roofs made from twisted cane and rye chaff. Although archaeologists and academics differ about the exact dates of the Neolithic in the Balkans, it is generally agreed that the period extended from 6500 to 3500 BC. Cave and rock art confirm the use of caves as temporary shelters and places of worship. The primary cult {{was that of the}} mother goddess, and Neolithic society was matriarchal.|$|E

50|$|The major {{breakthroughs}} {{in this period}} were {{in the use of}} iron (both cast and wrought). Iron columns had been used in Wren's designs for the House of Commons and were used in several early eighteenth-century churches in London, but these supported only galleries. In {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century the decreasing costs of iron production allowed the construction of major pieces of iron engineering. The Iron Bridge at Coalbrookdale (1779) is a particularly notable example. Large-scale mill construction required fire-proof buildings and cast iron became increasingly used for columns and beams to carry brick vaults for floors. The Louvre in Paris boasted an early example of a wrought-iron roof. Steel was used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> but could not be made in sufficient quantities to be used for building.|$|E
50|$|Forge welding {{has been}} used {{throughout}} its history for making most any items out of steel and iron. It {{has been used}} in everything from the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools,</b> farming implements, and cookware to the manufacture of fences, gates, and prison cells. In the early Industrial Revolution, it was commonly used in the manufacture of boilers and pressure vessels, until the introduction of fusion-welding. It was commonly used through the Middle Ages for producing armor and weapons. One of the most famous applications of forge welding involves the production of pattern-welded blades. During this process a smith repeatedly draws out a billet of steel, folds it back and welds it upon itself. Another application was the manufacture of shotgun barrels. Metal wire was spooled onto a mandrel, and then forged into a barrel that was thin, uniform, and strong. In some cases the forge-welded objects are acid-etched to expose the underlying pattern of metal, which is unique to each item and provides aesthetic appeal.|$|E
