5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended control arms can be employed on <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E

25|$|The Spirit could {{accommodate}} {{six people}} with an optional front split-bench seat. It had a large trunk, a solid-beam rear axle, and a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension. The Spirit differed from the other A-bodies primarily in the grille and rear lamp styling, and in {{the availability of a}} sportier, higher-performing R/T version.|$|E
25|$|The Frisky Family Three was {{basically}} a three-wheeled version of the coupe fitted with a smaller Villiers 9E engine and <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension. Having three wheels instead of four meant the car qualified for lower vehicle excise duty and also meant {{that it could be}} driven with a motorcycle licence. It entered production in about February 1959.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} used four speed manual transmission, whilst {{the current}} car is available with either six speed manual or five speed automatic transmission. The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension, and a Twist-beam rear suspension. Most models use disc brakes {{at the front}} and rear drum brakes, although some recent models have all round disc brakes.|$|E

25|$|Coil spring {{independent}} suspension features {{by way of}} a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms. Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.|$|E
25|$|Suspension was a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> {{arrangement}} at the front, {{anchored by}} lower alloy L-arms. The wide spacing of the mounting points, compliant bushings and a perimeter subframe gave the model a cushioned yet precise ride with relaxed handling {{that could be}} tuned for different markets or model derivatives such as the later MG ZT. The rear suspension, {{after a period of}} uncertainty during development, was eventually a version of BMW's Z-Axle arrangement first featured on the 1988 Z1 sports car.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX's new {{transmission}} can lock-up its torque converter from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center locking differential, a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An Electric Power Steering (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A double wishbone rear suspension setup replaces the previous <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E

25|$|The G20 {{was first}} {{unveiled}} to Infiniti dealers at the 1989 New York International Auto Show (appearing {{to the public}} at the 1990 show), with the first series production example being assembled on July 10, 1990. The final 1996 G20 was rolled off the assembly line on July 19, 1996. The P10 featured the first application of Nissan's multi-link front suspension in a front-wheel-drive car, with an independent <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> setup in the rear. It came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. The only options to begin with were an automatic transmission, leather interior, and a power glass moonroof; a Touring package (labeled G20t) was introduced in 1994 and featured a black leather interior with sport front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats, as well as a limited-slip differential in the transmission and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1959 a {{new version}} of the Family Three was announced. The Frisky Family Three Mk2, dropped the <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front {{suspension}} of the original car replacing it with the Dubonnet system used on the Friskysport. The chassis was lengthened to allow the engine to be moved back out of the cabin and it was now offered with the choice of either a [...] or [...] Excelsior Talisman twin engines giving the advantage of an Albion gearbox with a true reverse gear. Twin front seats replaced the original bench seats and production commenced in early 1960.|$|E
2500|$|Inside the cabin, the second-generation ES {{featured}} California walnut trim on {{the center}} console, leather seats, an eight-speaker premium sound system, and keyless entry. The added wheelbase length and overall width made for increased legroom and shoulder space than the previous model. Compared to its Camry relative, the ES 300 featured separate styling, a different suspension setup with front and rear independent <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut,</b> and added weight amounting to [...] Much of {{this is due to}} increased dimensions, asphalt insulation in the body panels and additional on-board equipment. As with its predecessor, anti-lock brakes were standard.|$|E
50|$|At the front, {{aluminium}} <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> are used. The {{rear suspension}} is a steel 5-link Multi-link suspension.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} setup {{used was}} inspired by the Legacy instead of using strictly <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> to save on production costs.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} utilises {{a fairly}} conventional set-up that comprises <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts,</b> offset coil springs, lower wishbones and an anti-roll bar.|$|R
2500|$|The Escort had {{conventional}} {{rear-wheel drive}} and a four-speed manual gearbox, or three-speed automatic transmission. The suspension consisted of <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension {{and a simple}} live axle mounted on leaf springs. The Escort was the first small Ford to use rack-and-pinion steering. The Mark I featured contemporary styling cues in tune with its time: a subtle Detroit-inspired [...] "Coke bottle" [...] waistline and the [...] "dogbone" [...] shaped front grille– arguably the car's main stylistic feature. Similar Coke bottle styling featured in the larger Cortina Mark III (a visually similar car was built in West Germany as the Taunus) launched in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Volkswagen added a [...] "Super Beetle" [...] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 {{differed}} from the standard Beetle in its use of a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension {{instead of the usual}} torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in model year 1974 and up. The front of the car was stretched [...] to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.|$|E
2500|$|The Bluebird 910, the of {{the last}} rear-wheel drive Bluebird, {{featured}} simple clean-cut lines, unlike the [...] "Coke Bottle" [...] styling of its predecessor. It did however retain the same engine range, the same <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> suspension and the same [...] wheelbase as the 810. Starting with this generation, in Japan the Bluebird returned to offering only four-cylinder vehicles, and the six-cylinder Bluebird {{was replaced by the}} Nissan Skyline based Nissan Leopard at Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships. Bluebirds of this generation were renowned for reliability but rusted away in salted areas long before the engine gave trouble. Nissan realigned with the Japanese Stanza/Auster/Violet sedans which were assigned to individual Japanese Nissan dealerships.|$|E
50|$|Following MacPherson's {{arrival at}} Ford, the first {{production}} car to feature <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> was the British-built 1950 Ford Consul and later Zephyr.|$|R
5000|$|<b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> {{are used}} in {{suspension}} at all four corners {{with the exception of}} the Sienna, which uses a rear beam axle.|$|R
5000|$|The Lancia Lybra and Alfa Romeo 156 used a {{development}} of the C1 platform, called [...] "Type Two rev. 3", with an extended wheelbase and a different suspension setup: <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> at the front and BLG ("Bracci Longitudinali Guidati", translating to [...] "Guided Longitudinal Arms") rear suspension for the Lancia, double wishbones at the front and <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> at the rear for the Alfa. The Alfa Romeo 147 and Alfa Romeo GT were derived from the 156 floorpan.|$|R
2500|$|Jenkins went winless in 1971. NHRA {{changed the}} 1972 rules to allow drivers {{with a small}} block wedge engine to run a lighter car. Jenkins used a small block-based [...] in a Chevrolet Vega fitted in the division's first tube chassis, which debuted at the 1972 Winternationals. He had a subpar 9.90 second pass in the {{untested}} Vega, qualifying 17th of the 32 entries at the season-opening event. After tuning the chassis, the car clocked low-9.6 second passes on race day and Jenkins won the event. Jenkins used the car to win five of the first eight events of the season (some of them regionals) and six of eight Nationals. Jenkins earned a total of $250,000 that year, including event and manufacturer support. He matched Wilt Chamberlain as the professional athlete with the highest salary in the United States. That year he was featured in Time magazine, the first drag racer to experience mainstream national coverage. Jenkins built a Vega in 1974 (dubbed Grumpy's Toy XI) that had several firsts which impacted future drag racing cars, including the first dry sump oiling system and a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> front suspension. This car would give him thirteen wins in Pro Stock that year.|$|E
50|$|The Chapman strut {{is often}} {{confused}} with the <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut,</b> as both use a near-vertical upper strut, The distinction is that the <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> always requires a lower track control arm where the Chapman uses the drive shaft and a light radius rod.|$|E
5000|$|Front {{suspension}} is <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut,</b> while rear is torsion beam.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{in front}} was <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> {{supported by a}} transverse leaf spring beneath the engine cross-member, with leaf springs connected to a solid axle in back.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} setup in the BH Persona, {{like the}} Iriz, consists of <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> with stabiliser bars {{at the front}} and torsion beam axles at the rear. In comparison, the CM Persona received <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> with stabiliser bars up front and more sophisticated multi-links at the back. Additionally, the BH has electric power steering (EPS) as opposed to hydraulic power steering in the CM. The EPS system is easier to steer at low speeds and helps improve fuel efficiency, but it comes {{at the expense of}} more engaging steering feedback.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Fiat C-platform was directly derived from this platform: {{it has only}} minor differences, and is also called [...] "Type Two rev. 2". The Alfa Romeo 156 and Lancia Lybra platform is also derived from the Type Two rev. 2 platform and called [...] "Type Two rev. 3", with stretched wheelbase and different suspension setups: <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> at the front and GLA (standing for [...] "Guided Longitudinal Arms", [...] "Bracci Longitudinali Guidati" [...] in Italian) at the rear for the Lybra, double wishbones at the front and <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> at the rear for the Alfa.|$|R
