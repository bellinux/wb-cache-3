25|$|The Sierra del Tentzon {{and higher}} {{elevations}} of Malinche volcano still conserve the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion – with forests of pine, holm oak and other tree species. In the pine forests, <b>Montezuma</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus montezumae) is generally predominant, with Hartweg's Pine (Pinus hartwegii) and Pinus teocote in dry areas with shallow soils.

500|$|Psilocybe aztecorum {{is known}} {{only from the}} high {{mountains}} of central Mexico, such as Sierra Nevada, Nevado de Toluca, and La Malinche in the States of Mexico, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. According to Guzmán, {{it is likely that}} the species also grows in other areas with high mountains, such as the States of Nuevo Leon, Veracruz, Colima, and Chiapas, which have ecological conditions similar to those of the known localities. Variety bonetii grows in the same substrata as the type variety, mainly on humus, but only in forests with <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus montezumae) and sacred fir (Abies religiosa), between [...] elevation; it has not been recorded from Hartweg's pine forests. Also known only from Mexico, in the states of Mexico and Morelos, and in the Federal District, P.aztecorum var. bonetii usually fruits from August to November. According to Guzmán, P.aztecorum should be of conservation concern owing to loss of its natural habitat.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{reported}} by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1956 as {{a variety of}} Psilocybe mexicana before he officially described it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the Nahua people also called Aztecs, P.aztecorum {{may have been one}} of the sacred mushroom species, or teonanácatl (A Nahuatl word translated variously as [...] "sacred mushroom" [...] or [...] "flesh of the gods"), reported in the codices of 16th-century Spanish chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the Popocatépetl region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety P.aztecorum var. bonetii has smaller spores than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus montezumae) and sacred fir (Abies religiosa). P.aztecorum may be distinguished from similar temperate species such as P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis by their ranges, and by differences in the morphology of microscopic structures like cystidia.|$|E
5000|$|On lower slopes are farmlands which grow mostly field [...] "dent" [...] {{corn and}} forests which {{transition}} from alders and {{various types of}} oak to <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pines</b> and sacred firs with increasing elevation. The upper slopes are zacatonal. The summit is covered by snow {{part of the year}} and is considered to be the coldest location in Tlaxcala. On the lower slopes the climate is mild year round, but rainy during the summer months. The soils consist of crushed volcanic rock and sand with an underlying layer of clay and sand called tepetate at an average depth of about a meter. The dark and porous forest soils were formed from volcanic ash. From La Malinche streams flow in all directions forming small gorges in places which fill and run rapidly when torrential rains occur. At the base of the mountain emerge many springs, some of drinkable water, and others of thermal water heated in the volcano's interior.|$|R
5000|$|The {{imperial}} woodpecker prefers open montane forests {{made up of}} Durango, Mexican white, loblolly and <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pines,</b> as well as oak, usually between 2100 and 2700 meters above sea level. Most records are from elevations of 1,920-3,050 m, but there are records as low as 1,675 m. It feeds mainly on bark scaled from dead pine trees and feeding on the insect larvae found underneath. There are many reports of more than four individuals, and this grouping behaviour {{may be related to}} its foraging specialisation. Breeding has been recorded between February and June, and probably 1-4 eggs are laid. A mated pair requires a very large area of untouched mature forest to survive, approximately 26 km2; outside the breeding season, the birds are reported to form small groups of up to a dozen individuals and move about a wide area, apparently in response to the availability of food. [...] The main food source, beetle larvae in snags, is probably distributed in patches and peaks within a short period of time. Consequently, feeding-sites are probably best exploited by [...] "nomadic" [...] groups. If operating in groups of seven or eight individuals, the minimum area of old-growth forest for a group is 98 km2.|$|R
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to Pinus montezumae (<b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine)</b> , differing from it in the shorter leaves, black (not brown) and smaller cones; it replaces <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine</b> at high altitudes, and often hybridises with it where they meet at middle altitudes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pine}} forests, <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus montezumae) is {{generally}} predominant, with smooth-bark Mexican pine (P. pseudostrobus) predominant in more humid areas, and Hartweg's pine (P. hartwegii) and P. tecote in dry areas with shallow soils.|$|E
5000|$|Pinus devoniana {{is closely}} related to Pinus montezumae (the <b>Montezuma</b> <b>Pine).</b> [...] These species are {{sometimes}} difficult to distinguish, while hybrids probably occur. The cones are especially variable. Overall, both foliage and cones are larger in Pinus devoniana.|$|E
50|$|The Achamore Gardens {{are owned}} by the Heritage Trust, and {{are open to the}} public. The mild climate of the Inner Hebrides, and the {{microclimate}} of the gardens, allows an unusual range of plants to flourish. The gardens include specimens of southern rātā from New Zealand, <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine</b> from Central America, Puya alpestris from the Andes, and Wollemia nobilis from Australia.|$|E
50|$|Pinus montezumae, {{known as}} the <b>Montezuma</b> <b>pine,</b> is a species of conifer in the family Pinaceae.It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it is known as ocote. The tree grows about 35 m high and 80 cm in diameter; {{occasionally}} it may reach a height of 40 m and diameter of 1 m. It has a round crown. The bark is dark brown-grayish.|$|E
50|$|Habitat {{information}} for the northern population is scant, with pine, oak, and Arbutus (probably Arizona Madrone, A. arizonica) trees being mentioned. Better details are available for the more extensively studied southern population. The dominant bunchgrass species are Festuca amplissima, Peruvian feather grass (Stipa ichu), a muhly grass (Muhlenbergia affinis), and Muhlenbergia macroura. Small woods of <b>Montezuma</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus montezumae) and (probably) Lumholtz' Pine (P. lumholtzii) occur on elevated terrain.|$|E
