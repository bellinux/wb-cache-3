The IPC by this time was taking the Iraqi government very seriously and made some huge concessions. They agreed to increase oil production substantially and also increase the price of its crude oil in certain areas. They also offered an advance payment on royalties.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of the species used for fine feathers, {{many of which are}} now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|It was Blue Byte's {{desire to}} improve upon any {{aspects of the}} first game which they felt didn't work which led to Thomas Häuser {{becoming}} project manager. When the first game was in development, Häuser was newly employed by Blue Byte, and had done quality assurance work on it.

However, they had been impressed with his ideas, and, when the second game was greenlit, they suggested he apply his ideas to this game. This ultimately led to Häuser, a programmer by trade, working as the lead designer on the sequel.|$|E

Although Hogfields is only 4-year school, the series is divided into 7 parts according to original HP series. The author manages that by letting Garry fail exams in first book and making the tournament in fourth book take place during summer camp. To date, there are four complete books - Garry Poker and the Blue Ace of Spades, Garry Poker and his Blissful Years of Secrets, Garry Poker and the Prisoner of Az-Cardan, Garry Poker and the Goblet of Putrefy and several chapters of the fifth available in Czech, but the author <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of names in English for further translations.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{year after}} {{completing}} his first string quintet, Dvořák completed his String Quartet No. 1 in A major, Op. 2, {{the first of his}} fourteen string quartets. For some time Dvořák was very tentative in his approach to quartets. In the 1880s Dvořák <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of compositions he had destroyed, which lists two quartets and 2 other quartets. He may well have destroyed the scores, but only after the individual instrumental parts had been copied out. The number of errors in the parts makes it highly unlikely that he actually had them played. The quartets numbered 2 to 4 were probably composed between 1868 and 1870 and show the strong influence of the music of Richard Wagner. Dvořák kept the manuscripts of these quartets but did not give them opus numbers. They have numbers B.17, B.18, and B.19 in the Burghauser catalog. An Andante religioso from his fourth quartet was used five years later in his second string quintet Op. 77, as a second movement named Intermezzo: Nocturne, making this initially a five-movement composition, although he later withdrew this second movement, and later still reworked it variously, resulting in the Nocturne for Strings in B major, Op. 40 (B. 47). The two Quartets he wrote in 1873 (number 5, B37 and number 6, B40) show a stronger sense of form.|$|E

500|$|While {{characters}} {{are in a}} constant state of flux—constantly changing names, occupations, and physical attributes—a recurring set of core characters, or character types (what Norris dubs [...] "ciphers"), are discernible. During the composition of Finnegans Wake, Joyce used signs, or so-called [...] "sigla”, rather than names to designate these character amalgams or types. In a letter to his Maecenas, Harriet Shaw Weaver (March 1924), Joyce <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of these sigla. For those who argue for the existence of distinguishable characters, the book focuses on the Earwicker family, which consists of father, mother, twin sons and a daughter.|$|E

However, historian of medicine Owsei Temkin argues that Aristotle {{had in fact}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of melancholics and had only associated Heracles with the [...] "Sacred Disease". Taxil goes on to add his own names: Roman Emperor Caligula, Drusus (tribune of the Roman people), Muhammad, and Petrarch.

500|$|Through his research, Franklin {{was first}} to prove the {{electrical}} principal of conservation of charge in 1747. Franklin wrote detailed letters and documents about his experiments with the electrostatic machine and Leyden jars. In 1749, Franklin <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of several ways in which lightning was similar to electricity. He concluded that lightning was essentially nothing more than giant electric sparks, similar to the sparks from the static charges produced by his electrostatic machine. He referred to static electricity as [...] "electric fire", [...] "electric matter, or [...] "electric fluid." [...] The term [...] "electric fluid" [...] was based off {{the idea that a}} jar could be filled and refilled when it became empty. That led to the revolutionary idea of [...] "electrical fire" [...] as a type of motion or current flow rather than a type of explosion.|$|E

500|$|Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed Salai or Il Salaino ("The Little Unclean One" [...] i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's {{household}} in 1490. After only a year, Leonardo <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of his misdemeanours, calling him [...] "a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton", {{after he had}} made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes. Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years. Salai executed a number of paintings {{under the name of}} Andrea Salai, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo [...] "taught him a great deal about painting", his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as Marco d'Oggiono and Boltraffio. In 1515, he painted a nude version of the Mona Lisa, known as Monna Vanna. Salai owned the Mona Lisa {{at the time of his}} death in 1524, and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{released}} his fourth full-length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004.

With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track [...] "The Past Recedes". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, [...] "These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of all the songs I had and they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had. In the midst of doing that, I was writing some of my best songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Newcomer {{conceived}} Joust as a [...] "flying game" [...] with cooperative two-player gameplay; however, he did {{not wish}} to emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like Asteroids and Defender. To that end, Newcomer <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of things that could fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, he chose birds, believing that they would have a wide appeal. Newcomer also felt that birds were a good fit as he was familiar with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds. To further increase his understanding, Newcomer went to the library to study mythology. He felt that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird. The first choice was an eagle, but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded the designer. Instead, Newcomer chose an ostrich because he thought a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle. To differentiate {{between the first and second}} player characters, the developers picked a stork, believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players. Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies, believing that they would be recognizably evil. Anghelo created concept art of the characters as guidance for further design.|$|E
