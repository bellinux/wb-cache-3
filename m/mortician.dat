5|$|Tony Todd, {{who played}} Candyman in the 1992 film Candyman, was cast as <b>mortician</b> William Bludworth. Morgan {{initially}} wanted Todd {{for the role}} because he felt his deep voice would give the film an eerie tone.|$|E
5|$|After Tod dies in a freak freak accident, {{they go to}} {{the morgue}} to see his body and find <b>mortician</b> William Bludworth. Bludworth {{explains}} to them Death's design and that they're still in danger. Realizing this, they attempt to rescue the remaining survivors. Following Terry's and Ms. Lewton's deaths, they are successful in saving Carter's life. Unfortunately, only seconds later Billy dies, causing them to realize that if they intervene in someone's death they can save them. Believing himself to be next, Alex withdraws from the group.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Daigo becomes {{comfortable}} with his profession as he completes {{a number of}} assignments and experiences the gratitude of {{the families of the}} deceased. Though he faces social ostracism, Daigo refuses to quit, even after Mika discovers a training DVD in which he plays a corpse and leaves him to return to her parents' home in Tokyo. Daigo's former classmate Yamashita (Tetta Sugimoto) insists that the <b>mortician</b> find a more respectable line of work and, until then, avoids him and his family.|$|E
50|$|Mortuary neglect {{is another}} segment that has {{peculiar}} trends. There are relatively few <b>morticians</b> that just refuse {{to perform their}} duties. However, cases of ethically questionable practices can be easily found. <b>Morticians</b> only preserving visible body parts, incomplete embalming and defrauding families {{are just a few}} examples of reported cases of neglect.|$|R

She was widowed by 1953 and did not remarry during the remaining three decades of her life.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Beck {{wakes up}} in a shallow grave {{in the woods with}} rope burns on her neck and no memory of how she got there. She hitchhikes to her house in Manson, Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a <b>mortician,</b> examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close to bringing about the End times, which will also destroy Manson. During their conversation, Zoe slits her wrists and Malus leaves her body to find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E
50|$|While {{attending}} Richfield High School, Hester {{was one of}} {{the founding}} members of the popular Texas pop rock band, The <b>Morticians.</b> He wrote songs for the group and included them in sets for the band’s sizable revved up audiences. Headed now by guitarist and original founding member, Joe Hall, The <b>Morticians</b> continue to play concerts regularly.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., {{most modern}} day funeral homes are run as family businesses. The {{majority}} of <b>morticians</b> work in small, independent family run funeral homes. The owner usually hires {{two or three}} other <b>morticians</b> to help them. Often, this hired help is in the family, perpetuating the family's ownership. Other firms that were family-owned have been acquired and are operated by large corporations such as Service Corporation International, though such homes usually trade under their pre-acquisition names.|$|R
50|$|A {{woman named}} Marta Arnau Marti dies {{in a car}} crash, after accidentally running over a dog. An orderly wheels Marta's body into a morgue drawer, past a {{mourning}} couple, who a nurse gives a crucifix necklace. The orderly overhears two workers autopsying a pair of male bodies, looks in on them out of curiosity, and leaves {{when one of the}} <b>morticians</b> (who is disturbingly enthused by his duties) glares at him. The <b>morticians</b> complete their work on the dead men, and while one leaves, the other remains, and brings in Marta's body.|$|R

25|$|Voris {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California but was raised in Aptos, and later Santa Cruz (where he {{attended}} high school). He briefly considered {{a career as a}} <b>mortician,</b> but instead decided to enroll in Salinas Junior College, receiving his associate degree there in 1939. As a youngster, Voris (whose hobby was building model airplanes out of balsa wood and tissue paper) was thrilled by the exploits of Eddie Rickenbacker and other World War I aces, and would spend hours watching the big planes come into Mines Field (Los Angeles Airport).|$|E
25|$|Doughty knew {{almost from}} the {{beginning}} of her work in the death industry that she wanted to change attitudes about death, {{and find a way to}} offer alternative funeral arrangements. After one year at the crematory, Doughty attended Cypress College's mortuary science program, and graduated as a licensed <b>mortician,</b> though in California she could have obtained a license by passing a test without attending mortuary college. She founded The Order of the Good Death, an association of like-minded death professionals, along with artists, writers, and academics who shared her goals of reforming Western attitudes about death, funerals, and mourning.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} about the identity of Martin's murderer were suggested by locals. These included a <b>mortician</b> from Wyoming County, a businessman's son who left the area soon after the murder, a local assistant pastor, {{a teacher at the}} Wilkes-Barre Business College, and a local teenager who had a crush on Martin. Two men who had attempted to attack a 16-year-old girl from Hanover Township, Luzerne County, were also investigated. Some investigators believed that due to the killer's familiarity with the area's terrain, the killer must have been a local. More recently, {{it has been suggested that}} the killer was actually a non-local serial killer.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984 <b>Morticians</b> MC {{was formed}} {{and by the}} early 1990s, there were many {{motorcycle}} clubs across Scandinavia. In 1992, the <b>Morticians</b> and Hells Angels, {{who had been on}} good terms until then, became rivals as both clubs transformed from bike enthusiasts into criminal organizations. The <b>Morticians</b> then changed their name to Undertakers MC and became allies of the Bandidos, whose only European chapter was based in Marseille, France at that point. In 1993, the Undertakers merged with the Bandidos to become Bandidos MC Denmark. In 1994 the Hells Angels tried to prevent Morbids MC from growing into an established biker gang and potential rival in Sweden. The Morbids then joined an alliance with the Bandidos, who backed-up their prospect club. Outlaws MC also joined with the Bandidos in Norway. This eventually led to a drug-trade war between the two most powerful outlaw biker gangs in Scandinavia, the Hells Angels and the Bandidos, which the police described as a [...] "deadly game" [...] to prove 'who's the toughest'. Many of the port cities in Scandinavia, particularly Copenhagen, were used to smuggle drugs in from Spain and the Netherlands.|$|R
500|$|Thirty-nine days later, the {{survivors}} attend {{a memorial service}} for the victims. That night, Tod is killed when a chain reaction causes him to be strangled in his bathtub. His death is [...] deemed a suicide; however, Alex does not believe that Tod killed himself. He and Clear sneak into the funeral home to see Tod's body, where they meet <b>mortician</b> William Bludworth, who tells them that they have ruined Death's plan, and Death is now claiming the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane. The next day, Alex and Clear discuss what the <b>mortician</b> said at a cafe. Alex believes that if they look out for omens they can cheat Death again, although Clear is skeptical. They encounter the rest of {{the survivors}}; and when Carter provokes Alex, Terry storms off in anger and is suddenly killed by a speeding bus.|$|E
500|$|Kenny {{is turned}} into a zombie after a <b>mortician</b> accidentally knocks Worcestershire sauce, a {{fermented}} liquid condiment, into his embalming fluid.

500|$|Alongside How to Murder Your Wife, {{there were}} two further {{releases}} for Terry-Thomas in 1965: Strange Bedfellows, in which he played {{the part of a}} <b>mortician,</b> and Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. In the latter, he played Sir Percy Ware-Armitage, a character the film historian Andrew Spicer calls [...] "a cartoon version" [...] of his usual persona in a [...] "bloated mid-Atlantic comed". In the film, Terry-Thomas appeared again with Sykes, an experience Sykes later described as magical. The roles of Ware-Armitage and his sidekick were written especially for Terry-Thomas and Sykes {{at the behest of the}} director Ken Annakin.|$|E
40|$|The South Carolina Board of Funeral Service {{publishes a}} {{newsletter}} {{of interest to}} funeral directors and <b>morticians.</b> Some topics covered are {{a message from the}} president of the South Carolina Board of Funeral Service, board meeting dates, information about new members, fines for inspection violations and continuing education...|$|R

5000|$|Mortuary science {{students}} are also subject to disease.

500|$|... is a 2008 Japanese drama film {{directed}} by Yōjirō Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryōko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows {{a young man}} who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a —a traditional Japanese ritual <b>mortician.</b> He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work.|$|E
500|$|Motoki {{studied the}} art of encoffinment {{first-hand}} from a <b>mortician,</b> and assisted in an encoffining ceremony; he later stated that the experience imbued him with [...] "a sense of mission... to try to use as much human warmth as I could to restore [...] to a lifelike presence for presentation to her family". Motoki then drilled himself by practising on his talent manager until {{he felt he had}} mastered the procedure, one whose intricate, delicate movements he compared to those of the Japanese tea ceremony. Takita attended funeral ceremonies to understand the feelings of bereaved families, while Yamazaki never participated in the encoffinment training. [...] Motoki also learned how to play a cello for the earlier parts of the film.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{idealization}} of the [...] {{as presented}} in the film. In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that [...] "the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen". The one corpse {{that had not been}} found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim. Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there [...] "is nothing lower on the social scale than the <b>mortician,</b> and {{the truth of the matter}} is that [...] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse".|$|E
5000|$|A man {{is walking}} {{home with his}} girlfriend when he is {{suddenly}} struck by a meteorite in the head. When the <b>morticians</b> remove the object from his head, he rises from the dead. He's {{not the only one}} who [...] "rises" [...] — and they seem to have a plan now...|$|R

50|$|<b>Morticians</b> may {{ensure that}} all jewelry, {{including}} wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed.
