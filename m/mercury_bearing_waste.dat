40|$|This {{reference}} contains {{guidance for}} responding to a mercury spill, and how to recycle <b>mercury</b> <b>bearing</b> products. This document also contains specific recommendations for the following types of products: batteries, fluorescent lights, high intensity discharge lamps (HID) lamps, ballasts, thermostats, switches, float switches, sump pumps, silent light switches, washing machines, tilt switches, freezers, flow meters, manometers, barometers, vacuum gauges, flame sensors on gas appliances, rubber flooring containing mercury, and mercury accumulation in sanitary drains. This reference also contains a general checklist of products found to routinely contain mercury. Mercury is a dangerous element in the environment today. It can cause serious health problems such as neurological and kidney damage. Mercury is found in many products that end up in landfills and incinerators allowing the mercury to re-enter the environment and pollute drinking water and contaminate the food chain. The following information is a helpful guide to identify products that contain mercury switches and thermostats.

50|$|On February 17, 1876 {{construction}} of a new tower began by a contractor called Mendeville. Works were interrupted in October 1878 and terminated on May 21, 1879. A second auction was presented on September 18, 1879 and the tower was completed in July 1881. On December 1, 1881 the new light was moved to the new tower. This third tower was a cylindrical stone tower, either 62 m, or 59 m (63 m above sea level) tall. The light was electrical with 300mm lens, and the characteristic used was three white flashes, separated by a red glow until 1902 when it was replaced by the current white flash every 5 seconds.

50|$|Mercuryville {{was founded}} in 1874, after cinnabar, a <b>mercury</b> <b>bearing</b> ore, was {{discovered}} in eastern Sonoma County around 1870. Mercury is a dense liquid metal {{that can be used}} to separate gold from other less dense materials and the California Gold Rush, which had begun only 20 years earlier, increased the demand and price of mercury to $1 a pound, making extracting the ore profitable, and prompting a short-lived mercury rush in the 1870s. When the price of ore dropped within a few years, most mines were quickly abandoned. In its heyday, the town had eight bars that were notorious for fights, and a single church. Mercury was also mined in other areas of Sonoma County at the time, including mines near Guerneville.|$|R
40|$|A high {{priority}} {{has been given}} to investigating the vitrification of three specific nuclear wastes in iron phosphate glasses (IPG). These wastes, which were recommended by the Tank Focus Area (TFA) group of Hanford, are poorly suited for vitrification in the currently DOE-approved borosilicate (BS) glasses. They include (1) a sodium <b>bearing</b> <b>waste</b> (SBW) at INEEL, (2) a high chrome waste (HCW) at Hanford, and (3) a high sodium/sulfate waste (HSSW), also known as low activity waste (LAW) at Hanford.

40|$|Many {{substances}} {{are known}} to inhibit cellular respiration. Relatively non-specific inhibitors are generally effective {{in proportion to the}} degree of penetration into the cell. However, the mechanism of action of cyanide is specific; cyanide irreversibly binds the iron group of cytochrome oxidase preventing transfer of electrons to oxygen. Hence, microbial sewage treatment processes may be severely disrupted by influx of cyanide <b>bearing</b> <b>wastes.</b> Cyanide toxicity was studied using a biological oxygen demand (BOD) system which was not oxygen limited. Lag times prior to exponential oxygen uptake were directly related to cyanide concentration. Each increase of 2. 5 x 10 - 5 moles/ 1 KCN extended the lag period 10 to 15 hours. No oxygen up-take was exhibited in 300 hours at 5. 0 x 10 - 4 moles/ 1 KCN with seed concentrations of 0. 5 mg/ 1 (wet weight). However, at 2. 0 mg/ 1 seed, cultures containing 5. 0 x 10 - 4 KCN reached plateau oxygen demand in 145 hours, indicating the importance of KCN-seed ratio on degree of inhibition. Batch cultures were used to study acclimation of sewage treatment microorganisms to KCN. Three experimental systems were used: aerobic, anaerobic with nitrate as an exogenous hydrogen acceptor, and anaerobic without exogenous hydrogen acceptors. The completely anaerobic system showed the greatest degree of acclimation (relative to control) to KCN based on glucose and soluble carbon removal and cell mass increase. However, the cyanide acclimated aerobic system showed the greatest overall rates of carbon removal suggesting greatest utility for treatment of cyanide <b>bearing</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R

However, landing conditions at the site meant the closest location for landing the materials was about [...] to the east, at Christies Bay. A jetty and a tramway were constructed, and the materials were drawn by horses from the landing location. The climate and the grade meant only two round trips could be made each day, and in addition construction could only be carried out on the dry season, from April to November. As a result, construction took three years, completing in June 1917. Though the lantern was installed and ready to be lit, an earthquake hit the tower in August 1917. Though the structure was not damaged, [...] of mercury were lost from the <b>mercury</b> <b>bearing</b> pedestal bath. The lighthouse was finally officially lit on 15 September 1917.|$|R
40|$|The {{disposition}} of INEEL radioactive wastes {{is now under}} a Settlement Agreement between the DOE and the State of Idaho. The Settlement Agreement requires that existing liquid sodium <b>bearing</b> <b>waste</b> (SBW), and other liquid waste inventories be treated by December 31, 2012. This agreement also requires that all HLW, including calcined waste, be disposed or made road ready to ship from the INEEL by 2035. Sodium <b>bearing</b> <b>waste</b> (SBW) is produced from decontamination operations and HLW from reprocessing of SNF. SBW and HLW are radioactive and hazardous mixed waste; the radioactive constituents are regulated by DOE and the hazardous constituents are regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Calcined waste, a dry granular material, is produced in the New Waste Calcining Facility (NWCF). Two primary waste tank storage locations exist at the ICPP: Tank Farm Facility (TFF) and the Calcined Solids Storage Facility (CSSF). The TFF has the following underground storage tanks: four 18, 400 -gallon tanks (WM 100 - 102, WL 101); four 30, 000 -gallon tanks (WM 103 - 106); and eleven 300, 000 + gallon tanks. This includes nine 300, 000 -gallon tanks (WM 182 - 190) and two 318, 000 gallon tanks (WM 180 - 181). This study analyzes the closure and subsequent use of the eleven 300, 000 + gallon tanks.

Three alternatives were identified to be top performers: Risk-based Calcination, MACT to WIPP Calcination and Cesium Ion Exchange. A dual-path through early Conceptual design is recommended for MACT to WIPP Calcination and Cesium Ion Exchange since Risk-based Calcination does not require design. If calcination alternatives are not considered based on giving Type of Processing criteria significantly greater weight, the CsIX/TRUEX alternative follows CsIX in ranking. However, since CsIX/TRUEX shares common uncertainties with CsIX, reasonable backups, which follow in ranking, are the TRUEX and UNEX alternatives.
