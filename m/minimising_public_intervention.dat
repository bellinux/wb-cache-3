40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>intervention</b> in {{the banking}} sector takes three main forms: {{prudential}} regulation, especially with the Basel II ratio for adequacy of a bank's own funds for their exposure to risk; insuring deposits, the goal {{of which is to}} ensure a minimum level of protection for depositors and savers in order to avoid a run on banks; and control and supervision of banks by public authorities, which ensures that the rules are applied properly. Intervention by central banks, through their monetary policy and as lenders of last resort, constitutes the fourth means of regulating the banking system, and the main form of intervention in financial markets. Central banks intervene in order to ensure the stability of financial systems. The financial crisis has shown that traditional modes of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the financial system are ineffective and insufficient. Before analyzing the principles and limits of these forms of <b>public</b> <b>intervention,</b> we examine cases of exceptional intervention and support to banks by public powers during the crisis.

40|$|Spatial {{concentration}} of economic activities {{is one of}} the most salient features of economic development. The almost parallel urge by policymakers to counteract such a trend through public polices is also striking. This is not only reserved to those countries, especially in Europe, which have a long tradition of <b>public</b> <b>intervention.</b> To a lesser extent, the United States has (for example during the New Deal period) put into place policies aimed at correcting uneven patterns of regional development. <b>Public</b> <b>intervention</b> is usually defended on either efficiency or equity grounds. In the case of economic geography, a justification in terms of efficiency implies identifying the various market failures, specific to the issue of space, that make the optimal economic geography differ from the one induced solely by market forces. Although one also needs to show that <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> will make a better job than market forces, the identification of market failures is a necessary first step to justify <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> on efficiency grounds. Whereas this type of analysis has been standard for <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the fields of education, technology, pollution, etc., the counterpart for regional policies is much less developed. There are two ways forward: the first is to analyse how some 'standard' market failures are modified by the introduction of space and distance and how in turn, this should affect the definition of public policies; the second is to understand how space and distance themselves can be at the origin of market failures...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} {{increased}} {{focus on the}} methods in which <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> stabilize agricultural markets.

However, the efficiency of such an instrument is still being discussed and has not yet been explored in the context of imperfect information.

While the optimal size of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> is shown to depend on the natural influence of economic development on longevity and on the extra-productivity of public spendings in terms of longevity, its optimal structure is determined by (1) differences in the productivity of each public policy; (2) how economic expansion would influence each aspect of longevity without public in-tervention; (3) the dependence of each longevity aspect on past achievements. In the presence of various competing effects, it is concluded that the optimal long-run <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> cannot, given the complementarity of different policies under standard additive expected lifetime utility, be strongly unbalanced...|$|R

Our results suggest that <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> reinforce the existing differences between center and periphery. Specifically, public services and utilities and social programs are allocated more intensively in districts with higher human development levels. These findings call for a more careful consideration of distribution of societal resources and effectiveness of public programs and policies.

I argue that intervention was justified in the past, when there were just a few channels and when advertising was the sole source of commercial funds. However, the advent of subscription television overcomes many of the market failures that once existed. Moreover, asymmetric treatment of broadcasters acts to distort the incentives of commercial broadcasters. Finally, viewers have an increasing ability to avoid unappealing, but perhaps socially desirable, content, which further weakens the case for <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the market...|$|R

In fact, <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in broadcasting markets has been particularly justified when advertising is the only method of commercial provision. As suggested by Coase (1966), {{in the absence of}} subscription television, public policy can increase social welfare by improving the quality and diversity of the available programming. A basic ingredient of the justification of this public regulation is usually associated with the need of diminishing the nuisance of excessive advertising. The rapid technological advances in the broadcasting and communication industries have enhanced the debate on the role of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in broadcasting industries (see, among others, Armstrong 2005). Moreover, this debate has become particularly relevant as a result of recent controversial policy decisions within the EU. Particularly remarkable is the decision by the public TV platform in France (followed more recently by its counterpart in Spain) to eliminate advertising as a method of financing. 1 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Orthodox {{economics}} {{rests on}} the belief that if markets were fully competitive, there would be general efficiency. The current financial malfunctions, accordingly, would not result from free competition, but rather from insufficient competition. This statement is strong, for it rests on a sophisticated conceptual framework within which there is no dysfunction when perfect competition prevails. But it is also strongly unrealistic, for it rejects <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> even when markets obviously lost there bearings in the storm. In fact much of those who referred to the orthodox approach before the financial crisis, are now, inconsistently, claiming for <b>public</b> <b>interventions.</b> This short paper argues that there is a consistent way of thinking about necessary <b>public</b> <b>interventions.</b> Indeed, John Maynard Keynes focus on fundamental uncertainty consequences questioned the supposed virtues of competition and offered the most elaborated alternative as for thinking about the current turnmoils and designing the necessary stabilizers.

The relationship between social capital and violence has been rarely modeled in the literature and, when so, it has been found not significant. The study finds otherwise, on the basis of simultaneous econometric models with data from Colombia. Interpersonal trust {{is the single most important}} determinant to reduce victimization, while victimization levels cut back interpersonal trust and increasingly so only after some threshold is surpassed. Perceptions in the community of an effective public presence both reduce victimization and increase interpersonal trust, but the magnitude of these effects is rather small. Other <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> (civic campaigns and improving the performance of public institutions) in crime-ridden communities also have a positive impact on both victimization and interpersonal trust levels.

40|$|Abstract Traditional Political Economy models {{typically}} imply {{a strong}} relationship between income inequality and <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in redistributive policies. Empirical evidence suggests that this may hold true only for certain kinds of policies, for instance cash transfers or education, {{but in the case}} of other policies with redistributive effects such as social security and some publicly provided private goods this may not hold true. Abstract In this paper I develop a method to derive the sign of the relationship between income inequality and degree of <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in education in a Probabilistic Voting model in which the consumers-voters are also allowed to choose other forms of redistribution. Abstract I show that the relationship between income inequality and governmental intervention implied in the traditional literature is mainly a result of the restrictive assumptions of those models. Abstract I also show that this method can deliver sharp predictions even in presence of those non-convexities in individual preferences that are usually described as a feature induced by public provision of education in the traditional literature in Public Economics. Abstract I argue that the relationship between income inequality and <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in schooling is a natural and promising field in which the tool proposed can be useful for empirical purposes and that can help to better explain some patterns described in the literature about <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in education. ...|$|R
