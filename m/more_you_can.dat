500|$|Ford {{sponsored}} legislation {{defining a}} hate crime [...] "as an assault, intimidation or threat based on 'actual or perceived' race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin and sexual orientation." [...] He also introduced several bills concerning gay rights in lodging, hospital visitation rights and partnerships. His partnership bill would provide for civil unions in South Carolina. The effort was judged by state senator Mike Fair as predetermined to fail, but Ford cited the Democratic National Committee's platform on the issue and argued that Barack Obama's election showed that a change should be attempted. Even if passed, the measure would be unenforceable, due to a constitutional amendment banning unions similar to marriage in South Carolina. Ford worked to outlaw profanity and saggy pants and to keep music from minors that is [...] "profane, vulgar, lewd, lascivious or indecent." [...] Ford argued he did not expect these proposals to be approved but {{wanted to start a}} discussion specifically targeting young African American men's fashion as well as rap music. He stated: [...] "You don't have to emulate prisoners no <b>more.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> emulate somebody like Barack Obama." ...|$|E

Using mirrors, glass and windows to shoot through, he explains, [...] " [...] something I’d like to do all the time, but particularly in a movie that’s all about lies, and manipulation and misunderstandings. The <b>more</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> warp the frame a little bit, the more it speaks towards what’s going on". The film was shot hand-held, digitally with multiple cameras, often with a RED Epic, and used a Lensbaby Composer with Double Glass lens on a Canon 7D to differentiate certain scenes.|$|E

2500|$|The Princess {{began her}} work with AIDS victims in the 1980s. In 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London. She was not averse to making {{physical}} contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way. Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient {{in one of her}} early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition. Diana noted: [...] "HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it. What's <b>more,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys." [...] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in [...] "something more pleasant". In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C. She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust. In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK. As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992. She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research.|$|E
