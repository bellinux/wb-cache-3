5|$|The Dayak {{people of}} Borneo are renowned for their solo sword dances, which show {{the skill of}} a young man using a sharp mandau. Also on the island of Borneo one finds the Lotud, an {{indigenous}} ethnic group residing in Sabah. The Lotud are well known for their very colourful costumes and their dances, one of which is the Bakanjar, a war-like dance with a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a sword and a shield, originally performed to portray the sword fight and heroic exploits of the headhunting days.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{numerous}} human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage {{in a wide range}} of activities; some appear to enjoy sensory pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with nature. In the middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the eroticism of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of spiritual transition or a playground of corruption.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most of the comments Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment featured in this episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an individual that, due to a secret experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} mysterious <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a briefcase, walking down a futuristic hallway. As the music starts, the girls start dancing in a dark office with lights {{flashing}} in the background. As the chorus starts, the girls start shooting laser beams from their fingers, and dance to the song. The girls teleport into the futuristic labyrinth, looking for {{the man with the}} briefcase. Inter cut scenes features the group dancing and singing to the song, whilst in several different hallways. During the second chorus, the girls continue to search for him without any luck. The man enters the office, sits down on a sofa, with a helmet piece of shiny–coloured plastic on his head. The girls find the office entrance, with CCTV footage catching them enter the room.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.|$|E

5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E

25|$|Holy Week in Guatemala {{incorporates}} processions {{with images}} of saints carried on huge wooden platforms. The heavy andas are held by the locals, both men and women, who are frequently in purple robes. The procession is led by a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a container of incense accompanied by a small horn and flute band. Intricate carpets (alfombras) line the streets during the week’s celebration. Easter processions begin at sunrise and everyone comes to join the festivities.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} human sacrifice in the Indian subcontinent {{dates back to}} the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. An Indus seal from Harappa depicts the upside-down nude female figure with legs outspread and a plant issuing from her womb. The reverse side of the seal depicts a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a sickle and a woman seated on the ground in a posture of prayer. Many scholars interpret this scene as a human sacrifice in honor of the Mother-Goddess, although many historians doubt it.|$|E

However, Ligachyov lost his posts in 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, resigning from his political career at the 28th Party Congress. Ligachyov was critical of Yeltsin and Gorbachev to an extent, although he is often held as most remarkable for being Gorbachev's primary critic.|$|E

25|$|Retro-camp {{fashion is}} an example of modern hipsters {{employing}} camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions. The classic camp yard ornament is the pink plastic flamingo. The yard globe, garden gnome, wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a lantern (called a lawn jockey) and ceramic statues of white-tailed deer are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, {{the celebrated}} scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, {{discovered}} a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route, and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft. Both presidents were unharmed and the summit was held. Díaz was re-elected in 1910, but alleged electoral fraud forced him into exile in France and sparked the 1910 Mexican Revolution, initially led by Francisco I. Madero.|$|E
25|$|The Virginia State Flag {{represents}} the Commonwealth of Virginia’s love of freedom. It was commemorated on a 13-cent stamp {{as a part}} of the American Bicentennial Issue: Flag Series on February 23, 1976. It was the first pane with fifty different stamps ever issued. The design adopted in 1861 is deep blue field containing a circular white center bordered with a garland and the Latin motto “Sic Semper Tyrannis”, Thus always to tyrants. The vignette is of two figures, both in ancient warrior garb, acting out the motto. The woman, Virtue, represents Virginia, the fallen tyrant is a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a scourge and chain.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} Chinese {{language}} {{does not use}} an alphabet it was usually necessary {{for a set of}} type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, President William H. Taft {{agreed to}} meet with Mexican President Porfirio Díaz in El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican {{president}} and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. But the historic summit resulted in serious assassination threats and other security concerns for the then small Secret Service, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, BOI agents, U.S. marshals, and an additional 250 private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, were all called in by Chief John Wilkie to provide added security. On October 16, {{the day of the}} summit, Burnham discovered a <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham signaled a Texas Ranger, Private C.R. Moore, and the two men captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft, preventing the shooting of both Presidents.|$|E
25|$|For a time, Custer's men {{appear to}} have been {{deployed}} by company, in standard cavalry fighting formation—the skirmish line, with every fourth <b>man</b> <b>holding</b> the horses, though this arrangement would have robbed Custer of a quarter of his firepower. Worse, as the fight intensified, many soldiers could have taken to holding their own horses or hobbling them, further reducing the 7th's effective fire. When Crazy Horse and White Bull mounted the charge that broke through the center of Custer's lines, pandemonium may have broken out among the soldiers of Calhoun's command, though Myles Keogh's men seem to have fought and died where they stood. According to some Lakota accounts, many of the panicking soldiers threw down their weapons and either rode or ran towards the knoll where Custer, the other officers, and about 40 men were making a stand. Along the way, the warriors rode them down, counting coup by striking the fleeing troopers with their quirts or lances.|$|E
