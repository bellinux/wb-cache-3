40|$|<b>Migration</b> <b>modelling</b> is a {{cost-efficient}} {{alternative to}} experimental testing when allowed by legislation. For <b>migration</b> <b>modelling,</b> two fundamental {{pieces of information}} are needed: the diffusion coefficient, and the coefficient describing a migrant's partitioning between polymer and food. For the latter, a worst case approach can easily be implemented assuming a high solubility of the migrant in the food. The diffusion coefficient however, depends on several factors, e. g. the molecular weight of the migrant, the temperature, and the matrix (polymer). For the first time, diffusion coefficients were determined in a small scale interlaboratory comparison study, meaning that the data established here can be considered the most reliable values relevant for this purpose available to date. A validation of the <b>migration</b> <b>modelling</b> approach itself was possible as {{it was possible to}} compare reliable experimental migration data on one side and predicted migration data on the other. The experimental and predicted data of materials fit together quite well. Of the 28 migration values predicted, 93 % were in the range of ± 40 % compared to the experimental migration values. Deviations observed are likely to originate from analytical variations or in different solubilities of the migrants in oil (applied during specific migration testing) and food simulants (applied during diffusion testing) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Multi-tiered storage systems {{today are}} {{integrating}} Solid State Disks (SSD) {{on top of}} traditional rotational hard disks for performance enhancement due to the significant IO improvements in SSD technology. It is widely recognized that automated data migration between SSD and HDD plays {{a critical role in}} effective integration of SSD into multi-tiered storage systems. Furthermore, effective data migration has to take into account of application specific workload characteristics, deadlines, and IO profiles. An important and interesting challenge for automated data migration in multi-tiered storage systems is how to fully release the power of data migration while guaranteeing the migration deadline is critical to maximizing the performance of SSD-enabled multi-tiered storage system. In this paper, we present an adatpive lookahead data <b>migration</b> <b>model</b> that can incorporate application specific characteristics and I/O profiles as well as workload deadlines.

40|$|The {{paper is}} of a methodological character. It {{discusses}} methods for the quantitative <b>modelling</b> of <b>migration</b> {{as the most}} inclusive variables of population movements. Two approaches to creating <b>migration</b> <b>models</b> are outlined: the demographic and the demometric modelling approach. The paper explains the long-term determinants of migration through time sections, and the interdependence between migration movements and the selected variables that influence them. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} <b>modelling</b> <b>migration</b> {{with the help of the}} demometric models. The theoretic approach to the problem of specifying demometric <b>migration</b> <b>models</b> (selection of variables for a given model, defining possible links and dependencies among them, and the selection of a possible analytic form of the demometric <b>migration</b> <b>model)</b> is also discussed. Demographic and demometric methods for producing <b>migration</b> <b>models</b> can be mutually distinguished by the ease of their application, as well as by their reliance and objectivity, and therefore they give different results. Demometric <b>migration</b> <b>models</b> have the following advantages: simplicity and applicability in a large number of cases, consideration of all the relevant variables effecting migration, the possibility of determining the individual effects of the variables within their combined system, their easy interpretation and numerical analysis, and the fact that prediction on the basis of such models can be made directly.

40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is {{nowadays}} {{the packaging}} material {{of choice for}} beverages. Therefore knowledge about the diffusion coefficients at a certain temperature or activation energies of diffusion of potential migrants in the polymer is of interest, especially for {{the definition of the}} basic parameter set for <b>migration</b> <b>modelling</b> of PET. In this study, the diffusion coefficients of acetaldehyde, benzene and tetrahydrofuran in PET bottle materials were determined from kinetic migration experiments at four different temperatures. The activation energies for tetrahydrofuran and benzene were determined to be 106. 8 kJ mol- 1 and 101. 4 kJ mol- 1, respectively. The activation energy for acetaldehyde is significantly lower (75. 7 kJ mol- 1) which is due to the lower molecular weight of this molecule compared to benzene and tetrahydrofuran. The results were compared with literature data of diffusion coefficients of other low molecular weight molecules in PET. From the res ults it is evident that the current migration model with the default modelling parameters for PET does not describe realistically the diffusion coefficients in PET. The migration of small molecules like acetaldehyde will be underestimated whereas higher molecular weight compounds will be overestimated by the current migration model. Whereas the overestimation is useful for compliance evaluation of PET bottles, for more realistic migration calculations, e. g. for exposure estimations, such overestimation is not desirable. Therefore, more accurate modelling parameters should be established. The key parameters for more realistic <b>migration</b> <b>modelling</b> are the activation energies of diffusion in the polymer...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that fault rock capillary properties {{are important in}} controlling the distribution of hydrocarbons in sedimentary basins, and methods exist for predicting the capillary seal capacity of prospect bounding faults. However, fault seal capacity is rarely incorporated into models of hydrocarbon migration. This paper {{presents the results of}} <b>migration</b> <b>modelling</b> of the Oseberg Syd area of the Viking Graben incorporating fault rock capillary properties. Seal capacity is calculated in the model as a function of Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR), i. e. the percentage shale in the sequence moved past a point on a fault. Over 3 000 model realisations were run for different SGR to fault seal capacity relationships and the calculated hydrocarbon distributions were compared with known distributions. Realisations were ranked according to the closeness of fit between model and actual oil-water contacts for 7 traps. The best-fit to all 7 traps was provided by realisations with significant seal capacity at SGR values greater than ca. 0. 2; a value which is in agreement with an independently derived fault-by-fault calibration between SGR and seal capacity. The level of fill calculated for an individual trap is extremely sensitive to minor changes in the seal capacity relationship because it is controlled not only by the seal capacities of the faults that bound the trap, but also by the pattern of fill-spill of upstream traps. This sensitivity to minor changes in seal capacity introduces large uncertainties when fault seal capacity relationships are used in a predictive mode and emphasises the requirement for <b>migration</b> <b>modelling</b> in fault seal prospect evaluation...|$|E

For this purpose, 11 representative acrylic polymers containing five different acrylic monomers (MA, EA, BA, MMA and nBMA) were studied in extensive kinetic migrations experiments in contact with five different contact media (simulants) at three different temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C). The simulants were selected according to the applications: toys were simulated by saliva simulant and articles coming in contact with human skin by sweat simulant. For food contact applications, water (aqueous foods), Miglyol 840 (Sasol, Witten, Germany) (fatty food) and Tenax® (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Munich, Germany) (an adsorbent simulating dry foods) were selected. The diffusion coefficients (D) of the monomers in the polymer as well as partition coefficients between polymer and contact media were derived. It was found that those acrylic polymer materials used for rigid plastics applications exhibit extremely low diffusion behaviour, whereas acrylic polymer resins used for coating applications showed somewhat higher diffusion behaviour but this still at very low rates in comparison with other typical polymers used for the manufacture of food packaging materials. As a result, conservative polymer-specific constants in support of <b>migration</b> <b>modelling</b> were established, and the specifications for the model general applicability were determined and specified.
