5|$|The 1915 Singapore <b>Mutiny,</b> {{also known}} as the 1915 Sepoy <b>Mutiny</b> or the <b>Mutiny</b> of the 5th Light Infantry, was a <b>mutiny</b> {{involving}} up to half of a regiment of 850sepoys (Indian soldiers) against the British in Singapore during the First World War, linked with the 1915 Ghadar Conspiracy. The <b>mutiny,</b> on 15 February 1915, lasted nearly seven days. It resulted in the deaths of eight British officers and soldiers, two Malay officers and one soldier, 14 British civilians, five Chinese and Malay civilians and one German internee before it was finally quelled by British forces and Allied naval detachments.|$|E
5|$|The Meermin slave <b>mutiny</b> {{took place}} in February 1766 and lasted for three weeks. Meermin {{was one of the}} Dutch East India Company's fleet of slave ships. Her final voyage was cut short by the <b>mutiny</b> of her cargo of Malagasy people, who had been sold to Dutch East India Company {{officials}} on Madagascar to be used as company slaves in its Cape Colony in southern Africa. During the <b>mutiny</b> half the ship's crew and almost 30Malagasy lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania <b>Mutiny</b> of 1783 (also {{known as}} the Philadelphia <b>Mutiny)</b> was an anti-government protest by nearly 400 {{soldiers}} of the Continental Army in June 1783. The <b>mutiny,</b> and the refusal of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania to stop it, ultimately resulted in Congress vacating Philadelphia {{and the creation of}} a federal district to serve as the national capital.|$|E

5|$|The Tsentralka, {{the group}} {{plotting}} a <b>mutiny</b> of the Black Sea Fleet, decided on June 25, 1905, that the <b>mutiny</b> should start on Potemkin rather than Rostislav. On June 27, 1905, {{the day of}} the battleship Potemkin <b>mutiny,</b> Rostislav was sailing under the ensign of Vice Admiral Alexander Krieger. Nicholas II ordered Krieger and his superior, fleet commander Grigory Chukhnin, to destroy the rebels by force, but the admirals refrained from shooting. They let the rebels flee to Odessa and later to Romania. Krieger's own crew {{was on the verge of}} open <b>mutiny.</b> On July 2, 1905, a military council held on board Rostislav decided to moor the ships in Odessa, disconnect the engines from the propellers and let the enlisted men walk ashore at will. By the time of the Ochakov <b>mutiny</b> in November 1905, fleet morale had improved and Krieger did not hesitate to fire two 10-inch and fourteen 6-inch shells against the rebels.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mutiny</b> was memorialized {{most famously}} by Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin, {{although}} the French silent film La Révolution en Russe (<b>Mutiny</b> on a Man-of-War in Odessa or Revolution in Odessa, 1905), directed by Ferdinand Zecca or Lucien Nonguet (or both), {{was the first}} film to depict the <b>mutiny,</b> preceding Eisenstein's far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22, with the derelict battleship Dvenadsat Apostolov standing in for the broken-up Potemkin, Eisenstein recast the <b>mutiny</b> into a predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasized their role, and implied that the <b>mutiny</b> failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as Potemkin Stairs), and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed.|$|E
5|$|The period also {{witnessed}} {{a number of}} rebellions starting with the 1806 Vellore <b>Mutiny.</b> The rebellion of Velu Thambi and Paliath Achan and the Poligar Wars were other notable insurrections against the British rule, but the Madras Presidency remained relatively undisturbed by the Sepoy <b>Mutiny</b> of 1857.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of turbulence, in 1965 Mobutu used his {{position}} as ANC Chief of Staff to seize power in the Congo. Although Mobutu succeeded in taking power, his position was soon threatened by the Kisangani <b>Mutinies,</b> {{also known as the}} Stanleyville <b>Mutinies</b> or Mercenaries' <b>Mutinies,</b> which were eventually suppressed.|$|R
50|$|The Hunan Army was {{extensively}} infiltrated by {{the anti}} Qing Gelaohui secret society, who started several <b>mutinies</b> during the Dungan revolt, delaying crucial offensives. Zuo {{put down the}} <b>mutinies</b> and executed those involved.|$|R
25|$|Broadly speaking, these <b>mutinies</b> {{resulted}} in three problems. First, the <b>mutinies</b> were unpredictable and frightening events for any military leader to deal with. Second, they encouraged the troops {{to live off}} the locals, extracting 'free lodgings, and encouraging theft and plunder' which drastically reduced local support for the Spanish cause. Third, the pauses in the campaigns caused by the <b>mutinies</b> allowed the Dutch to recover lost ground each time.|$|R
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the <b>mutiny,</b> a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for <b>mutiny</b> and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the <b>mutiny,</b> with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the <b>mutiny</b> and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the <b>mutiny</b> was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new <b>mutiny</b> in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the <b>mutiny</b> and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new <b>mutiny</b> in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E

500|$|During 1797 {{there was}} {{considerable}} discontent among the seamen of the Royal Navy. This discontent manifested itself at the Nore and at Spithead when {{the greater part of}} the Channel Fleet rose up against their officers. These <b>mutinies</b> were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the <b>mutinies</b> established their own order and kept the ships under [...] "committee" [...] control until their collective demands were met. The mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave.

5|$|By February 1918, {{the crews}} of Sankt Georg {{and several other}} {{warships}} grew weary {{of the war and}} the long periods of inactivity, which led to the Cattaro <b>Mutiny.</b> The <b>mutiny</b> was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg and several other ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In April 1857, 85 {{men of the}} {{regiment}} refused to accept cartridges for their carbines and were tried by court-martial, convicted, and sentenced to up to 10 years' hard labour. After the men were imprisoned, {{the regiment}} freed their jailed comrades and headed to Delhi, where their arrival led to {{the outbreak of the}} Indian <b>Mutiny.</b> Following the events of the <b>mutiny,</b> all the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In Germany and Illyricum, {{the legions}} were in <b>mutiny.</b> In Germany, the legions in <b>mutiny</b> {{were those of}} the Lower Rhine under Aulus Caecina (the V Alaudae, XXI Rapax, I Germanica, and XX Valeria Victrix). The army of the Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii. They had not gotten the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.|$|E
40|$|The <b>mutinies</b> of the Continental Army {{during the}} American Revolution {{threatened}} both {{the integrity of}} the army and the viability of the Revolution itself. They were complex phenomena, stemming from numerous underlying physical and psychological causes. Having slowly developed {{over the course of the}} war, the problems confronting the Continental Army eventually brought it to the breaking point. No less than four major <b>mutinies,</b> involving soldiers or officers, occurred between 1780 - 1783. This essay focuses on the reasons for the <b>mutinies</b> and how the participants justified their actions. It also examines responses from General Washington and other senior officers, and what effects these actions had on the army. Finally, this essay addresses the question of why so few major <b>mutinies</b> occurred given the miserable state of the Continental Army...|$|R

5|$|On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, {{at first}} meeting in {{confidence}} {{but then in}} public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} <b>mutiny</b> was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the <b>mutiny.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 1915 <b>mutiny</b> was a {{watershed}} {{event in the}} way that the British viewed security in their Malayan colonies. More importance than ever was placed on political intelligence, espionage, and the surveillance of potential subversives. Following the <b>mutiny,</b> a political intelligence bureau was established in Singapore under direct command and control of Major General Dudley Howard Ridout, General-Officer-Commanding (GOC) Singapore. This eventually paved the way for the formation of the Criminal Intelligence Department (Special Branch) was set up in 1919.|$|E

50|$|The <b>mutinies</b> were {{potentially}} dangerous for Britain, {{because at the}} time the country was at war with Revolutionary France.

5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to <b>mutiny.</b> These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to <b>mutiny</b> but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the <b>mutiny</b> might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{continued}} to be an active military installation throughout the British period. It {{was the scene of}} a <b>mutiny</b> in 1807 when Albanian soldiers of the Froberg Regiment revolted and shut themselves up in Fort Ricasoli. Despite attempts at negotiation they eventually blew up the main gunpowder magazine, causing extensive damage to the fort in the process. The <b>mutiny</b> was quashed by loyal troops, and some of the mutineers were condemned to death by court martial. The damaged parts of the fort were repaired, but were not rebuilt to their original design. A new magazine was built in 1829 to replace the one destroyed in the <b>mutiny.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{controversial}} issue– {{the future of}} the city of Vilnius– was not explicitly addressed. When the agreement was signed, Vilnius was garrisoned by Lithuanian troops and behind the Lithuanian lines. Yet this changed almost immediately when the staged Żeligowski's <b>Mutiny</b> began on October 8. Soon after the <b>mutiny,</b> Léon Bourgeois, President of the Council of the League of Nations, expressed strong disapproval, asserting that Żeligowski's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the Council of the League of Nations, and demanding the immediate Polish evacuation of the city.|$|E
