5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to <b>manganese</b> <b>oxide</b> (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

The oxidative reactivity of <b>manganese</b> (hydro) <b>oxides</b> is important for geochemical transformation of organic pollutants.

The results show the oxidative reactivity of <b>manganese</b> (hydro) <b>oxides</b> towards MBT degradation strongly depends on their physicochemical properties. Specific surface area and reduction potential of <b>manganese</b> (hydro) <b>oxides</b> were positively correlated with MBT degradation rates, whereas pH at the point of zero charge (pH PZC) of <b>manganese</b> (hydro) <b>oxides</b> and apparent activation energy (E a) were negatively correlated.
