I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E

In 2007 the SPFA was replaced by a new body, PFA Scotland, but the new organisation's awards are considered to be a direct continuation of the SPFA awards.|$|E

500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I <b>mean,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene {{featuring}} Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, comedian Steve Love was cast {{as one of the}} Brotherhood members killed by the Hound. Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to me if I could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Jimi Hendrix played {{bass and}} added lead in his session {{musician}} days for Mansfield in 1965 on two songs ("As The Clouds Drift By" [...] and [...] "Suey"), released as a 45-rpm single by London Records in 1966. Ed Chalpin, the record producer, claimed that Mansfield played all the instruments on the singles. According to Hendrix historian Steven Roby (Black Gold: The Lost Archives Of Jimi Hendrix, Billboard Books), this collaboration occurred because {{they shared the}} same manager. Wo ist der Mann sung in German and released by Polydor Records in Austria was much in demand immediately after its release in August 1963. The A-side featured Hans Last's Scnicksnack-Snuckelchen. Two original soundtracks from The Las Vegas Hillbillys— That Makes It (an answer to The Big Bopper's [...] "Chantilly Lace" [...] )on side-A and Little Things <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> on side-B— was released in 1964 on the Original Sound label.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot in black-and-white in New York City with the video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A Spanish version of the music video, titled [...] "Si Yo Fuera Un Chico", was released with the same concepts as the main one; it was edited from the original with the Spanish version of the song dubbed over it. The music video for [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is reflective of the stance as an independent woman that Beyoncé has taken throughout her career. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé revealed {{that the concept of}} the video is similar to the American comedy film Freaky Friday (1976); its theme is role reversal. She also said that it would depict things that men commonly do to hurt their partners, like not answering their phones, before adding that the video is about little things that <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in relationships. Beyoncé explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} on Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track [...] "Stockholm Syndrome", {{which is the first}} Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives {{eventually}} expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa. It was described by prominent music critic Robert Christgau as a [...] "simulated Neil Young ballad". The song [...] "Autumn Sweater", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while [...] "Center of Gravity" [...] has been described as [...] "a simple lo-fi devotional love song". Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, [...] "I think it's a nice, evocative title—it seems to <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not telling what movie. You'll have to see it one day and say, 'Eureka!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Side two {{consists}} of miscellaneous unrelated songs unused for The Graduate, with many possessing a more rock-based sound than the unified folk songs that precede it. Simon felt the album's second side were composed of throwaway tracks: [...] "They didn't <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> They weren't well recorded." [...] In [...] "Fakin' It", melodies are occasionally deleted to suit lyrics, but the song generally follows a similar chord structure and melodic outline over a [...] "funky rock beat" [...] that sonically references the Beatles' [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows". [...] "Punky's Dilemma" [...] is breezy and minimal musically, {{with a soft}} jazz-style percussion and seemingly improvised guitar lines dominated by seventh chords. [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] opens with an [...] "instantly recognizable" [...] pop rock guitar hook that carries throughout the track. The first verse consists only of syllables—"dee-dee-dee" [...] and [...] "doo-doo-doo"—that form stable harmonic foundation. The inclusion of the meaningless syllables arises from the unfinished nature of the song when pitched to director Mike Nichols, who particularly liked the verse. [...] "A Hazy Shade of Winter" [...] follows a more rock-tinged sound, with a fairly straightforward verse-refrain structure. [...] "At the Zoo" [...] uses a rock groove that settles into the key of G major.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was {{met with}} mainly {{positive}} reviews from contemporary music critics. Lucy Davis from BBC Music wrote that the song [...] "might <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to some, those with the tiresome self defence lyrics should go [...] when she gets on with the singing, there's nothing to prove". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani deemed [...] "Oh Mother" [...] a [...] "lovely" [...] piano and string melody [...] "that we're offered a reprieve". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic was also positive toward [...] "Oh Mother", commenting that [...] "another ode to her single mother and middle-finger to her abusive father, is yet more proof that Aguilera works best when the subject matter actually means something to her, when the song {{is more than just}} something to sing". Spence D. for IGN was positive toward the song's meaning, writing that it [...] "resonates with a bittersweet energy that helps it rise above the standard young pop queen fare of the day". musicOMH's John Murray was not impressed with the song, calling it [...] "good" [...] but saying that it would [...] "just make the bad moments feel so much worse". Digital Spy critic Nick Levine provided a negative review, giving it a two out of five stars rating and calling it [...] "tremulous" [...] with a [...] "vibrato-fuelled conclusion". He also compared [...] "Oh Mother" [...] to Madonna's song [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989) for the same sad melody as well as the same theme of child abuse.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted in 2005, Williams' former promoter, Pak-Man, {{who worked on}} {{over half of the}} album with the rapper, spoke on the record, with his explanation leaning toward the album being intended as satire: [...] "At that time Canibus was in the studio recording a lot of songs and [...] <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> but he didn't want to make the fans wait no more so he did C True Hollywood Stories and he wanted to have fun wit, so thats what we did we had fun wit". In {{an interview}} on AllHipHop.com posted on April 8, 2005, Williams was asked what direction he was trying to take with that album; in his response, he stated [...] "That album depicts the state of affairs in my life at the time – nothing more, nothing less".|$|E
2500|$|The {{event has}} not only been the {{occasion}} to, as a promotional brochure explains, [...] "learn about the important role that heritage and tradition play in defining who we are", but has also been used to make artistic and political statements. In 1974, the Chicano conceptual and performance art group Asco {{took advantage of the}} opportunity to confront a by-then entrenched social and political culture with an irreverent [...] "invasion". In the midst of ceremonies attended by Los Angeles's political elite, Harry Gamboa, Jr., Patssi Valdez, Gronk, and Willie Herrón were [...] "delivered" [...] in a giant envelope marked postage due. They emerged in wild costumes, acting out their [...] "absurdist message". The piece was a challenge to Self Help's orthodox interpretation of the holiday. According to Gronk, [...] "We were originally asked to come in to do a piece." [...] But after being shown a film about Mexico's Day of the Dead, [...] "we sort of rolled our eyes like, 'Are we gonna repeat that?' Just like, 'That's fine for somewhere else, but not for us.' Day of the Dead can <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different of things, and it doesn't necessarily mean paper cutouts, skull heads. We can invent it, what it means to us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heather Ousby {{points out}} that the {{identity}} of the [...] "subbornd Informer" [...] has proved especially contentious for critics. She points to several interpretations of the informer which include the Friend, some sort of spy, and [...] "an abstract force such as jealousy". In her interpretation of the Sonnet, Ousby settles on the idea that the informer represents the Friend. She bases this thought on the various meanings of the word [...] "suborn" [...] during this time period. Rather than spying, informing could also be seen as inspiring and thus it would refer to the inspiration for the sonnet. Likewise, the term suborn meant corruption in loyalty which the Speaker accuses the Friend of in other sonnets. Ousby is making a case for eliminating the informer as some third party, much like Greene. The difference is that Ousby uses the subtraction of this would-be character to shift the tone of the sonnet. She agrees that the first two quatrains concern how the [...] "dwellers on form and favor are destroyed by that humiliating process" [...] of giving unreciprocated affection. She sees the third quatrain as a plea to the Friend or as a directive to both of them. The couplet, however, becomes a means of stating the Speaker's independence from the Friend due to his [...] "poor but free" [...] oblations which <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> but cost so little. For Ousby, the Speaker seems to be separating himself from a disloyal patron who demeans his work.|$|E

Pickard {{explained}} that when Cindy ends the relationship because he does not plan to marry her, his character is shocked that he [...] "misses Cindy. They talk things through and, out of the blue, Tony proposes in jest. But Cindy goes along with it..." [...] He explained that Tony is unaware of Cindy's true nature although he did suspect Cindy to be manipulating him for a while. Pickard added that Cindy will [...] "want to get married as soon as possible before Tony can change his mind". He added that Cindy is [...] "acting like she genuinely loves him and he desperately wants that love" [...] so he remains unsuspicious towards her and her plans to scam him. Despite her plans, Pickard felt Cindy has [...] "some feelings" [...] for Tony. He felt that Tony has [...] "fallen for her, yes. It surprises him but she's started to <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to him. Cindy's smart and sexy and they're good together".

The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush".

Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here."
