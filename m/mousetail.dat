50|$|Ivesia is also {{a synonym}} for the Nesticus spider genus.Ivesia is a genus of {{flowering}} plants in the rose family known generally as <b>mousetails.</b> They are perennial herbs native to western North America, especially the western United States.

50|$|This is a {{perennial}} herb {{which can be}} somewhat different in appearance from many other <b>mousetails.</b> Each leaf {{is made up of}} many leaflets but they are tiny and overlap tightly to form a woolly, taillike, cylindrical leaf up to 10 centimeters long. The erect, naked stem reaches up to 40 centimeters in height and bears an inflorescence of flowers. Each flower is up to 8 millimeters wide and has large, round white petals above the much smaller, pointed sepals. There are 15 stamens and a single pistil.|$|R
50|$|The genera Horkelia (horkelias) and Ivesia (<b>mousetails)</b> are {{sometimes}} included in Potentilla today. The mock-strawberries of Duchesnea have been included. Conversely, the shrubby plants previously {{included in this}} genus are now separated in the genus Dasiphora, while some distinctive and apparently protocarnivorous herbaceous cinquefoils are placed in Drymocallis. The marsh cinquefoil {{is now in the}} genus Comarum, and the three-toothed cinquefoil makes up the monotypic genus Sibbaldiopsis. As already proposed by John Hill in the 18th century, the silverweeds of genus Argentina may be distinct, but as the immediate sister genus of Potentilla, its boundary is still unclear.|$|R
