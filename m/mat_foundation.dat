50|$|Arguably {{the largest}} {{part of the}} {{renovation}} was improving the building's resistance to earthquake damage. A base isolation system was installed under the building to provide this protection. The building's isolation system is composed {{of a network of}} 280 base isolators, each 20 in high, and between 36 in and 44 in in diameter. Installing the isolators required excavating the dirt around and beneath the capitol, exposing the foundation and footings. The original concrete support columns were then attached to a network of new load transfer beams, which extended horizontally from under the building, and were supported by pile caps under and along the perimeter of the capitol. The support columns were then detached from the original footings, leaving the building sitting on the load transfer beams and pile caps. A new concrete mat was poured around and on top of the original footings, leaving a space between the new load transfer beams and the concrete mat. The base isolators were then installed on top of the concrete mat, directly above the covered footings. Once all the isolators had been installed the temporary supports between the pile caps and load transfer beams were removed, leaving the beams to sit directly on the isolators, which sit on the concrete <b>mat</b> <b>foundation.</b> The isolators are made of layers of laminated rubber, and are very strong vertically but not horizontally, which allows the building to rock gently back and forth as the ground underneath moves during an earthquake.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{challenges}} in structural engineering is defining the reliable and accurate loading patterns for design of earthquake-resistant structures based on the all components of the seismic motions-three translational and three rotational. From earthquake engineering approach, it is usually assumed that the rotational components of strong ground motions are induced due to the spatial variation of the seismic waves and, consequently, these components are estimated in terms of corresponding translational components. When the earthquake shaking can be specified at a single point, the rotational loading of structures can be performed by point rotation, which corresponds with gradient of a point on the ground surface. Most investigations on the earthquake rotational loading, by considering the effects of point rotation {{on the behavior of}} structures have shown that the rotational components based on their frequency content can severely change dynamic behavior of structures, which are sensitive to the high-frequency motions, such as secondary systems, historical monuments, nuclear reactors, tall asymmetric buildings or irregular frames, slender tower shape structures, bridges, vertically irregular structures, and even the ordinary multi-story buildings. The contribution of the rotational components to the seismic response of the structures supported on the rigid <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> can even be amplified if the effects of the kinematic and dynamic soil structure interaction are considered in structural loading and modeling. In a recent study, the combined action of the rotational loading and multi-support excitation on the seismic behavior of short-span bridges was investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: At present, commercially {{available}} software {{is used for}} <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> analysis. Some of these software products are only valid for flat plate modeling and lack a fundamental understanding of mat-soil interaction. The software user {{should be aware of}} these facts when using software to analyze mat foundations. There are very few products on the market which are originally developed specifically for <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> analysis with an in-depth understanding of mat soil interaction. Mats are relatively thick concrete slabs with typical span to depth ratios varying from as low as 2 to as high as 8. It is reasonable to expect that shear deformation would {{play an important role in}} the mat-soil interaction. Therefore, it would be prudent to model a <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> using a thick plate formulation rather than a thin plate.

The solution using RISAFoundation is compared with a solid element FEM solution. The inclusion of shear deformation in flexural behavior of plates make the plates more flexible, which increases differential settlement and reduces bending moments, thus the overall mat design is impacted significantly.

These damages create unnecessary maintenance {{cost to the}} owner and can be detrimental to the building superstructure. Post-tensioned ribbed mat foundations are commonly used in light commercial construction in areas in the United States that have highly expansive soils. Mild reinforced ribbed mat foundations are rarely used in these areas. This report investigates why post-tensioned ribbed mat foundations are more common in these areas than mild-reinforced ribbed mat foundations. The approach to this investigation is a design example which designs and compares the two foundation types. The design example is a typical 2 -story office building located in Dallas, Texas, which {{is an area that}} has highly expansive soils. First, a post-tensioned ribbed <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> is designed for the office building. Next, a mild-reinforced ribbed <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> is designed for the same building.

The findings in the comparison is that post-tensioning is a more economical and constructible method. Using mild-reinforcement requires the use of shear reinforcement in the ribs which is not typical in foundation design and construction and is less economical, and additional reinforcement in the slab is needed to resist bending stresses which is also less economical.

40|$|Abstract: Piled-raft {{foundations}} for important high-rise buildings {{have proved to}} be a valuable alternative to conventional pile <b>foundations</b> or <b>mat</b> <b>foundations.</b> The concept of using piled raft foundation is that the combined foundation is able to support the applied axial loading with an appropriate factor of safety and that the settlement of the combined foundation at working load is tolerable. Pile raft foundation behavior is evaluated with many researches and the effect of pile length; pile distance, pile arrangement and cap thickness are determined under vertical or horizontal static and dynamic loading. In the present paper the influence of pile length configurations on behavior of multi-storied are evaluated under vertical loading. In practice, the foundation loads from structural analysis are obtained without allowance for soil settlements and the foundation settlements are estimated assuming a perfectly flexible structure. However, the stiffness of the structure can restrain the displacements of the foundations and even tiny differential settlements of the foundations will also alter forces of the structural members. Hence, the interaction among structures, their foundations and the soil medium below the foundations alter the actual behaviour of the structure considerably than what is obtained from the consideration of the structure alone. In this work, analysis of pile soil structure interaction has been studied by finite element software ANSYS 11. The soil structure interact ion {{has been found to be}} significantly affecting the performance of structure and it is discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Extract] A {{foundation}} is a structural element {{that is expected}} to transfer a load from a structure to the ground safely. The two major classes of foundations are shallow foundations and deep foundations. A shallow foundation transfers the entire load at a relatively shallow depth. A common understanding is that the depth of a shallow foundation (Df) must be less than the breadth (B). Breadth is the shorter of the two plan dimensions. Shallow foundations include pad footings, strip (or wall) footings, combined footings, and <b>mat</b> <b>foundations,</b> shown in Figure 3. 1. Deep foundations have a greater depth than breadth and include piles, pile groups, and piers, which are discussed in Chapter 4. A typical building can apply 10 – 15 kPa per floor, depending on the column spacing, type of structure, and number of floors. Shallow foundations generally are designed to satisfy two criteria: bearing capacity and settlement. The bearing capacity criterion ensures that there is adequate safety against possible bearing capacity failure within the underlying soil. This is done through provision of an adequate factor of safety of about 3. In other words, shallow foundations are designed to carry a working load of one-third of the failure load. For raft foundations, a safety factor of 1. 7 – 2. 5 is recommended (Bowles 1996). The settlement criterion ensures that settlement is within acceptable limits. For example, pad and strip footings in granular soils generally are designed to settle less than 25 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a building, its founda-tion {{and the underlying}} soils may haveimportant effects {{on the behavior of}} each of these components {{as well as on the}} overall system behavior. For example, the rel-ative stiffness of a building structure, its <b>mat</b> <b>foundation</b> and the soils that support the foundation will influence the stresses and dis-placements of both the structure and soil. Soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects are sometimes neglected by the use of a structur-al model supported on a fixed base.

On this basis, the complete spectral description (direct and cross power density functions) of the 6 D motion of the rigid mat is derived from the space-time stochastic model of the free field displacement. To this aim different forms of the coherency function relating the horizontal and vertical motion at a point are proposed and tested. The rigid-mat excitation model is then applied to the dynamic analysis of the reactor building designed within the IRIS international project, this being a classical example of rigid system, i. e. of a structural system which, once base-isolated, tends to behave as a rigid body. The effect of the rotational input components is studied, by a classical random vibration approach, in view of characterizing their effect on the isolators, especially in term of imposed relative displacement and of applied axial forces. The result show how the torsional rotation input has a negligible effect on the horizontal relative displacement of the isolators, while rocking inputs are responsible for a more significant increase in the axial load variation.

The response in time domain is obtained by Fourier transform. The seismic excitation is represented as the control motion on the ground surface, which is generated as an artificial earthquake. Both inertial and kinematic interactions are included.;Several computer programs, including a general purpose finite element program, a program to formulate soil stiffness matrices, and a program to generate artificial earthquake ground motion records, {{have been written by}} the author, which can be used to analyze most soil-structure interaction problems, such as machine foundations, buildings, piles and pile groups, tunnels, and dams. A series of parametric studies on strip foundations, single piles, pile groups, and three-dimensional <b>mat</b> <b>foundations</b> is presented to demonstrate these applications. Particular attention is paid to the effect of soil anisotropy on the structural response. The effect of soil anisotropy on the foundation response is found to be significant in most cases.;A 300 MW turbine-generator-foundation system is analyzed as an application of the developed mathematical model and computer codes. Excitations from rotor unbalances and earthquakes are considered. The influence of turbine-generator casing and soil anisotropy on the response of the system is explored. It is found that the presence of casing and soil anisotropy strongly influences the displacements and internal forces of the system under rotor unbalance excitation. Under seismic excitation, however, although the presence of casing and soil anisotropy does affect the displacements of the system, their effect on the internal forces of the system is minimal...|$|R
