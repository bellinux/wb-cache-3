50|$|<b>Ferdinand</b> <b>may</b> {{represent}} {{the hope of}} the younger generation who will not repeat the mistakes made by Prospero and Alonso. In Act 5 Scene 1, as they saw Ferdinand and Miranda playing chess together, Alonso told their reconciliation and unification through the marriage.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{almost a}} decade after {{specifically}} in 1957 another school system was introduced. This time {{it was due to}} the tremendous increase in the interest for formal education. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ferdinand</b> Onuorah gave us a vivid account of how the quest for another school structure started. He said that the whole scenario began when a strong wind devastated the roof of Sacred Heart School in Amozalla. The entire town could not raise enough money to renovate it. More so, the tension ensued again but this time to the favour of the Ikeghe section. This led to the withdrawal of the Ikeghe people from contributing for the maintenance of the teachers and structures of the school. This also became another opportunity for the Ikeghe people to seek for the establishment of another school at their side. As a matter of fact, the white missionaries began to consider this interest of Ikeghe people. During this time an inter-house sport competition was scheduled to be hosted at the out sketch of Okwum village. The hosting of the inter-house sports was made possible by the effort of the villagers, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ferdinand</b> Onuorah and some teachers who prepared the ground and field for the competition.|$|R

It had all to be done, so to say, in an hour. My friend,--as far as he was a friend, for I don't know much about him,--wanted the money and wanted to be off. So here they are, and Emily can do as she likes."

50|$|However, {{the school}} at Ugwu Agbudu was {{relocated}} to St. Cyril station, which had then standards one to four. The school began admitting more number of pupils from far and near. According to <b>Mr</b> <b>Ferdinand</b> Onuora a renowned teacher and veteran historian {{who gave us}} this account, he said, {{though it was a}} mud-house, there was the desire to build another structure to accommodate the new students. This was actualized in 1947 under a white priest called Fr. Bronsnaha. The school was built at Amozalla and named Sacred Heart School Egede. Previously, the teachers were secretly organizing an unapproved standard five and six.|$|R

In 1913 <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Ferdinand</b> C. Gammons, original members of the M. E. Church, purchased the property {{at the corner}} of School and Cedar Streets for a new permanent building. This stone building, known as the Gammons Memorial Methodist Church, was dedicated in 1914.

This impressive average ratio was due to its extreme firepower and protection, which gave it an enormous advantage when used in head-on combat or a static defensive role. However, poor mobility and mechanical unreliability greatly diminished its operational capability.|$|R
