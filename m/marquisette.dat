50|$|The County of Malta was a Feudal Lordship of the Kingdom of Sicily, {{relating}} to the islands of Malta and Gozo. Malta was essentially a fief within the kingdom, with the title given by Tancred of Sicily the last Norman king of Sicily to Margaritus of Brindisi in 1190 who earned acclaim as the Grand Admiral of Sicily. Afterwards the fiefdom was passed from nobleman to nobleman remaining as a family possetion in a few instances. It was used mainly as a bargaining tool in Sicilian politics leading to a rather turbulent history. The fiefdom was elevated to a <b>Marquisette</b> in 1392 and either title was no longer used after 1429.|$|E
5000|$|Christian Dior's 'New Look' {{collection}} in 1947 brought a revolution to the fashionable silhouette of the Fifties. Dior's nostalgic femininity of round shoulders, full skirts, padded hips and tiny waists replaced the boxy {{style of the}} wartime period at WWII. The trend of hourglass silhouette brought by the popularity of Dior guaranteed the market for intimate apparel. Although intimate apparels are usually hidden by outerwear, intimate apparel is especially emblematic for the contradictory beauty in the 1950s as the silhouette was created depends {{on the type of}} foundation garments worn. Foundation garments became essential items to maintain the curvy silhouette, especially waspies, girdles and horsehair padding. For example, the sales of corsets doubled in the decade 1948-58 (Haye, 1996 p.187). Dior's 'New Look' collection brought back the boned intimate apparels for women, even the young one, in order to create the feminised silhouettes that embrace feminity. Symington Corset Company of Market Harborough was one of the famous intimate apparel producers in the 1950s as they are the official producer of Dior's corselettes and girdles. [...] "All the girdles were produced to the same design, in either black or white. The sugar-pink cotton velvet trimming was a particular feature of the range, and some were woven with Christian Dior's initials in the elastic panels on the side..." [...] (Lynn, 2010, p.106). A brand new 'Bri-Nylon' fabric was introduced by the British Nylon Spinners. This fabric was popular fabric to be applied on intimate apparel in the 1950s because {{it was one of the}} first easy-to-launder and drip-dry fabric. There was a full corset advertisement in 1959 shows the popularity of 'Bri-Nylon' and the design of the corselet in the 1950s. 'This exquisite Dior corselet features jacquard elastic net with the down-stretch back panel of stain elastic. The enchanting front panel is in Bri-Nylon lace and <b>marquisette</b> highlighted with criss-cross bands of narrow velvet ribbon. It has side fastening - partly hook and eye with zipping extension. The very light boning is covered with velveteen.' (Warren, 2001, p.30 [...] ) From the above advertisement, it is not hard to find that the corselets in the 1950s were constructed in details with boning, panels, different fabrics in different elasticity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Oxygen {{consumption}} of single mosquitoes {{was measured using}} a differential pressure transducer (DPT) connected to two small chambers. A mosquito {{was placed in the}} experimental chamber (P 1) and was separated from NaOH by 4 cm 2 of <b>marquisette</b> mesh. The reference chamber (P 2) contained the same amount of NaOH and the <b>marquisette</b> mesh but without a mosquito. When these two chambers were sealed, removed O 2 from P 1 resulted in a pressure decrease with respect to P 2. This pressure differential was transduced into an output voltage that was directly proportional to the amount of O 2 consumed by the mosquito. An array of eight DPTs was interfaced with an IBM 486 PC using an ADAC 5500 MF analog to digital converter and software from ADAC (Direct View) to automate the recording procedure. We determined that our apparatus was sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in O 2 consumption in mosquitoes subjected to different physiologic conditions. Manometric methods have been used extensively in the study of respiration and have produced a great variety of apparatus to carry out these measurements. Among the many different respirometers that have been produced, the War-burg respirometer has been the most widely used. 1 In the early 1960 s, Gilson 2 constructed a simpler differential res...|$|E
40|$|Hiram Royal Mallinson, {{an ambitious}} and talented son of mid-nineteenth-century {{immigrants}} from Poland, entered the silk trade in 1893 as a salesman {{for the company}} of Pelgram 2 ̆ 6 Meyer in Paterson, New Jersey. Just two years later Mallinson joined a new firm, Newwitter 2 ̆ 6 Migel, headquartered in New York City, as head of sales. In 1900, Migel and Mallinson bought out Newwitter and renamed the firm M. C. Migel 2 ̆ 6 Co. Migel and Mallinson consciously targeted the novelty market and the high-end or “class” customer generally conceded to European concerns at the time. The company was regarded as progressive, its output of excellent quality and a credit to the American industry. Migel retired from active participation in the firm in 1903, leaving Mallinson in charge—a position he maintained until 1931. His company’s long-term success within a turbulent industry was founded on a solid reputation for quality silks and, perhaps more importantly, on marketing practices not yet common in his day: buying or generating the right publicity, cultivating all potential consumers, and anticipating— even creating—consumer demand for novelty. Until 1913, M. C. Migel 2 ̆ 6 Co. concentrated primarily on woven textures and jacquardwoven designs. In the years between 1900 and 1913, the firm offered many innovative fabrics, such as “Waterette” waterproof taffeta, “Motora” pongee for the emerging motorist market, and “Madame Butterfly” <b>marquisette.</b> All competed against the luxury imports from Europe and the few other high-end American products. The company’s printed silks kept to prevailing Paris fashions, usually in simple color combinations that suited the relative lack of skill within the American silk-printing industry at this time. In November 1912, Migel sold {{his interest in the}} company to Mallinson. In early 1914, Mallinson stepped up his campaign against European competitors, introducing the Mexixe line of printed silks. [fig. 1] This series took advantage of Mexico’s prominence in the news due to the American war against Pancho Villa. The designs were based on Aztec, Mexican, and American Indian art, and although they were certainly influenced by European aesthetics, the underlying theme was an American original, not a variation on a French idea. The printing, in multiple colors on saturated grounds, challenged European supremacy in that art. The fabrics were used by several Paris couturiers, endorsing this upstart American attempt at original design. It was a stunning critical and sales success for the company and a notable first for the American industry. In its wake, Mallinson changed the company’s name to his own in January 1915...|$|E

40|$|Translation begins] Friday My Darling, I’m happy today- got {{a letter}} from you. The mailman just came. Gee, honey, I love you so. What a day. It’s all cloudy and looks as though it were going to rain any second. Hope it doesn’t. Have to go shopping- {{strictly}} window shopping- in New Rochelle and Mt. Vernon. Having more trouble trying to find a negligee that isn’t <b>marquisette</b> (any way the kind that you can’t see through. They’re all like celephane [sic].) Maybe today I’ll find one. Shooting skeet must be hard. That sounds good- 19 out of 25. I’d be amazed to come close to one out of 25. That’s something else you’ll have to teach me- how to shoot. Then when I catch you running ‘round with other women I can be real dramatic about it. Goley [sic], honey, I wish you’d finish that night flying. It must be awful to fly so late + then get up at the same ungodly hour in the morning. Anytime you’re too tired or don’t feel like writing don’t. Not that you would but don’t feel that you have to. I realize how hard it is for you to write so often. I hope it doesn’t rain on March 11 th. Oh, that reminds me. I had the craziest dream last night. We got married + then you disappeared suddenly right after the ceremony and the next thing I remember you were flying around. It was so vivid. You were buzzing all the houses and I was trying to get your attention. I can remember I had my wedding dress on + it looked very nice but you wouldn’t come down. Then this fellow from the Navy Air Corps came + we were talking (this must have been a hangover from “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”.) He looked like Bob- the one Van Johnson was going to buy a ranch with. He was complaining about how fresh the Marines were. I was telling him what had happened + he wanted to know what else I could expect from a Marine. After about five minutes I’d convinced him that you weren’t a marine + were the the [sic] best pilot in the Army Air Corps. Then you finally drove up in a car- Gee, it was a funny dream. It was much more complicated than that but it wouldn’t make sense to you. You looked so cute, though. Woody and I are going to see “National Velvet” tonight. It’s supposed to be good. As long as it’s about a horse I’m sure to like it. That reminds me, honey, we should go riding sometime. Maybe when we’re old and gray someday we’ll go. Oh, honey, don’t you want to send any announcements to Steve or any of the fellows in the Air Corps. We’ll have loads of them so don’t worry about that. Golly, you only get married once on March 11 th. We’re having a couple hundred made so we have to use them up. What a wedding this is going to be! Nothing has gone the way we planned! You’ve changed your bestman + I’ve changed my attendants and the place has been changed. That’s what I like- everything goes exactly the opposite from the way we plan. Wonder if that will happen all our lives. Hope so- I love things to happen. Are you {{going to be able to}} get the rings this weekend, honey? Or aren’t they giving you open Post? This week went real fast for me- The weekends always do anyway. Oh honey, are you going to have our rings engraved there? Let me know about your ring so I can send you the money, hon. You most certainly didn’t answer my questions about Scotch! (Not until this letter). You didn’t tell me how much to get. I’ll get more than one bottle, honey. One bottle will never last you until we get out of the south. Someone is playing “I’m Beginning To See The Light”. Hope I can remember to buy some ink, honey, this stuff is getting lighter and lighter. Gee, honey, only 16 more days. You’ll probably be getting your rings about now. Hope it’s a nice day but I probably wouldn’t know the difference. Gee, honey, it won’t be much longer now. You’re just too wonderful, honey! You’re just too, too wonderful. I wish I could be with you now. I miss you more + more every day. The sun just came out. Happy Day! It still looks like a storm. I love you so- Well, honey, just got back from “National Velvet”. It was wonderful. What a picture. I love horses- Woody + I went and I’ve almost got her talked into going riding. Gee, I love you honey. Someday maybe we’ll go riding together. Tomorrow I may go if it’s nice out and not too cold- Woody’s never been and I’m trying to get her to go. Gee, darling, I miss you so. I wish we were going to be married now instead of in sixteen more days. Well, honey it’s pretty late. Guess I better get to bed. I’ll write tomorrow, my darling, I miss you more and more. And they’ll never be words enough to tell you how very much I love you. Do you know Carol’s sister? She had a baby boy the other day. Her husband was killed in France the first day he went into action- the only thing that kept her going was the baby. She was praying so that it would be a boy. Carol is real busy now being an Aunt. Well, honey, as I said before I’d better be getting. I love you and will love you Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
