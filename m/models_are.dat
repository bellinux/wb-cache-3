5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time.

40|$|Abstract. GM (1, 1) <b>model</b> <b>is</b> {{a widely}} used model for forecasting. The {{characteristics}} of the <b>model</b> have <b>been</b> analyzed. The fact that the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> a biased exponential <b>model</b> has <b>been</b> testified. Based on the results, UGM (1, 1) <b>model</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper. The proposed model has more extensive application scope than GM (1, 1) model {{for the reason that}} the model can limit the inherent deviation of GM (1, 1) model. The proposed <b>model</b> <b>is</b> applied to the field of electric load forecasting, the actual results also show that the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> better than GM (1, 1) model. ...|$|R

5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical <b>models</b> <b>are</b> based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical <b>models</b> <b>are</b> numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E

5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These <b>models</b> <b>are</b> especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These <b>models</b> <b>are</b> now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E

5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When <b>models</b> <b>are</b> calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, <b>models</b> <b>are</b> evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E
