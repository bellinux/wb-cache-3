5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain <b>making</b> <b>life</b> a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E

25|$|With the {{proclamation}} of the Edict of Nantes, {{and the subsequent}} protection of Huguenot rights, pressures to leave France abated.

The Huguenot population of France dropped to 856,000 by the mid-1660s, of which a plurality lived in rural areas.

25|$|Differences {{between the}} Arian Vandals and their Trinitarian {{subjects}} (including both Catholics and Donatists) were a {{constant source of}} tension in their African state. Catholic bishops were exiled or killed by Genseric and laymen were excluded from office and frequently suffered confiscation of their property. He protected his Catholic subjects when his relations with Rome and Constantinople were friendly, as during the years 454–57, when the Catholic community at Carthage, being without a head, elected Deogratias bishop. The same was also the case during the years 476–477 when Bishop Victor of Cartenna sent him, during a period of peace, a sharp refutation of Arianism and suffered no punishment. Huneric, Genseric's successor, issued edicts against Catholics in 483 and 484 in an effort to marginalise them and make Arianism the primary religion in North Africa. Generally most Vandal kings, except Hilderic, persecuted Trinitarian Christians {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, banning conversion for Vandals, exiling bishops and generally <b>making</b> <b>life</b> difficult for Trinitarians.|$|E

25|$|The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, {{holder of}} the Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, in a 2008 talk {{delivered}} to LGBT Dharma practitioners at the Shambhala Meditation Center of New York, stressed that for vajrayana lay practitioners, homosexual relationships {{are no better}} or worse than heterosexual relationships and that only unhealthy relationships in general are to be avoided. Both the Nalandabodhi sangha, which was founded by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, and the Shambhala sanghas founded by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche have stated that they are welcoming of all sexual orientations. The Shambhala Meditation Center of New York hosts a weekly practice group, Queer Dharma, specifically catering {{to the needs of}} the LGBTQ Buddhist community. According to the Danish Karma Kagyu Lama Ole Nydahl, Buddha saw homosexuality as circumstances <b>making</b> <b>life</b> more difficult, but also explained the reason for homosexuality could be aversion against the opposite sex in a former life. Nydahl says however that sexual orientation is not really important in order to practice Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|At MacLeod's urging, Zelle {{returned}} to him, but his behavior did not change. She escaped her circumstances {{by studying the}} local culture. In 1899, their children fell violently ill from complications relating {{to the treatment of}} syphilis contracted from their parents, though the family claimed they were poisoned by an irate servant. Jeanne survived, but Norman died. Some sources maintain that one of MacLeod's enemies may have poisoned a supper to kill both of their children. After moving back to the Netherlands, the couple officially separated on 30 August 1902. The divorce became final in 1906. Zelle was awarded custody of Jeanne. MacLeod was legally required to pay support, which he never did, <b>making</b> <b>life</b> very difficult for Zelle and her daughter. During a visit of Jeanne with her father, MacLeod decided not to return Jeanne to her mother. Zelle did not have resources to fight the situation and accepted it, believing that while McLeod had been an abusive husband, he had always been a good father. Jeanne later {{died at the age of}} 21, also possibly from complications relating to syphilis.|$|E
25|$|On March 20 8th-seeded Cincinnati and 9th-seeded Purdue {{squared off}} in the game prior to Kentucky and Hampton playing. The Bearcats outlasted the Boilermakers 66 to 65 in overtime. On March 22 Cincinnati and Kentucky met in Louisville for a berth to the Sweet 16. This was the first meeting between the two {{programs}} since the 2005 NCAA Tournament in which Kentucky won. The game was not as easy for the Wildcats like {{it was in the}} opening round game against Hampton. Kentucky shot just 37 percent and was outrebounded 45 to 38 yet always seemed in control because of timely baskets and rebounds that Cincinnati failed to get. The physical, pesky Bearcats made the Wildcats work hard for every shot and rebound in an intense contest. Yet the Wildcats succeeded by <b>making</b> <b>life</b> difficult on both ends for Cincinnati, holding the Bearcats to 32 percent shooting including just 24 percent in the second half. Kentucky blocked six shots after halftime and nine overall while also coming up with key rebounds. Kentucky outlasted Cincinnati's physicality, defeating the Bearcats 64 to 51 en route to the Sweet 16.|$|E

500|$|Alexander the Great {{conquered the}} Middle East in the 4th century BCE, {{and in the}} {{following}} centuries ancient Greek cultures and values came to the Middle East. The Greeks abhorred circumcision, <b>making</b> <b>life</b> for circumcised Jews living among the Greeks (and later the Romans) very difficult. Antiochus Epiphanes outlawed circumcision, as did Hadrian, which helped cause the Bar Kokhba revolt. [...] During this period in history, Jewish circumcision called {{for the removal of}} only a part of the prepuce, and some Hellenized Jews attempted to look uncircumcised by stretching the extant parts of their foreskins. This was considered by the Jewish leaders to be a serious problem, and during the 2nd century CE they changed the requirements of Jewish circumcision to call for the complete removal of the foreskin, emphasizing the Jewish view of circumcision as intended to be not just the fulfillment of a Biblical commandment but also an essential and permanent mark of membership in a people.|$|E
500|$|At the front, {{soldiers}} were in constant danger from artillery shells, mortar bombs and bullets {{and as the}} war progressed they also faced aerial attack. Some sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, <b>making</b> <b>life</b> comparatively easy. Other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. However, quiet sectors still amassed daily casualties through snipers, artillery fire and disease. The harsh conditions, where trenches were often wet and muddy and the constant company of lice and rats which fed on unburied bodies, often carried disease. Many troops suffered from trench foot, trench fever and trench nephritis. They could also contract frostbite in the winter months and heat exhaustion in the summer. The men were frequently wet and extremely muddy, or dry and exceedingly dusty. Food could not usually be cooked in the front line trenches as any smoke would draw enemy fire, hot food had to be carried along communication trenches in clumsy [...] "hayboxes", sometimes arriving late or not at all.|$|E
500|$|To {{minimize}} her tax liability, Heyer {{formed a}} {{limited liability company}} called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would {{be paid to the}} company, which would then furnish Heyer's salary and pay directors' fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother. Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, [...] "Books about the Brontës" [...] and [...] "How to be a Literary Writer", that were published in the magazine Punch. She once wrote to a friend, [...] "I'm getting so tired of writing books {{for the benefit of the}} Treasury and I can't tell you how utterly I resent the squandering of my money on such fatuous things as Education and <b>Making</b> <b>Life</b> Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers." ...|$|E
