Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF 4) is an open-channel separation technique that eliminates interference from column packing to the non-covalently bound complex and could potentially be applied for study of <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interaction.</b> The recovery and elution behaviors of the poly(dA) n strand and aptamers in AF 4 were investigated. Good recovery of ssDNAs was achieved by judicious selection of the channel membrane with consideration of the membrane pore diameter and the radius of gyration (R g) of the ssDNA, which was obtained {{with the aid of}} a Molecular Dynamics tool. The R g values were also used to assess the folding situation of aptamers based on their migration times in AF 4. The interactions between two ssDNA aptamers and their respective protein components were investigated. Using AF 4, near-baseline resolution between the free and protein-bound aptamer fractions could be obtained. With this information, dissociation constants of ~ 16 nM and ~ 57 nM were obtained for an IgE aptamer and a streptavidin aptamer, respectively. In addition, free and protein-bound IgE aptamer was extracted from the AF 4 eluate and amplified, illustrating the potential of AF 4 in screening ssDNAs with high affinity to targets. Our results demonstrate that AF 4 is an effective tool holding several advantages over the existing techniques and should be useful for study of diverse <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interaction</b> systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Surface {{immobilization}} of biomolecules is {{a fundamental}} step in several experimental techniques such as surface plasmon resonance analysis and microarrays. Oxime ligation allows reaching chemoselective protein immobilization with the retention of native-like conformation by proteins.

Second, proteinaceous components may modulate the properties of the lipid membrane itself, thus affecting the binding interaction of the AH peptide to lipid and/or other protein components. Because the AH peptide is amphipathic, physical properties of the lipid membrane are likely to {{play a significant role in}} this interaction. While the AH peptide demonstrated minimal binding to a planar bilayer, it is important to determine whether this interaction kinetics holds for all types of model membranes or whether it is the result of the platform design.

40|$|The {{nature of}} <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interactions</b> {{has been an}} area of deep {{interest}} for understanding many facets of biology. While {{a great deal of}} insight has been gained from structural knowledge, the contribution of protein dynamics to <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interactions</b> is not fully appreciated. This plays out from a thermodynamic perspective as the conformational entropy. The role of conformational entropy in <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interactions</b> has been difficult to address experimentally. Recently, an empirical calibration has been developed to quantify the conformational entropy of proteins using solution NMR relaxation methods. This method has been demonstrated in two distinct protein systems. The goal of this work is to expand this calibration to assess whether conformational entropy can be effectively quantified from NMR-derived protein dynamics. First, we demonstrate that NMR dynamics do not correlate well between the solid and solution states, suggesting that the relationship between the conformational entropy of proteins is limited to solution state-derived NMR dynamics. We hypothesize that this may be partially due to the role of hydration of the protein in its dynamics. Next, we expand our empirical calibration to over 30 distinct protein systems and demonstrated that the relationship between NMR dynamics and conformational entropy is both robust and general. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conformational entropy plays a significant role in <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interactions.</b> Using our empirical calibration, we then look to address if conformational entropy could be an important contribution to drug design. The latter process is often a brute force approach, and subsequent optimization of initial drug candidates is often a guess and check process. In silico drug design was thought to offer a more efficient and rational approach, but often relies on static structures. This minimizes or completely neglects the role that conformational entropy may play in binding. Here we experimentally determine the role of conformational entropy in the drug target p 38 a MAPK in binding to two potent inhibitors. We demonstrate evidence that conformational entropy may represent a tunable parameter in affinity optimization of lead compounds. This has important implications for lead optimization and strongly suggests that the role of conformational entropy be considered in drug design efforts. ...|$|R

Here we show that a highly conserved basic residue, Lys 399, on the lateral surface of FtsY provides a novel RNA tetraloop receptor to mediate the SRP RNA- and cargo-induced acceleration of SRP–FtsY complex assembly. We propose that the SRP RNA, by using its tetraloop to interact with FtsY–Lys 399, provides a transient tether to stabilize the early stage and transition state of complex formation; this accelerates the assembly of a stable SRP–FtsY complex and allows the loading of cargo to be efficiently coupled to its membrane delivery.

These different versions are collectively referred to here as ‘n-hybrid systems’. In another set of variations, the original configuration of the two-hybrid fusion proteins was modified to expand the range of possible protein–protein interactions that could be analyzed. For example, systems were devel-oped to detect trimeric interactions, ligand–receptor interactions or interactions that require particular post-translational modifications.

This dissertation focuses on the characterization of two important <b>macromolecular</b> <b>interactions</b> involved {{in the relationship between}} Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) and its host cell in horse: (1) the interaction between the EIAV Rev protein and its binding site, the Rev-responsive element (RRE) and (2) interactions between equine MHC class I molecules and epitope peptides derived from EIAV proteins. EIAV, one of the most divergent members of the lentivirus family, has a single-stranded RNA genome and carries several regulatory and structural proteins within its viral particle. Rev is an essential EIAV regulatory encoded protein that interacts with the viral RRE, a specific binding site in the viral mRNA. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, the interactions between EIAV Rev and RRE were characterized in detail. EIAV Rev was shown to have a bipartite RNA binding domain contain two arginine rich motifs (ARMs). The RRE secondary structure was determined and specific structural motifs that act as cis-regulatory elements for EIAV Rev-RRE interaction were identified. Interestingly, a structural motif located in the high affinity Rev binding site is well conserved in several diverse lentiviral genoes, including HIV- 1. <b>Macromolecular</b> <b>interactions</b> involved in the immune response of the horse to EIAV infection were investigated by analyzing complexes between MHC class I proteins and epitope peptides derived from EIAV Rev, Env and Gag proteins.
