50|$|Rarely, {{blindness}} {{is caused}} by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with ethanol for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits,</b> denatured ethyl alcohol, to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption. <b>Methylated</b> <b>spirits</b> are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess whether}} alcohol and {{glutaraldehyde}} are effective disinfectants against dried HIV the virucidal effects of 70 % alcohol (ethanol and industrial <b>methylated</b> <b>spirit)</b> and 1 % and 2 % alkaline glutaraldehyde were tested against cell associated and cell free HIV dried on to a surface. Virus stock (100 microliters) or 10, 000 cultured C 8166 T lymphocytes infected with HIV were dried onto sterile coverslips and immersed in 2 % and 1 % alkaline glutaraldehyde and 70 % ethanol for 30 seconds and one, two, four, and 10 minutes, there being an additional time point of 20 minutes for cell free virus disinfected with 70 % industrial <b>methylated</b> <b>spirit.</b> In addition, virus stock in neat serum was tested with 1 % and 2 % alkaline glutaraldehyde {{to see whether}} the fixative properties of glutaraldehyde impair its virucidal properties. Virus activity after disinfection was tested by incubating the coverslips (cell associated virus) or the coverslips and sonicated cell free virus with C 8166 T lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were examined for the formation of syncytia and HIV antigens were assayed in the culture fluid. Both 2 % and 1 % alkaline glutaraldehyde inactivated cell free HIV within one minute; 2 % alkaline glutaraldehyde also inactivated cell free virus in serum within two minutes, but a 1 % solution was ineffective after 15 minutes' immersion. Cell associated HIV was inactivated by 2 % alkaline glutaraldehyde within two minutes. Seventy per cent industrial <b>methylated</b> <b>spirit</b> failed to inactivate cell free and cell associated HIV within 20 and 15 minutes, respectively, and 70 % ethanol did not inactivate cell free virus within 10 minutes. Seventy per cent industrial <b>methylated</b> <b>spirit</b> and ethanol are not suitable for surface disinfection of HIV. Fresh 2 % solutions of alkaline glutaraldehyde are effective, but care should be taken that they are not too dilute or have not become stale when used for disinfecting HIV associated with organic matter...|$|R
