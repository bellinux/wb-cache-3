40|$|This {{dissertation}} advances {{the current}} state-of-the-art {{with respect to}} fatigue fracture in the marine industry by considering three interrelated issues in concert. The first involves the time-dependent nature of the fatigue inducing loads which, given a linear damage hypothesis, is typically a <b>mute</b> <b>point.</b> Intuitively, however, {{the order of the}} loading does matter and extreme overloads are not randomly dispersed throughout, but clustered together during physical storms. Therefore, the present work addresses the simulation of long, time-dependent (storm model) stress sequences which are stationary at one timescale (i. e., on the order of hours), yet decidedly non-stationary over longer intervals. Two categories of nonlinearities are simultaneously addressed. They are considered to arise from nonlinear ship motions and responses, and from the conversion of the resultant structural loading to equivalent fatigue damage and/or crack growth. In the present work, the former is taken to include the contribution of nonlinear wave-induced bending and whipping responses, whereas the latter encompasses the material hysteresis or load interactions inherent to variable amplitude loading. In accounting for this material hysteresis, focus is shifted from a hypothetical fatigue damage criterion (i. e., applicable to the crack initiation and early crack growth phases), to macroscopic fatigue crack growth behavior {{within the context of a}} damage tolerant design. By considering the time-dependent nature of the fatigue inducing loads, a novel modeling approach is proposed which extends the finite element analysis of plasticity-induced crack closure to variable amplitude, high-cycle fatigue predictions. In doing so, cycle-by-cycle material hysteresis is included through a time-dependent crack opening level. This approach is demonstrated to be both consistent and convergent and, in contrast to previous numerical studies, permits the incorporation of a material constitutive model suited to cyclic plasticity in structural steels. Implementing this model within the context of storm model loading, several aspects of the fatigue fracture process are explored. Elucidated behaviors include the influence of nonlinear ship responses, the significance of physical storms, and the random nature of the fatigue process over a finite interval of ship operation...|$|E

Jimmy Carter {{seemed to}} be the {{appropriate}} presidential candidate in the election of 1976 due to his personal characteristics of honesty, devotion to others and his incredible work ethic. He provided a type of possible salvation from the dual fiascos of Watergate and Vietnam, which had caused many Americans to simply write the political system off as corrupt, especially the presidential office. The political climate post Watergate is important to understand as well as the type of man Americans were willing to elect in 1976. Many scholars have looked to the Moral Jimmy (Morris Jimmy Carter: American Moralist) as just that type of man and yet that same trait may have made getting anything done a more difficult task in Washington. From his childhood and through his Naval career, Mr. Carter personified the small town boy. Growing up in a small Southern peanut farm, the Carters were never a rich family. Often waking early in the morning to help his father with chores, a sense of hard work was ingrained at an early age. Religion {{played a key role in}} his upbringing, as did the role of family, especially his mother. Incensed by the inequities he found in his post WWII hometown he entered politics. From a Georgia Senate seat to the governor???s mansion, Carter worked hard, promised not to lie, and to be thrifty with the people???s money. (Carter, Why Not the Best, Bourne, Jimmy Carter and Hyatt, The Carters of Plains) The Election of 1976 was in many ways a new type of election, altered by legislation hoping to curb the powers of an imperialistic president and yet it was also dominated not by the issues that had dominated early elections, for example civil rights and the policies in Vietnam. (Schram, Running for President 1976 : The Carter Campaign, Bitzer and Rueter, Carter v Ford: The Counterfeit Debates of 1976) Instead, it was a contest between two men promising healing and a new outsider perspective. In many ways, American voters said that they wanted a man of integrity first and then worry about the issues the nation was facing because without trust all else was a <b>mute</b> <b>point.</b> (see Appendix M: Carter???s Acceptance Speech at the Democratic Convention) Everything about his childhood and political career seemed to say that Carter was sincere in his goals, yet as crisis after crisis arose during his presidency he found it increasingly difficult to balance his personal feelings of morality with the political massaging necessary to get things done in Washington. From the Middle East to the economy, the Iranian hostage situation and the environment, Carter was always trying to do the ???right thing. ??? The hard work turned out to be overworked and the honesty was sometimes too honest for many American to swallow. (See Carter???s ???Crisis of Confidence??? Speech) Of course, Carter???s presidency has been viewed as ineffective and filled with contradictions (Mollenhoff, The President Who Failed: Carter Out of Control and Kaufman, The Presidency of James Earl Carter Jr.) In many ways the characteristics that made Carter a viable and popular candidate also hampered his ability to participate in the political process. Carter struggled with his desire to do the right thing in a world where that was not always possible. However once free from the constraints of the Oval Office, Congress and the constant scrutiny of the press, a Carter enveloped by his passions is revealed. (Brinkley, The Unfinished Presidency) Carter???s human rights efforts around the world have been recognized, including a Noble Prize...|$|E

40|$|Few months ago, the United States of America and Argentina {{signed the}} {{agreements}} to become official allies. Although every alliance is a bilateral fact, {{it is obvious}} {{in this case that}} it was Argentina that approached the U. S. first and not vice-versa. How can it be explained that a peripheral country, with a long tradition of isolationism, and even confrontation with the Washington, came to be this northern neighbor’s ally? Such a decision was not improvised, rather it {{was the result of a}} prolonged process of readjustment in Argentina’s foreign policy. To begin to explain this readjustment, three distinct levels of analysis should be undertaken. The first, the broadest, refers to changes in the international system that affected the way Argentina conceived of its foreign policy. The end of bipolarity altered the equation of costs and benefits of Argentinean diplomacy, raising the costs of isolationism and increasing the incentives for a new bilateral relation with Washington. The second level is more demarcated and refers to the events which influenced Argentinean society and its leadership: the profound transformation of this country’s political culture. A series of values that were absolutely unpopular when the transition to democracy began had become, by the end of the decade, <b>mute</b> <b>points</b> in the process leading to a democratic consensus. The change in the political culture was decisive in the construction of the new foreign policy. The third level of analysis is the most specific: the ideas and leadership style of President Carlos Menem. Though the vision and ideas of this Peronist leader have been fundamental in the decision to establish closer relations with Washington, his decisions are not explicable without reference to the other variables mentioned above...|$|R

Because he had included an address on the 'Warm Leatherette' single cover people had {{wanted to do a}} similar small scale deal with <b>Mute.</b> The turning <b>point</b> for <b>Mute</b> Records came when Miller listened to a tape by an artist called Fad Gadget and liked what he heard. In 1979 Mute Records began releasing singles by Fad Gadget including 'Back to Nature', the follow-up to 'Warm Leatherette'. Miller ran the label from his North-West London flat. Another early Mute signing was the American artist Boyd Rice (NON).|$|R

40|$|My work {{concerns}} wind {{instruments of}} the symphonic orchestra {{seen from the}} perspective of the current period ? that is instruments which in unconventional ways offer new sound possibilities. In the opening three chapters I will briefly outline common features of wind instruments, of their principles of sound creation, sound characteristics and the function of the wind instrument in the orchestra. I will focus on their notation, and on air consumption and breathing. The following chapters cover dynamic possibilities of wind instruments, articulation, sound effects and <b>muting.</b> The focal <b>point</b> of the work lies in the chapter about special possibilities of wind instruments, for instance, multiphonics, bisbigliando, double-trill, flageolets, slap-tones, echo-tones etc. In the closing chapter I sum up the results of my experiments of tremolo of all tone combinations in the main representative family of wooden wind instruments (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and saxophone). From the tests arise additional synoptic tables of special techniques...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} {{we present a}} series of {{algorithms}} developed to detect the following guitar playing techniques: bend, hammer-on, pull-off, slide, palm <b>muting,</b> harmonic, plucking <b>point.</b> Via the detection of these information, the instrument can be extended as a natural way to control external content (i. e. loops, audio effects, videos, light changes, etc.). The guitar used is a Godin Multiac with an under-saddle RMC hexaphonic piezo pickup (one pickup per string, i. e six mono signals, one per string). Two exhaustive databases have been recorded by two different guitarists with different playing technics (finger style picking and plectrum style picking) to test the different algorithms. Off-line implementation of the algorithms are showing good results. A global implementation on a dedicated software {{seems to be the}} solution to provide a more robust solution to real-time hexaphonic use. Implementation on FPGA have been investigated as well, in order to asses the problem of the big amount of processing power needed for hexaphonic detection...|$|R
5000|$|The show [...] "scores the argument" [...] by {{awarding}} {{points or}} deducting points from panelists {{at the discretion}} of the host depending on the strength or weakness of their arguments. The awarding and deduction of points has changed throughout the series. Originally, under host Max Kellerman, being muted cost a panelist five points. Later, Kellerman changed the scoring whereby [...] "good" [...] answers received two points, [...] "great" [...] answers received three, and a <b>mute</b> subtracted three <b>points</b> from a panelist's score. Shortly before Kellerman left the show, the mute was reduced to its current -1. After Tony Reali took over the show, the number of points awarded or deducted was randomized at his discretion. For example, Reali might give a single point for a weak argument, or many points for a particularly strong case backed by statistical information, or not. Points may also be taken away for self-promotion, such as bragging about a good column or a successful upset prediction. (According to Reali, [...] "Self-promotion is the mating call of the mute button!") In addition, complaints about how many points that they or another panelist received, usually results in a deduction and/or mute. Reali mainly uses the mute button when a panelist interrupts another panelist, begins to ramble, or changes his or her previous opinion on a given topic.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} European Constitution, {{which was}} just voted down in France and the Netherlands, is technically a treaty containing far-reaching amendments to the present set of treaties governing the European Union. Article 48 of the EU treaty text currently in force specifies that any such amendments first be unanimously approved by {{the governments of the}} member states within an Inter-Governmental Conference framework and then ratified by each country. The first, intergovernmental step of ratification was completed October 29, 2004. What has run aground now with the French and Dutch referenda is the second step—required, unanimous ratification by European member states. The likely halt to efforts to ratify the current document will force a reconsideration of the European Union’s legal alternatives for governance. The treaty on the proposed Constitution is <b>mute</b> on the <b>point</b> of nonratification, since any such provision would not be applicable until the treaty was ratified. However, Declaration 30, which was appended to the Constitution, states: The Conference notes that if, two years after the signature of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, four fifths of the Member States have ratified it and one or more Member States have encountered difficulties in proceeding with ratification, the matter will be referred to the European Council. The precedent for dealing with failure to ratify a constitutional treaty is both thin and only vaguely relevant to today’s situation. Historically, the European Council (made up of heads of member state governments) has been the forum for discussion after failed ratification. The Treaty of Maastrich...|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} (3000 words, {{including}} 19 footnotes) {{was written on}} January 29 - 31, 2011, as events unfolded in Egypt. It {{was published in the}} present version as an article on January 31, 2011, by OpenDemocracy, and may be republished with attribution for non-commercial purposes following the Creative Commons guidelines. The article’s sub-title is “From the Shah of Iran to Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister to Egypt’s Mubarak, cozy relationships in US foreign policy need to be questioned. ” Its point of departure is the Thatcher-Pinochet friendship, which is related to Hillary Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s interview in Egypt in 2009 when she downplayed the US Department of State 2 ̆ 7 s own report of serious human rights violations in Egypt (including a torture apparatus) while emphasizing, 2 ̆ 2 I really consider President and Mrs. Mubarak to be friends of my family. 2 ̆ 2 The article then shows how a version of family-ties coziness has plausibly played a role in how Sri Lanka has managed to <b>mute,</b> to the <b>point</b> of near-silence, US criticism. I take the reader through the first joint press conference held by Secretary of State Clinton and the just-appointed Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka G L Peiris, who attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar alongside former US President Bill Clinton. Amongst the notable omissions and elisions in Hillary Clinton’s remarks during that press conference was the complete failure to address her own Department of State’s report on approximately 300 incidents of possible war crimes in Sri Lanka that needed investigating. I return to Egypt in its present crisis by comparing the 30 years of support for Mubarak to the decades of US support for the Shah of Iran, which support then merged with President Jimmy Carter 2 ̆ 7 s inability to disentangle a personal rapport with the Shah from Carter 2 ̆ 7 s supposed human rights-friendly foreign policy. The piece ends with consideration of the implications for US foreign policy of cozy personal relationships with key politicians in repressive regimes – implications that go beyond adding a layer of complexity, extending to questions of ethical accountability...|$|R
