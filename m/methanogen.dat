5|$|In {{the carbon}} cycle, <b>methanogen</b> archaea remove {{hydrogen}} and {{play an important}} role in the decay of organic matter by the populations of microorganisms that act as decomposers in anaerobic ecosystems, such as sediments, marshes and sewage-treatment works.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the <b>methanogen</b> Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a <b>methanogen.</b> A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
50|$|Comparative genomic {{analysis}} {{has led to}} the identification of 31 signature proteins which are specific for the <b>methanogens</b> (also known as Methanoarchaeota). Most of these proteins are related to methanogenesis, and they could serve as potential molecular markers for the <b>methanogens.</b> Additionally, 10 proteins found in all <b>methanogens</b> which are shared by Archaeoglobus, suggest that these two groups are related. In phylogenetic trees, the <b>methanogens</b> are not monophyletic and they are generally split into three clades. Hence, the unique shared presence of large numbers of proteins by all <b>methanogens</b> could be due to lateral gene transfers.|$|R

Results showed that Methanoculleus sp. regarded as hydrogenotrophic and Methanosarcina sp. regarded as acetoclastic <b>methanogens</b> were present in turf tested. However, active acetoclastic <b>methanogens</b> were present in turf soil only. The current study showed that thermophilic <b>methanogens</b> were present in various turf grass species: Stenotaphrum secundatum, Cynodon dactylon, and Zoysia japonica. Severe treatments of grass leaves under oxic conditions, including blending, drying and pulverizing {{did not affect the}} thermophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity of the grass. A dried and pulverized grass extract could be generated that can serve as a readily storable methanogenic inoculum for thermophilic anaerobic digestion.

5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a <b>methanogen</b> that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, the Earth's {{atmosphere}} and biogeochemical cycles {{have been in}} a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic <b>methanogen</b> microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H2S + CO2 + hv → CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the Great Oxidation) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1billion years prior.|$|E

5000|$|Methanogenesis is the {{biological}} production of methane. It {{is carried out}} by <b>methanogens,</b> strictly anaerobic Archaea such as Methanococcus, Methanocaldococcus, Methanobacterium,Methanothermus, Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta and Methanopyrus. The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use {{of a number of}} unusual cofactors to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. [...] These cofactors are responsible (among other things) {{for the establishment of a}} proton gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis. Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized. Some <b>methanogens</b> reduce carbon dioxide (...) to methane (...) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas (...) chemolithoautotrophically. These <b>methanogens</b> can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms. The tight association of <b>methanogens</b> and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the <b>methanogens,</b> which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth. This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as interspecies hydrogen transfer. A second group of <b>methanogens</b> use methanol (...) as a substrate for methanogenesis.

Yet, the only possibility {{to assess the}} methane (CH 4) production potential of hydrogenotrophic <b>methanogens</b> is to apply gas chromatographic quantification of CH 4. In {{order to be able}} to effectively screen pure cultures of hydrogenotrophic <b>methanogens</b> regarding their CH 4 production potential we developed a novel method for indirect quantification of the volumetric CH 4 production rate by measuring the volumetric water production rate. This method was established in serum bottles for cultivation of <b>methanogens</b> in closed batch cultivation mode. Water production was estimated by determining the difference in mass increase in a quasi-isobaric setting. This novel CH 4 quantification method is an accurate and precise analytical technique, which can be used to rapidly screen pure cultures of <b>methanogens</b> regarding their volumetric CH 4 evolution rate. It is a cost effective alternative determining CH 4 production of <b>methanogens</b> over CH 4 quantification by using gas chromatography, especially if applied as a high throughput quantification method. Eventually, the method can be universally applied for quantification of CH 4 production from psychrophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic hydrogenotrophic <b>methanogens...</b>|$|R

25|$|Producing rice in paddies {{is harmful}} for the {{environment}} due {{to the release of}} methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, and live off nutrients released by rice roots. Researchers have recently reported in Nature that putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot (above ground tissue becomes larger, while below ground tissue is reduced), decreasing the <b>methanogen</b> population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.|$|E

2500|$|Syntrophy, in {{the context}} of {{microbial}} metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a chemical reaction that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable. [...] The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, ethanol and butyrate) by organisms such as Syntrophomonas. [...] Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable. [...] However, when a hydrogenotrophic (hydrogen-using) <b>methanogen</b> is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10−5 atm) and thereby shift the equilibrium of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (ΔGº’) to non-standard conditions (ΔG’). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is [...] "pulled" [...] towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: ΔGº’= +48.2 kJ/mol, but ΔG' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10−5 atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from ΔGº’= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to ΔG' = -17 kJ/mol at 10−5 atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.
