Existing GAMA catalogues of large scale structure, group and pair membership {{allow us to}} construct galaxy stellar mass functions for different environmental types. To avoid simply extracting the known underlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create a mass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses between 9. 5 ≤logM∗/h− 2 M⊙≤ 11 for each environmental population. Using these samples, we show that mass normalised galaxies in different large scale environments have similar energy outputs, u−r colours, luminosities, and morphologies.

40|$|From time to time, {{and quite}} more {{frequently}} in recent years, claims appear favoring a variable Initial Mass Function (IMF), one way or another, either in time or space. In this chapter we add our two pennies of wisdom, illustrating how the IMF affects various properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters. We start by showing that even relatively small variations of the IMF slope have large effects on the demography of stellar populations, moving {{the bulk of the}} stellar mass {{from one end to the}} other of the distribution. We then point out how the slope of the IMF in different <b>mass</b> ranges <b>controls</b> specific major properties of galaxies and clusters. The slope of the IMF below ~ 1 solar <b>mass</b> <b>controls</b> the M/L ratio of local ellipticals, whereas the slope between ~ 1 and ~ 1. 4 solar <b>masses</b> <b>controls</b> the evolution with redshift of such ratio, hence of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. Similarly, the slope between ~ 1 and ~ 40 solar masses drives the ratio of the global metal mass in clusters of galaxies to their total luminosity. While we believe that it is perfectly legitimate to entertain the notion that the IMF may not be universal, our message is that when proposing IMF variations to ease a specific problem then one should not neglect to explore the full consequences of the invoked variations.

50|$|Controls for {{prevention}} or mitigation {{of a red}} oil explosion are generally categorized as controlsfor temperature, pressure, mass, and concentration. Maintaining a temperature of less than 130 °C isgenerally accepted {{as a means to}} prevent red oil explosions. Sufficient venting serves to keep pressure from destroying the process vessel, while also providing the means for evaporative cooling to keep red oil from reaching the runaway temperature. Mass controls utilize decanters or hydrocyclones to remove organics from feedstreams entering process equipment capable of producing red oil. Limiting the total available TBP is another <b>mass</b> <b>control</b> that mitigates the consequence of a red oil explosion by limiting its maximum available explosive energy. Finally, concentration control can be utilized to keep the nitric acid below 10 M (moles/liter). A U.S. government study concluded that none of the controls should be used alone; rather, they should be used together to provide effective defense in depth {{for prevention}} of a red oil explosion.|$|E

Pesticides, such as pindone and 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate), are commonly distributed via aerial spray by helicopter as a method of <b>mass</b> <b>control</b> on islands infested with invasive rat populations. Bait, such as brodifacoum, is also used along with coloured dyes in order to kill and identify rats for experimental and tracking purposes. Another method to track rats is the use of wired cage traps, which are used along with bait, such as rolled oats and peanut butter, to tag and track rats to determine population sizes through methods like mark-recapture and radio-tracking. Poison control methods are effective in reducing rat populations to nonthreatening sizes, but rat populations often rebound to normal size within months. Besides their highly adaptive foraging behavior and fast reproduction, the exact mechanisms for their rebound is unclear and are still being studied.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates {{building}} thermal <b>mass</b> <b>control</b> {{of commercial}} buildings to reduce utility costs {{with a particular}} emphasis on the individual impacts of both adaptive comfort criteria and of heat waves. Recent changes in international standards on thermal comfort for indoor environments allow for adaptation to the weather development as manifested in comfort criteria prEN 15251. 2005 and NPR-CR 1752. 2005 relative to the non-adaptive comfort criterion ISO 7730. 2003. Furthermore, since extreme weather patterns tend to occur more frequently, even in moderate climate zones, it is of interest how a building's passive thermal storage inventory responds to prolonged heat waves. The individual and compounded effects of adaptive comfort criteria and heat waves on the conventional and optimal operation of a prototypical office building are investigated for the particularly hot month of August 2003 in Freiburg, Germany. It is found that operating commercial buildings using adaptive comfort criteria strongly reduces total cooling loads and associated building systems energy consumption under conventional and building thermal <b>mass</b> <b>control.</b> In the case of conventional control, total operating cost reductions follow the cooling loads reductions closely. Conversely, the use of adaptive comfort criteria under optimal building thermal <b>mass</b> <b>control</b> leads to both lower and slightly higher absolute operating costs compared to the optimal costs for the non-adaptive ISO 7730. While heat waves strongly affect the peak cooling loads under both conventional and optimal building thermal <b>mass</b> <b>control,</b> total cooling loads, building energy consumption and costs are only weakly affected for both control modes. Passive cooling under cost-optimal control, while achieving significant total cost reductions of up to 13 %, is associated with total energy penalties {{on the order of}} 1 - 3 % relative to conventional nighttime setup control. Thus, building thermal <b>mass</b> <b>control</b> defends its cost saving potential under optimal control in the presence of adaptive comfort criteria and heat waves...|$|E

It used a terminal sliding mode {{to ensure that the}} error reaches zero in finite time. The disturbance and coupled terms of the warhead were treated as uncertainties. An RBF neural network was used to estimate the uncertainties. A nonspinning warhead was taken in the simulation to test the performance of the presented controller.
