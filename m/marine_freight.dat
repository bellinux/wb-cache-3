As but one example of the achievements of the tabula rasa design: whereas the Winton 201A was doing very well with a 50,000 to 100000 mi piston lifetime, the 567 immediately achieved a 400000 to 500000 mi piston lifetime, and in at least one case, reached a 1,000,000 mi piston lifetime, a 10:1 to 20:1 improvement.|$|R
5000|$|Freight Rate, {{the cost}} of {{transporting}} goods, is reflective {{of a number of}} factors aside from normal transportation costs. [...] The main determining factors of freight rate are: mode of transportation (truck, ship, train, air craft), weight, size, distance, points of pickup and delivery, and the actual goods being shipped. One of the earliest forms of freight transportation was by water. Many of the earliest settlements were built along or near seacoasts and navigable inland waterways. As these settlements grew, roads and later railroads and pipelines had to be built to transport freight to and from the navigable waterways, thus connecting the inland points of pickup and delivery which could not be reached by navigable waterways. The development of roads, railroads, and even pipelines allowed for the expansion of settlements inland and away from water ways. Transportation by ships is very limited in nature. If there are no navigable waterways close to the pickup point and destination then a good will not be transported by a ship. Rarely is any good transported solely by ship; usually goods coming into ports by ship must be unloaded and transferred onto another mode of transportation i.e. truck or railcar for transportation to its final destination. With the expansion of railroad systems and the development of more efficient trucks, the transportation of freight by ships became less cost effective. Networks, of roads and train tracks which once carried freight from coastal and inland waterway ports to destinations which were not accessible by means of marine transportation, greatly expanded making freight transportation from port to port overland more efficient and more affordable than the <b>marine</b> transportation of <b>freight.</b>|$|R

Due to a law in Brooklyn banning steam locomotives, horses pulled trains from the Bushwick Depot to the East River Ferry Terminal in 1868. Steam dummy engines pulled trains from Bushwick depot to East River Ferry Terminal between 1869 and 1873. The two main railroad routes leading to the East River ferry terminals were along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, a route owned by the LIRR, and in Long Island City, a route owned by the Flushing and North Side Railroad (FNSRR). To provide a <b>marine</b> <b>freight</b> terminal, {{in the summer of}} 1869, a spur was built to the Newtown Creek at Furman's Island, which today is connected by landfill to the rest of Brooklyn.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLevel {{crossings}} or paved ballasted tracks laid in {{freight train}} container yards {{are subjected to}} train loads and forklift loads. Those asphalt pavements in the level crossings or paved ballasted tracks are designed using performance-based design method. Nevertheless, in the conventional design for ballasted tracks itself at the level crossing or paved ballasted tracks in the freight container yards in Japan, truck loads or forklift loads are generally not taken into account, and therefore, heavy duty truck loads or 12 ft-container-forklift loads had not induced a typical problem to level crossing structures or paved ballasted tracks. However, because of the recent increase in the transportation of the large <b>marine</b> containers on <b>freight</b> trains, very large forklifts have been increasingly introduced to freight container yard. Maximum wheel loads of those large forklifts reach up to 500 kN. Consequently, damages to level crossings and paved ballasted tracks in freight container yard are increasing. Concrete slab tracks {{are considered to be}} effective track structure to reduce the deformation of roadbeds or subgrades which are subjected to heavy forklift loads. However, to maintain the concrete slab tracks in the freight container yards in a decent condition, it is necessary to design the roadbeds and subgrades properly to avoid excessive deformation, because once the deformation are induced bebeath concrete slab tracks, {{it is not easy to}} correct track irregularity. To deal with above issues, deformation characteristics of subgrades, roadbeds and track structure under the heavy forklift loads were investigated using small scale model tests and full scale model tests in this study. In the scale model tests, moving wheel loads were applied to an asphalt paved ballasted track model and concrete slab model. In the full scale model tests, train loads and heavy forklift loads were applied on the asphalt paved ballasted track and concrete slab track. Through those tests, it was confirmed that the load applied by heavy forklift have predominant effect on the deformation characteristics of asphalt paved ballasted track. Besides, it was confirmed that the concrete slab track effectively reduces the vertical stress applied on the roadbed and subgrade...|$|R

The design would not be handicapped by requirements for marine, Navy, or stationary application. Most of the Winton experimental design group moved to Detroit where the redesign was to be made. After settling in Detroit we took a large piece of paper and on one side wrote down all of the troubles which were known in the 201A engine at that time. On the other side we were going to write down parts of the engine which had been satisfactory. These items were based on the four years experience in the field and the test work at Winton and General Motors Research. It did not take long to fill in one side of the sheet.

The container pre-marshalling problem is to arrange containers on the yard so that they will be loaded by quay cranes into ships efficiently. This paper deals with a special container pre-marshalling problem; i. e., we develop a marshalling plan to avoid conflicts caused by quay cranes requiring containers in the same lane at the same time. The problem is formulated as an integer optimization model, and a two-step heuristic optimization algorithm is presented. Computational experiments are conducted on actual data of a container terminal in Japan. Computational results demonstrate that our method finds better marshalling plans than those of the current system of the container terminal within a reasonable length of time...|$|E
40|$|Mauritania, one of {{the most}} {{dependent}} fish trade nations in the world, has an important octopus fishery within its EEZ. Fishing treaties between the EU and this Sub-Saharan nation have permitted 24 Spanish cephalopod trawling vessels to target this species for its export as a frozen product, mainly to Spain, Italy and Japan. This article presents Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology in order to assess and compare the environmental impacts related to the capture, processing and exportation of packed frozen octopus from this fishery to the main importing nations. Environmental results show that frozen common octopus presented a remarkable dominance of the fishing vessel activities, due to the high energy intensity of the fishery and to the fact that these activities include harvesting, processing and preliminary packaging. Post-harvesting activities presented low relative contributions in all impact categories, minimizing the food mile effect of exporting to Japan, thanks to the slow transportation through <b>marine</b> <b>freight</b> of frozen octopus. The results for fishery-specific indicators showed regular trends for trawling fleets, with high discard and seafloor impact rates. Therefore, improvement actions focused on the minimization of energy use and fishery-specific impacts and the shift to less ozone layer damaging cooling agents are the main targets in order to improve the sustainability of this product, as long as the slow freighting characteristics of the imported product are maintained.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the trends and evaluates {{the prospects of}} functioning of the Northern Sea Route. It shows that after the change of its management model its freight traffic has dropped 4 -fold, and in the Eastern sector (outside the Vilkitsky Strait) – 40 -fold. In the recent {{years there has been}} a certain revival of transportation, including transit, which reached its maximum of 1. 27 million tons in 2012. However, {{over the next two years}} they declined again; the drop was particularly significant in 2014 and amounted to a total of 240 thousand tons. The main problem is that this rather complex system is influenced by many factors, often contradictory and poorly predictable. Thus, the growing need for energy resources determines the overall need for developing the Arctic shelf. However, the possibility of climate cooling and the deterioration of ice situation can influence the possibility of transporting these resources. Besides, the Ukrainian crisis followed by the “war of sanctions” will cause a significant decline, especially in the medium term, the attractiveness of the European oil and gas market, which will cause the shift of strategic interests of Russian companies to the Asia-Pacific region. This necessitates the modernization of the Arctic transport and logistics system and introduction of new technical solutions. For instance, even nuclearpowered icebreakers series LA- 60 Ya that are currently under construction will not be able to escort linear tankers and gas carriers with a deadweight of more than 100 thousand tons along the eastern sector of the Northern Sea Route. It is necessary to create more powerful vessels of the classical type or to design new models. All these driving forces and constraints are not always predictable within the framework of standard economic and statistical approaches. In this regard, the study reflected in the article used expert approaches along with the methods of factor and economic analysis.
