One of the hooligans (now ex-hooligan and vice-president of the Potsdam Hells Angels) was a famous and dangerous fighter, who had beaten the French police officer Daniel Nivel into a coma in 1998.

2500|$|A reunification {{treaty was}} signed on 31 August 1990, and was {{overwhelmingly}} approved by both parliaments on 20 September 1990. On 3 October 1990, East Germany officially ceased to exist, and its territory joined the Federal Republic as the five states of Brandenburg, <b>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,</b> Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. [...] These states {{had been the}} original five states of East Germany before being abolished in 1952, and had been reconstituted in August. [...] East and West Berlin were reunited as {{the capital of the}} enlarged Federal Republic. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl confirmed that historically German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were definitively part of Poland, thereby relinquishing any claim Germany had to them. In 1993, Kohl confirmed, via treaty with the Czech Republic, that Germany would no longer bring forward territorial claims as to the pre-1945 ethnic German Sudetenland. This treaty was a disappointment for the German Heimatvertriebene ("displaced persons").|$|E
2500|$|On 22 July 2016 it was {{announced}} on Sky Sports that Cleverly would finally meet his long-standing rival [...] Juergen Braehmer (48-2, 35 KOs) for the WBA 'Regular' light-heavyweight title on 1 October at the Jahnsportforum in <b>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</b> in Germany. They were initially supposed to meet in 2011 at the O2, in London, and another fight was mooted in 2015, only for Cleverly to decide to fight in America against Fonfara. This was Braehmer's seventh defence of his title that he had held since 2013. On the night, Cleverly became a two-time world champion at light heavyweight, after Braehmer retired on his stool with an injured elbow {{at the end of}} the 6th round, which his promoter later confirmed was dislocated. The fight itself was back and forth action, with Braehmer winning most due to landing the more effective shots, particularly the left hook to the head.
