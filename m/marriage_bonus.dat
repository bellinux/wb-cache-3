50|$|The {{marriage}} penalty in the United States {{refers to the}} higher taxes required from some married couples with both partners earning income {{that would not be}} required by two otherwise identical single people with exactly the same incomes. There is also a <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus</b> that applies in other cases. Multiple factors are involved, but in general, in the current U.S. system, single-income married couples usually benefit from filing as a married couple (similar to so-called income splitting), while dual-income married couples are often penalized. The percentage of couples affected has varied over the years, depending on shifts in tax rates.|$|E
5000|$|Tooth offered {{numerous}} staff benefits. The company {{offered a}} £10 <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus</b> to those employees getting married {{while in the}} company’s service. Leave was four weeks per year, with 50% loading. Although there was no formal superannuation available, employees retiring from the company [...] "would be provided for" [...] on confidential terms. There was a staff social club coordinated by Kent Brewery. Following restructuring circa 1975, Tooth had a gymnasium (at Kent Brewery), [...] "Wet" [...] canteen (Kent and Waverley Breweries) and a (non-technical) reading room/library. The social club also purchased an old fishing boat, sponsored by the company. The social club published a magazine called Tooth Topics.|$|E
40|$|The tax regimes {{applied to}} couples in many {{countries}} including the US, France, and Germany imply either a marriage penalty or a <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus.</b> We study how they affect the decision to get married by considering two potential spouses who play a marriage proposal game. At {{the end of the}} game they may get married, live together without formal marriage, or split up. In this signaling game, proposing (or getting married) is costly but can indicate strong love. The striking property we obtain is that a <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus</b> may actually reduce the probability that a couple gets married. If the bonus is sufficiently large, the signaling mechanism breaks down, and only a pooling equilibrium in which fewer couples get married remains. Similarly, a marriage penalty may increase the marriage probability. Speciffically, the penalty may lead to a separating equilibrium with efficiency enhancing information transmission, which was otherwise not possible. Our results also imply that marriage decisions in the laissez-faire are not necessarily privately optimal. In some cases a bonus or a penalty may effiectively make the marriage decision more efficient; it may increase the number of efficient marriages that otherwise may not be concluded...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, the EITC will {{increase}} marriage penalties {{by at least}} $ 3. 1 billion (10. 4 percent) and reduce <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses</b> by $ 439 million (1. 5 percent). Over half of EITC-related marriage penalties will be attributable to couples who currently are ineligible for the EITC because their income is above $ 30, 000. However, estimates of <b>marriage</b> penalties and <b>bonuses</b> {{are very sensitive to}} assumptions regarding a couple’s living arrangements and custody agreements if they do not file joint returns. Recent proposals to provide marriage penalty relief through the EITC are well-targeted to lower-income taxpayers but vary in their ability to reduce marriage penalties. Measuring the Effect of the EITC on <b>Marriage</b> Penalties and <b>Bonuses</b> According to the General Accounting Office (1996), there are 59 provisions in the income tax code that either penalize or reward marriage. 1 The presence of <b>marriage</b> penalties and <b>bonuses</b> in the income tax code raises at least three concerns. First, one goal of tax policy is horizontal equity, or the equal tax treatment of equals. But the presence of <b>marriage</b> penalties and <b>bonuses</b> implies that two couples, who are similar except for the presence of a marriag...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{government}} and private post-war policies have contributed to a gendered division of labor. These include a family wage offered by corporations which subsidized health and housing subsidies, <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses</b> and additional bonuses for each child; and pensions for wives who earn below certain incomes. Additionally, in 1961, income for wives of working men were untaxed below $10,000; income above that amount contributed to overall household income. Corporate culture also plays a role; while many men are expected to socialize with their managers after long work days, women may find trouble balancing child-rearing roles {{with the demands of}} mandatory after-work social events.|$|R
40|$|The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) {{provides}} <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses</b> to some {{married couples}} and imposes marriage penalties on many others. The sources of these bonuses and penalties are the EITC eligibility rules, its non-linear benefit structure, and the phase-out of benefits at higher incomes. In this paper, {{we examine the}} source of the EITC marriage penalty, simulate the impact on the EITC marriage penalty of the reform included in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001, and then propose and examine additional reform that would both provide further relief from the EITC marriage penalty and improve labor supply incentives at the same time.

It also summarizes the origin of the marriage penalty and <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus.</b> The following two sections first discuss general equity issues, and then apply the ability-to-pay standard to examine how tax burdens vary by family size, across the income spectrum.

40|$|Excerpt] A {{series of}} tax cuts were enacted early in the George W. Bush Administration by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P. L. 107 - 16) and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA; P. L. 108 - 27). These tax cuts, which are collectively known as the Bush tax cuts, are {{scheduled}} to expire {{at the end of}} 2010. Beginning in 2011, many of the individual income tax parameters (such as tax rates) will revert back to 2000 levels. The major tax provisions in EGTRRA and JGTRRA {{that are part of the}} current debate over the Bush tax cuts are the reduced tax rates, the reduction of the marriage penalty (and increase in the <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus),</b> the repeal of the personal exemption phaseout and the limitation on itemized deductions, the reduced tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, and expanded tax credits. This report examines the Bush tax cuts within the context of the current and long-term economic environment...|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{four out}} of ten American {{children}} experience the divorce of their parents. This raises concern because studies in sociology, developmental psychology, and economics show that offspring of divorced parents fare worse than offspring of married parents. The belief that a two-parent family is the ideal environment for raising children is reflected in recent pro-marriage public policies. One difficulty with these policies {{is that there is}} substantial evidence that interparental conflict adversely affects children, and such policies may prolong conflict-ridden marriages. The first goal of my paper is to address the following counterfactual question: Would a child whose parents divorced have been better off had the child's parents not divorced? Another goal {{of this paper is to}} understand the impact on children's outcomes of implementable family policies, such as monetary incentives to stay married, better enforcement of child support guidelines, and modifications to existing child support regulations. To study the effects of these policies, one needs to know how family structure and children's outcomes are jointly determined. Thus, the third goal of my paper is to answer the question: Through what mechanism are children better or worse off when family structure changes? To address these questions, I develop and structurally estimate a sequential model of a couple's behavior (from marriage onwards). In the model, parents value the quality of their children, as measured by scores on cognitive tests. Parents can affect their children’s quality by investing time and goods, and by improving the quality of the marital relationship as captured by absence of conflict. Child inputs, labor supply, fertility, divorce, child support transfers, and children's quality are endogenously determined. Divorce enables parents to shield their children from conflict but precludes joint time spent by parents with their children. Conflict plays two roles in the model: it is an input in the child quality technology and may also be an impediment to the exploitation of the gains from trade within marriage. Conflict may trigger a divorce through either channel. When estimating the model, I allow for permanent unobserved heterogeneity in preferences and child quality technology. I use the estimated model to answer the first and last questions by simulating behavior excluding the divorce option at the point when partners first want to divorce. Specifically, I compare a child's cognitive achievement and the inputs invested in the child under the counterfactual and the baseline scenario. This comparison gives the counterfactual change in achievement for each child whose parents divorced. I address the question of how policies that change parents' incentives to stay married affect the wellbeing of children by simulating behavior when Arizona’s child support guidelines are fully enforced, or when West Virginia’s monthly $ 100 <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus</b> is paid to low income married couples. An interesting feature of Arizona’s guidelines is that the financial burden on the father depends on the amount of time he spends with his children. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, I find that a child whose parents divorced would have been better off had divorce not occurred. Specifically, both the mean and the median within-child difference in test scores are positive, and for 97 % of the children this difference is non negative. According to the model, the reason for the estimated gain in test scores is that, when the divorce option is no longer available, a child receives more maternal and paternal time, more goods, and parents engage in some but very little conflict. Second, I find that the West Virginia <b>marriage</b> <b>bonus</b> leaves the divorce rate unchanged; in fact, a bonus of $ 1200 per month would be required to reduce the divorce rate of low income couples by 5 %. Finally, under perfect enforcement, Arizona’s guidelines do not increase the time that fathers spend with children as intended. They do increase mother-child time within marriage, reduce female labor force participation (especially after divorce), and reduce conflict within marriage. divorce, cognitive achievement, children...|$|E
40|$|The United States {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} countries to retain the joint income tax return, available for heterosexual married couples only. Since its adoption in 1948, its underlying assumptions have been challenged on many valid grounds, and yet it remains firmly embedded in mainstream political and policy discourse. In recent years, most of the debate surrounding the joint return has focused on reducing <b>marriage</b> penalties, <b>bonuses,</b> and determining who among the universe of couples ought to be extended the benefit of the <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses.</b> The treatment of single people has received almost no attention. The scant attention paid to single people is striking in light of the most recent U. S. census data, which indicate that they are nearing a majority of the adult population, a trend one demographer describes as a 2 ̆ 2 clear tipping point. 2 ̆ 2 Moreover, awareness of singles as an overlooked demographic is starting to permeate the political and popular cultural consciousness. In addition, economists and other behavioral scientists, as well as feminist theorists, have begun to study singleness as a social identity. They have begun to gather persuasive evidence of the costs-economic, social, and psychological-that are imposed on single people, and to chart the development of a more vibrant social identity for single people. This article draws upon the research and insight from these other disciplines to assess the negative impact of the joint return on single people, and to challenge the fundamental assumptions underlying the joint return. It concludes that single people are unduly penalized under the joint return, and that it ought to be abolished...|$|R
40|$|Although both {{marriage}} {{penalties and}} <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses</b> {{exist at all}} income levels under the federal income tax, the system is tilted toward penalties for lower-income couples, toward bonuses for middle-income couples, and back toward penalties for upper income couples. This Article begins by explaining how the tax rules produce these differing treatments of marriage {{at different points in}} the income distribution. It then argues that the increase in recent decades in the social acceptability and prevalence of cohabitation makes tax marriage effects a more serious concern [...] in terms of both behavioral, effects and fairness-than in earlier decades. After demonstrating that Congress has never offered any justification for the differing tax treatments of marriage at different income levels, and that no plausible defense exists for the current distribution of penalties and bonuses, the Article offers several policy recommendations. The most basic and most important recommendation is simply that, whatever Congress does in this area, it should make conscious decisions about the appropriate distributions of penalties and bonuses at various income levels, instead of following its current practice of stumbling into a set of poorly understood and almost-impossible-to-defend effects...|$|R
40|$|Tax {{scholarship}} has long struggled with whether married taxpayers should be taxed differently from unmarried taxpayers. Currently, married taxpayers {{are subject to}} different tax rates than unmarried taxpayers, and may file a joint tax return. A married couple may pay a higher or lower amount of tax than an unmarried couple with the same total income, and a single person generally pays more tax on a given income than a married couple with a single earner with the same income. These outcomes are difficult to reconcile with a commitment to income tax progressivity, which in theory requires that higher incomes be taxed at higher rates. Moreover, the system penalizes some marriages, and benefits other marriages. This article takes {{a fresh look at}} the problem of <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses</b> and penalties, acknowledges that there may be difficulties with a separate filing system, but concludes that the joint return and special rates for married taxpayers should be abolished. In addition, drawing on the work of family law scholars, this article argues that a stronger case can be made for supporting parenting rather than marriage in the tax system...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{offers a}} brief {{examination of the}} key policy issues surrounding the EITC and marriage penalties. The EITC is designed to support low income working families with children. It provides a subsidy (up to $ 3, 816 in 1999) for families with children and low earnings. Current {{research shows that the}} EITC has been successful in raising the income of such families, increasing rewards/incentives to work among many low skill workers, and in stimulating greater work effort by single parents. 2 A less well understood feature of the EITC is its impacts on marriage incentives. The EITC can generate sizable <b>marriage</b> <b>bonuses</b> for some couples and marriage penalties for others precisely because it is targeted on low-income families with children. Those with no children or no earnings qualify for little or nothing. And because benefits are phased out as family income rises, those with children and high earnings also get little or nothing. Thus it creates marriage rewards for couples where a non-working mother is considering marriage to a working man without children. "Her " children and "his " earnings allow them to qualify for the EITC when neither would qualify otherwise. Conversely, when a single parent is already working and qualifying for the full EITC, marriage to another worker will usually result in an EITC penalty...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the consequences of}} happiness research for taxation. It focuses on the finding that happiness depends on status as well as income, examining how adding status concerns to standard optimal tax models changes the results. It then compares the empirical findings of the happiness literature {{to see whether they}} provide the type of data needed to parameterize the models, arguing that the models need different types of data than most happiness studies emphasize. The paper also looks at Robert Frank's arguments for a progressive consumption tax based on the findings of the happiness research. It finds that these claims are not supported by the current models or empirical data. Finally, the paper considers a number of other potential implications of happiness research for taxation, including <b>marriage</b> penalties or <b>bonuses,</b> special tax rates for the disabled, and age-dependent taxation.

40|$|Encouraging and {{strengthening}} marriage continues {{to move up}} the nation’s social policy agenda—and for good reason. Research consistently shows that married adults are emotionally and physically healthier and economically more secure than unmarried adults (Waite and Galla-gher 2000) and that children living with their married parents fare better than children in any other living arrangement on a host of indicators and outcomes (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994). 1 The fed-eral government’s commitment to promot-ing healthy marriages {{can be seen in the}} Bush administration’s proposal to spend $ 1. 5 billion over five years on marriage pro-motion and enhancement initiatives. 2 These initiatives include efforts to strengthen the relationships of currently married couples and to help unwed couples make informed decisions about marriage. Efforts to encourage and enhance marriage among cohabiting couples with children may be helped or hindered by financial incentives and disincentives embedded in U. S. tax and transfer pro-grams. Indeed, many analysts have pointed out that the taxes couples pay may vary widely depending on their marital status (Feenberg and Rosen 1995; Rosen 1987). For some couples, especially those made up of two low-income workers, their tax bills would be considerably higher if they were married than if they simply lived together. This phenomenon is referred to as the “marriage penalty. ” While “marriage penalties ” have received more attention in the press and halls of Congress, the struc-ture of the tax code also creates significant “marriage bonuses ” for other couples. In particular, unmarried partners with very different earning levels may pay less tax if they were to marry. Research on the prevalence of <b>marriage</b> penalties and <b>bonuses</b> is mixed. Previous studies have analyzed the effect of mar-riage on tax liability by analyzing prototyp-ical households (Carasso and Steuerle 2002; Lav and Berube 1998) or by dividing cur-rently married households (Dickert-Conli...|$|R
