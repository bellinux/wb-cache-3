5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a <b>manoeuver</b> known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped <b>manoeuver</b> the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling <b>manoeuver,</b> with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E
40|$|Understanding drivers’ {{responses}} to critical events, analyzing drivers’ abilities to perform corrective <b>manoeuvers,</b> and investigating {{the correlation between}} these <b>manoeuvers</b> and crash severity provide the opportunity of increasing the knowledge about how to avoid crash occurrence or at least mitigate crash severity. We extend existing research on the determinants of engaging in crash avoidance <b>manoeuvers</b> by considering that observable and unobservable factors relate to both the selection of corrective <b>manoeuvers</b> and the severity outcome. Accordingly, we propose a joint multinomial-logit ordered-probit model of single-vehicle crashes extracted from the NASS GES database for the years 2005 – 2009. Results show (1) the existence of unobserved correlation between crash avoidance <b>manoeuvers</b> and crash severity, and (2) the link between drivers’ attributes, risky driving behaviour, road characteristics, and environmental conditions, with the propensity to engage in crash avoidance <b>manoeuvers</b> and experience severe crash outcomes...|$|R

5|$|The race ended after Paul di Resta {{crashed on}} the start/finish {{straight}} {{shortly before the}} end, bringing out the safety car once again until {{the conclusion of the}} race. Caterham's Vitaly Petrov took 11th position which meant his team overtook Marussia in the Constructors' Championship. Former world champion Kimi Räikkönen had an eventful race as well, almost crashing into Vettel after the start and later trying to use an escape road only to find it to be a dead end. He later stated the way had been open 11 years prior, having made the same <b>manoeuver</b> at the 2001 race. He also had a close contest with the retiring Michael Schumacher, who finished seventh after recovering from an early puncture, but gave up sixth to Vettel in order to help him extend his small point advantage over Fernando Alonso in the championship.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{at the end of}} 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens {{collided}} at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna {{went on to win the}} race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, the Brazilian received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading Senna to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favoring his compatriot Prost. Senna's disqualification meant that it was mathematically impossible for him to overhaul Prost's points total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman. There has been much debate as to whether Senna was overambitious in his overtaking <b>manoeuver,</b> whether Prost intentionally ran into Senna, or whether the collision was simply a racing incident between two teammates who were embittered with each other.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} {{defensive}} strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense. In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court.

25|$|Prince Alexandros Soutzos' {{death in}} January 1821 {{led to the}} forming of a {{temporary}} Comitet de Ocârmuire ("Governing Committee"), three regents - all of them members of the most representative indigenous boyar families, of which the most prominent was Caimacam Grigore Brâncoveanu. The Comitet, motivated against competition and denied Phanariote rulers' favours, decided to quickly <b>manoeuver</b> anti-boyar and anti-Phanariote sentiment in Wallachia (and especially in Oltenia), acting before the newly appointed Scarlat Callimachi could claim his throne. Therefore, an agreement {{between it and the}} Pandurs was reached on the 15th: Dimitrie Macedonski was awarded the post of lieutenant to Tudor.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, e {{is usually}} {{preferred}} over oe and often over ae, but oe and ae are sometimes {{found in the}} academic and scientific writing as well as government publications (for example the fee schedule of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan). In Australia, encyclopedia and medieval are spelled with e rather than ae, as with American usage, and the Macquarie Dictionary also notes a growing tendency towards replacing ae and oe with e worldwide. Elsewhere, the British usage prevails, but the spellings with just e are increasingly used. Manoeuvre is the only spelling in Australia, and the most common one in Canada, where maneuver and <b>manoeuver</b> are also sometimes found.|$|E

25|$|Haughey's {{leadership}} {{came under}} scrutiny {{for a third}} time when a report linked Haughey with the phone tapping of political journalists. In spite of huge pressure Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey's success was partly due to the death of the Fianna Fáil TD Clement Coughlan, a supporter of O'Malley. Haughey's supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to <b>manoeuver.</b> Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.|$|E
25|$|The fight {{took place}} under new rules {{regarding}} knockdowns: the fallen fighter would have 10 seconds {{to rise to}} his feet under his own power, after his opponent moved to a neutral corner (i.e., one with no trainers). The new rule, which was not yet universal, was asked {{to be put into}} use during the fight by the Dempsey camp, who had requested it during negotiations. Dempsey, {{in the final days of}} training prior to the rematch, apparently ignored the setting of these new rules. Also, the fight was staged inside a 20-foot ring, which favored the boxer with superior footwork, in this case Tunney. Dempsey liked to crowd his opponents, and normally fought in a 16-foot ring that offered less space to <b>manoeuver.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} for the lack of experience, and to make use of standard land military tactics at sea, the Romans equipped their new ships with a special boarding device, the corvus. The Roman military was a land-based army, while Carthage was primarily a naval power. This boarding-bridge allowed the Roman navy to circumvent some of Carthage's naval skills by using their marines to board Carthaginian ships and fight in hand-to-hand combat. Instead of manoeuvring to ram, which was the standard naval tactic at the time, corvus equipped ships would <b>manoeuver</b> alongside the enemy vessel, deploy the bridge which would attach to the enemy ship through spikes {{on the end of the}} bridge, and send legionaries across as boarding parties.|$|E

25|$|To {{resolve the}} crisis, on December 11, 1876, the Constantinople Conference of the Great Powers was opened in Constantinople (to which the Turks were not invited). A {{compromise}} solution was negotiated, granting autonomy to Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina under the joint control of European powers. The Ottomans, however, refused to sacrifice their independence by allowing international representatives {{to oversee the}} institution of reforms and sought to discredit the conference by announcing on December 23, the day the conference was closed, that a constitution was adopted that declared equal rights for religious minorities within the Empire. The Ottomans attempted to use this <b>manoeuver</b> to get their objections and amendments to the agreement heard. When they were rejected by the Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire announced its decision to disregard {{the results of the}} conference.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, List {{commanded}} the German 14th Army in {{the invasion of}} Poland. It was List’s task to advance his army into southern Poland immediately {{at the start of}} the invasion, to form the extreme southern wing of an encircling <b>manoeuver</b> carried out by the German forces aimed at trapping the Polish field army in the general region of Warsaw. He didn’t fulfill this mission, although he met advance elements of the German XIX Panzer Corps under General Heinz Guderian a short distance south of Brest-Litovsk, on 17 September 1939. Following the conclusion of the fighting in Poland, which was accelerated by the occupation of the eastern part of the country by Soviet forces (as agreed to in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), List and his army remained posted in Poland as occupying forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{controller}} was a joint {{design by}} Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Hägglund, designated CMBK4. It {{was equipped with}} four cylinders. Those controlling the speed and braking were connected {{to each other and}} the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The cylinders controlling the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the main cylinder and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand and give it a more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to <b>manoeuver</b> the tram in traffic rather than a more technical control of the vehicle. The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls {{at the back of the}} vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and emergency braking.|$|E
