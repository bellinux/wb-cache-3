50|$|O’Beirne was {{a regular}} {{contributor}} on CNN's Saturday night political round-table program, Capital Gang, along with Al Hunt, <b>Mark</b> <b>Shields,</b> Robert Novak, <b>and</b> Margaret Carlson.

Months of {{investigation}} by Jamaica's Deputy Commissioner of Police <b>Mark</b> <b>Shields</b> <b>and</b> Scotland Yard failed to produce agreement on the cause of death. The jury convened to conduct the inquest into Woolmer's death concluded that there was insufficient evidence to return a verdict either of murder or of death by natural causes.|$|E
5000|$|FAIR {{seems to}} be accusing us of {{covering}} {{the people who make}} decisions that affect people's lives, many of whom work in government, the military, or corporate America. That's what we do: we're a news program, and that's who makes news... I take issue with the way the FAIR report characterizes each guest, which they have obviously done very subjectively. Witness the trashing of <b>Mark</b> <b>Shields</b> <b>and</b> Tom Oliphant (in the full report), who are not liberal enough for FAIR's taste. When you get down to arguing about degrees of left-and-rightness, I think you undermine your own argument.|$|E

To aid Duncan, a magic <b>shield</b> <b>and</b> the power to hurl fireballs can, fortunately, be found within the Dark Castle. The game begins in the Great Hall, where the player can choose from four doors. The large center door leads to the Black Knight. One other is <b>marked</b> with the <b>shield,</b> <b>and</b> the {{remaining}} two mysteriously alternate between the fireball course and a more troubling path. The game can be played at three different skill levels, the hardest [...] "Advanced" [...] level containing more enemies and a few extra surprises.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{parallel}} bridge was built, I-275 utilized a bypass designation system. Whenever {{there would be}} a major delay at the Howard Frankland Bridge, special signs would alert drivers to the delay and direct them to utilize the bypass, which ran along SR 694 and across the Gandy Bridge, to the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway, Willow Avenue, Howard Avenue, and ending at Interstate 275. Special <b>shields</b> (<b>marked</b> N <b>and</b> S) along the route made sure that drivers were using the correct thoroughfare.|$|R
50|$|The next day, the {{surviving}} villagers are placing the wrapped {{bodies of the}} dead villagers together. The survivors are not happy at Turok, who notices the Lost Land shaman. The villagers argue that Turok must avenge their dead, that the cave dwellers have come for Turok and darkness has fallen into their home, and blame Turok that he killed Koba. Sepinta persuades them and demonstrates the <b>mark</b> on a <b>shield</b> <b>and</b> mentions that with every sunrise, they fight for their lives, and this is their way, they do not fear it. She tells them that Koba could not hold them back and because of Turok, he died a hero. Later, the Cliff People gather their things and their mounts (which do not just include the terror birds but also mastodons, Uintatherium, and Arsinoitherium). Turok tells Sepinta {{that it is time}} for them to return to their own world.|$|R

50|$|Shipwrecked, 1999, is {{a mature}} example of Larwill’s {{intuitive}} approach to making art. Larwill was a keen sailor who appreciated the shape, feel {{and texture of}} timber-hulled boats. A voracious reader of the stories of seafarers and pirates, elements of the local environment and coastal folklore became important components of his work. The arrangement of the figures, boat, <b>shields,</b> <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> dots animate the painting. With its strong primitivist inclinations and clear stylistic references to Indigenous art, Shipwrecked combines the style of painting and sculpture Larwill developed subsequent to his time in New York. The palette of predominantly ochre, red and browns laid down over a bed of white and creams was a combination that features {{in a number of}} Larwill’s large works from the late 1990s and early 2000s.|$|R
