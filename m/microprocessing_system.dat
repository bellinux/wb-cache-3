40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA functional {{design of a}} microprocessor-based system is proposed {{as a model for}} the Naval Environmental Display Station for use by the Naval Weather Service Environmental Detachments. The design consists of four modules: control, communications, storage, and display. A software program prototype that simulates many of the proposed functions of the control module is discussed. The processing requirements for the communications module are presented along with a proposed hardware configuration. The storage module, based on a floppy disk system, is explained and its required functions defined. A display module utilizing an intelligent terminal and two CRTs is considered. The <b>microprocessing</b> <b>system</b> was designed to show not only the power and flexibility of this system, but also to demonstrate a potential application of low cost microprocessor technology.

40|$|An {{extended}} cost study {{consisting of}} 14 process scenarios {{was carried out}} to envisage the cost impact of microprocessing and microwaves separately or in combination for two liquid-phase model reactions in fine-chemicals synthesis: (1) Ullmann C–O cross-coupling reaction and (2) the aspirin synthesis. The former, a Cu-catalyzed substitution reaction, {{was based on an}} experimental investigation, whereas the latter, a noncatalyzed aromatic esterification reaction, was based on literature data. The cost of 4 -phenoxypyridine production, as a pharmaceutical intermediate in the synthesis of vancomycin or vancocin, was compared with that of the synthesis of aspirin, a key example of large-scale fine-chemical production plants. The operating costs in the Ullmann synthesis were found to be related to materialbased process (reactant excess, pretreatment, and catalyst synthesis), whereas those in the aspirin synthesis appeared to be related to downstream-based process (workup, waste treatment). The impact of an integrated microwave heating and <b>microprocessing</b> <b>system</b> on profitability was demonstrated with respect to operational cost and chemical productivity. Different modes of microwave heating and catalyst supply were studied and compared with conventional oilbath-heated systems in batch and continuous processes. The overall costs including profitability breakthrough for a competitive market price of product were obtained from various combinations of heating and processing. In case of the Ullmann synthesis, the CAPEX (capital expenditure) was negligible compared to the OPEX (operational expenditure), whereas in the aspirin synthesis, the CAPEX was found around 40 %, both at a production scales of 1 – 10 kg/day using proposed upscale methods. The source of the catalyst strongly determined the profitability of a continuously operated Ullmann process due to its effect on the chemical performance. Higher energy efficiencies could be attained using single-mode microwave irradiation; however, the energy contribution to the overall cost was found to be negligible. Different scenarios provided a cost-feasible and profitable process; nevertheless, an integrated microwave heating and microflow processing led to a cost-efficient system using a micropacked-bed reactor in comparison to wall-coated microreactor, showing a profit margin of 20 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a simple {{diffraction}} focusing element can alleviate mechanical tolerances in ultrafast laser microprocessing. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that, in comparison with a conventional refractive lens (RL), focusing light pulses of 30 fs onto a stainless steel sample with a diffractive lens (DL) can increase twice the useful axial ablation region. This is thanks to {{the combination of the}} broadband spectrum of ultrashort pulses, and the huge longitudinal chromatic aberration associated with DLs. We believe that our results might be useful for reducing the complexity and cost of ultrafast <b>microprocessing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{presents}} {{the technology of}} processing of requirements for systems with event-driven architecture. The technology consists of the stages of formalization, formal verification and conversion to design specifications. The formalization is the formal description of events as formal specifications called basic protocols. The consistency and completeness of basic protocols, safety properties and user-defined properties are verified. The deductive tools for dynamic and static checking are used for detection of properties violation. The method of enlargement allows reducing the complexity of proving and solving. Formal presentation of requirements allows converting them to SDL specifications and generating the test suite. The technology is realized in IMS system and applied in more than 50 projects of telecommunication, networking, <b>microprocessing</b> and automotive <b>systems...</b>|$|R
