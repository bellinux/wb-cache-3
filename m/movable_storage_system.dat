Two observations make us believe such <b>storage</b> <b>system</b> {{is crucial to}} efficiently support workflow-based applications: First, workflows generate irregular and application-dependent data access patterns. These patterns render existing generic <b>storage</b> <b>systems</b> unable to harness all optimization opportunities as this often requires enabling conflicting optimizations or even conflicting design decisions at the <b>storage</b> <b>system</b> level. Second, most workflow runtime engines make suboptimal scheduling decisions as they lack the detailed data location information that is generally hidden by the <b>storage</b> <b>system.</b> This paper presents a limit study that evaluates the potential gains from building a workflow-aware <b>storage</b> <b>system</b> that supports per-file access optimizations and exposes data location.
