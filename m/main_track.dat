5|$|In January 2008, the Gold Coast City Council {{released}} {{plans for}} a Mack Rides Water Coaster at Sea World. The ride would have been located {{at the front of}} the park, with the ride's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the <b>main</b> <b>track</b> extending out and over the car park. These plans were shelved. In December 2008, Sea World opened Jet Rescue, an Intamin JetSki Coaster.|$|E
5|$|The coaster {{features}} a dual station which {{is connected to}} the <b>main</b> <b>track</b> using a switch track segment (similar to a railroad switch). Dual-station operation allows for two trains to be loaded simultaneously for more efficient operation. This configuration existed since the ride debuted at Geauga Lake.|$|E

5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage door on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one <b>main</b> <b>track</b> and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles taped the <b>main</b> <b>track,</b> {{consisting}} of guitars, piano and drums, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. The session {{took place on}} 2 June 1966, the day after Harrison met Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar {{for the first time}} and secured Shankar's agreement to help him master the sitar. The band recorded five takes of the song before Harrison selected the third of these for further work. After reduction to a single track on the four-track master tape, their performance consisted of Harrison on lead guitar, treated with a Leslie effect, McCartney on piano and Ringo Starr on drums, with Lennon adding tambourine. The group then overdubbed vocals, with McCartney and Lennon singing parallel harmony parts beside Harrison's lead vocal. Further overdubs included maracas, the sound of which Pollack likens to a rattlesnake; additional piano, at the end of the bridge sections and over the E79 chord in the verses; and handclaps.|$|E

25|$|A {{sidetrack}} is {{a railroad}} track other than siding that is auxiliary to the <b>main</b> <b>track.</b> The word {{is also used}} as a verb (without object) {{to refer to the}} movement of trains and railcars from the <b>main</b> <b>track</b> to a siding, and in common parlance to refer to giving in to distractions apart from a main subject. Sidetracks are used by railroads to order and organize the flow of rail traffic.|$|E

5000|$|The Colaba-Borivali section (37.8 km) was {{electrified}} on 5 January 1928 on the 1.5 kV DC system. The two tracks between Colaba and Grant Road {{stations were}} electrified, while four tracks between Grant Road and Bandra railway stations were electrified. Only two suburban tracks between Bandra and Borivli were electrified in 1928, two <b>main</b> <b>tracks</b> were {{left for the}} steam locomotives. In 1933, Colaba railway station and two electrified tracks between Colaba and Churchgate railway stations were dismantled. In 1936, electrification was extended to the two <b>main</b> <b>tracks</b> between Bandra and Borivali railway stations, left earlier and the two <b>main</b> <b>tracks</b> between Borivali and Virar railway stations were also electrified, resulting in completion of the electrification of the Churchgate-Virar section.|$|R

25|$|In this example, a train {{may have}} {{authority}} straight through from Anna through Cloy. Or, {{it could have}} authority in Anna through Bess Siding, in which case it must throw the switch between Anna and Bess and enter the siding--this will usually be done to clear up the <b>main</b> <b>track</b> in preparation for an opposing train to pass. After clearing its authority in Anna siding and the opposing train passes, it might then get authority from Bess Siding through Cloy, in which case it will throw the switch between Bess and Cloy and reenter the <b>main</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{north end}} of the Crosstown Line is a flying {{junction}} with the IND Queens Boulevard Line and 60th Street Tunnel Connection just south of Queens Plaza. The line then travels south as a two-track line, except for a center relay track south of Court Square. At the turn from Marcy Avenue to Lafayette Avenue, two center tracks appear, merging into one after crossovers to the <b>main</b> <b>tracks.</b> These tracks were to be used for a split to another line in a 1931 expansion plan. This center track continues through Bedford–Nostrand Avenues and then ends with crossovers to the <b>main</b> <b>tracks,</b> but space remains in the center through Classon Avenue for the third track.|$|R
