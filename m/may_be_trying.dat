5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by the beetles, but they find the beetles to be larger and more mature. From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to breed the beetles in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E
5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner had a rocky {{relationship}} with the United States. Several items from a US air force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a diplomatic crisis. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley {{said that they were}} standard tools used in counter-terrorism tactics which were being taught to the Argentine police during the joint operation, and asked for the return of the seized materials. Kirchner blamed the whole country for the 2014 default, ruled by US judge Thomas P. Griesa. She said in a cadena nacional ("national network") address that the US <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to oust her from power, or even assassinate her. She said this a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her. The idea was rejected by opposition leader Elisa Carrió as a mere conspiracy theory.|$|E

5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} causes for this disorder. One such possibility is an underlying personality disorder. Individuals with FD <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to repeat a satisfying childhood {{relationship with a}} doctor. Perhaps also an individual has a desire to deceive or test authority figures. The underlying desire to resume {{the role of a}} patient and be cared for can also be considered an underlying personality disorder. Abuse, neglect, or abandonment during childhood are also probable causes.|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to reenact unresolved {{issues with}} their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may {{also contribute to}} the development of this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E
500|$|Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times {{said that is}} difficult to recognize Lady Gaga [...] "out of her usual get-ups: the meat dresses, seashell bikinis, towering stilettos and skyscraper hair" [...] and praised Bennett's vocals [...] "his voice still strong at 88, take on the Great American Songbook and prove again that the classics can bridge many divides." [...] Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Washington Post wrote [...] "It's become practically cliché to note what an odd couple they make, so we'll just remind you they're actually both divine live performers and they've got great chemistry." [...] Jeff Pfeiffer from Channel Guide said that although Bennett and Gaga [...] "engage in some playfulness and camaraderie which is generally fun, though Lady Gaga <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> too hard at times". He added that [...] "The artists and the terrific orchestra are in fine form, and though the editing between numbers seemed a bit rapid on occasion, the production and directing is effective to capture the performances".|$|E

500|$|Most nouns {{have one}} or more {{particular}} classifiers associated with them, often depending {{on the nature of}} the things they denote. For example, many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier (...) zhāng, whereas many long and thin objects use (...) tiáo. The total number of classifiers in Chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred, depending on how they are counted. The classifier [...] (...) , pronounced gè or ge in Mandarin, apart from being the standard classifier for many nouns, also serves as a general classifier, which may often (but not always) be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is [...] "correct" [...] when asked. Mass-classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense: for example, hé ("box") may be used to denote boxes of objects, such as lightbulbs or books, even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count-classifiers if being counted as individual objects. Researchers have differing views as to how classifier–noun pairings arise: some regard them as being based on innate semantic features of the noun (for example, all nouns denoting [...] "long" [...] objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent longness), while others see them as motivated more by analogy to prototypical pairings (for example, [...] "dictionary" [...] comes to take the same classifier as the more common word [...] "book"). There is some variation in the pairings used, with speakers of different dialects often using different classifiers for the same item. Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or pragmatic concerns on the part of a speaker who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to foreground new or important information.|$|E

Alternatively systemic immunosuppressants <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> such as ciclosporin, methotrexate, interferon gamma-1b, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine. Antidepressants and naltrexone <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used to control pruritus (itchiness). In 2017, the biologic agent dupilumab was approved to treat moderate-to-severe eczema.|$|R
