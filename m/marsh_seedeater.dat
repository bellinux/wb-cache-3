5000|$|A rare {{seedeater}} {{very similar}} to this species breeds in the Entre Ríos province of Argentina, and a few individuals {{have been found in}} Corrientes province and in southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, and southeastern Uruguay. [...] It has been listed as a separate species, Sporophila zelichi (Narosky 1977), the Entre Ríos, white-collared, Zelich's, or Narosky's seedeater. Differences are that it has a wide white collar {{all the way around the}} neck; the back is chestnut, not grey; and the rufous of the belly is darker than the marsh seedeater's. However, its status has been controversial since its discovery; some have suggested that it is a color morph of the <b>marsh</b> <b>seedeater</b> or the chestnut seedeater, or a hybrid between the two. The few recorded songs are the same as those of the <b>marsh</b> <b>seedeater.</b> Accordingly, the American Ornithologists' Union's South American Classification Committee voted in 2008 to remove S. zelichi from their list, with two voters favoring the suggestion that it is a morph of the <b>marsh</b> <b>seedeater.</b> [...] Following them, it is considered to belong to the <b>marsh</b> <b>seedeater</b> here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marsh</b> <b>seedeater</b> (Sporophila palustris) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is sexually dichromic, with the males {{sporting}} a bright white throat, grey crown and chestnut belly, and the females resembling other brown female seedeaters.|$|E
50|$|The area is {{used for}} {{breeding}} by many aquatic birds, particularly maguari stork (Ciconia maguari) and snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis).Important bird species observed in the reserve include greater rhea (Rhea americana), sulphur-bearded spinetail (Cranioleuca sulphurifera), <b>marsh</b> <b>seedeater</b> (Sporophila palustris and Sporophila zelichi) and chestnut seedeater (Sporophila cinnamomea).|$|E
40|$|The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Seedeater</b> Sporophila palustris {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} and least known of the capuchino seedeaters. Breeding populations are patchy, occurring in north-east Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay. We present data on the breeding biology of the species, and describe nests and eggs, behaviour (including courtship, nesting, incubation and parental care), breeding sites and food items. Marsh Seedeaters breed in well-preserved grasslands with wet soils and tall vegetation. In general, these habitats are used for extensive livestock ranching. Main threats are overgrazing, widespread use of fire, conversion of grasslands to pastures of exotic grasses and rice fields, afforestation, and illegal trapping. Most breeding sites are located in Important Bird Areas, but only one in Brazil and one in Argentina are protected. We propose a series of actions to promote the conservation of Marsh Seedeaters and other endangered birds that coexist in grassland habitats...|$|E
40|$|Populations of {{grassland}} {{birds are}} declining in Brazil due to profound alterations to grassland habitats. In this paper, we present recent records and range extensions for 12 threatened or little known Brazilian grassland species: Ocellated Crake Micropygia schomburgkii, Sickle-winged Nightjar Eleothreptus anomalus, Campo Miner Geositta poeciloptera, Rufous-sided Pygmytyrant Euscarthmus rufomarginatus, Sharp-tailed Grass-tyrant Culicivora caudacuta, Cocktailed Tyrant Alectrurus tricolor, Cinereous Warbling-finch Poospiza cinerea, Black-masked Finch Coryphaspiza melanotis, Tawny-bellied Seedeater Sporophila hypoxantha, <b>Marsh</b> <b>Seedeater</b> S. palustris, Chestnut Seedeater S. cinnamomea and Black-bellied Seedeater S. melanogaster. We also {{comment on the}} biogeography and conservation of these species.
