5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy <b>mesocarp,</b> which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The <b>mesocarp</b> of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
25|$|The outer, often edible layer, is the pericarp, {{formed from}} the ovary and {{surrounding}} the seeds, although in some species other tissues contribute to or form the edible portion. The pericarp may {{be described in}} three layers from outer to inner, the epicarp, <b>mesocarp</b> and endocarp.|$|E
25|$|The fully grown {{fruit is}} a drupe of 4–10 × 2–3cm, ovoid to cylindric, with five {{prominent}} ribs, with the <b>mesocarp</b> initially woody but supposedly pulpy and edible when fully ripe. It contains brown or almost black, finely wrinkled, irregularly compressed, oval, keeled seeds of 4½–7½ × 3–3½mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{fruits of}} the edible and {{medicinal}} Egyptian palm, Medemia argon, were collected from Aswan in Egypt and the essential oil (EO) from fruits and headspace (HS) of the seeds and fleshy <b>mesocarps</b> were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Results obtained by GC-MS analysis indicated a high variability in the oil and in the headspace from seeds and <b>mesocarps.</b> Sesquiterpene derivatives were the main group of volatiles in the EO from fruits and in the HS from seeds (45. 0 and 64. 0 %, respectively), while oxygenated hydrocarbon derivatives were the main constituents in the HS obtained from fleshy <b>mesocarps</b> (96. 5 %). The different chemical composition of the headspace obtained from the seeds and <b>mesocarps</b> of M argon can be correlated with the different roles that the different constituents play {{in the prevention of}} dehydration of the fruits in the desert region from where the plant was collected...|$|R
50|$|The {{greater coucal}} {{is a large}} bird which takes {{a wide range of}} insects, {{caterpillars}} and small vertebrates such as the Saw-scaled vipers. They are also known to eat bird eggs, nestlings, fruits and seeds. In Tamil Nadu they were found to feed predominantly on snails Helix vittata. They are also known to feed on the toxic fruits of Cascabela thevetia (Yellow Oleander). In Oil palm cultivation, they have been noted as an avian pest due to their habit of eating the fleshy <b>mesocarps</b> of the ripe fruits.|$|R
5000|$|Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds {{have been}} found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. [...] The Huaorani of Amazonian Ecuador use the <b>mesocarps</b> for food. They use the petiole and leaf rachis to make blowgun darts and {{sleeping}} mats, the petioles for torches, the pinnae for kindling and the stems for firewood. [...] In addition to using is as a food species, Kayapó of Brazil use the species as a source of salt, and value it because it attracts wildlife. [...] The leaves are also used for thatching.|$|R
25|$|An {{enormous}} number of cultivars have, like the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, <b>mesocarp)</b> that is more closely attached to the segments.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} staple to {{the people}} who settled at Kintampo was the oil palm. The oil palm was used at Kintampo starting at least 4000 years ago. A very useful plant in many ways, it serves as a source of drink, food, and construction material. It was allowed to flourish in the region due to its preference for a constant warm climate and high rainfall. As a food, the oil can be extracted from the <b>mesocarp</b> which covers the plant, and the kernel which is also edible by itself. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, which would have helped to support a growing population.|$|E
25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called epicarp), <b>mesocarp</b> (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms.|$|E
40|$|Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth) is {{cultivated}} by smallholders in Central {{and northern}} South America, principally for fruit production. In 1997, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and Peru’s National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA) began a participatory genetic improvement programme of the species. The programme {{was started by}} collecting open-pollinated seed from 402 selected trees. We describe relationships between fruit characteristics of these trees, and between these characteristics and environmental variables of the collection sites. Significant relationships included the following: negative correlations between number of fruits raceme− 1 and measures of individual fruit size and weight (− 0. 34 to − 0. 49); non-independence between exocarp colour and fruit size (fruits with greenish-red exocarps were the largest and heaviest); unstriated fruit tended to be smaller than striated fruit; fruits with white <b>mesocarps</b> had starchy, yellow exocarps and tended to be lighter (but not smaller) than fruits with creamy-orange <b>mesocarps,</b> although total fruit weight raceme− 1 was higher for white mesocarps; starchy fruits, which included all yellow fruits, were bigger and heavier than oily fruits, and with higher total fruit weight raceme− 1. Total fruit weight raceme− 1 and numbers of fruit raceme− 1 were affected by site variables, but measures of individual size and weight and categorical fruit variables were largely unaffected. We suggest that categorical fruit variables and measures of individual fruit size and weight {{are likely to have}} higher heritabilities than total fruit weight raceme− 1 or number of fruits raceme− 1, and that phenotypic correlations involving those traits that appear to be little affected by environmental variables {{are more likely to have}} stronger genotypic components than correlations involving traits that are susceptible to environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{dielectric}} {{models are}} required for proper sensing and characterization of materials especially {{for the purpose of}} quality control. In this work, a multi-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was designed to model the complex permittivity of the <b>mesocarps</b> of oil palm fruitlets within the frequency range of 2 - 4 GHz. The system consists of two ANFIS models with same sets of inputs; one ANFIS model for the dielectric constant and the other for the loss factor. Training data were obtained from laboratory microwave measurements with the aid of Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and used for the ANFIS model. The evaluation of the performance of the model confirms the suitability of the multi-ANFIS model for rapid and accurate determination of the dielectric properties of the fruitlets...|$|R
30|$|Electrophoresis (for {{both the}} method {{development}} gels and the 2 DE proteome maps) {{was conducted in}} a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN® Tetra Cell apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 200  V (Powerpac 300, Bio-Rad Laboratories). The separated proteins were fixed in the gels for 30  min [50 (v/v) ethanol, 10  % (v/v) acetic acid] and stained with Colloidal Coomassie G- 250 (Candiano et al. 2004). The gels were de-stained in water until the background was clear. Gel images were obtained with a DLSR camera (Nikon D 100, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The settings were ISO 200, f 16 for the aperture and a shutter speed of 1 / 40 th of a second. Image processing was done with analySIS software (Soft Imaging System GmbH, Germany). Protein spot detection and subsequent protein spot-to-spot comparative analysis were done with PDQuest 2 D analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The reproducibility of the 2 DE protein profiles was determined using {{three independent biological replicates}} for low and high oleic acid oil palm <b>mesocarps.</b>|$|R
500|$|Cucurbita fruits {{are large}} and fleshy. Botanists {{classify}} the Cucurbita fruit as a pepo, which is a special type of berry derived from an inferior ovary, with a thick outer wall or rind with hypanthium tissue forming an exocarp around the ovary, and a fleshy interior composed of <b>mesocarp</b> and endocarp. The term [...] "pepo" [...] is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits, where this fruit type is common, but the fruits of Passiflora and Carica are sometimes also pepos. The seeds, which {{are attached to the}} ovary wall (parietal placentation) and not to the center, {{are large and}} fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two cotyledons. Fruit size varies considerably: wild fruit specimens can be as small as [...] and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over [...] The current world record was set in 2014 by Beni Meier of Switzerland with a [...] pumpkin.|$|E
2500|$|Fruit type {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a useful character in classification and in understanding the phylogeny of plants. The evolution of fruits with a berry-like pericarp has been studied {{in a wide range of}} flowering plant families. Repeated transitions between fleshy and dry pericarps have been demonstrated regularly. One well-studied family is the Solanaceae, because of the commercial importance of fruit such as tomatoes, bell peppers, and eggplants or aubergines. Capsules, which are dry dehiscent fruits, appear to be the original form of the fruit in the earliest diverging members of the family. Berries have then evolved at least three times: in Cestrum, Duboisia, and in the subfamily Solanoideae. Detailed anatomical and developmental studies have shown that the berries of Cestrum and those of the Solanoideae are significantly different; for example, expansion of the fruit during development involves cell divisions in the <b>mesocarp</b> in Solanoideae berries, but not in Cestrum berries.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{names have}} been given to the many {{varieties}} of the genus. Orange applies primarily to the sweet orange – Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. The orange tree is an evergreen, flowering tree, with an average height of , although some very old specimens can reach [...] Its oval leaves, alternately arranged, are [...] long and have crenulate margins. Sweet oranges grow in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue, the white, bitter <b>mesocarp</b> or albedo (pith). The orange contains a number of distinct carpels (segments) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by a membrane, and containing many juice-filled vesicles and usually a few seeds (pips). When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non-climacteric. The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.|$|E
40|$|Pistachio fruit components, {{including}} hulls (<b>mesocarps</b> and epicarps), seed coats (testas), and kernels (seeds), all {{contribute to}} variable aflatoxin content in pistachios. Fresh pistachio kernels were individually inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and incubated 7 or 10 days. Hulled, shelled kernels were either left intact or wounded prior to inoculation. Wounded kernels, {{with or without the}} seed coat, were readily colonized by A. flavus and after 10 days of incubation contained 37 times more aflatoxin than similarly treated unwounded kernels. The aflatoxin levels in the individual wounded pistachios were highly variable. Neither fungal colonization nor aflatoxin was detected in intact kernels without seed coats. Intact kernels with seed coats had limited fungal colonization and low aflatoxin concentrations compared with their wounded counterparts. Despite substantial fungal colonization of wounded hulls, aflatoxin was not detected in hulls. Aflatoxin levels were significantly lower in wounded kernels with hulls than in kernels of hulled pistachios. Both the seed coat and a water-soluble extract of hulls suppressed aflatoxin production by A. flavus...|$|R
30|$|Proteins {{from the}} plant {{chromoplast}} are essential for many physiological processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Different protein extraction methods were tested {{to find the most}} robust method to obtain oil palm chromoplast proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. Initially, two different solvents were employed to reduce the fruit lipids. Then, two plant cell wall digestive enzymes were used to acquire the protoplasts to increase the protein extraction effectiveness. A two-stage centrifugation-based fractionation approach enhanced the number of identified proteins, particularly the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The effectiveness of each extraction method was assessed using protein yields and 2 DE gel profiles. The ideal method was successfully used to establish the 2 DE chromoplast proteome maps of low and high oleic acid <b>mesocarps</b> of oil palm. Further nanoLC–MS/MS analysis of the extracted chromoplast proteins led to the identification of 162 proteins, including some of the main enzymes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis. The established procedures would provide a solid foundation for further functional studies, including fatty acid biosynthetic expression profiling and evaluation of regulatory function.|$|R
30|$|A {{combination}} of TCA and acetone {{was used in}} the first wash as this combination had been reported to be more effective than either TCA or acetone alone (Agrawal et al. 2010). Acetone dissolves simple lipids and glycolipids (Rastegari et al. 2011). This washing stage was limited to two washes only as prolonged exposure to low pH caused by TCA could potentially modify and/or degrade proteins. In the second wash, aqueous methanol in the presence of ammonium acetate salt was employed to remove more lipids from <b>mesocarps.</b> Polar solvents, such as methanol, are able to solubilize polar lipids like phospholipids and glycosphingolipids (Christie 1993). Aqueous methanol is also routinely used in extraction of phenolic compounds (Wang et al. 2006), which is advantageous for recalcitrant tissues since these tissues contain high amounts of phenolics. A {{combination of}} salt and organic solvent was employed in this washing stage to eliminate any residual TCA, and also to produce an alkaline pH for subsequent protein extraction using phenol (Wang et al. 2006). The wash involved the utilization of aqueous acetone to remove any residual lipids.|$|R
60|$|Every perfect husk, vulgarly pericarp, or 'round-fruit,'--(as periwig, 'round-wig,')--consists of a shell, (vulgarly endocarp,) rind, (vulgarly <b>mesocarp,)</b> and skin, (vulgarly epicarp); three {{essential}} parts altogether. But {{one or more}} of these parts may be effaced, or confused with another; and in the seeds of grasses they all concentrate themselves into bran.|$|E
50|$|The {{zest and}} <b>mesocarp</b> {{vary with the}} {{genetics}} of the fruit. Fruit with peels that are almost all flavedo are generally mandarines; relatives of pummelos and citrons tend to have thicker <b>mesocarp.</b> The <b>mesocarp</b> of pummelo relatives (grapefruit, orange, etc.) is generally more bitter; the <b>mesocarp</b> of citron relatives (Mexican and Persian limes, alemows etc.) is milder. The lemon is a hybrid of pummelo, citron, and mandarin. The <b>mesocarp</b> is also edible, and is used to make succade.|$|E
50|$|Edible oil can be {{extracted}} from the <b>mesocarp</b> and kernel of A. maripa. Oleic acid is the predominant fatty acid in oil {{extracted from the}} <b>mesocarp,</b> while lauric acid predominates in the kernel. About half of the fatty acids in the <b>mesocarp</b> oil are saturated and half unsaturated. The tocopherol content of the <b>mesocarp</b> oil was average (in comparison to other edible oils) while the kernel oil was low in tocopherols.|$|E
40|$|Fossil fruits {{pertaining}} to the mangrove palm genus Nypa Steck, (Arecaceae, Arecales) were collected from a new plant-bearing assemblage in the Arguis Formation (Fm.), northeastern Ebro Basin (Arguis, Huesca Province, Spain). This formation is Bartonian to early Priabonian in age and comprises pro delta and carbonate platform deposits. The new assemblage consists of nine specimens of fossil Nypa fruits and one monocotyledon leaf fragment. Over half of these fossil fruits are nearly-complete (i. e. with preserved <b>mesocarps)</b> while the other represent endocarps. From {{the point of view}} of morphology and size they resemble other European records of this genus. The type of remain preserved (fruits or endocarps), presence of abrasion, Teredo borings and sedimentary facies provide criteria to infer contrasting lengths of transport (drifting). However, they indicate in all cases that these fossil fruits were afloat in seawater for a considerable time. The discovery of Nypa fruits suggests a tropical-subtropical climate in the area, as well as the presence of a coastal environment and littoral forests during deposition. This interpretation corroborates previous findings from the nearby Eocene outcrops of the Catalan Central Depression (Eastern Pyrenees range) ...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the historical biogeography of the southern hemisphere and evolutionary responses of plants to aridity, we undertook a detailed phylogenetic study of the predominantly southern family Elaeocarpaceae sensu lato (including Tremandraceae). Plastid trnL-trnF and nuclear ITS sequence {{data were analyzed using}} parsimony and Bayesian methods and molecular evolutionary rates calibrated using the Oligocene fossil record of Elaeocarpus <b>mesocarps</b> to estimate the minimum divergence dates. The results indicate the monophyly of all recognized genera and a placement for the former Tremandraceae (three genera and about 49 species of shrubby, dry-adapted Australian plants) within the widespread predominantly rainforest tree family Elaeocarpaceae (nine genera, over 500 species). The former Tremandraceae clade diverged from its sister (Aceratium + Elaeocarpus + Sericolea) during the Paleocene, after which it underwent a marked acceleration in evolutionary rate. Furthermore, this lineage diversified during the late Miocene, coincident with widespread aridification in Australian environments and extensive radiations of several sclerophyllous groups. The role of dispersal in explaining the current geographical distribution of Elaeocarpaceae is illustrated by Aristotelia. This genus, whose distribution was previously thought to reflect Gondwanan vicariance, is shown to have arrived in New Zealand from Australia at least 6 – 7 million yr ago...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{quality of}} seeds of native species {{is important to}} produce healthy saplings and therefore guarantee the success of programs to recover disturbed vegetation. This reinforces the necessity for investigating the physiological quality of those seeds. To evaluate the effects of different drying rates on the germination, moisture content and storability of Eugenia involucrata diaspores, mature fruits collected at Mogi Guaçu, SP, Brazil had their epi- and <b>mesocarps</b> removed by washing and were dried at 30, 40 or 50 ºC until their water content was reduced from 57 % (fresh diaspores) to 13 % (final drying), totaling six drying levels. In a second experiment, diaspores had their moisture content reduced from 57 % to 49 %, at 30 ºC, totaling six drying levels (0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 5 h), and were kept for 180 days in plastic bags under cold storage. The drying rate {{had no effect on}} tolerance to desiccation by E. involucrata diaspores; water contents lower than 51 % decreased both germinability and storability. Diaspores can be stored for up to 180 days as long as their water content is reduced to 53 % and they are kept inside plastic bags under cold storage...|$|R
50|$|The white {{portion of}} the peel under the zest (pith, albedo or <b>mesocarp)</b> may be unpleasantly bitter and is {{generally}} avoided by limiting the peeling depth. Some citrus fruits have so little white <b>mesocarp</b> that their peel can be used whole.|$|E
5000|$|Botanically, {{the coconut}} fruit is a drupe, {{not a true}} nut. Like other fruits, it has three layers: the exocarp, <b>mesocarp,</b> and endocarp. The exocarp and <b>mesocarp</b> make up the [...] "husk" [...] of the coconuts. Coconuts sold in the shops of nontropical {{countries}} often have had the exocarp (outermost layer) removed. The <b>mesocarp</b> is composed of a fiber, called coir, which has many traditional and commercial uses. The shell has three germination pores (micropyles) or [...] "eyes" [...] that are clearly visible on its outside surface once the husk is removed.|$|E
50|$|In a hesperidium, as {{is found}} in citrus fruit, the <b>mesocarp</b> is also {{referred}} to as albedo or pith. It is the inner part of the peel and is commonly removed before eating. In citron fruit, where the <b>mesocarp</b> is the most prominent part, it is used to produce succade.|$|E

40|$|Postharvest dry rot of Raphia hookeri palm fruits was {{studied and}} found {{to be caused by}} Xylaria feejeensis. Also {{associated}} with this fungus were Penicillium dierckxii, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma sp. The disease caused dryness of the fruits, thereby affecting the testa and embryo and making the fruit unsuitable for planting. Proximate analyses of the healthy and infected <b>mesocarps</b> of the fruit was carried out using the methods described by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, revealed the presence of food components such as moisture, ash, fibre, protein energy fat and minerals. The results of the proximate and mineral composition of infected fruits showed decreases in all the food and mineral components apart from ash and magnesium which increased from 4. 33 % to 6. 10 % and 395. 6 ppm to 1538. 93 ppm, respectively. There was also a significant decline in the phosphate and zinc content which decreased from 1165. 6 pp to 65. 31 ppm and from 10. 45 ppm to 0. 825 ppm, respectively. The decrease in the moisture content, food and mineral contents and increase in ash indicate the utilisation of these components by the microorganisms. The result of the proximate and mineral composition shows that R. hookeri fruit contains high amounts of mineral elements required for good health and fitness in man, therefore adequate and proper care of the fruit during harvesting and storage should be ensure for proper conservation of these nutritional components...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The ESTree db [URL] {{represents}} {{a collection of}} Prunus persica expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) and is intended {{as a resource for}} peach functional genomics. A total of 6, 155 successful EST sequences were obtained from four in-house prepared cDNA libraries from Prunus persica <b>mesocarps</b> at different developmental stages. Another 12, 475 peach EST sequences were downloaded from public databases and added to the ESTree db. An automated pipeline was prepared to process EST sequences using public software integrated by in-house developed Perl scripts and data were collected in a MySQL database. A php-based web interface was developed to query the database. Results The ESTree db version as of April 2005 encompasses 18, 630 sequences representing eight libraries. Contig assembly was performed with CAP 3. Putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection was performed with the AutoSNP program and a search engine was implemented to retrieve results. All the sequences and all the contig consensus sequences were annotated both with blastx against the GenBank nr db and with GOblet against the viridiplantae section of the Gene Ontology db. Links to NiceZyme (Expasy) and to the KEGG metabolic pathways were provided. A local BLAST utility is available. A text search utility allows querying and browsing the database. Statistics were provided on Gene Ontology occurrences to assign sequences to Gene Ontology categories. Conclusion The resulting database is a comprehensive resource of data and links related to peach EST sequences.
