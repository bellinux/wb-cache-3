5|$|Colt set up {{libraries}} and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were seminal training grounds for {{several generations of}} toolmakers and other <b>machinists,</b> who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century. Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt, Amos Whitney, Henry Leland, Edward Bullard, Worcester R. Warner, Charles Brinckerhoff Richards, William Mason and Ambrose Swasey.|$|E
5|$|Construction of both Have Blue demonstrators used {{leftover}} tools {{from the}} C-5 program. Final assembly of HB1001 was originally scheduled {{to end in}} August 1977, before being ground tested until mid-October. The secret roll-out was envisaged to occur on 23October, after which the aircraft would be dismantled and flown to the test area. On 1September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed <b>machinists</b> went on a four-month strike. A group of managers instead took over the job of assembly, which was completed in six weeks, with ground tests beginning on 17October.|$|E

5|$|While {{officers}} were typically {{allowed to leave}} their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), <b>machinists,</b> and other integral crewmen were not given the same opportunity. These exceptions came on Minas Geraes, whose {{officers were}} surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, , {{was killed in the}} fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser Bahia, the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on São Paulo killed himself.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to {{manufacture}} the machine in summer 1871. During this time, {{the machine was}} revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production. In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit. In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring an ever-increasing ownership interest. Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $12,000. Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent. Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost, a manufacturer {{with whom he had}} been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons. Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War, possessed the machining equipment and skilled <b>machinists</b> necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Beck {{essentially}} supplanted Tobin as {{the real}} power in the Teamsters union. On April 22, 1948, the <b>Machinists</b> (which was {{not a member of}} the AFL) struck Boeing in Seattle, Washington. On May 28, Beck announced that Teamsters would seek to organize the workers at Boeing, and formed Aeronautical Workers and Warehousemen Helpers Union Local 451 to raid the <b>Machinists.</b> Beck and Boeing officials made a secret agreement in which Boeing would hire members of Local 451—essentially hiring Teamsters as scabs and strikebreakers. After as many as a third of the <b>Machinists</b> had joined the Teamsters, the <b>Machinists</b> agreed to return to work without a contract. Beck's actions were nearly universally condemned by members of the AFL Executive Council. The AFL Executive Council met in August 1948 to take action against Beck. The day before the meeting, Tobin privately told associates that he would repudiate Beck. But at a secret meeting that afternoon, Beck and his followers on the West Coast confronted Tobin with a fait accompli: Beck had allied with his long-time enemy Jimmy Hoffa. He now had more than enough votes on the Teamsters executive board to overrule Tobin if he tried to fire Beck. At the AFL meeting the next day, Tobin was forced to defend Beck's actions. Unwilling to embarrass an AFL vice president and create a confrontation with the Teamsters, the AFL Executive Council condoned the Teamster raid on the <b>Machinists.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The core {{job of a}} <b>Machinist's</b> Mate is {{the engine}} room.

This job was previously performed by Boiler Technicians, however, the BT rating merged with <b>Machinist's</b> Mate in 1997. <b>Machinist's</b> Mates working in the propulsion plants are often referred to as [...] "pit snipes," [...] "hole snipes," [...] or just [...] "snipes" [...] for short.|$|R

From 1968 to 1988, McGraw-Hill issued it biweekly and later monthly, briefly titling it American <b>Machinist</b> & Automated Manufacturing during 1986-88. Since 1988 it has been published by Penton; in 2013 it transitioned from combined print/online publication to online-only.|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{critical}} differences that once separated the two organizations had faded since the 1930s.

50|$|The U.S. Navy {{has several}} ratings or job {{specialties}} for its enlisted members.

5000|$|The {{somewhat}} generic {{sound of}} the title American Machinists' Handbook, and the ambiguity of its apostrophe usage, no doubt contributed to the confounding of the two books' titles and identities. It capitalized on readers' familiarity with American <b>Machinist,</b> McGraw-Hill's popular trade journal. But the usage could have benefited from some branding discipline, because the confusion over whether the title was properly [...] "American <b>Machinist's</b> Handbook" [...] or [...] "American Machinists' Handbook" [...] or [...] "American <b>Machinist</b> 's Handbook" [...] was (and is) considerable. ("American <b>Machinist</b> 's Handbook" [...] would be parallel {{to the construction of}} the title [...] "Machinery's Handbook"; perhaps McGraw-Hill's handbook's title was originally conceived as that and later was muddied into [...] "American Machinists' Handbook".) ...|$|R
