5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic {{it turns out to}} be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> and the lowest vacant antibonding σu <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital.</b>|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> and the lowest vacant antibonding σu <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital.</b> The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E

The reducible representation is a linear combination of irreducible representations found in the character table. Manipulation of reducible representations explain how many σ <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> and π <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> {{are found in the}} molecule. There are multiple methods utilizing reducible representations; two examples using methane are described below: ...|$|R

40|$|A {{tendency}} to form benzene-like <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> has been recently {{shown to be}} a common feature of the $ 4 d$ and $ 5 d$ transition metal oxides with a honeycomb lattice. This tendency competes with other interactions such as the spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard correlations, and can be partially or completely suppressed. In the calculations, SrRu$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 6 }$ presents the cleanest, so far, case of well-formed <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals,</b> however, direct experimental evidence for or against this proposition has been missing. In this paper, we show that combined photoemission and optical studies can be used to identify <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> in SrRu$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 6 }$. Symmetry-driven election selection rules suppress optical transitions between certain <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals,</b> while photoemission and inverse photoemission measurements are insensitive to them. Comparing the photoemission and optical conductivity spectra one should be able to observe clear signatures of <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is treated {{as if it was}} a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account. Research by multiple authors has been undertaken on dubnium pentachloride: it has been calculated to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting properties of a compound of a d-block element. For example, the <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> levels indicate dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property dubnium pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E
5000|$|Localized <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> (LMO) are {{obtained}} by unitary transformation upon {{a set of}} canonical <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> (CMO).

5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ {{are expected to}} be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides which tend to be 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under the <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> formalism, {{a typical}} {{ground-state}} molecule has electrons {{in the lowest}} possible energy levels. According to the Pauli principle, at most two electrons can occupy a given orbital, and if an orbital contains two electrons they must be in opposite spin states. The highest occupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> is called the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> is called the LUMO; the energy gap between these two states {{is known as the}} HOMO-LUMO gap. If the molecule absorbs light whose energy is equal to this gap, an electron in the HOMO may be excited to the LUMO. This is called the molecule's excited state.|$|E
25|$|More {{sophisticated}} models embrace covalency, {{and this}} approach is described by ligand field theory (LFT) and <b>Molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> theory (MO). Ligand field theory, introduced in 1935 and built from <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> theory, can handle {{a broader range of}} complexes and can explain complexes in which the interactions are covalent. The chemical applications of group theory can aid in the understanding of crystal or ligand field theory, by allowing simple, symmetry based solutions to the formal equations.|$|E

Significant atomic orbital overlap explains why sp bonding may occur. Strong mixing of the oxygen 2s atomic orbital {{is not to be}} expected and are non-bonding degenerate <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals.</b> The combination of similar atomic orbital/wave functions and the combinations of atomic orbital/wave function inverses create particular energies associated with the nonbonding (no change), bonding (lower than either parent orbital energy) and antibonding (higher energy than either parent atomic <b>orbital</b> energy) <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals.</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the crystal}} {{structure}} analysis, the overlap integral between the frontier <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> of adjacent F 8 CuPcs in the one-dimensional chain is estimated: the overlap integral between the lowest unoccupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> is 5. 4 × 10 − 3, which {{is larger than}} that in a typical n-type semiconducing material F 16 CuPc (2. 1 × 10 − 3), whereas that between the highest occupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> is 2. 9 × 10 − 4. Contrary to previous studies in air, we found that an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) composed of F 8 CuPc essentially shows clear n-type semiconducting behavior in vacuum...|$|R
50|$|There is {{only one}} conserved {{symmetry}} element in this transformation - the mirror plane {{through the center of}} the reactants as shown to the left. From this we can assign the symmetry of the <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> of the reactants very simply. The <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> of the reactants are merely the set {Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3, Ψ4} of <b>molecular</b> <b>orbitals</b> of 1,3-butadiene shown above, along with π and π* of ethylene. Ψ1 is symmetric, Ψ2 is antisymmetric, Ψ3 is symmetric, and Ψ4 is symmetric with respect to the mirror plane. Similarly π is symmetric and π* is antisymmetric with respect to the mirror plane.|$|R

25|$|Similarly, {{theories}} from classical physics {{can be used}} {{to predict}} many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> theory, are generally used.

25|$|The {{molecule}} ClO2 has an {{odd number}} of valence electrons, and therefore, it is a paramagnetic radical. Its electronic structure has long baffled chemists {{because none of}} the possible Lewis structures is very satisfactory. In 1933, L. O. Brockway proposed a structure that involved a three-electron bond. Chemist Linus Pauling further developed this idea and arrived at two resonance structures involving a double bond {{on one side and}} a single bond plus three-electron bond on the other. In Pauling's view the latter combination should represent a bond that is slightly weaker than the double bond. In <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> theory this idea is commonplace if the third electron is placed in an anti-bonding orbital. Later work has confirmed that the highest occupied <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> is indeed an incompletely-filled antibonding orbital.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the matter of the {{rotational}} barrier of ethane is not settled within the scientific community. An analysis within quantitative <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> theory shows that 2-orbital-4-electron (steric) repulsions are dominant over hyperconjugation. A valence bond theory study also emphasizes the importance of steric effects.|$|E
25|$|His work on {{chemical}} bonding marks {{him as one}} of {{the founders}} of modern quantum chemistry. The Nature of the Chemical Bond was the standard work for many years, and concepts like hybridization and electronegativity remain part of standard chemistry textbooks. While his Valence bond approach fell short of accounting quantitatively for some of the characteristics of molecules, such as the color of organometallic complexes, and would later be eclipsed by the <b>molecular</b> <b>orbital</b> theory of Robert Mulliken, Valence Bond Theory still competes, in its modern form, with <b>Molecular</b> <b>Orbital</b> Theory and density functional theory (DFT) as a way of describing the chemical phenomena. Pauling's work on crystal structure contributed significantly to the prediction and elucidation of the structures of complex minerals and compounds.
