5|$|Steam Whistle – An {{industrial}} {{steam whistle}} has been present on Georgia Tech's campus {{ever since the}} early industrial shop years. It typically was blown for the change of classes at five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> On football game days, the whistle is blown after every Yellow Jackets' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets' victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 16 of the competition, Luton faced Ipswich Town of the Second Division. Without several senior players because of ineligibility and injury, Luton scored early through Brian Stein's strike, and then {{produced}} a solid defensive performance, reliant on goalkeeper Les Sealey {{to earn a}} place in the quarter-finals. The result marked Ipswich's first defeat of the season, having earlier recorded 10 wins and two draws at Portman Road. Luton hosted Bradford City in the fifth round of the competition on 19 January 1988. A mistake by Bradford goalkeeper Paul Tomlinson handed Luton the lead four <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> when he gave away a free kick for handling the ball in his area. A shot from Danny Wilson in the 65th minute resulted in Luton's second goal; though his effort was saved by Tomlinson, the goalkeeper could not fend off the advancing Harford's header.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Fire of 1405, {{the tower}} was {{completely}} burned out. The structural damage {{would not be}} completely repaired until 1983. The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was installed above the gate. This clock, together with a bell cast in 1405, gave the tower the name of Zytglogge. In the late fifteenth century the tower was decorated with four decorative corner towerlets and heraldic symbols. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state in 1527–1530. In addition to the astronomical clock, the Zytglogge features a group of mechanical figures. At three <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> the figures which include a rooster, a fool, a knight, a piper, a lion and bears, put on a show. The animals chase each other around, the fool rings his bells and the rooster caws. During the day {{it is common to}} see small crowds gathered around the foot of the Zytglogge waiting for the show to start.|$|E
50|$|The station transmits using AM with a {{suppressed}} {{lower sideband}} (R3E), {{but it has}} also used full double-sideband AM (A3E). The signal consists of a buzzing sound that lasts 1.2 seconds, pausing for 1-1.3 seconds, and repeating 21-34 times per minute. Until November 2010, the buzz tones lasted approximately 0.8 seconds each. One <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>the</b> repeating tone was previously replaced by a continuous, uninterrupted alternating tone, which continued for one minute until the short repeating buzz resumed, although this stopped occurring in June 2010.|$|R
5000|$|FC Seoul striker Damjanovic made {{a strike}} at goal seven {{minutes into the}} second half. One <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, Guangzhou took the lead as FC Seoul's defence failed to fully clear the danger inside their penalty area and Sun Xiang's low drilled cross was {{diverted}} {{into the back of}} the net at the near post when Gao Lin poked it in. Damjanovic again went close to making another goal for FC Seoul after 66 minutes only to be denied by a last-ditch block by Sun Xiang before Koh Myong-Jin fired into the side netting.|$|R
50|$|The China international, Gao Lin, {{then added}} to the Brazilian's header a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark, and despite Montenegrin striker Damjanovic {{equalizing}} with seven minutes remaining, Guangzhou headed into the next month's second leg in pole position. Guangzhou came close to a breakthrough after eight minutes as Dario Conca's shot was palmed back out towards the penalty spot only for Huang Bowen to blaze over the crossbar. But just two minutes later FC Seoul took the lead as Guangzhou's defence failed {{to deal with a}} quickly taken free-kick and Escudero held off Feng Xiaoting <b>before</b> coolly beating <b>the</b> goalkeeper, Zeng Cheng, with a low shot from just inside the penalty area.|$|R
500|$|Georgia Tech has {{a number}} of legends and {{tradition}}s, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters [...] "TECH" [...] hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully. One of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a steam whistle blows five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> every hour from 7:55a.m. to 5:55p.m. The faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.|$|E
500|$|The 2004 {{edition of}} the FA Community Shield, was contested between Manchester United and Arsenal at the Millennium Stadium on 8 August. Cesc Fàbregas started {{alongside}} Gilberto Silva in midfield for Arsenal as Vieira was absent, while Thierry Henry partnered Dennis Bergkamp up front. After a goalless first half, Arsenal took the lead when Gilberto scored in the 50th minute. Manchester United equalised through Alan Smith five minutes after, but José Antonio Reyes restored Arsenal's advantage two <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark. Mikaël Silvestre scored an own goal 11 minutes before the end to give Arsenal a 3–1 victory. Wenger praised Fàbregas's performance after the match, describing the midfielder as a [...] "complete player" [...] and reiterated his desire to keep Vieira.|$|E
60|$|The Cardinal, {{well aware}} of this, skilfully working too on the Queen's still restive jealousy, had {{suggested}} to Mary that Ursula Glynde should await the Duke of Wessex in the hall at fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jordan coach Ray Wilkins {{had said}} {{a day earlier}} that if his team failed {{to qualify for the}} quarter-finals it would not be {{because of a lack of}} effort, and his troops proved the former Manchester United and Chelsea midfielder right with an industrious {{performance}} right down to the final whistle. But equally, Jordan struggled over the last third of the pitch, missing that touch of creativity necessary to penetrate Iraq's defense as striker Odai Al-Saify was free in front of goal a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> mark only to float a back-header over the crossbar. During the following sequence, Mohammad Mustafa had another chance for Jordan from the heart of the penalty area, but mishit the ball, shooting harmlessly into the arms of goalkeeper Jalal Hasan.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, uncle, who was it?" [...] Hilda asked, {{when they}} met {{in the drawing room}} a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> dinner <b>hour.</b> [...] "You said you would not be five minutes, and I waited for {{a quarter of an hour}} and then lost patience. I asked when I came in how long he had stayed, and heard that he did not leave until five o'clock." ...|$|R
60|$|Five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> {{they were}} at the rendezvous. As the clock struck, the duke rode up with two {{officers}} and an escort of six troopers. He looked at their accoutrements and horses, and nodded his head approvingly.|$|E
6000|$|At fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> {{of seven}} [...] "Ninety-four's kid," [...] {{as some of}} the clerks at {{headquarters}} had already designated Seth, entered the gymnasium with a bustling air as if the hardest tasks would be no more than a pleasure.|$|E
60|$|A {{note was}} at once sent off to the lawyer's to make the appointment, and the girls arrived with Miss Purcell two or three <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> and were at once shown into Mr. Pettigrew's room, where Mr. Farmer {{immediately}} joined them.|$|E
60|$|She {{arrived at}} Madame Mantalini's some <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{appointed}} <b>hour,</b> and after walking {{a few times}} up and down, {{in the hope that}} some other female might arrive and spare her the embarrassment of stating her business to the servant, knocked timidly at the door: which, after some delay, was opened by the footman, who had been putting on his striped jacket as he came upstairs, and was now intent on fastening his apron.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't imagine so,' {{returned}} the other; 'not {{if you do}} what Flora and I have arranged; and your business now is to dress, and lose no time about it. Is your watch right? Well, you have {{a quarter of an}} <b>hour.</b> By five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> half- <b>hour</b> you must be at table, in your old seat, under Uncle Duthie's picture. Flora will be there to keep you countenance; and we shall see what we shall see.' ...|$|R
50|$|The Type 114 debuted at the BPR Global GT Series four-hour race at Donington. Despite {{competing}} in the GT2 category {{it was able to}} out-qualify all of its class rivals and compete equally with the more powerful GT1 racers which included the McLaren F1 and the Porsche 911 GT1. The race finished 8 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 4 <b>hours</b> as <b>the</b> gearbox failed. Nevertheless, the Type 114 would earn a class victory (and 4th overall) at its second attempt during the Norwich Union Empire Trophy in September.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When Lady Mountclere's confederate {{came for}} the note, I was in waiting above, and handed one down a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> struck, {{confirming}} the time, but changing the place. When Lady Mountclere handed down her note, just as the clock was striking, her confederate had gone, and I was standing beneath the balcony to receive it. She dropped it into her husband's hands--ho-ho-ho-ho! ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{opposed to}} the {{architect}} as a lover, De Stancy felt {{for him as a}} poor devil in need of money, having had experiences of that sort himself, and he was really anxious that the needful supply entrusted to him should reach Somerset's hands. He was on the bridge five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> and when the clock struck a hand was laid on his shoulder: turning he beheld Dare.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{short time}} Charley rose, and saying, [...] "I will see if I can get {{anything}} better than dried meat for supper," [...] exchanged his rifle for Mr. Hardy's double-barreled gun, which was carried by Terence, and whistling for the retriever, strolled off up the stream. In ten minutes the double-barrels were heard at a short distance, and {{a quarter of an}} hour afterward again, but this time faintly. Ten <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> was up he appeared, wiping the perspiration from his face, with seven and a half brace of plump duck.|$|E
50|$|Crawford {{stood for}} {{parliament}} at Harwich in 1851, {{where he was}} elected Member of Parliament when the sitting member was unseated on petition, but was himself displaced on petition because it was alleged that the poll had closed three <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>hour.</b> In 1852 he was proposed for the City of London, but declined to become a candidate although 3765 votes had been cast for him. At the 1857 general election Crawford was elected MP for the City of London. He held the seat until 1874.|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{after seven}} o'clock I {{sent a message}} to Jessie by her maid, informing her that a good night's rest had done wonders for me, and that I {{expected}} to see her in my study at half past seven, as we had arranged <b>the</b> evening <b>before.</b> As soon as her answer, promising to be punctual to the appointment, had reached me, I took George into my study--left him in my place to plead his own cause--and stole away, five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> half <b>hour,</b> to join my brothers in the breakfast-room.|$|R
60|$|The usual little {{crowd was}} waiting in the lobby of a fashionable London {{restaurant}} a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> popular luncheon <b>hour.</b> Pamela Van Teyl, a very beautiful American girl, dressed in the extreme of fashion, which she seemed somehow to justify, directed the attention of her companions to the notice affixed to the wall facing them.|$|R
60|$|Mary had secluded {{herself in}} her bedroom {{as soon as the}} {{carriage}} had driven up to the door, and there she remained till dinner-time. But she could not shut herself up altogether. It would be necessary that she should appear at dinner; and, therefore, a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> she crept out into the drawing-room. As she opened the door, she looked in timidly, expecting Sir Louis to be there; but when she saw that her uncle was the only occupant of the room, her brow cleared, and she entered with a quick step.|$|E
6000|$|The day of {{the final}} dawned bright and clear. At least, I was not awake {{at the time to}} see, but I suppose it did; for at nine o'clock, when I came down to breakfast, the sun was shining brightly. The first {{eighteen}} holes were to be played before lunch, starting at eleven. Until twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> Vincent Jopp kept me busy taking dictation, partly on matters connected with his wheat deal and partly on a signed article dealing with the Final, entitled [...] "How I Won." [...] At eleven sharp we were out on the first tee.|$|E
60|$|When he had {{despatched}} {{the note}} by a boy he regretted {{that in his}} hurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors, when he might have said he would call upon her. It was, in fact, the country custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him. Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and it might not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue. However, {{it could not be}} helped now, and he moved towards the point a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps.|$|E
60|$|The Fore and Aft awaited, leaning {{upon their}} rifles and {{listening}} to the protests of their empty stomachs. The Colonel did his best to remedy the default of lining {{as soon as it was}} borne in upon him that the affair would not begin at once, and so well did he succeed that the coffee was just ready when--the men moved off, their Band leading. Even then there had been a mistake in time, and the Fore and Aft came out into <b>the</b> valley ten <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> proper <b>hour.</b> Their Band wheeled to the right after reaching the open, and retired behind a little rocky knoll still playing while the regiment went past.|$|R
60|$|On {{the summit}} of the {{mountain}} which Judge Temple had named the “Vision,” a little spot had been cleared, in order that a better view might he obtained of the village and the valley. At this point Elizabeth understood the hunter she was to meet him; and thither she urged her way, as expeditiously as the difficulty of the ascent, and the impediment of a forest, in a state of nature, would admit. Numberless were the fragments of rocks, trunks of fallen trees, and branches, with which she had to contend; but every difficulty vanished before her resolution, and, by her own watch, she stood on the desired spot several <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> appointed <b>hour.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{explains}} {{the rationale for}} 14 minutes as follows: [...] "It's one minute less than the smallest unit of schedulistically significant time. No calendar has a finer granularity than 15 minutes. No one ever has a meeting that starts at 5 or 10 or 14 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> or after <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> You have no excuse not to do this. Time-wise, it doesn't even register." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were up}} betimes, and mounted a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> at which the city gates would be opened. Sir Ralph and his dame rode first, Aline took her place between her brother and Edgar, the latter keeping a watchful eye over her horse, which was fresh after six or seven days' idleness. The two {{retainers}} rode behind, having the ladies' valises strapped behind them. The city churches rang out the hour when they were within a hundred yards of the gate, and as this opened, Van Voorden, with his daughter behind him on a pillion, rode out to meet them, followed by two mounted men.|$|E
60|$|The duke {{put in an}} {{appearance}} five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> upon a bay gelding, and attended by Lewis and Sir John Brooke, both mounted. As a most particular evidence of the detestation in which Chartersea was held, he could find {{nothing in common with}} such notorious rakes as March and Sandwich. And it fell to me to champion these. After some discussion between Fox and Captain Lewis, March was chosen umpire. His Lordship took his post {{in the middle of the}} Row, drew forth an enamelled repeater from his waistcoat, and mouthed out the conditions of the match,--the terms, as he said, being private.|$|E
60|$|She did not come, and he awaited {{her in the}} afternoon, {{which was}} finer. He knew that if she came at all she would {{approach}} the building along {{the eastern side of}} the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible, and he stood in a corner while the bell was going. A few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite, and followed her into the building, more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself. To see her, and to be himself unseen and unknown, was enough for him at present.|$|E
60|$|I used {{to own a}} clock which gurgled in {{its throat}} three <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> it struck <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> I know, therefore, the slow freight of Anticipation. For I have awakened {{at three in the}} morning, heard the clock gurgle, and waited those three minutes for the three strokes I knew were to come. Alors. In Ross's ranch house that night the slow freight of Climax whistled in the distance.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the single-track Biebermühl Railway has been operated together with the Alsenz Valley Railway, the Kaiserslautern-Enkenbach railway and the Bingen-Bad Münster section of the Nahe Valley Railway under time table number 672. There were continuous connections between Bingen and Pirmasens from 1990 to 2008. The trains usually cross in Waldfischbach at <b>the</b> symmetry <b>minute</b> shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> full <b>hour.</b> <b>The</b> journeys between Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof and Kaiserslautern are designated by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar as line R65 and those between the two Pirmasens stations are designated R55 (Landau-Pirmasens) and R68 (Saarbrücken-Pirmasens).|$|R
60|$|We then, as {{you will}} see by the schedule, {{commence}} <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> of <b>the</b> day. It is marked evening lessons, because most, though not all, of the studies are intended to be prepared out of school. These studies are miscellaneous in their character, comprising Geography, History, Natural and Intellectual Philosophy, and Natural History. This <b>hour,</b> like all <b>the</b> other <b>hours</b> for study, is divided into two equal parts, some classes reciting in the first part, and others in the second. A bell is always rung five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> time for closing the recitation, to give the teachers notice that their time is nearly expired, and then again at the time, to give notice to new classes to take their places. Thus you will observe that five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> half <b>hour</b> expires, <b>the</b> bell will ring; soon after which the classes in recitation will take their seats. Precisely at the end of <b>the</b> half <b>hour,</b> it will ring again, when new classes will take their places. In the same manner notice is given five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> second half of <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> expires, and so in all <b>the</b> other three <b>hours.</b>|$|R
