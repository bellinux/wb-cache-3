5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> {{problem facing}} the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and to revert {{to the practice of}} auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of the}} Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{had filled}} its <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> needs for {{submarines}} after {{the outbreak of}} World War I, they selected the German Type UB II design for its next group of submarines in mid 1915. Orders {{for the first six}} boats were placed in October 1915 with the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino and the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius. Two more boats were ordered in 1916, bringing the class total to eight.|$|E

5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} the <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known}} as the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans {{were reluctant to}} allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had such}} trust in his {{chancellor}} and the chancellor's clerks that Burnell and the clerks {{were allowed to}} dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal. Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> to the king.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the <b>most</b> <b>urgent</b> repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

50|$|Hemoperitoneum (sometimes also hematoperitoneum) is the {{presence}} of blood in the peritoneal cavity. The blood accumulates in the space between the inner lining of the abdominal wall and the internal abdominal organs. Hemoperitoneum is generally classified as a surgical emergency; in <b>most</b> cases, <b>urgent</b> laparotomy is needed to identify and control the source of the bleeding. In selected cases, careful observation may be permissible. The abdominal cavity is highly distensible and may easily hold greater than five liters of blood, or more than the entire circulating blood volume for an average-sized individual. Therefore, large-scale or rapid blood loss into the abdomen will reliably induce hemorrhagic shock and, if untreated, may rapidly lead to death.|$|R
