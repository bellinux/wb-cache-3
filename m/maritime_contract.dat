[...] "In enacting § 2 of the federal Act, Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew {{the power of the}} states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration," [...] Burger declared. There were only two statutory exemptions: that it was applicable only a written <b>maritime</b> <b>contract</b> or a contract [...] "evidencing a transaction involving commerce", and that the arbitration agreements could only be voided [...] "upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract". Cone had found the FAA to be substantive law that Congress had power to pass under the Commerce Clause.

In {{late medieval}} Southampton, wine was a commodity, which was extensively traded, and quite precious to the pirates of the English Channel {{because it was}} easy to sell and the vessels loaded with wine had less protection than the ships of precious metals. Therefore, increase of wine trade in the late medieval Southampton made piracy of the time more frequent. For the wine merchants of both Southampton and England, it was a natural reaction to try to avoid piratical attacks by taking legal measures against them. This would make piracy, as one of the biggest threats to commercial maritime activities, one of the factors that causes the development of anti-piracy legal regulations. The purpose of this thesis is verifying this correlation between wine trade, piracy and the <b>maritime</b> <b>contract</b> law by especially focusing on fifteenth century Southampton. As the title mentions, this work takes three sets of source as the backbones of this research to determine the links between the commercial, criminal and legal spheres: The port books of Southampton were used as the basic sources for the late medieval wine trade section of the thesis. A database of over one thousand items was prepared and examined to reach two conclusions, one relating {{to the nature of the}} wine trade and the other relating to the Southampton merchant-elites. To reach correlation centered conclusions in the sections on piracy and <b>maritime</b> <b>contract</b> law, singular accounts and the maritime codes of late medieval England were used, as well as secondary sources. The results of this research shows the dominance of bureaucrats over the fifteenth century Southampton wine trade, their dual identity as privateers, the continuous existence of pirates in the English Channel and the improvement of general maritime law (admiralty law), is demonstrably related to piracy, rather than <b>maritime</b> <b>contract</b> law specifically.

40|$|Maritime {{arbitration}} {{has been}} a practiced method of dispute resolution since remote times, particularly in Ancient Greece. During the Middle Ages {{the application of the}} lex maritima among seaborne traders resulted in a wide use of arbitration, as demonstrated by the provisions contained in the statutes of some Italian communes. In the following centuries arbitration remained quite popular until its definitive achievement in parallel with the rise of international uniform law. Maritime arbitration belongs to the genus of international commercial arbitration but it differs from the general model for a number of reasons, which make it somehow “special”: from the sources of law, to the kind of arbitrated disputes, to the characteristics of the maritime arbitral proceedings. Nowadays arbitration is widely used among international shipping operators to solve almost every kind of dispute and, consequently, arbitral clauses are included in many <b>maritime</b> <b>contract</b> forms. This is due to its remarkable advantages over litigation, such as flexibility, specialization, confidentiality and, more generally, possibility for the parties to determine every aspect of the procedure according to their needs. However, despite such benefits, there are some drawbacks and issues which affect contemporary arbitration and whose consequence is the increasing popularity of other mechanisms of dispute resolution, such as negotiation and mediation. In order to successfully defend its leading role in the next decades, maritime arbitration (and in particular London maritime arbitration) will necessarily have to make some changing, overcoming the proverbial reluctance to innovation of the maritime industry...|$|E
