25|$|Though Viacom {{continued}} {{to support the}} series throughout 2010, it {{announced that it was}} seeking a buyer for Harmonix, citing the series' continued profit losses and Viacom's inexperience at being a video game publisher. Harmonix was eventually sold at the end of 2010 to Harmonix-SBE Holdings LLC, an affiliate of investment firm Columbus Nova, LLC that included Harmonix shareholders. Though the net liability of the sale was valued at nearly $200 million, including existing unsold inventory and ongoing <b>music</b> <b>license</b> <b>fees,</b> analysts believe that Harmonix-SBE paid only $50 for the company, taking on the total financial liability that Viacom was able to write off in their books. The MTV Games division at Viacom was later closed.|$|E
50|$|The station's format {{remained}} nearly unchanged {{for nearly}} 30 years until <b>music</b> <b>license</b> <b>fees</b> and finances forced {{the station to}} adopt a more talk-oriented format by the mid-1990s with limited music play. In the 1970s, WGN engineers studied the studio design at WNWI inside the Valpo Tech main hall {{to see how the}} audio and electrical engineers at the school built the studios with super-large plate-glass windows while maintaining excellent acoustics in the studios at that time. The studio design at WNWI was the inspiration for the large plate-glass window studios seen today for WGN radio on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. WBBM-TV even used the over-engineered tower structure at WNWI as a TV antenna relay for a brief period in the 1960s to improve TV service to Northwest Indiana until the Sears Tower was built and the CBS affiliate could move its transmitter and antenna {{to the top of the}} new building. After that, the antenna relay was disassembled and all that remained of the support structure for the antenna were cross-arms, which can be seen on the original tower structure in Valparaiso, Indiana to this day.|$|E

50|$|NBC {{opted not}} to air the 12-minute {{epilogue}} when the third-season finale aired on March 30, 2005, {{a month and a}} half before the official cancellation of the series. TV Guide reported on July 26, 2005 that this epilogue was likely to air in a rerun of the third-season finale in August or September, but the airing never materialized. NBC was unable to attract sponsorship for the segment, which reportedly contained many rock-and-roll oldies, resulting in expensive <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> for the network.|$|R
5000|$|The January 20 episode {{included}} a comedic bit in which O'Brien unveiled a Bugatti Veyron {{dressed as a}} mouse, while the song [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" [...] by The Rolling Stones played in the background. O'Brien claimed that the car and <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> ("not to mention the rights to re-air this clip on the Internet") would cost NBC $1.5 million. It was later revealed that the car was on loan from the Petersen Automotive Museum. The segment was subsequently cut from Internet versions of the episode that were uploaded to Hulu and NBC.com, presumably so the network could avoid paying the <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> required for the Rolling Stones song.|$|R

Some potential listeners expressed to the station that their radios were not capable of tuning to 87.9 and asked if WXTZ-FM had a public website stream available on services such as TuneIn. Additional <b>Music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> paid by the station would have been required to stream the station on line on in this manner. This proved to be too costly for the station and it would also have limited the number of songs that could be played per artist per a set number of program hours.|$|R

The early 1990s marked a period of financial distress for WPQR, but the circumstances surrounding it are still unknown. Heshler and Kelly dissolved their partnership in 1991, but Heshler stayed on as General Manager for WPQR and sister station WCVI {{for a couple of years}} afterward, with Kelly taking ownership and control of both WCVI and WPQR.

50|$|Additionally, {{the song}} soundtracks, {{aside from the}} {{original}} theme-song by Billy Preston, consisted a group of 60's and 70's style British Rock sound-alike pieces very much influenced by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and even Herman's Hermits. Jonathan Klein, the English Language Producer for L/R, had mentioned at anime conventions that the Japanese Producer, Akahiro Kawamura, had originally wanted to use actual Beatles songs in the L/R soundtrack, since <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> for old songs are far less expensive in Japan {{than they are in}} the rest of the world. However, the idea was put to rest early on in the production of the series when it was explained to Kawamura, that the cost to license those same songs for an American and European DVD release of L/R would raise the production cost by several million dollars, even if they could even secure permission from the rights holders. It was therefore agreed that original songs with a classic British Rock style would be used instead.|$|R
5000|$|A 2007 law {{requires}} radio stations {{to use the}} Greek language as the main language, {{as well as to}} have certain funds in reserve and to employ a minimum number of full-time employees. This creates a disproportionate burden for smaller and municipality-owned radio stations; there is no separate provision for community-based radios, and several student-run radios were subject to attempts by authorities to shut them down in 2014.The 2007 law also allows those radio stations affiliated to political parties represented in the Hellenic Parliament to broadcast without a license. This was extended in 2013 by a NCRTV decision to Art TV, owned by LAOS, that only had European Parliament representation. Art TV remained on air also after LAOS lost European Parliament representation at the 2014 elections.Since August 2014, [...] "news station" [...] radios can change into [...] "non-news stations", but not the other way around, giving rise to risk of insulation of the news station market.Rising utility costs and prohibitive <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> led to many radio stations facing large unpaid debts by the end of 2014.|$|R
5000|$|For many years, the show's {{theme music}} was Leroy Anderson's [...] "Bugler's Holiday", {{performed}} by the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler's direction. (This information would occasionally appear in questions used on the show.) At least two different Boston Pops recordings were used on the air over the years: one dating from 1967, and another from 1969 that featured a guest performance by legendary trumpeter Al Hirt. The 1969 recording was dubbed off of a record owned {{by one of the}} station's engineers. In September 2000, [...] "Bugler's Holiday" [...] was replaced in favor of a generic-sounding, far less distinctive piece because of escalating <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees.</b> [...] "Bugler's Holiday" [...] returned as the show's theme in 2007, played against photos of random historical content and past episode clips. Ethan Lillie, an acclaimed concert pianist and jazz composer, composed an alternate version of the [...] "Bugler's Holiday" [...] theme, which was used in a November 2004 episode of ASMW to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of Lillie's induction into the jazz hall of fame.|$|R
5000|$|In late December 2010, Viacom {{announced}} that it had sold Harmonix to Harmonix-SBE Holdings LLC, a holding company for the family office of investor Jason Epstein. Epstein is a senior managing partner at investment firm Columbus Nova, though the buy-out of Harmonix was conducted by Epstein personally, and not Columbus Nova. The terms of the sale were undisclosed, though estimated at $200 million. This sale returned Harmonix to its origins as an independent developer. The resulting sale did not affect present or future support plans for Harmonix' games; Harmonix retained the intellectual property rights for Rock Band and Dance Central in the sale', allowing Harmonix Music Systems to continue to develop these series. According to Peter Kafka of the Wall Street Journal, the sale of Harmonix was heavily discounted, possibly as low as fifty dollars, {{the equivalent of a}} fire sale and allowing Viacom to claim certain tax benefits; meanwhile, the new independent owners would assume all ongoing liability for Harmonix' projects, including <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> and unsold inventory. Viacom later affirmed that they received nearly $115 million in tax benefits from the Harmonix sale. Following the purchase, Harmonix underwent a restructuring in February 2011, laying off about 12-15% of the 240-person staff. Shortly after this, Activision announced it was shuttering its Guitar Hero division and cancelling planned games for 2011, which many journalists considered to mark the end of the rhythm game genre; Harmonix's Director of Communications, John Drake, in response to this closure, called the news [...] "discouraging", but affirmed that Harmonix will continue to invest itself in further Rock Band and Dance Central developments for the foreseeable future.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Music</b> <b>licensing</b> deals cut at {{the time}} of {{production}} were for a limited number of years. Hugh Wilson commented that WKRP was videotaped instead of filmed because when the show was originally produced, a loophole in <b>music</b> <b>licensing</b> deals reduced <b>fees</b> for using songs in videotaped programs. The loophole was intended to accommodate variety shows. When the show initially went in syndication shortly after its 1982 cancellation, the original music remained intact because the licensing deals were still active {{at the time}}. Once the licenses expired, later syndicated versions of the show did not feature the music as first broadcast, but rather generic [...] "sound-alikes" [...] by studio musicians to avoid paying additional royalties. In some cases (when the music was playing in the background of a dialogue scene), some of the characters' lines had to be redubbed by sound-alike actors. This was evident in all prints of the show issued since the early 1990s, which included its late-1990s run on Nick at Nite.|$|R

Instead, the stations played regional music and styles (like rhythm and blues or country) that had been traditionally disdained by ASCAP.
