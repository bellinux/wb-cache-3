5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
25|$|Nyíri's {{proposition}} {{was immediately}} criticised by Ottó Gyürk, {{pointing to the}} fact that with such a permissive deciphering method one can get anything out of the code. Also, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that Nyíri makes an uncritical allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian, discredits his enterprise.|$|E

25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> {{that strikes}} or {{agreements}} not to work, entered into by laborers to compel employers {{to yield to}} their demands, may restrict the power of such employers {{to compete in the}} market with those not subject to such demands does not bring the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman Act.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that an {{application}} for compulsory sequestration is brought by a creditor who is prepared to co-operate with the debtor, or who is motivated partly {{by a desire to}} assist the debtor, does not preclude the granting of a sequestration order. An order should not be refused simply because there is goodwill between the parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} law {{applicable}} to the dispute. If all other factors weigh in favor of keeping {{the case in the}} jurisdiction where it was filed, then the court may choose between application of local law (lex fori) or relevant foreign law. Thus, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that foreign law may apply to the event, circumstances, accident, or occurrence is not a strong reason to dismiss the case on FNC grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{would ask}} this {{question}} first. Is it a book of <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> concerning journeys and expenditure, and so on, or a book of thoughts?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the mere}} facts," [...] {{he cried out}} {{in a kind of}} despair. [...] "The <b>mere</b> <b>facts!</b> Do you really admit--are you still so sunk in superstitions, so {{clinging}} to dim and prehistoric altars, that you believe in facts? Do you not trust an immediate impression?" ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the {{conversation}} {{at the head}} of the table had taken a political turn. Mr. Craig was not above talking politics occasionally, though he piqued himself rather on a wise insight than on specific information. He saw so far beyond the <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> of a case that really it was superfluous to know them.|$|R
25|$|The {{location}} of relevant evidence and records. The defendant must identify the records; explain {{who is in}} charge of the records; address necessity, language, and translation problems; address the volume of such records; address the law governing these records; and rule out the existence of duplicate records in the jurisdiction chosen by the plaintiff. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that records need to be translated is not sufficient grounds to invoke FNC.|$|E
25|$|On many lines, the new {{units were}} warmly welcomed. It is {{important}} to remember that while the first generation DMUs had given many years of service, in very many cases, they suffered from lack of and/or poor maintenance, with sometimes filthy and worn interiors, and leaking exhaust systems. Ignoring arguments over comfort and style, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that the trains were clean and new was enough to make them welcome countrywide.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation {{by other}} teams through {{additional}} high-precision RVs {{would be most}} welcome. But if GJ 581g is confirmed by further RV scrutiny, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a habitable planet has been detected this soon, around such a nearby star, suggests that η could well be {{on the order of}} a few tens of percent, and thus that either we have just been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery.|$|E
60|$|Over {{and above}} the solid gain of a {{scientific}} habit of mind, of which I shall speak presently, the gain of <b>mere</b> <b>facts,</b> the increased knowledge of this planet on which we live, is very valuable just now; valuable certainly to all who do not wish {{their children and their}} younger brothers {{to know more about the}} universe than they do.|$|R
50|$|During her travels, {{she meets}} {{a boy who}} was brought up as a girl, tricks a holy man, swims in the Roman baths of Aquae Sulis, takes part in a battle, and {{witnesses}} Arthur's brutality, piety and immorality, all the while observing her master create the fantastic stories that have made 'King Arthur' {{one of the most}} famous men in legend. After Arthur's death she creates some stories herself, conceding that the legend is more important than the <b>mere</b> <b>facts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, {{educational}} reform has had a number of different meanings. In Taiwan in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century a movement tried to prioritize reasoning over <b>mere</b> <b>facts,</b> reduce the emphasis on central control and standardized testing. There was consensus on the problems. Efforts were limited because there was little consensus on the goals of educational reforms, and therefore on how to fix the problems. By 2003, the push for education reform had declined.|$|R
25|$|By July 1895 {{his health}} had {{recovered}} sufficiently {{for him to}} return to England and play for Surrey again. Fortuitously, Lohmann's return coincided with a return to extremely treacherous wickets after a long spell of dry weather and much better pitches than Lohmann had ever bowled on before. Though completely overshadowed by Tom Richardson, the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> of missing the good wickets in May and June caused Lohmann to actually beat Richardson in the averages, though his batting (seen as an important part of his county cricket up to 1892) was completely insignificant.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> {{that the}} U-505 was {{captured}} and towed — rather than sunk after the codebooks {{had been taken}} — was considered to have endangered the Ultra secret. The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral King, considered court-martialling Captain Gallery. To protect the secret, U-505s crewmen, who knew of the U-boat's capture, were isolated from other prisoners of war; the Red Cross were denied access to them. Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine declared the crew dead and informed the families to that effect. The last of the German crew was not returned until 1947.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} a fair hearing {{requires}} that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, {{and the opportunity to}} present their own case. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the {{right to a}} fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.|$|E
5000|$|Surpluss {{innovative}} {{style is}} the product of a method that Gandini adopts in his very personal approach to documentary film, [...] "the freest, cheapest way for a person to express themselves cinematically". Although his films deal with social issues they are far from traditional political documentaries. They are [...] "creative documentaries" [...] relying on the idea of [...] "show, dont tell", to give the viewer an experience of politics rather than <b>mere</b> <b>facts,</b> making a powerful use of cinematography, music and editing to make their point.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mere</b> <b>facts</b> are not copyrightable. However, {{compilations}} {{of facts}} are treated differently, {{and may be}} copyrightable material. The Copyright Act, , allows copyright protection for [...] "compilations", {{as long as there}} is some [...] "creative" [...] or [...] "original" [...] act involved in developing the compilation, such as in the selection (deciding which facts to include or exclude), and arrangement (how facts are displayed and in what order). Copyright protection in compilations is limited to the selection and arrangement of facts, not to the facts themselves.|$|R

But let {{the winds of}} passion swell, and straightway men begin to generalize, to connect by remotest analogies, to express the most universal positions of reason in the most glowing figures of fancy; in short, to feel particular truths and <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> as poor, cold, narrow, and incommensurate with their feelings."--Statesman's Manual, p. 18.|$|R
25|$|The major {{competitor}} for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel {{design and}} built at Duple's Blackpool factory. The Dominant had {{many of the}} design cues of the Panorama Elite {{and that could be}} because the managing director at that time was an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E
25|$|However, in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the Supreme Court {{held that}} when a {{contractor}} was merely the federal government's purchasing agent, the legal incidence of the tax fell on the United States and hence the tax was invalid. Further rulings by the Supreme Court, however, indicated that Kern-Limerick has extremely limited implications for Supremacy Clause jurisprudence and the ruling {{is limited to the}} facts in that case. States countered by imposing use taxes on corporations instead, and the Supreme Court upheld such taxes in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964.) The Court also held in United States v. California, 507 U.S. 746 (1993), that the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that the United States reimburses a contractor for payment of state taxes does not violate the legal incidence test.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a {{decision-maker}} is conferred wide discretion by {{law is not}} {{reason enough}} for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by Ahmed v. H.M. Treasury (No. 1) (2010). The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources {{on the ground that}} it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mere</b> <b>facts</b> {{about how}} the world is cannot {{determine}} how we ought to think or behave. Elqayam & Evans (E&E) argue that this "is-ought fallacy" undercuts the use of rational analysis in explaining how people reason, by ourselves and with others. But this presumed application of the "is-ought" fallacy is itself fallacious. Rational analysis seeks to explain how people do reason, for example in laboratory experiments, not how they ought to reason. Thus, no ought is derived from an is; and rational analysis is unchallenged by E&E's arguments...|$|R
5000|$|In the Copyright {{law of the}} United States, the Copyright Act of 1976, section 101, {{defines a}} {{collective}} work as [...] "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole".

5000|$|Assent to {{the truth}} {{is of the essence}} of faith, and the {{ultimate}} ground on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the veracity of God. Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to certain statements which are regarded as <b>mere</b> <b>facts</b> of history. Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men (e.g., Felix) by the [...] of the truth and by the influence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes styled the common operation of the Holy Spirit. Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life inseparably connected with it, and is a special operation of the Holy Spirit ...|$|R
25|$|The {{first trial}} for piracy {{was of the}} 13 men, {{including}} Captain Thomas H. Baker, captured on privateer Savannah. The trial {{was held in the}} United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York. It began on 23 October 1861, and from the start attracted wide public notice. The <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> of the trial drew outrage in the Confederacy, where the government threatened retaliation, life for life. To increase pressure on Washington, the prisoners of war who would have been executed in retaliation were selected and their names made known. The trial went to the jury on the seventh day, but the next day the jury announced that it was deadlocked. The prisoners were sent back to prison to await a second trial. The United States government, however, had decided that it would no longer press the charges. The thirteen men would not be regarded as pirates, but as prisoners of war. They later were exchanged. The decision in effect meant that Washington was conceding the rights of belligerency to those who took up arms against it at sea.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E
25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal {{immunity}} from taxation stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He admitted that Dravo Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) but rather on the <b>mere</b> <b>fact</b> that a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be no end to unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would be}} a new thing in history if a priori {{philosophers}} were daunted by the factious opposition of experience; and the Stoics were the last men to {{allow themselves to be}} beaten by <b>mere</b> <b>facts.</b> [...] "Give me a doctrine and I will find the reasons for it," [...] said Chrysippus. So they perfected, if they did not invent, that ingenious and plausible form of pleading, the Theodicy; for the purpose of showing firstly, {{that there is no such}} thing as evil; secondly, that if there is, it is the necessary correlate of good; and, moreover, that it is either due to our own fault, or inflicted for our benefit.|$|R
