50|$|The {{issuance}} of an RMA/RGA {{is a key}} gatekeeping moment in the reverse logistics cycle, providing the vendor with a final opportunity to diagnose and correct the customer's problem with the product (such as improper installation or configuration) before the customer permanently relinquishes ownership of the product to the <b>manufacturer,</b> <b>commonly</b> {{referred to as a}} return. As returns are costly for the vendor and inconvenient for the customer, any return that can be prevented benefits both parties.|$|R
5000|$|Synthesizers may employ any of {{a variety}} of sound {{generation}} techniques. They may include an integrated keyboard, or may exist as [...] "sound modules" [...] or [...] "expanders" [...] that generate sounds when triggered by an external controller, such as a MIDI keyboard.

50|$|Grounding {{transformers}} let three wire (delta) {{polyphase system}} supplies accommodate phase to neutral loads {{by providing a}} return path for current to a neutral.

40|$|Many {{details about}} the complex enzyme {{mechanism}} of polymerases are still unknown, despite their essential rol in vivo and in biochemical laboratories. In this project we aim to develop a polymerase capable of accepting and <b>incorporating</b> <b>synthetic</b> nucleotides with modified leaving groups by means of molecular evolution in order to illucidate the enzyme mechanism. Furthermore, this polymerase will represent a valuable contribution to an orthogonal genetic system as the addition of synthetic nucleotide triphosphates will likely interfere with DNA/RNA metabolism, energie storage and phosphorylation regulation of the host. Of course, modification of the leaving group alone will not result in complete orthogonality. Therefore, a polymerase will be designed, based on information gathered from literature and acquired from ongoing projects within the research group, capable of <b>incorporating</b> <b>synthetic</b> nucleotides with both modified sugar and leaving groups. These artificial nucleic acids {{will not be able}} to interact with natural systems. In short term, these enzymes are directly applicable in the development of aptamers based on xeno nucleic acids (XNA). status: accepte...|$|R

50|$|Whereas in most {{previous}} {{sources of}} light (incandescent lamps, discharge lamps, {{and those that}} burn combustible fuel, e.g. candles and oil lamps) the light results from heat, LEDs only operate if they are kept cool enough. The <b>manufacturer</b> <b>commonly</b> specifies a maximum junction temperature of 125 or 150 °C, and lower temperatures are advisable {{in the interests of}} long life. At these temperatures, relatively little heat is lost by radiation, which means that the light beam generated by an LED is cool.|$|R
5000|$|The target vector is linearized and {{cut with}} a blunt-end {{restriction}} enzyme. This vector is then tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase. It is important to use ddTTP to ensure the addition of only one T residue. This tailing leaves the vector with a single 3'-overhanging thymine residue on each blunt end. <b>Manufacturers</b> <b>commonly</b> sell TA Cloning [...] "kits" [...] {{with a wide range}} of prepared vectors that have already been linearized and tagged with an overhanging thymine [...]|$|R
