40|$|The Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) {{is a kind}} of micromanipulative {{technique}} in which a single sperm is directly injected into the ooplasm of a matured oocyte using a <b>microscopic</b> <b>needle.</b> It is a type of in vitro fertilization which is mainly used to treat severe male factor infertility in human. This procedure can bypass many barriers of fertilization including the process of sperm penetration through cumulus-corona cells, zona pellucida and oolemma during fertilization by directly depositing the sperm into the ooplasm. The introduction of ICSI in assisted reproduction has helped to investigate and understand the early events of fertilization such as sperm capacitation, the acrosome reaction and pronucleus formation. Like humans, domestic animals including goats, suffer from infertility or sub-fertility, which lowers their lifetime productivity and reduces the number of offspring that could be obtained from a sire or dam. The prevalence of this problem coupled with the desire of people to understand and subsequently control the reproductive processes has {{led to the development of}} novel assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) like ICSI. It is one of the modern ART which can be used in livestock for the improvement and preservation of livestock genetics and the enhancement of reproductive efficiency. Till now, ICSI technique - one of the modern ARTs - has been successfully used in humans, rodents and other animals, especially in the cattle. The present study describes different aspect of ICSI including history, types of micromanipulative techniques, remodeling of fertilization process, oocyte activation and factors affecting outcomes of ICSI etc...|$|E

25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, in the massive material. Some rose quartz contains <b>microscopic</b> rutile <b>needles</b> which produces an asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|R
40|$|Larvae of the Northern {{pine processionary}} moth (Thaumetopoea pinivora, TP) carry <b>microscopic</b> <b>needles</b> (setae), which by {{penetrating}} skin and mucous membranes, may cause inflammatory/immune derived symptoms in man. In {{the present study}} the stimulatory effects of setae on human blood lymphocytes in vitro was investigated. Blood mononuclear cells were separated from venous blood or buffy coat of ten healthy individuals, six previously exposed to setae and four with no known exposure. Lymphoproliferation was measured as uptake of 3 H-thymidine. Setae were prepared from TP larvae. Setae and saline setae extracts stimulated proliferation of T-lymphocytes {{in the presence of}} monocytic cells. Stimulation was pronounced in cells from persons who had been exposed to setae, and weak in cells from non-exposed donors. Chitin also induced lymphocyte proliferation in most donors, but to a lesser extent and independently of donor’s previous exposure to setae. In conclusion, setae contain molecules that in the presence of monocytes activate human T-lymphocytes to proliferation. The antigenic nature of stimulatory molecules was supported by the significantly stronger lymphocyte response in persons previously exposed to setae than in non-exposed donors. The nature of such molecules remains to be defined...|$|R

[...] It occurs in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia on corroded tennantite in the second oxidation zone under hydrothermal conditions in a dolostone-hosted polymetallic ore deposit. [...] It is associated with adamite, stranskiite, koritnigite, claudetite, tsumcorite, and ludlockite. The origin of discovery was in a dolostone ore formation within an oxidized hydrothermal zone, in the E9 pillar, 31st level of the Tsumeb Mine in Namibia, Southwest Africa.

40|$|The Main Central Thrust Zone (MCTZ) in the Alaknanda valley, NW Himalaya, {{affected}} the Lesser Himalayan Crystalline Sequence {{and has a}} gradual transition to the structurally overlying Higher Himalayan Crystalline Sequence (HHCS). This boundary is defined {{on the basis of}} the following petrographic features in pelitic rocks at the base of the HHCS: (i) first appearance of <b>microscopic</b> <b>needles</b> of kyanite upon moving up-section along the transect; (ii) garnet porphyroblasts with random inclusion pattern and non-rotational growth history, which contrast with the garnet porphyroblasts in MCTZ rocks with spiral inclusion trails; and (iii) chemically homogeneous garnet porphyroblasts as opposed to the growth-zoned garnets in MCTZ rocks. Pseudosection modelling and garnet isopleth thermobarometry of pelitic rocks yield peak metamorphic conditions of 6. 3 - 7. 5 kbar and 550 - 582 degrees C in the MCTZ, and 8. 0 - 10. 0 kbar and 610 - 650 degrees C in the basal part of the HHCS. The results indicate continuity in the P-T field gradient across the contact between the MCTZ and HHCS. The MCTZ shows an inverted metamorphic sequence from biotite to garnet zones. Metamorphism in the basal part of the HHCS is in the kyanite zone, which is continuous with the inverted metamorphic sequence. Both P and T increase up-section, peak in the lower HHCS and then decrease higher up in the HHCS unit. The observations are consistent with predictions of a recently proposed thermomechanical model in which temperature in the shear zone rises due to viscous heating and pressure rises as a result of weakening of the rocks...|$|R
40|$|Biopharmaceuticals, {{including}} proteins, DNA and vaccines, {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} growing segments of the overall pharmaceutical market. While the hypodermic injection, the most common delivery method for these molecules, is effective, it also has limitations, including low patient compliance, need for medically trained personnel and biohazardous sharps after delivery. The overall goal of this thesis was to develop a new delivery system for biopharmaceuticals, based on dissolving polymer microneedles, which is effective and more patient compliant than the hypodermic <b>needle.</b> Microneedles are <b>microscopic</b> <b>needles</b> that are large enough to insert into the skin to deliver drugs effectively, while being short enough to avoid the pain causing nerves deep in the skin. An additional benefit of polymer microneedles is that the needles completely dissolve in the skin, leaving behind no biohazardous sharps. There are significant material and fabrication issues that must be overcome in the development of this new device. The first part of this thesis focused on the development of a new fabrication process, based on in situ photopolymerization, for the creation of polymer microneedles. These microneedles were shown to successfully insert into the skin, dissolving within a minute to deliver the encapsulated cargo, and retain full activity of encapsulated proteins. Next, we applied the microneedle technology to the delivery of the influenza virus. We found that the reformulation process required to encapsulate the influenza virus in polymer microneedles did not affect the antigenicity or immunogenicity of the virus. In addition, we used coated metal microneedles to successfully immunize mice with the influenza virus, verifying the delivery capabilities of a microneedle system. Finally, we used the dissolving polymer microneedles to successfully immunize mice with the influenza virus, resulting in full protection against lethal challenge after one immunization. This immune response was equivalent to the control intramuscular injection. In conclusion, we have developed dissolving polymer microneedles as an effective and patient compliant delivery system for biopharmaceuticals. This system could be especially applicable to mass immunization efforts or home use, since it can be self-administered and allows for easy disposal with no biohazardous sharps. Ph. D.

40|$|Brushlike {{arrays of}} {{electrodes}} packaged with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are undergoing development {{for use as}} electronic implants especially as neuro-prosthetic devices that might be implanted in brains to detect weak electrical signals generated by neurons. These implants partly resemble the ones reported in Integrated Electrode Arrays for Neuro-Prosthetic Implants (NPO- 21198), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 2 (February 2003), page 48. The basic idea underlying both the present and previously reported implants is that the electrodes would pick up signals from neurons and the ASICs would amplify and otherwise preprocess the signals for monitoring by external equipment. The figure presents a simplified and partly schematic view of an implant according to the present concept. Whereas the electrodes in an implant according to the previously reported concept would be microscopic wires, the electrodes according to the present concept are {{in the form of}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>needles.</b> An even more important difference would be that, unlike the previously reported concept, the present concept calls for the inclusion of microelectromechanical actuators for adjusting the depth of penetration of the electrodes into brain tissue. The prototype implant now under construction includes an array of 100 electrodes and corresponding array of electrode contact pads formed on opposite faces of a plate fabricated by techniques that are established in the art of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A mixed-signal ASIC under construction at the time of reporting the information for this article will include 100 analog amplifier channels (one amplifier per electrode). On one face of the mixed-signal ASIC there will be a solder-bump/micro-pad array that will have the same pitch as that of the electrode array, and that will be used to make the electrical and mechanical connections between the electrode array and the ASIC. Once the electrode array and the ASIC are soldered together, the remaining empty space between them will be filled with a biocompatible epoxy, the remaining exposed portions of the ASIC will be covered with micromachined plates for protection against corrosive bodily fluids, and then the ASIC and its covering micromachined plates will be coated with parylen...|$|R
40|$|To date, transdermal {{delivery}} {{is recognized as}} a successful route for the administration of active compounds, overcoming most of the drawbacks affecting the traditional oral and parenteral routes. Patches made up of <b>microscopic</b> <b>needles,</b> namely microneedles, fabricated by means of several kinds of polymers, including biodegradable, biocompatible and water-soluble polymers, have been, in the last decade, developed and tested as effective and non-invasive devices for delivering therapeutic macromolecules across the skin. Anyway, some limitations associated to the fabrication techniques of biodegradable and dissolvable microneedles, such as stamp-based multistep processes or high working temperatures, not suitable for encapsulating thermo-labile drugs, have prevented their spreading on pharmaceutical market. Recently, a mold-free and mild temperature Electro-Drawing (ED) technique, has been proposed as viable route for the fabrication of biodegradable microneedles: {{it is based on}} the single-step deformation of sessile drops of polymer solution, undergoing an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) action generated from the electric field arising from a pyroelectric crystal, punctually and thermally stimulated. In the thesis work a novel ED set up, based on the control of the pyro-EHD action by means of an electric circuit directly patterned onto the crystal is presented. This solution allows the heating of an extended surface area of the crystal, in order to activate a uniform electric field, and therefore a homogeneous EHD action, on a two-dimensional array of polymer solution drops. In this way the ED advantages are extended to the in parallel fabrication of microneedles in an array configuration, in a single drawing step. In addition, microneedle shape modulation, in terms of indenting cone height and tip radius of curvature, can be achieved. This optimized shape, joint to a rapid dissolvable layer interposed between the microneedles and their substrate, allows the release of microneedles from the patch few minutes after its application. Several strategies for tuning the microneedle internal morphology, in order to modulate the drug release kinetics, are also presented. In particular, it is shown how, by electro-drawing drops of emulsions, it is possible to obtain microneedles with closed disperse compartments, which features can be controlled through the emulsion formulation, especially the inner phase composition. On the contrary, interconnected porosities can be obtained by means of a Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS) process on the just shaped microneedles. A strategy based on Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Monte Carlo modeling has also been developed to study thermodynamics of binary or ternary systems, in order to gain information useful for controlling the morphologies of porous polymer structures obtained from phase separation processes...|$|R
40|$|Transdermal drug delivery, besides painful {{injections}} with syringes, {{has long}} been associated with small size particle pharmaceuticals, which can diffuse through the skin. This method of drug administration has only been applicable on {{a small number of}} drugs, where active molecules are small and delivery time should or can be long. Other drug delivery options are oral administration and injection with hypodermic needles (ordinary hospital syringes). In oral administration the stomach and liver tend to dissolve the drug and the effect becomes more difficult to anticipate, and drug delivery rates difficult to control. Hypodermic needles are used as a mean of drug injection directly into the bloodstream. This method is painful and risks infection due to tissue damage and skin penetration. One way to get a painless non-damaging technique with high delivery rate that still can delivery large molecules is to manufacture an array of <b>microscopic</b> hollow <b>needles</b> and equip them with a pumping unit that delivers the correct amount of drugs. This thesis shows the technique and possibility of manufacture micromachined needles using low cost techniques of Ion Track Technology (radiation of heavy ions creates porous materials), electroless deposition (non-current activated wet chemistry method of depositing metal) and electroplating. It also shows {{that it is possible to}} combine the needles with a thermal activated pump (actuator) unit made of paraffin to transport liquid through the needles. Hence the experiments show that microneedles and actuator fulfil the fundamentals towards micro scaled drug administration, transportation of fluid...|$|R
40|$|Caring for {{any animal}} {{is more of}} an art than a science. What works for one keeper may not {{necessarily}} work for another. This may be based on unnoticed nuances, local climate or weather patterns, the personalities of the individual animals, or other minute details. This is a basic husbandry and breeding guide to the Mexican red knee tarantula (Brachypelma smithi). Any more specifics will have to be discovered personally or discussed with colleagues. Where many vertebrates have been kept in captivity for centuries a lot of invertebrates are relatively new to the husbandry world. Even though humans have kept and captive bred many tarantulas for decades; keepers and hobbyists around the world are still discovering new husbandry techniques and new species to keep every year. The Mexican red knee tarantula (Brachypelma smithi (F. O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1897)) is a species of robust spider. The genus is found only in Southern North America and Central America; primarily Mexico to Panama (Valerrio 1980; Smith 1994). Brachypelma smithi is found along the Western faces of the Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre Occidental mountain ranges in Mexico. This terrestrial species rarely leaves the comfort of its burrow in the wild. Their burrows can be found near rocks or at the base of vegetation (Lockt, 1999). Mature males will participate in an annual migration to find willing partners but females and immature specimen stay relatively stationary. Like all arachnids, Brachypelma are characterized by two body segments and eight legs. Their fangs are oriented vertically, grouping them into the Suborder Mygalomorphae. The Mexican red kneed tarantula sports a black abdomen covered by brown/ red hairs. The cephalothorax is also black with a khaki colored ring. The Brachypelma smithi is renowned for the bright orange to red-orange splashes of color on their patella; they may also sport smaller patches of color on the legs below the patella (Gurley, 1993). New World tarantulas are notorious for their ability to discharge urticating hairs. When the spider feels threatened it may scrape the back of its abdomen and flick a cloud of <b>microscopic</b> <b>needles</b> that is capable of causing pain and discomfort to those that are easily irritated. Brachypelma are generally mild mannered and do not always respond to disturbances by flicking hairs or displaying a threat posture. The venom is an insect specific neurotoxin (Zhong, Y., Song, B., Lu, Q., et al., 2014). However, it can cause pain and discomfort similar to a bee sting. The tarantulas of the genus Brachypelma are long-lived. The males reach maturity in 3 - 7 years, living only one year or less after the last molt. The females however, reach maturity in 4 - 10 years, and then are capable of living another decade or two (Locht, 1999). The Brachypelma species from the west coast of Mexico are particularly docile and colorful. These traits have led to their being collected in large numbers for the pet trade. The destruction of the natural habitat and the high mortality before sexual maturity (99 %) (Baerg, 1958) are two factors that affect the populations of these species, and combined with the illegal trade that normally involves the capture of pre-adult and adult tarantulas, can cause the extinction of these tarantulas. To regulate this trade and prevent their endangerment, all the species of this genus have been listed in appendix II of CITES (Locht, Yanez and Vazquez 1999). The IUCN lists the Red Knee tarantula as a Near Threatened species. Mexican red kneed tarantulas are widely used as educational ambassadors within many AZA facilities. Although being a long lived species, precautions were needed in order to keep this species in collections. Captive reproduction for this genus is common in the private tarantula hobby. However, this species is rarely bred in AZA institutions. In 2007 the Mexican red kneed tarantula became an AZA managed program within the Terrestrial Invertebrate Taxon Advisory Group...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} is described for {{the measurement of}} muscle capillary basement membranes by electron <b>microscopic</b> examination of <b>needle</b> biopsies of the quadriceps muscle. With this procedure it has been possible to obtain an objective evaluation {{of the significance of}} capillary basement membrane hypertrophy in diabetic microangiopathy. The results of such studies of muscle capillary basement membrane thickness in 50 normal, 51 diabetic, and 30 prediabetic patients have demonstrated the following. First, that the average capillary basement membrane width of diabetic patients is over twice that of normal subjects; moreover, such basement membrane thickening is a very constant finding among overtly diabetic patients, in that approximately 98 % of individual diabetic subjects demonstrated this lesion. The degree of basement membrane thickening in diabetic patients is, however, unrelated to age, weight, severity, or duration of diabetes. Second, capillary basement membrane hypertrophy has been found in approximately 50 % of patients who are genetically prediabetic but who have not yet demonstrated evidence of the manifest carbohydrate disturbances of diabetes mellitus. Third, in contrast to the results obtained in genetically diabetic patients, subjects with severe hyperglycemia due to causes other than genetic diabetes only infrequently show basement membrane hypertrophy...|$|R
