5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{aircraft}} development became increasingly expensive, resulting in major projects often becoming <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> {{political and economic}} concerns. The development of TSR-2 saw increasing cost overruns, combined {{with the presence of}} a potentially cheaper alternative then under development in the United States, the F-111. The P.1154 was subject to the ongoing inter-service rivalry between the Royal Navy and RAF, which led to two wildly differing specifications being submitted for the aircraft that were impossible to fulfill with a single airframe.|$|E

The show, however, was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> controversy when it was alleged that the portions of the show were rigged to eliminate certain players, scenes were re-shot or staged to enhance drama, and contestants read from scripts.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E

5|$|The EADS/Northrop Grumman KC-45 was a {{proposed}} {{version of the}} A330 MRTT for the United States Air Force (USAF)'s KC-X aerial refuelling programme. In February 2008, the USAF selected the aircraft to replace the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The replacement process was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> controversy, instances of corruption, and allegations of favouritism. In July 2010, EADS submitted a tanker bid to the USAF without Northrop Grumman as a partner. However, on 24 February 2011, the USAF picked the Boeing KC-767 proposal, later named KC-46, as the winner because of its lower cost.|$|E
5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 Uptown {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those concerned for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a victory}} over the Buffalo Sabres after Christmas, and with the team still <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> 14th place in the Western Conference, General Manager and Executive Vice President Darryl Sutter {{announced}} his resignation from both positions on December 28, exactly eight years after {{he was hired by}} the team to become its coach in 2002. The move was not entirely Sutter's decision, as he was asked by the organization to step aside. The decision came as a shock to many fans, even as it was believed to be inevitable following the team's decline in recent seasons. Jay Feaster assumed control of the team, serving as acting general manager.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began in 1993 before the novel was published. Mike Nichols {{purchased}} the film rights, and the project {{was picked up by}} Savoy Pictures. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> development hell; during the troubled pre-production, Ben Stiller and John Dahl turned down opportunities to direct the film. After Savoy closed in November 1995, the project was sold to Paramount Pictures, and financed by Mutual Film Company, which provided a budget of $17 million. John Boorman was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. Principal photography began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days; filming took place in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The score was produced and composed by Danny Elfman.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> the complex technical questions {{of a test}} ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|In early March, Camacho {{resigned}} {{after three}} consecutive league draws, citing {{his inability to}} motivate the club. His assistant Fernando Chalana then took over, but Benfica continued to disappoint; they were eliminated in the UEFA Cup and <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> second place in mid-March. In April, the situation deteriorated further; Benfica matched their worst league defeat in 60 years, slipped to fourth place and was knocked out of the Portuguese Cup by Sporting CP. An away draw in May's opening game left the club dangerously close to finishing fourth. One week later, fans had the bitter-sweet experience of celebrating Rui Costa's final match and seeing Benfica finish fourth, their worst finish since 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying {{he was too busy}} writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon to work on that film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> pre-production for years.|$|E
5|$|With the {{construction}} of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000lots {{in a few months}} in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only to learn that the peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Though initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.|$|E
5|$|Animation enthusiasts {{have noticed}} {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and <b>mired</b> <b>in</b> local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

Härkösuo <b>Mire</b> <b>in</b> Kuhmo, eastern Finland covers about 20 hectares and includes a small area of aapamire, together with spring fen and pine bog types. Two vegetation maps of this site were prepared from aerial photographs and field observations by different observers using the Russian and Finnish approaches independently, and the maps were compared quantitatively using GIS techniques. Despite the different vegetation classification methods, the maps have a great deal in common. The correspondence of results obtained using the Russian ‘dominant’ approach and the Finnish ‘site type’ approach is discussed. The main differences occurred in the marginal zones of the <b>mire.</b> <b>In</b> the Finnish approach, marginal areas with dense spruce cover are regarded as <b>mire</b> whilst <b>in</b> the Russian approach they are classified as forest...|$|R
