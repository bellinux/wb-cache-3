25|$|In December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson {{approved}} {{a draft of}} a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides—who had long resisted <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations</b> {{as a way to}} address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{different}} bargaining strengths between music creators and music companies results in inefficient and unfair copyright revenue distrribution. On that basis it suggests two forms of regulatory intervnetion. Fair Trade Music is a voluntary certification scheme which would set a satndard of ‘fair remuneration’. The second option is <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> {{of the distribution of}} copyright revenue to ensure a minimum proportion goes to the music creator. Both schemes are considered against the benefits and obstacles in their practical implementation, ability to achieve the regulatory goal, political reactions and international obligations. Ultimately, this paper does not recommend adoption of a <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> and advises a cautionary approach to Fair Trade Music. Ostensibly it is unlikely the government will pursue either regulatory response without some politcal impetus...|$|R

The law also regulates legal efforts against terrorism.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility for}} governance authorities to avoid {{a large part of}} regulatory costs, by simply backing up social norms with a threat of collective punishment. Specifically, we consider the case of fisheries in which the regulatory cap is to sustain an optimal conservation level. We identify a <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> such that, when it is used as a threat, it ensures that the cap is voluntarily implemented. The mandatory scheme is based on a incentive mechanism which secures the returns of the harvester, and a tax on potential capacity. From the status of mere threat, this <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> takes time to be enforced though. We show that such a tax scheme, even if it is applied randomly after the first occurrence of a deviation from the optimal conservation level, ensures voluntary compliance, provided a suitable choice of the capacity tax. We study the properties of this tax scheme and build an example using data on the scallop fishery in the Saint-Brieuc Bay (France) to illustrate our point...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} provides additional {{empirical evidence}} for a previous study into external pressure group influences on corporate social disclosure (Tilt 1994) and extends the investigation to include recent increases in anticorporate activism, corporate social responsiveness and <b>mandatory</b> reporting <b>regulations.</b> The results reveal a relative consistency in pressure group viewpoints regarding corporate social disclosure across time, and show that pressure groups view corporate social disclosure as insufficient, even when relevant, and requiring greater <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation.</b> Although groups do attempt to influence corporate social disclosure this is primarily through indirect means. Overall, Australian external pressure groups {{do not appear to}} be satisfied with the results of any influence given their increased activities over time and the perceived insufficiencies and deficiencies of available corporate social disclosure...|$|R
40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{disclosure}} {{has attracted}} attention from regulatory bodies and academics {{over the past}} few decades. Due to the unreliability resulted from CSR voluntary disclosure, an increasing number of researchers are calling for more government regulation on CSR disclosure. Based on 1830 standalone CSR reports disclosed by the Chinese-listed firms during 2009 - 2012, we examine the effect of <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> on CSR reporting quality. We further hypothesize and test for the moderating effect of firm size and other characteristics on the link between government regulation on CSR reporting quality. Our results suggest that government <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulation</b> leads to an overall improvement in CSR reporting quality. We also find that this positive effect is greater when firms are larger and have better financial performance, but less when firms are controlled by government. Our study provides a direct answer to the recent calling for mandatory disclosure on CSR reports, and helps to understand why recent studies of social disclosure regulation suggest that government interventions do not seem to resolve the problems that are generally attributed to voluntary disclosures. Our findings should be of interest to the academics, regulators, and investors...|$|R

For the purpose of controlling these species’ introductions and dispersal, the Executive Secretary of the Task Force is given the responsibility of issuing voluntary guidelines for ships carrying ballast water. Ships are to report on whether or not they had followed the guidelines, and the Coast Guard has the responsibility of keeping records and reporting on who was complying with the guidelines. [...] If compliance is not being met, the Task Force is then instructed by NISA to recommend <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations.</b> However, since a target for invasive species reduction was never established, determining the right amount of compliance remains unclear. [...] With such ambiguous targets and not much incentive to alter old behaviors, those in the shipping industry seem to have little motivation to follow the NISA guidelines.|$|E
50|$|An {{acceptable}} {{quality level}} {{is a test}} and/or inspection standard that prescribes {{the range of the}} number of defective components that is considered acceptable when random sampling those components during an inspection. The defects found during an electronic or electrical test, or during a physical (mechanical) inspection, are sometimes classified into three levels: critical, major and minor. Critical defects are those that render the product unsafe or hazardous for the end user or that contravene <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations.</b> Major defects can result in the product's failure, reducing its marketability, usability or saleability. Lastly, minor defects do not affect the product's marketability or usability, but represent workmanship defects that make the product fall short of defined quality standards. Different companies maintain different interpretations of each defect type. In order to avoid argument, buyers and sellers agree on an AQL standard, chosen according to the level of risk each party assumes, which they use as a reference during pre-shipment inspection.|$|E
5000|$|For this reason, Congress {{has often}} avoided {{adoption}} of completely nationalized programs {{by one of}} two devices. In the first, Congress creates a delivery system for federal programs in which the national government encourages local implementation of a federal program by providing significant matching funds. In this context, the phrase {{may be found in}} a number of Supreme Court and lower court federal cases. The most frequent early use of the phrase may be found in a series of cases describing the paradigm for federally sponsored welfare programs such as medical assistance or the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs in which a participating state's program is financed largely by the Federal Government, on a matching fund basis, subject to federal <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations.</b> See for example, King v. Smith and a series of subsequent AFDC cases. More recently, the phrase has been used in connection with other federal programs built on the cooperative federalism model. See California v. U.S. 438 U.S. 645 (1978) (Reclamation Act) and Schaffer v. Weist (Special education). Here, the motivation for State compliance is that absent state compliance with federal conditions, the state loses significant federal funding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the possibilities of}} developing agri-environmental policy measures in Israel, focusing on market-oriented instruments. A conceptual framework for developing agri-environmental policy measures is presented, first in very broad lines (<b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations,</b> economic instruments and advisory measures) and subsequently focusing on economic instruments, and specifically, on market-oriented ones. Two criteria of choice between the measures are suggested: their contribution to improving {{the effectiveness of the}} policy; and the feasibility of their implementation. This is the framework used for analyzing agri-environmental measures in Israel. Israel currently implements a mix of <b>mandatory</b> <b>regulations,</b> economic instruments and advisory measures to promote the agri-environment. The use of additional economic instruments may improve the effectiveness of the policy. When comparing the effectiveness of various economic measures, we found that the feasibility of implementation of market-oriented instruments is greater, due to the Israeli public’s preference for strengthening market orientation in the agricultural sector. Four market-oriented instruments were practiced in a pilot project conducted in an Israeli rural area. We found that in this case study, the institutional feasibility and acceptance by stakeholders were the major parameters influencing the implementation of the market-oriented instruments, whereas the instruments’ contribution to enhancing the ecological o...|$|E
