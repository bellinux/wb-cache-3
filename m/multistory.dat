5|$|In {{the city}} of Rome, most people lived in <b>multistory</b> {{apartment}} buildings (insulae) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (thermae), toilets that were flushed with running water (latrinae), conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains (nymphea) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed primarily at the common {{people who lived in}} the insulae. Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|On May 13, 1851, Antoine-Olivier Berthelet {{purchased}} land on {{the corner}} of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-André Street (in Montreal) for use by the Misericorde Sisters, and in December 1851, following renovations to the two pre-existing structures on the land, the Sisters moved to the new address. In 1853 work began on a Mother House (or convent) for the Institute. The Motherhouse was planned to be a <b>multistory</b> building, built of grey stone, financed by borrowed money. Plans for the motherhouse had been drawn up in 1852 but the Montreal fires of July 8, 1852, which destroyed around 11,000 homes along with the Saint-Jacques Cathedral, had the result of delaying construction projects throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest <b>multistory</b> concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E
5|$|The former SeaWorld site {{began to}} be {{demolished}} in late 2004, when Geauga Lake started construction on a new water park. On November 11, 2004 Geauga Lake announced Wildwater Kingdom, a new water park {{scheduled to open in}} 2005. It would be constructed in two phases, with the first phase costing $16million and the second phase $8million. The first phase consisted of a ProSlide Tornado, an activity pool, an action river and a new children's area with a <b>multistory</b> play structure. Hurricane Mountain, Ohio's tallest water-slide complex, was moved from the existing water park to the new Wildwater Kingdom and renamed Thunder Falls. Together, they formed Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom. The parks were connected by a floating bridge {{in the middle of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|The orphanage {{provided}} both {{academic and}} vocational training to orphaned {{boys and girls}} from Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany, graduating students skilled in such trades as tailoring, shoemaking, engraving, carpentry, metalworking, pottery, painting, printing, farming, and gardening. In 1903 a {{school for the blind}} was opened on the premises, including dormitories, classrooms and vocational workshops. The orphanage also operated its own printing press and bindery; flour mill and bakery; laundry and clothing-repair service; carpentry; pottery factory; tree and plant nursery; and brick and tile factory. Located on high ground and surrounded by a high stone wall, the orphanage's distinctive onion-dome tower, <b>multistory</b> buildings, and decorative facades exuded the power and influence of European Christians in Jerusalem in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a <b>multistory</b> car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{building}} {{supply in the}} Roman time period was wood. Trees were cut to house increasing populations throughout the Roman Empire. While some Mediterranean houses were built with brick and stone, roof structures, covered with tiles, {{as well as the}} floors in <b>multistory</b> apartment buildings were often made of wood.|$|E
25|$|Livermore has two {{stations}} for the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE), a commuter train which runs from Stockton to the San Jose area. One station is at Vasco Road, {{and the other}} is in downtown Livermore at its Transit Center. The Transit Center has a free <b>multistory</b> parking garage and connections to the WHEELS bus system.|$|E
25|$|Powell's City of Books {{claims to}} be the largest {{independent}} new and used bookstore in the world, occupying a <b>multistory</b> building on an entire city block in the Pearl District. In 2010, Powell's Technical Books was relocated to Powell's Books Bldg. 2 {{across the street from the}} flagship store. In 2012, the city was named by Travel & Leisure magazine as the No. 1 city in the country for bookstores.|$|E
25|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} {{were established in}} December 1963. Israel has an embassy in Nairobi and Kenya has an embassy in Tel Aviv. In 2003, Kenya requested Israel's help in developing a national solar energy program. In 2006, Israel sent an 80-person search-and-rescue team to Kenya to save people trapped in rubble when a <b>multistory</b> building collapsed. Following the 2007 Kenyan presidential election Israel donated medicine to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, governments across America took {{initiatives}} to destroy so-called slums and ghettos of the cities, {{and put up}} housing projects in place. These <b>multistory,</b> high-density projects were where whites began to push blacks who were dislocated by destruction of slums, also heavily avoided by the white population. Despite the Fair Housing Act, which included cases like Gautreaux and Shannon which prohibited placing projects exclusively in black neighborhoods, the trend did not end.|$|E
25|$|This area {{takes in}} 19 blocks {{and parts of}} several others. James and Steuben streets, as well as Maiden Lane, are {{included}} in their entirety along with some narrow alleys within blocks. The area is totally developed, with many <b>multistory</b> buildings used as office space with storefronts at street level. Open space between them and on the edges is used for parking lots. There are no significant parks or squares within it.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the many}} {{communities}} that {{were affected by}} the disaster, the Caraballeda fan {{was one of the}} most hard-hit. The intensity of the disaster here is a combination of two factors. First, the Caraballeda fan was heavily urbanized, with many high-rise buildings and <b>multistory</b> houses. Second, it lies at the mouth of the Quebrada San Julián (Saint Julian Ravine), and this watershed produced very large boulders and a massive inundated area. Approximately 1/3 of the Caraballeda fan was inundated by debris flows, and the entire fan is built of past debris flow deposits.|$|E
25|$|Livermore has {{a strong}} blue-collar element, {{as well as many}} {{professionals}} who work at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other work sites in the high tech industries within the Bay Area. Recent housing development has included the addition of hundreds of million-dollar homes set among the southside's vineyards, as well as a multimillion-dollar renovation of the downtown area. Renovations included office buildings, the Livermore Cinemas, the Bankhead Theatre, and a <b>multistory</b> parking structure. The Livermore Civic Center includes a state-of-the-art library that opened in 2004, with a front mosaic by Maria Alquilar.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year saw {{the release of}} a more successful open-world platform-adventure, Nintendo's Metroid, which was critically acclaimed for having a balance between open-ended and guided exploration. Another platform-adventure released that year, Pony Canyon's Super Pitfall, was critically panned for its vagueness and weak game design. That same year Jaleco released Esper Boukentai, a platform-action sequel to Psychic 5 that scrolled in all directions and allowed the player character to make huge <b>multistory</b> jumps, which were necessary to navigate the giant, vertically oriented levels. Telenet Japan also released its own take on the platform-action game, Valis, which contained anime-style cut scenes.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, {{the rural}} {{character}} of Westchester would transform into the suburban county known today. The Bronx River Parkway, completed in 1925, {{was the first}} modern, multi-lane limited-access roadway in North America. The development of Westchester's parks and parkway systems supported existing communities and encouraged the establishment of new ones, transforming the development pattern for Westchester. With the need for homes expanding after World War II, <b>multistory</b> apartment houses appeared in the urbanized areas of the county, while the market for single-family houses continued to expand. By 1950, the total County population was 625,816. Major interstate highways were constructed in Westchester during the 1950s and 1960s. The establishment of these roadways, along {{with the construction of}} the Tappan Zee Bridge, led to further growth in the county.|$|E
25|$|In Washington, D.C., BU has internship, {{journalism and}} {{management}} programs. Students {{study in the}} University's building on Massachusetts Avenue in Dupont Circle {{and take advantage of}} the city by interning at different locations. In 2011 the University completed construction of a new, <b>multistory</b> residence to house students in the program featuring touch-less entry cards for security and suites with communal kitchens, right next to the Woodly Park/Zoo Metro stop. The Multimedia and Journalism program allows students to act as Washington, D.C. correspondents for newspapers and television stations across the Northeast and New England while interning at major news outlets in the city, as well as at many PR internships in politics, government and public affairs. Internship opportunities are also offered {{in a wide variety of}} sectors for students enrolled in other BU Study Abroad Washington programs.|$|E
25|$|As for {{architecture}} in the city, both {{the body of}} architectural styles {{as well as the}} prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day {{when it comes to their}} demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, <b>multistory</b> apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, Simon {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} raze the mall and build a 625,000 to [...] mixed use facility with retail, office, medical, and residential space {{at a news conference}} at the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce building in Little Rock. The project would have potentially included half a dozen individual structures, including a big-box retailer on the west, two high-rise multifamily residential buildings on the north and a <b>multistory</b> medical office complex on University Avenue. Paschall Strategic Communications, who was assisting with Simon’s public relations campaign on the project, said that the negotiations were “going very well”, however these plans did not apparently come to pass.|$|E
500|$|The {{above-ground}} {{entrance to}} the Harris Theater is a glass-walled lobby at 205 E. Randolph Street, which spans several metallic and neon floors in what the Chicago Tribunes Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin describes as [...] "a <b>multistory</b> shaft of space that explodes downward from street level". The theater and adjacent Millennium Park Garage are located mostly underground, with a passage connecting them. Kamin also notes that the theater's underground design and the Millennium Park Garage entrance causes many theater goers to miss the spatial grandeur of the lobby, and has led to complaints about {{the time it takes}} to descend the many stairs to the theater. The theater has a rooftop terrace that is available for private events.|$|E
500|$|Like other European Christian {{institutions}} {{built in}} Jerusalem in the 1800s, the Schneller Orphanage was situated on high ground and {{was surrounded by}} a high stone wall, with an iron gate that was locked at night. The property exuded the power and influence of European Christians in Jerusalem with its <b>multistory</b> buildings, a clock tower, and decorative façade, including reliefs in stone and epigrams. Engraved on the façade of the main building is the verse [...] "Jesus the Messiah has compassion upon us" [...] in German and Arabic, as well as the name of the institution, Syrian Orphanage (...) [...] There is also a stone relief of a lamb carrying a flag with a cross on it. Following the visit of Kaiser Wilhelm to Jerusalem in 1898, the orphanage received three bells for its tower.|$|E

500|$|In 1946, U.S. National {{purchased}} the Wells Fargo Building (since 1922 {{known as the}} Porter Building), a <b>multistory</b> office building located directly adjacent, immediately to the north, to expand its downtown Portland headquarters. United States National Bank of Portland {{changed its name to}} United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964. [...] By 1970, the bank was operating 119 branches. At that time, it announced plans for another major expansion of its headquarters on property it had acquired diagonally across from the Wells Fargo Building. The entire oversize block, bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues, and Oak and Burnside Streets, had been acquired, its existing buildings to be razed and replaced by new U.S. National Bank buildings. The first of these was a seven-story building (the U.S. Bank Plaza, at 5th & Oak), completed in 1974. But the headline structure was the U.S. Bancorp Tower, a 42-story building that opened in 1983 (having already been part of the bank's long-term site plans in 1970, but ultimately delayed until the 1980s). Notwithstanding this major expansion, the firm continued to own and use its landmark 1917 building, which company president LeRoy Staver, in a 1970 Oregonian article, called [...] "a jewel of a banking property and one that will never be duplicated".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the late-nineteenth century, {{the weight}} of a <b>multistory</b> {{building}} had to be supported principally by the strength of its walls. The taller the building, the more strain this placed on the lower sections of the building; since there were clear engineering limits to the weight such [...] "load-bearing" [...] walls could sustain, large designs meant massively thick walls on the ground floors, and definite limits on the building's height.|$|E
2500|$|The state capital, St. Paul {{was most}} prosperous {{during the late}} 1800s and early 1900s, much of its {{downtown}} development occurred during that period. [...] Construction in downtown St. Paul was slow in the early 1920s. [...] Several significant buildings were constructed in the previous decade, though all commercial and public buildings relied heavily on the classical style, such as the St. Paul Public Library (1917) and Hamm Building (1919). [...] After the Hamm Building, no <b>multistory</b> office building was built in St. Paul until the Minnesota Building, itself the first high rise building in the city since World War I.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, the {{remodeling}} {{and expansion}} of the shopping center was completed, offering a new facade {{and a total of}} , occupied by over 300 stores. A three-level (255,000 square foot) Macy’s opened as the third anchor of the shopping center on October 25, making it the chain's first location outside the fifty states. Local movie theater chain Caribbean Cinemas opened a thirteen-screen movie theater and is the busiest and highest-grossing of the entire chain. A concept of [...] "public" [...] art was created in the shopping center, which includes pieces by local artists. In 2012, Plaza Las Américas invested $12 million in remodeling the mall's north entrance facade. The remodeling work began on May 23, 2012 and was completed by mid November 2012, just before the holiday season. In addition, between July–August 2012, expansion began on the <b>multistory</b> parking, located in the southern area of the mall. The expansion extended the five floors of <b>multistory</b> to add over 300 parking spaces. All parking areas of the mall were also repaved while new landscape gardens designs where developed in front of the main entrance. On August 28, 2013, Plaza opened the first ever Cheesecake Factory in Puerto Rico. Sports Authority opened up in mid-2014 which included an expansion of parking spaces. it closed in 2016 after the company declared bankruptcy and will be converted to Marshalls in October 2017, according to El Nuevo Dia.|$|E
