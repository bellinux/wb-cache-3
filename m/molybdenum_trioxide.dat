40|$|Graphene {{has been}} {{identified}} as an emerging horizon for a nanoscale photonic platform because the Fermi level of intrinsic graphene can be engineered to support surface plasmons (SPs). The current solid back electrical gating and chemical doping methods cannot facilitate the demonstration of graphene SPs at the near-infrared (NIR) window because of the limited shift of the Fermi level. Here, we present the evidence for the existence of graphene SPs on a tapered graphene-silicon waveguide tip at a NIR wavelength, employing a surface carrier transfer method with <b>molybdenum</b> <b>trioxides.</b> The coupling between the graphene surface plasmons and the guiding mode in silicon waveguides allows for the observation of the concentrated field of the SPs in the tip by near-field scanning optical microscopy.

5000|$|D-orbital {{aromaticity}} {{is found}} in trinuclear tungsten W3O9− and molybdenum Mo3O9− metal clusters generated by laser vaporization of the pure metals {{in the presence of}} oxygen in a helium stream. In these clusters the three metal centers are bridged by oxygen and each metal has two terminal oxygen atoms. The first signal in the photoelectron spectrum corresponds to the removal of the valence electron with the lowest energy in the anion to the neutral M3O9 compound. This energy turns out to be comparable to that of bulk tungsten trioxide and <b>molybdenum</b> <b>trioxide.</b> The photoelectric signal is also broad which suggests a large difference in conformation between the anion and the neutral species.

40|$|A <b>molybdenum</b> <b>trioxide</b> {{thin film}} with smooth surface and uniform {{thickness}} was successfully achieved by an electrospray deposition method using an aqueous solution with a drastically low concentration of 0. 05 wt%. Previous papers demonstrated that an additive solvent technique {{is useful for}} depositing the thin film by the electrospray deposition, and the high vapor pressure and a low surface tension of an additive solvent {{were found to be}} important factors.
