5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's fifth round home tie against South Shields {{produced}} a straightforward 3–0 victory.

Bolton drew Swansea Town, the last remaining Second Division club, in the semi-final. This meant Bolton did not <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> single First Division club in their path to the final. Three early goals gave Bolton a comfortable 3–0 win at White Hart Lane.|$|E

In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E

5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} to <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee for a large submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E
