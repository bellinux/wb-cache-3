The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three keels, 32 to 34 <b>midbody</b> scales, and separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of scales, and discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E
5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) <b>midbody</b> scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer <b>midbody</b> scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY-The {{formation}} and fate of aHached and eliminated <b>midbodies</b> (Zwischenkorper) of mitotic erythroblasts in rat fetal liver were studied by electron microscopy. Actual and theoretical numbers of interzonal spjndle fibers were determined. The actual number was about {{equal to the}} total number of fibers (x) for twice the number of chromosomes (2 n) plus 9 for centriologenous fibers, or x = 4 n + 9. <b>Midbodies</b> were RaHened bands or ribbon-like and not cylindrical. Those with shorter telophase bridges remained aHached to daughter erythroblasts in the late basophilic and early polychromatophilic stages of development. A pincer-like process produced by invaginations of the plasma membrane {{at the base of the}} shorter telophase bridges apparently caused the elimination of <b>midbodies</b> from the daughter cells. In both aHached and free <b>midbodies,</b> dense amor-phous material was distributed into a darker cortical and lighter medullary zone. Phagocytosis of <b>midbodies</b> was not observed.

40|$|Troyer {{syndrome}} is a {{hereditary spastic paraplegia}} caused by a mutation {{that leads to a}} complete loss of expression of spartin protein. The plant-related senescence domain in spartin is highly conserved and present in over 150 proteins, but its function is unknown. Our results indicate that spartin associates with phospholipids via its senescence domain. Phospholipids are important components of intracellular membranes and play roles in many cellular processes. Knock-down of spartin results in impaired cell division. The phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate (PI 3 P) is present at <b>midbodies,</b> where it recruits proteins for cytokinesis. Our findings demonstrate that spartin colocalizes with PI 3 P at <b>midbodies,</b> and knock-down of spartin results in fewer cells with PI 3 P at <b>midbodies.</b> Lipid transfer proteins shuttle lipids between intracellular membranes. Our data suggest that spartin functions as a novel lipid transfer protein.

Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the belly. The <b>midbody</b> is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E

40|$|Somatic cell {{cytokinesis}} {{was shown}} to involve the insertion of sphingolipids (SLs) to <b>midbodies</b> prior to abscission. Spermatogenic <b>midbodies</b> transform into stable intercellular bridges (ICBs) connecting clonal daughter cells in a syncytium. This process requires specialized SL structures. (1) Using high resolution-mass spectrometric imaging, we show in situ a biphasic pattern of SL synthesis with testis-specific anchors. This pattern correlates with and depends on ceramide synthase 3 (CerS 3) localization in both, pachytene spermatocytes until completion of meiosis and elongating spermatids. (2) Blocking the pathways to germ cell-specific ceramides (CerS 3 -KO) and further to glycosphingolipids (glucosylceramide synthase-KO) in mice highlights the need for special SLs for spermatid ICB stability. In contrast to somatic mitosis these SLs require ultra-long polyunsaturated anchors with unique physico-chemical properties, {{which can only be}} provided by CerS 3. Loss of these anchors causes enhanced apoptosis during meiosis, formation of multinuclear giant cells and spermatogenic arrest. Hence, testis-specific SLs, which we also link to CerS 3 in human testis, are quintessential for male fertility...|$|R

We used same-cell video, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy to compare the structure and composition of normal equatorial furrows with that of ectopic furrows formed between spindles. As in controls, ectopic furrows contained <b>midbodies</b> composed of microtubule bundles and an electron-opaque matrix. Despite the absence of an intervening spindle and chromosomes, the <b>midbodies</b> associated with ectopic furrows also contained the microtubule-bundling protein CHO 1 and the chromosomal passenger protein INCENP. However, CENP-E, another passenger protein, was not found in ectopic furrows but was always present in controls. We also examined cells in which the ectopic furrow initiated but relaxed. Although relaxing furrows contained overlapping microtubules from opposing centrosomes, they lacked microtubule bundles as well as INCENP and CHO 1. Together these data suggest that the mechanism defining the site of furrow formation during mitosis in vertebrates does not depend on the presence of underlying microtubule bundles and chromosomes or on the stable association of INCENP or CHO 1. The data also suggest that the completion of cytokinesis requires the presence of microtubule bundles and specific proteins (e. g., INCENP, CHO 1, etc.) that do not include CENP-E...|$|R
40|$|The multivesicular body (MVB) sorting pathway is a {{mechanism}} for delivering transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. ESCRT-III is the final complex in the pathway that assembles on endosomes and executes membrane scission of intraluminal vesicles. In addition, proteins of this complex are involved in other topologically similar processes such as cytokinesis, virus egress and autophagy. Here we show that protein kinase CK 2 α {{is involved in the}} phosphorylation of the ESCRT-III subunits CHMP 3 and CHMP 2 B, as well as of VPS 4 B/SKD 1, an ATPase that mediates ESCRT-III disassembly. This phosphorylation is observed both in vitro and in cells. While we do not observe recruitment of CK 2 α to endosomes, we demonstrate the localization of CK 2 α to <b>midbodies</b> during cytokinesis. Phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutants of ESCRT-III proteins can still bind endosomes and localize to <b>midbodies,</b> indicating that CK 2 α does not regulate ESCRT-III localization. Finally, we analyzed two cellular functions where CHMP 3, CHMP 2 B and VPS 4 are known to be involved, epidermal growth factor degradation and cytokinetic abscission.

40|$|In the {{accompanying}} paper (Cabral, F., 1982, J. Cell. Biol., 97 : 22 - 29) we described the isolation and properties of taxol-requiring mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells. We now show {{that at least}} one of these mutants, Tax- 18, has an impaired ability to form a spindle apparatus. Immunofluorescence studies using antibodies to tubulin demonstrate that, when incubated in the absence of taxol, Tax- 18 forms only a rudimentary spindle with few and shortened microtubules associated with the spindle poles. Furthermore, <b>midbodies</b> were not observed, consistent with an absence of cytokinesis. Essentially normal spindles and <b>midbodies</b> are seen in the presence of taxol. Electron microscopic examination indicates that centrioles and kinetochores are morphologically normal in the mutant strain. Pole-to-kinetochore microtubules were seen but interpolar microtubules were not. Taxol- deprived mutant cells stained with anti-centrosome serum show an elevated centriole content, indicating that the defect in Tax- 18 does not affect centriole replication or prevent progression through the cell cycle. Although Tax- 18 cells do not form a complete spindle in the absence of taxol, cytoplasmic microtubule assembly occurs in association with microtubule-organizing centers, and microtubules with apparently normal morphology exist throughout the cytoplasm. Observation of chromosome movement indicates that the defect in these cells occurs after prometaphase. These studies demonstrate that the formation of spindle microtubules requires cellular conditions that are different from those required for cytoplasmic microtubule formation. They further show that a normal spindle may be necessary for cytokinesis but not for progress of the cells through the cell cycle...|$|R

It has been reported that this protein has a masked nuclear export signal and is transiently exported to the cytoplasm upon cell infection with HIV- 1. We show the existence of a permanent fraction of hSNF 5 in the cytoplasm by biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence of cultured cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that exists a constitutive transport of EGFP-hSNF 5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), indicating that hSNF 5 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In order to elucidate hSNF 5 cytoplasmic functions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify putative hSNF 5 interacting proteins. We identified Dynamin 2 (DNM 2) as a putative hSNF 5 interacting protein and verified this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence colocalization and pull down experiments. DNM 2 is a GTPase implicated in several cellular events including cytokinesis and endocytosis. It has been shown that this protein localizes in <b>midbodies</b> and that Dnm 2 KO cells have cytokinesis defect. We show that hSNF 5 is also present in <b>midbodies</b> and that hSNF 5 overexpression prevents cytokinesis. Moreover, we have detected the opposite effect when antibodies against hSNF 5 are transfected in cells. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that DNM 2 depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits endocytosis. We have seen that stability of DNM 2 protein decreases in hSNF 5 -depleted cells, strongly impairing endocytosis. Taken together, our results reveal a new role of hSNF 5 in cytokinesis and endocytosis, probably by its interaction with DNM 2 Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Moreover, induced overexpression of Translin was found to accelerate cell proliferation. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that Translin is localized at the centrosomes at prophase and the mitotic spindle at metaphase, then translocating to the spindle <b>midbodies</b> during cytokinesis. This novel localization is attributable to specific interactions with microtubules of the mitotic spindles, and especially γ-tubulin.

40|$|Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of {{proteins}} and lipids {{are the major}} post-translational modifications involved in virtually all molecular signaling pathways in the cell and are catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases respectively. Abnormal variation in kinase and phosphatase activity leads {{to the development of}} several human diseases. Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) - 3 is a dual specificity phosphatase that has been related to cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, while PRL- 3 is aberrantly overexpressed in primary and metastatic tumors, it is barely expressed at all in healthy human tissue. Therefore, PRL- 3 represents a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment and an emerging prognostic marker for tumor progression. However, finding robust PRL- 3 substrate candidates remains a challenge in the field. The aim of the present work is to gain insight in both the cellular and molecular pathways where PRL- 3 is involved. The first part of this project is focused on the characterization of the role of PRL- 3 in epithelial cell polarity using organotypic 3 D-culture systems. We show that overexpression of PRL- 3 disrupts epithelial architecture by promoting the development of cysts with ectopic lumens that arise from mispositioned <b>midbodies.</b> Furthermore, we propose a novel cellular mechanism where <b>midbodies</b> are retained in the lateral membrane due to acceleration of cytokinesis driven by PRL- 3 overexpression. The second part of the work deals with investigating PRL- 3 PI(4, 5) P 2 phosphatase activity in cells, which was previously established in vitro. Here, we demonstrate this activity in vivo with a novel technique developed for this purpose. Moreover, we prove that the low phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PRL- 3 and its specific interaction with PI(4, 5) P 2 are essential for enhancing clathrin-mediated internalization. In conclusion, we show that PRL- 3 overexpression disrupts epithelial cell polarization probably by accelerating cytokinesis, and we demonstrate that it is a phosphoinositide phosphatase, increasing clathrin-dependent endocytosis...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAlthough massive {{membrane}} rearrangements {{occur during}} cell division, {{little is known}} about specific roles that lipids might play in this process.

In parallel, systematic RNAi knockdown of lipid biosynthetic enzymes identified enzymes required for division, which highly correlated with lipids accumulated in dividing cells. We show that cells specifically regulate the localization of lipids to <b>midbodies,</b> membrane-based structures where cleavage occurs. We conclude that cells actively regulate and modulate their lipid composition and localization during division, with both signaling and structural roles likely.

We show that many NuRD components interacted with pericentrin by coimmunoprecipitation and that they localized to centrosomes and <b>midbodies.</b> Overexpression of the pericentrin-binding domain of CHD 4 or another family member (CHD 3) dissociated pericentrin from centrosomes. Depletion of CHD 3, but not CHD 4, by RNA interference dissociated pericentrin and gamma-tubulin from centrosomes. Microtubule nucleation/organization, cell morphology, and nuclear centration were disrupted in CHD 3 -depleted cells. Spindles were disorganized, the majority showing a prometaphase-like configuration. Time-lapse imaging revealed mitotic failure before chromosome segregation and cytokinesis failure.

The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) pathway mediates intraluminal endosomal vesicle formation, budding of HIV- 1 and other enveloped viruses, and the final abscission step of cytokinesis in mammals and archaea.

40|$|Centrosomes are {{the primary}} {{microtubule}}-organizing centers that orchestrate microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle. The correct number of centrosomes is pivotal for establishing bipolar mitotic spindles that ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes. Thus, centrioles must duplicate once per cell cycle, one daughter per mother centriole, the process of which requires highly coordinated actions among core factors and modulators. Protein phosphorylation is shown to regulate the stability, localization and activity of centrosome proteins. Here, we report the function of Casein kinase II (CK 2) in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. The catalytic subunit (KIN- 3 /CK 2 α) of CK 2 localizes to nuclei, centrosomes and <b>midbodies.</b> Inactivating CK 2 leads to cell division defects, including chromosome missegregation, cytokinesis failure and aberrant centrosome behavior. Furthermore, depletion or inhibiting kinase activity of CK 2 results in elevated ZYG- 1 levels at centrosomes, restoring centrosome duplication and embryonic viability to zyg- 1 mutants. Our data suggest that CK 2 functions in cell division and negatively regulates centrosome duplication in a kinase-dependent manner...|$|R

We isolated RNAs that are differentially expressed in macrodissected prostate cancer samples. This study focused on 1 identified gene, TTLL 12, which was predicted to modify tubulins, an established target for tumor therapy. TTLL 12 is the most poorly characterized member of a recently discovered 14 -member family of proteins that catalyze posttranslational modification of tubulins. We show that human TTLL 12 is expressed in the proliferating layer of benign prostate. Expression increases during cancer progression to metastasis. It is highly expressed in many metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. It partially colocalizes with vimentin intermediate filaments and cellular structures containing tubulin, including <b>midbodies,</b> centrosomes, intercellular bridges and the mitotic spindle. Downregulation of TTLL 12 affects several posttranslational modifications of tubulin (detyrosination and subsequent deglutamylation and polyglutamylation). Overexpression alters chromosomal ploidy. These results raise the possibility that TTLL 12 could contribute to tumorigenesis through effects on the cytoskeleton, tubulin modification and chromosome number stability. This study contributes a step toward developing more selective agents targeting microtubules, an already successful target for tumor therapy...|$|R
