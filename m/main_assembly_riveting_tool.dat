50|$|Solid rivets {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Solid rivets consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of <b>rivet.</b> This <b>tool</b> is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A <b>rivet</b> compression <b>tool</b> does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid rivets.|$|R

Detailed discussions are provided on how to conduct vibration measurements of the tools and the methods of analysing the multiple impulsive signals. Important issues such as triggering method, averaging, windowing, recording, and conversion from fast Fourier transform narrow band spectrum to a one-third octave-band spectrum are included in the paper. In addition, the implementation of ISO 5349 standard on this type of measurement is addressed. It is believed that the methods presented in this paper can be applied for similar transient signals generated by other types of mechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|This chapter first reviews {{several aspects}} of the {{riveting}} process to ensure that riveted joints will have excellent fatigue performance. These aspects include solid rivets, joint design rules, several experimental and numerical methods to determine the residual stress/strain and interference in riveted joints, and the current approach for studying the riveting process. It then provides two case studies using experimental and finite element methods to explore: (i) {{the effect of the}} riveting process on the residual stress/strain in joints: and (ii) the stress condition in riveted lap joints when the joints are remotely loaded in tension. Concluding remarks on the potential development direction of the <b>riveting</b> <b>tools</b> and <b>rivets</b> are briefly provided. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The form {{drilling}} riveting is {{an advanced}} joining process of aluminum alloys. The {{purpose of this}} work is to made new type of form drilling – <b>riveting</b> <b>tool.</b> In addition, the effect of speed rate, feed rate and cone radius ratio on thrust, torque and heat generated were investigated. The significance of influence parameters on their quality characteristics were examined by ANOVA. The optimal combination of parameters for speed and feed were determined based on Signal to Noise ratio. Since the process has multiple performance characteristics, the grey relational analysis is used. The grey relational grade normalizes the contradicting performance indices. From eighteen experiments based on the orthogonal array of L 18 the best combination of parameters were found. Compared with Taguchi’s method the proposed method is more scientific. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method in this study effectively improves the machining performance of Form Riveting process...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} for both barrels {{is housed in}} a single receiver. This is a single forging, milled to house the two separate actions.

The bolt is a steel forging well machined. The gas cylinder tube is constructed of seamless steel tubing and is threaded to the receiver at the rear. The trigger assembly is made up of two separate sear <b>assemblies</b> <b>riveted</b> to the pistol grip framework. Two pistol grips are located about 6 inches apart, the sears are connected to a horizontal trigger bar mounting a trigger on either end. Both guns may be fired by depressing either trigger. The magazine is the saddle-drum magazine type. Each side holds 50 rounds and feeds one gun. Each side has its own spring so that, {{in the event of a}} jam affecting one barrel, the other gun may continue to fire.|$|R
