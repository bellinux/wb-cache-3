40|$|Except for {{specific}} {{cases where the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) maintains a continuous presence at a facility (such as the Japanese Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant), {{there is always a}} period of time or delay between the moment a State is notified or aware of an upcoming inspection, and the time the inspector actually enters the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> or facility. Termed by the authors as “delayed access,” this period of time between inspection notice and inspector entrance to a facility poses a concern. Delayed access also has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of measures applied as part of the Safeguards Approach for a facility (such as short-notice inspections). This report investigates the feasibility of using process monitoring to address safeguards challenges posed by delayed access at a subset of facility types...|$|E

40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) treats spent {{nuclear fuel}} using an electrometallurgical process that {{separates}} the uranium from the fission products, sodium thermal bond and cladding materials. Material accountancy is necessary at FCF for two reasons: first, it provides a mechanism for detecting a potential loss of nuclear material for safeguards and security; second, it provides a periodic check of inventories to ensure that processes and material are under control. By weighing material entering and leaving a process, and using sampling results to determine composition, an inventory difference (ID) results when the measured inventory is compared to the predicted inventory. The ID and its uncertainty, based on error propagation, determines the degree of assurance that an operation proceeded according to expectations. FCF uses the ID calculation in two ways: closeout, which is the ID and uncertainty for a particular operational step, and material accountancy, which determines an ID and its associated uncertainty for a <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> through several operational steps. Material accountancy over the whole facility for a specified time period assists in detecting diversion of nuclear material.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} concepts in a materials control and accountability system for nuclear safeguards is the materials balance (MB). All transfers {{into and out of}} a <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> are measured, as are the beginning and ending inventories. The resulting MB measures the material loss, MB = T{sub in} + I{sub B} {minus} T{sub out} {minus} I{sub E}. To interpret the MB, the authors must estimate its measurement error standard deviation, {sigma}{sub MB}. When feasible, they use a method usually known as propagation of variance (POV) to estimate {sigma}{sub MB}. The application of POV for estimating the measurement error variance of an MB is straightforward but tedious. By applying POV to individual measurement error standard deviations they can estimate {sigma}{sub MB} (or more generally, they can estimate the variance-covariance matrix, {Sigma}, of a sequence of MBs). This report describes a new computer program (VPSim) that uses simulation to estimate the {Sigma} matrix of a sequence of MBs. Given the proper input data, VPSim calculates the MB and {sigma}{sub MB}, or calculates a sequence of n MBs and the associated n-by-n covariance matrix, {Sigma}. The covariance matrix, {Sigma}, contains the variance of each MB in the diagonal entries and the covariance between pairs of MBs in the off-diagonal entries...|$|E
40|$|The LANL {{physical}} inventory program (statistically based) provides {{assurance that the}} inventory is represented to the defined confidence levels. In addition, it establishes a benchmark {{to prove that the}} inventory is accurately stated. The LANL's Physical Inventory Program for nuclear materials requires the performance of periodic physical inventories and special inventories of nuclear material. The Inventory Program also requires the reconciliation of inventory measurements with previously established nuclear material accountability values. This inventory program applies to all <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>areas</b> (MBAs) and is designed in accordance with DOE order 474. 1, 'Nuclear Material Control and Accountability'. The program uses a graded approach for performing physical inventories with primary emphasis placed on Categories I and II quantities of special nuclear material.

40|$|Six US Department of Energy Laboratories are {{carrying}} out a program of cooperation with the Russian Research Center Kurchatov Institute to improve nuclear material protection, control and accounting (MPC and A) at Kurchatov. In 1997 [...] 1998 the primary thrust of {{this program has been}} directed to Building 106, which houses a number of test reactors and critical facilities. Substantial improvements in physical protection, upgrades in the physical inventory taking procedures, installation of equipment for the computerized materials accounting system, and installation of nuclear material portal monitors and neutron-based measurement equipment are being carried out at this facility. Software for the computerized accounting system, named KI-MACS, has been developed at Kurchatov and the system has been fully integrated with the bar code printing and reading equipment, electronic scales, and nondestructive assay equipment provided under this program. Additional 1997 [...] 1998 activities at Kurchatov include continuation of a tamper indicating device program, vulnerability assessments of several facilities, hosting of a Russian-American Workshop on Fissile Material Control and Accountability at Critical Facilities, and the development of accounting procedures for transfers of nuclear <b>materials</b> between <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

This paper addresses the Material Control and Accountability (MC and A) activities that were developed and implemented to downgrade the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> (MBA) from an active Category I facility to an inactive Category IV MBA. MC and A downgrade requirements developed address topical areas that can impact final facility closure milestones. Final operational activities to process the remaining nuclear material in the facility needed to be coordinated with MC and A closure activities to minimize the amount of time and cost associated with the closure of the facility. MC and A activities that needed to be addressed included; the decommissioning of process areas, transfer of accountable nuclear material to other facilities, the material hold-up measurements required once process areas were shut down, the access requirements to nuclear material during the final processing and simultaneous closure of processing areas, the usage of enhanced material surveillance requirements to improve the utilization of Operations personnel, the updating and record retention for accountability records, the transition to a lower category MBA for final deactivation activities which included phasing out security force personnel, and the establishment of an administrative/inactive MBA once all deactivation activities were completed...|$|E
40|$|Since 1996, the Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC - {{formerly}} known as K- 26), and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) have been cooperating under the cooperative Nuclear Material Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) Program between the Russian Federation and the U. S. Governments. Since MCC continues to operate a reactor for steam and electricity production for the site and city of Zheleznogorsk which results in production of the weapons grade plutonium, {{one of the goals}} of the MPC&A program is to support implementation of an expanded comprehensive nuclear material control and accounting (MC&A) program. To date MCC has completed upgrades identified in the initial gap analysis and documented in the site MC&A Plan and is implementing additional upgrades identified during an update to the gap analysis. The scope of these upgrades includes implementation of MCC organization structure relating to MC&A, establishing <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> structure for special nuclear materials (SNM) storage and bulk processing areas, and material control functions including SNM portal monitors at target locations.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the definition of a}} <b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Area</b> (MBA) as a well-defined geographical area involving an Integral operation, the building housing the BFS- 1 and BFS- 1 critical facilities is considered to consist of one MBA. The BFS materials are in the form of small disks clad in stainless steel and each disk with nuclear material has its own serial number. Fissile material disks in the BFS MBA can be located at three key monitoring points: BFS- 1 facility, BFS- 2 facility and main storage of BFS fissile materials (storage 1). When used in the BFS- 1 or BFS- 2 critical facilities, the fissile material disks are loaded in tubes (fuel rods) forming critical assembly cores. The following specific features of the BFS MBA should be taken into account for the purpose of computerized accounting of nuclear material: (1) very large number of nuclear material items (about 70, 000 fissile material items); and (2) periodically very intensive shuffling of nuclear material items. Requirements for the computerized system are determined by basic objectives of nuclear material accounting: (1) providing accurate information on the identity and location of all items in the BFS material balance area; (2) providing accurate information on location and identity of tamper-indicating devices; (3) tracking nuclear material inventories; (4) issuing periodic reports; (5) assisting with the detection of material gains or losses; (6) providing a history of nuclear material transactions; (7) preventing unauthorized access to the system and data falsification. In August 1995, the prototype computerized accounting system was installed on the BFS facility for trial operation. Information on two nuclear material types was entered into the data base: weapon-grade plutonium metal and 36 % enriched uranium dioxide.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a safeguards approach {{that can be}} deployed at any modern plutonium processing facility to increase the level of safeguards assurance and significantly reduce the impact of safeguards on process operations. One of the most perplexing problems facing the designers of plutonium processing facilities is the constraint placed upon the limit of error of the inventory difference (LEID). The current DOE manual constrains the LEID for Category I and II <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>areas</b> to 2 per cent of active inventory up to a Category II quantity of the material being processed. For 239 Pu a Category II quantity is two kilograms. Due to the large material throughput anticipated {{for some of the}} modern plutonium facilities, the required LEID cannot be achieved reliably during a nominal two month inventory period, even by using state-of-the-science non-destructive assay (NDA) methods. The most cost-effective and least disruptive solution appears to be increasing the frequency of <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> closure and thus reducing the throughput being measured during each inventory period. Current inventory accounting practices and systems can already provide the book inventory values at any point in time. However, closing the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> with measured values has typically required the process to be cleaned out, and in-process materials packaged and measured. This process requires one to two weeks of facility down time every two months for each inventory, thus significantly reducing productivity. To provide a solution to this problem, a non-traditional approach is proposed that will include using in-line instruments to provide measurement of the process materials on a near real-time basis. A new software component will be developed that will operate with the standard LANMAS application to provide the running <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> reconciliation, including the calculation of the inventory difference and variance propagation. The combined measurement system and software implementation will make it possible for a facility to close <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> on a measured basis in a time period as short as one day...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} seven years, Los Alamos National Laboratory {{developed}} several generations of computerized nuclear materials control and accountability (MC and A) systems for tracking and reporting the storage, movement, and management of nuclear materials at domestic and international facilities. During the same period, Oak Ridge National Laboratory was involved with automated data acquisition (ADA) equipment, including installation of numerous bar-code scanning stations at various facilities to serve as input devices to computerized systems. Bar-code readers, {{as well as other}} ADA devices, reduce input errors, provide faster input, and allow the capture of data in remote areas where workstations do not exist. Los Alamos National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory teamed together to implement the integration of bar-code hardware technology with computerized MC and A systems. With the expertise of both sites, the two technologies were successfully merged with little difficulty. Bar-code input is now available with several functions of the MC and A systems: material movements within <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>areas</b> (MBAs), <b>material</b> movements between MBAs, and physical inventory verification.

40|$|A Nuclear Material Control and Accountability (MC&A) Functional Model {{has been}} {{developed}} to describe MC&A systems at facilities possessing Category I or II Special Nuclear Material (SNM). Emphasis is on achieving the objectives of 144 “Fundamental Elements” in key areas ranging from categorization of nuclear material to establishment of <b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Areas</b> (MBAs), controlling access, performing quality measurements of inventories and transfers, timely reporting all activities, and detecting and investigating anomalies. An MC&A System Effectiveness Tool (MSET), including probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) technology for evaluating MC&A effectiveness and relative risk, {{has been developed}} to accompany the Functional Model. The functional model and MSET were introduced at the 48 th annual International Nuclear Material Management (INMM) annual meeting in July, 20071, 2. A survey/questionnaire is used to accumulate comprehensive data regarding the MC&A elements at a facility.

40|$|Traditional {{materials}} accounting is focused {{exclusively on the}} <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> (MBA), and involves periodically closing a material balance based on accountability measurements conducted during a physical inventory. In contrast, the physical inventory for Los Alamos National Laboratory's near-real-time accounting system is established around processes and looks more like an item inventory. That is, the intent is not to measure material for accounting purposes, since materials have already been measured in {{the normal course of}} daily operations. A given unit process operates many times {{over the course of a}} material balance period. The product of a given unit process may move for processing within another unit process in the same MBA or may be transferred out of the MBA. Since few materials are unmeasured the physical inventory for a near-real-time process area looks more like an item inventory. Thus, the intent of the physical inventory is to locate the materials on the books and verify information about the materials contained in the books. Closing a materials balance for such an area is a matter of summing all the individual mass balances for the batches processed by all unit processes in the MBA. Additionally, performance parameters are established to measure the program's effectiveness. Program effectiveness for verifying the presence of nuclear material is required to be equal to or greater than a prescribed performance level, process measurements must be within established precision and accuracy values, physical inventory results meet or exceed performance requirements, and inventory differences are less than a target/goal quantity. This approach exceeds DOE established accounting and physical inventory program requirements. Hence, LANL is committed to this approach and to seeking opportunities for further improvement through integrated technologies. This paper will provide a detailed description of this evaluation process...|$|E
40|$|The Analytical Development (AD) Section field nuclear {{measurement}} group performed six 'best available technique' verification measurements {{to satisfy}} a DOE requirement instituted for the March 2009 semi-annual inventory. The requirement of (1) yielded the need for SRNL Research Operations Department Material Control & Accountability (MC&A) group to measure the Pu content of five items and the highly enrich uranium (HEU) content of two. No 14 Q-qualified measurement equipment was available to satisfy the requirement. The AD field nuclear group has routinely performed the required Confirmatory Measurements for the semi-annual inventories for fifteen years using sodium iodide and high purity germanium (HpGe) {gamma}-ray pulse height analysis nondestructive assay (NDA) instruments. With appropriate {gamma}-ray acquisition modeling, the HpGe spectrometers {{can be used to}} perform verification-type quantitative assay for Pu-isotopics and HEU content. The AD nuclear NDA group is widely experienced with this type of measurement and reports content for these species in requested process control, MC&A booking, and holdup measurements assays Site-wide. However none of the AD HpGe {gamma}-ray spectrometers have been 14 Q-qualified, and the requirement of reference 1 specifically excluded a {gamma}-ray PHA measurement from those it would accept for the required verification measurements. The requirement of reference 1 was a new requirement for which the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) Research Operations Department (ROD) MC&A group was unprepared. The criteria for exemption from verification were: (1) isotope content below 50 grams; (2) intrinsically tamper indicating or TID sealed items which contain a Category IV quantity of material; (3) assembled components; and (4) laboratory samples. Therefore all (SRNL) <b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Area</b> (MBA) items with greater than 50 grams total Pu or greater than 50 grams HEU were subject to a verification measurement. The pass/fail criteria of reference 7 stated 'The facility will report measured values, book values, and statistical control limits for the selected items to DOE SR [...] . ', and 'The site/facility operator must develop, document, and maintain measurement methods for all nuclear material on inventory'. These new requirements exceeded SRNL's experience with prior semi-annual inventory expectations, but allowed the AD nuclear field measurement group to demonstrate its excellent adaptability and superior flexibility to respond to unpredicted expectations from the DOE customer. The requirements yielded five SRNL items subject to Pu verification and two SRNL items subject to HEU verification. These items are listed and described in Table 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} requirements and best practices for implementing international nuclear safeguards at independent {{spent fuel storage}} installations (ISFSIs), also known as Away-from- Reactor (AFR) storage facilities. These installations may provide wet or dry storage of spent fuel, although the safeguards guidance herein focuses on dry storage facilities. In principle, the safeguards guidance applies to both wet and dry storage. The reason for focusing on dry independent spent fuel storage installations {{is that this is}} one of the fastest growing nuclear installations worldwide. Independent spent fuel storage installations are typically outside of the safeguards nuclear <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> (MBA) of the reactor. They may be located on the reactor site, but are generally considered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the State Regulator/SSAC to be a separate facility. The need for this guidance is becoming increasingly urgent as more and more nuclear power plants move their spent fuel from resident spent fuel ponds to independent spent fuel storage installations. The safeguards requirements and best practices described herein are also relevant to the design and construction of regional independent spent fuel storage installations that nuclear power plant operators are starting to consider in the absence of a national long-term geological spent fuel repository. The following document has been prepared in support of two of the three foundational pillars for implementing Safeguards-by-Design (SBD). These are: i) defining the relevant safeguards requirements, and ii) defining the best practices for meeting the requirements. This document was prepared with the design of the latest independent dry spent fuel storage installations in mind and was prepared specifically as an aid for designers of commercial nuclear facilities to help them understand the relevant international requirements that follow from a country’s safeguards agreement with the IAEA. If these requirements are understood at the earliest stages of facility design, it will help eliminate the costly retrofit of facilities that has occurred in the past to accommodate nuclear safeguards, and will help the IAEA implement nuclear safeguards worldwide, especially in countries building their first nuclear facilities. It is also hoped that this guidance document will promote discussion between the IAEA, State Regulator/SSAC, Project Design Team, and Facility Owner/Operator at an early stage to ensure that new ISFSIs will be effectively and efficiently safeguarded. This is intended to be a living document, since the international nuclear safeguards requirements may be subject to revision over time. More importantly, the practices by which the requirements are met are continuously modernized by the IAEA and facility operators for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness. As these improvements are made, it is recommended that the subject guidance document be updated and revised accordingly...|$|E
40|$|In <b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Areas,</b> flasks {{of nuclear}} {{material}} undergo a processing {{governed by a}} well defined sequence of stages. As such, {{it makes sense to}} model the temporal succession of Safeguards-relevant events as annotated in past review reports by inspectors and re-use this knowledge to assist present and future reviews. In previous work, we presented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that keeps track of the state of single flask processing and checks that the consequentiality of events is respected. In this paper we extend previous work in two directions. First, we make a communication effort in describing in greater details the reasons advocating in favor of Hidden Markov Models to complement our battery of advanced review tools for inspectors. Second, we design and test alternative modeling approaches within the Hidden Markov Models family (HMMs). In particular, we address the idea of describing the MBA behavior as a ‘whole’, as opposed to adopt the ‘single flask tracking’ point of view. This approach has the merit of unifying the modeling of MBAs where the decontamination area can host more than one flask at a time. For both approaches, the guiding principle is to augment the functionality of state-of-the-art Safeguards review tools while making the HMM set-up and operation as ‘effort-free’ as possible for the inspector. In review experiments on real surveillance images, we verified that all significant images were correctly reviewed (a non-negotiable requirement), and in the meantime the inspectors’ workload was reduced by at least 45 % thanks to the rejection of false positives achieved by the HMM.

40|$|Small graphite-moderated and gas-cooled {{reactors}} {{have been}} around {{since the beginning of the}} atomic age. Though their existence in the past has been associated with nuclear weapons programs, they are capable of being used in civilian power programs. The simpler design constraints associated with this type of reactor would make them ideal for developing nations to bolster their electricity generation and help promote a greater standard of living in those nations. However, the same benefits that make this type of reactor desirable also make it suspicious to the international community as a possible means to shorten that state?s nuclear latency. If a safeguards approach could be developed for a fuel cycle featuring one of these reactors, it would ease the tension surrounding their existence and possibly lead to an increased latency through engineered barriers. The development of this safeguards approach follows a six step procedure. First, the fuel cycle was analyzed for the types of facilities found in it and how nuclear material flows between facilities. The goals of the safeguards system were established next, using the normal IAEA standards for the non-detection and false alarm probabilities. The 5 MWe Reactor was modeled for both plutonium production and maximum power capacity. Each facility was analyzed for material throughput and the processes that occur in each facility were researched. Through those processes, diversion pathways were developed to test the proposed safeguards system. Finally, each facility was divided into <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>areas</b> and a traditional nuclear material accountancy system was set up to meet the established safeguards goals for the facility. The DPRK weapons program is a great example of the type of fuel cycle that is the problem. The three major facilities in the fuel cycle, the Fuel Fabrication Facility, the 5 MWe Reactor, and the Radiochemical Laboratory, can achieve the two goals of safeguards using traditional methods. Each facility can be adequately safeguarded using methods and practices that are relatively inexpensive and can obtain <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> periods close to the timeliness limits set forth by the IAEA. The Fuel Fabrication Facility can be safeguarded at both its current needed capacity and its full design capacity using inexpensive measurements. The <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> period needed for both capacities are reasonable. For the 5 MWe reactor, plutonium production is simulated to be 6. 7 kg per year and is on the high side of estimates. The Radiochemical Laboratory can also be safeguarded at its current capacity.

40|$|Executive Summary The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{implements}} {{nuclear safeguards}} and verifies countries are compliant with their international nuclear safeguards agreements. One {{of the key}} provisions in the safeguards agreement is the requirement that the country provide nuclear facility design and operating information to the IAEA relevant to safeguarding the facility, and {{at a very early}} stage., This provides the opportunity for the IAEA to verify the safeguards-relevant features of the facility and to periodically ensure that those features have not changed. The national authorities (State System of Accounting for and Control of Nuclear Material - SSAC) provide the design information for all facilities within a country to the IAEA. The design information is conveyed using the IAEA’s Design Information Questionnaire (DIQ) and specifies: (1) Identification of the facility’s general character, purpose, capacity, and location; (2) Description of the facility’s layout and nuclear material form, location, and flow; (3) Description of the features relating to nuclear material accounting, containment, and surveillance; and (4) Description of existing and proposed procedures for nuclear material accounting and control, with identification of nuclear <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>areas.</b> The DIQ is updated as required by written addendum. IAEA safeguards inspectors examine and verify this information in design information examination (DIE) and design information verification (DIV) activities to confirm that the facility has been constructed or is being operated as declared by the facility operator and national authorities, and to develop a suitable safeguards approach. Under the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI), the National Nuclear Security Administrations (NNSA) Office of Non-Proliferation and International Security identified the need for more effective and efficient verification of design information by the IAEA for improving international safeguards in the future. Consequently, the NNSA Office of International Regimes and Agreements (NA- 243) sponsored a team of U. S. Department of Energy National Laboratory nuclear safeguards experts and technologists to conduct a workshop on methods and technologies for improving this activity, under the ASA- 100 Advanced Safeguards Approaches Project. The workshop focused on reviewing and discussing the fundamental safeguards needs, and presented technology and/or methods that could potentially address those needs more effectively and efficiently. Conclusions and Recommendations for technology to enhance the performance of DIV inspections are presented by the workshop team...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of the {{non-uniform}} nuclide composition in spent fuel on material accountancy in the pyroprocess. High-fidelity depletion simulations are performed using the Monte Carlo code SERPENT in order to determine nuclide composition as a function of axial and radial position within fuel rods and assemblies, and burnup. For improved accuracy, the simulations use short burnups step (25 days or less), Xe-equilibrium treatment (to avoid oscillations over burnup steps), axial moderator temperature distribution, and 30 axial meshes. Analytical solutions of the simplified depletion equations are built to understand the axial non-uniformity of nuclide composition in spent fuel. The cosine shape of axial neutron flux distribution dominates the axial non-uniformity of the nuclide composition. Combined cross sections and time also generate axial non-uniformity, as the exponential term in the analytical solution consists of the neutron flux, cross section and time. The axial concentration distribution for a nuclide having the small cross section gets steeper than that for another nuclide having the great cross section because the axial flux is weighted by the cross section in the exponential term in the analytical solution. Similarly, the non-uniformity becomes flatter as increasing burnup, because the time term in the exponential increases. Based on the developed numerical recipes and decoupling of the results between the axial distributions and the predetermined representative radial distributions by matching the axial height, the axial and radial composition distributions for representative spent nuclear fuel assemblies, the Type- 0, - 1, and - 2 assemblies after 1, 2, and 3 depletion cycles, is obtained. These data are appropriately modified to depict processing for materials in the head-end process of pyroprocess that is chopping, voloxidation and granulation. The expectation and standard deviation of the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio by the single granule sampling calculated by the central limit theorem and the Geary-Hinkley transformation. Then, the uncertainty propagation through the key-pyroprocess is conducted to analyze the Material Unaccounted For (MUF), which is a random variable defined as a receipt minus a shipment of a process, in the system. Finally, the Type-I error for the Pu MUF is evaluated for spent fuel assemblies with respect the size of granules and powders which are the key parameters to evaluate the uncertainty in determining ratio by sampling. The main observations of this calculation are the following: (1) the probabilities of Type-I error for the Pu MUF are occasionally greater than 5 % when the size of powder particles and granules are large and small; (2) the possibility of Type-I error greater than 5 % increases by increasing the depletion period, because the increasing production of Pu and 244 Cm with increasing burnup propagates the uncertainty through the system; (3) the major contributor to the uncertainty of ratio is the non-uniformity of 244 Cm; (4) Pu generation in the Type- 2 spent fuel assemblies is greater that in the others due to higher gadolinia bearing fuel (GBF) loading in the assembly, therefore, the area indicating the probability of Type-I error {{greater than or equal to}} 5 % is the widest among the figures for the Type- 0 and - 1 spent fuel assemblies. The random variable, LOPu, is defined for evaluating the non-detection probability at each Key Measurement Point (KMP) as the original Pu mass minus the Pu mass after a missing scenario. A number of assemblies for the LOPu to be 8 kg is considered in this calculation. The probability of detection for the 8 kg LOPu is evaluated with respect the size of granule and powder using the event tree analysis and the hypothesis testing method. We can observe there are possible cases showing the probability of detection for the 8 kg LOPu less than 95 %. In order to enhance the detection rate, a new <b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Area</b> (MBA) model is defined for the key-pyroprocess. The probabilities of detection for all spent fuel types based on the new MBA model are greater than 99 %. Furthermore, it is observed that the probability of detection significantly increases by increasing granule sample sizes to evaluate the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio before the key-pyroprocess. Based on these observations, even though the Pu material accountability in pyroprocess is affected by the non-uniformity of nuclide composition when the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio method is being applied, that is surmounted by decreasing the uncertainty of measured ratio by increasing sample sizes and modifying the MBAs and KMPs...|$|E

In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the Nuclear Materials Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK's nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2015 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their nuclear materials. There were no indications of undeclared nuclear materials or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. Safeguards are applied to nuclear materials and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include nuclear materials accountancy, control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use nuclear materials, often referred to as “licence holders” or “operators”– and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its nuclear materials and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the non-proliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At the end of 2013, the revised STUK requirements were published as regulatory guides on nuclear safety, security and safeguards, called YVL guides. According to the Guide YVL D. 1 Regulatory Control of Nuclear Safeguards all the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. During 2015, in total 19 draft manuals were submitted to STUK, and 14 of those were approved. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared nuclear materials (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor nuclear material holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the Olkiluoto 4 reactor and a new nuclear power plant site, Hanhikivi in Pyhäjoki, were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors shall be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators submitted the preliminary Basic Technical Characteristics to the European Commission and obtained <b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Area</b> codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. During 2015, the construction licence application for the new Hanhikivi plant was submitted to the Government. The authorisation of the Olkiluoto 4 unit expired as the operator did not apply for the construction licence within the 5 year period of validity of the authorisation, i. e. the Decision-in-Principle by the Government, so the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> <b>area</b> code was also withdrawn. The research reactor was shut down in 2015 and the preparations for decommissioning continue in Espoo. On the other hand, in order to continue research activities, the new VTT Centre for Nuclear Safety was under construction at the research campus in Espoo. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval by the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the mining company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economic issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014, and finally in November 2014 Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. During 2015 a new operator, Terrafame Mining Oy took over the mining and milling activities, but no uranium extraction nor safeguards activities took place at Talvivaara. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK and to the European Commission. STUK maintains a national nuclear materials accountancy system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and materials. In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the Government in December 2012. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. These needs were included in the STUK statement and safety evaluation concerning the construction licence application finalised in February 2015. In November 2015 the Government granted the construction licence. In the meanwhile, the detailed design of the facility was updated resulting in the continuation of the planning of the safeguards system. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2015. By means of their nuclear materials accountancy and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number of inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, called Onkalo. In 2015 a concise survey campaign was carried out at Onkalo resulting in an increased number of inspection days since 2013. The number of annual inspection days for nuclear material holders has remained at 20 days per international inspectorate. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the elements of the global nuclear non-proliferation effort. STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the radionuclide laboratories (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUK’s organisation, together with the regulatory control of nuclear materials. A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the Nuclear Materials Section during 2015 was focused on nuclear material control: in particular, information security issues were addressed. This was partly due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK and Finnish Customs continued the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officers training as well as the updating of technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|E

In December 2013, Fennovoima announced that the Hanhikivi reactor will be supplied by Rusatom Overseas. This was not included as an option in the application of 2009, and thus the re-evaluation of the conditions for the previous authorisation was carried out in 2014, resulting in new Decision-in-Principle endorsed by the Parliament in December 2014. In parallel with this, the TVO application to extend the time line for the fourth unit was denied by the Government. Owing to these decisions, the construction licence applications are expected in 2015.

40|$|Safeguards data {{reviews of}} MBAs (<b>Material</b> <b>Balance</b> <b>Areas)</b> {{can be seen}} as a {{continuous}} verification process, broken down by the perioding reporting to guarantee the timeliness of inspections. The archive of review reports captures MBA history and its typical operation regularities. Most of these are known to the inspector through the experience s/he gained over the sequence of review exercises. To assist this process effectively, review tools also need to be aware of the MBA's regularities, either by being told (by the inspector) or by learning them from the base of knowledge contained in review archives. For instance, in image reviews, inspectors tell change detection filters where to spot differences in gray-intensity by drawing areas of interest over the image plane. The focus of our work is rather on what review tools can learn in a semi-autonomous way from archives of past and closed reviews, as well as from the on-line compilation of review reports. Along this direction, we presented in previous work software tools that learn improved filtering rules by using the visual appearance of images reviewed by inspectors. In this paper, we argue that also the temporal succession of data should be modeled and considered by review tools. For example, in an MBA, flasks of nuclear material undergo a processing governed by a rather regular sequence of stages. The duration of each stage and the normal succession of processing steps are features that can be learnt. Specifically, we describe a model of flask processing in a MBA based on a hybrid Markov model (hMM). Markov models are discrete-state machines where state-to-state transitions have an associated probability. In our hybrid model, the relation between the observed quantities (e. g. gray-level change in specific image regions) and the underlying process is also dependent on a probabilistic function. A salient benefit of probability frameworks is their inferential capability of learning from historical evidence. Former inspectors' reports can be employed to build a statistical description of the process, and to train the MM. The trained model keeps track of the state of processing and checks that the consequentiality of events is respected. Irregular event patterns are attributed a high probability of being false positives, and thus discarded from the review. In our experiments on real review data provided by inspectors, we verified that all significant images were still correctly selected by the hMM, whereas the false positives were reduced of a factor between 2. 5 and 10 with respect to the methods currently in use.

40|$|Estimating {{original}} hydrocarbons {{in place}} (OHIP) in a reservoir is fundamentally important to estimating reserves and potential profitability. Quantifying the uncertainties in OHIP estimates can improve reservoir development and investment decision-making for individual reservoirs {{and can lead}} to improved portfolio performance. Two traditional methods for estimating OHIP are volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> methods. Probabilistic estimates of OHIP are commonly generated prior to significant production from a reservoir by combining volumetric analysis with Monte Carlo methods. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> is routinely used to analyze reservoir performance and estimate OHIP. Although <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> has uncertainties due to errors in pressure and other parameters, probabilistic estimates are seldom done. In this thesis I use a Bayesian formulation to integrate volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses and to quantify uncertainty in the combined OHIP estimates. Specifically, I apply Bayes?? rule to the Havlena and Odeh <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> equation to estimate original oil in place, N, and relative gas-cap size, m, for a gas-cap drive oil reservoir. The paper considers uncertainty and correlation in the volumetric estimates of N and m (reflected in the prior probability distribution), as well as uncertainty in the pressure data (reflected in the likelihood distribution). Approximation of the covariance of the posterior distribution allows quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of N and m resulting from the combined volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses. Several example applications to illustrate the value of this integrated approach are presented. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> data reduce the uncertainty in the volumetric estimate, and the volumetric data reduce the considerable non-uniqueness of the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> solution, resulting in more accurate OHIP estimates than from the separate analyses. One of the advantages over reservoir simulation is that, with the smaller number of parameters in this approach, we can easily sample the entire posterior distribution, resulting in more complete quantification of uncertainty. The approach can also detect underestimation of uncertainty in either volumetric data or <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> data, indicated by insufficient overlap of the prior and likelihood distributions. When this occurs, the volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses should be revisited and the uncertainties of each reevaluated...|$|R
