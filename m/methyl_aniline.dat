40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{distribution}} of hydrophobic ionogenic organic compounds (HIOC's) between aqueous and nonaqueous phases has been investigated. The HIOC's are <b>aniline</b> and <b>methyl</b> substituted <b>anilines.</b> The aqueous phases are methanol-water mixed solvents with varying pH and ionic strength. The nonaqueous phases are silica and alkyl derivatized silica with ethyl- (C- 2), octyl- (C- 8), and octadecyl- (C- 18) silanes. A gas-liquid equilibration method {{has been developed}} to determine the Henry's law constants and the activity coefficients of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> in methanol-water mixed solvents. The logarithm of the Henry's law constants vary quadratically with the volume fraction of methanol. The chromatographic study has been performed to investigate the effect of three mobile phase factors, fraction of methanol, pH, and ionic strength, on the retention of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> on different stationary phases. The logarithm of mass distribution ratios, log k's, of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> vary linearly with the volume fraction of methanol. The ratios of H / k' of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> increase with increase in methanol in the mobile phase, indicating {{an increase in the}} activity coefficients in the stationary phases. This observation is found to be true for different <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> in different stationary phases. A partition model is presented to describe the effect of pH and ionic strength on the retention of HIOC's in the mobile phase. The variation in log k' among neutral and ionic <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> can be explained by linear free energy relationships. Equations are established to predict retention of neutral or ionized <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> from their octanol-water partition coefficients at any methanol content in the mobile phase. Acid dissociation constants of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> determined from the dependence of log k' on pH are in close agrement with those determined by potentiometric titrations. The effect of ionic strength on the retention of both neutral and ionic species of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> is negligible. That is, the contribution from electrostatic energy and salting out effect are not significant. The chromatographic study is extended to study the retention of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> on silica as a function of pH and methanol at a constant ionic strength. The dependence of retention on pH is qualitatively interpreted from an ion exchange reaction between the dissociated silanol groups in the surface and the ionized <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines.</b> The effect of methanol on the retention of <b>methyl</b> <b>anilines</b> and of pyridine on silica is described by a quadratic relationship between the log k' and volume fraction of methanol...|$|R

40|$|The syntheses of a {{new class}} of {{polycyclic}} TriAmino DiCarbenes (TADCs), based on 3, 9 -diazajulolidine, and their precursors and adducts are described. Starting with 2, 6 -dimethyl-nitrobenzene, 2, 6 -bis ((alkylamino) <b>methyl)</b> <b>anilines</b> (alkyl = isopropyl, mesityl, and tert-butyl) were synthesized in 40 % yield over five steps. These triamines were then di-cyclized stepwise to diformamidinium dications or formamidinium/ 2 -methoxyformaminals using oxonium salts and trialkyl orthoformates. A diformamidinium dication was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry. Treatment with various bases, particularly lithium hexamethyldisilylazide, led to the novel TADCs and monocarbenes, two of which were isolated and characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopies. In both cases, treatment with elemental sulfur trapped the TADCs as dithiobiurets. No TADC-transition metal complexes were successfully isolated from reactions of the diformamidinium dications or LiHMDS TADC complex with a number of transition metal complexes. With the exception of these two cases, all other TADCs were not isolated because they rapidly reacted to form dimers, trimers, and tetramers. One of these dimers was isolated and its structure determined using 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopies, along with high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This revealed that the TADC had dimerized to form an ene-triamine, likely via 1, 3 -shift of a benzylic proton. Novel N-heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) complexes of molybdenum were also synthesized and characterized. Reaction of Cp 2 Mo 2 (CO) 4 (Cp = C 5 H 5) with dimesityl-imidazol- 2 -ylidenes (IMes) or dimesityl-imidazolidin- 2 -ylidenes (SIMes) yielded the molybdoradicals CpMo(CO) 2 (NHC) (NHC = IMes or SIMes). The carbonyl infrared stretching frequencies and the relative metal-to-NHC π-backbonding for IMes and SIMes complexes are compared. Reaction of the less bulky dimethyl-imidazol- 2 -ylidene (IMe) with Cp 2 Mo 2 (CO) 4 yielded the Mo-Mo triple bond complex Cp 2 Mo 2 (CO) 3 (IMe) by CO substitution.

30|$|Besides, we {{have found}} that the β-mannanase {{produced}} by HDYM- 04 we used show remarkably high activity and found to be capable of decolorizing and degrading different structures of synthetic dyes. Though lots of papers reported the degradation and decolourisation of synthetic dyes by other enzymes, some studies demonstrating that laccases from Leptomitus lacteus could made different dyes decolorization (Svobodová et al. 2008). Such as, B.cereus could decolorize 85  % of an azo dye for 120  h of incubation (Kanagaraj et al. 2012) and a novel laccase from B.subtilis WD 23 could decolorize 50 - 90  % of congo red and methyl orange, which suggested the potential application of spore laccase in dyestuff treatment (Wang et al. 2010 a, b). Unfortunately, the majority of dyes are chemically stable and still resistant to microbiological attack. The differences in the decoloriaztion efficiencies may be attributed to the various chemical structures of different dyes. The most employed dyes belong to the azo and triaromatic class which accounts for the 80  % of all textile dye produced. The best decolorization over was obtained with reactive conge red methyl orange and titan yellow. β-mannanase may be modify azo dye structures by destroying their chromophoric assemblies, phenoxyl radicals are generated in the reaction course (Muralikrishna et al. 1995). Compared with the β-mannanase produced by HDYM- 04, these enzyme decolorization efficiency were relatively low. The β-mannanases are oxidase that cataluze oxidation reactions and hydrolysis reactions in many phenolic and organic substrates coupling with reduction reactions that transfer molecular oxygen to water (Murugesan et al. 2007). Triaromatic methane dyes represent an especially recalcitrant class of compounds. The present study confirms the ability of <b>methyl</b> orange and <b>aniline</b> blue purified β-mannanase to decolorize amaranth, chromotrope 2 R, amaranth and eosin with decolorization efficiency of more than 90  % in short time. This could be due to the presense of electron donating methy and methoxy groups on the triaromatic methane dyes. The results obtained in this study were in agreement with results reported previrously for Pleurotusostreatus laccase (Kumar et al. 2012) and P.variabile laccase (Forootanfar et al. 2011). They also demonstrated that different decolorization rates were attributed to the specific catalytic properties of the individual enzymes and to the structure of dyes. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a bacterial β-mannanase from HDYM- 04 able to degrade different dyes. Furthermore, the decolorization of dyes by β-mannanase produced by HDYM- 04 is simple and cheap. So, the broad substrates specificity of enzyme rendered its great potentials in industrial applications, such as degradation of dyes from acidic textile effluents and the purified β-mannanase produced by HDYM- 04 could be successfully employed for the treatment of dyes bearing industrial wastewater as it had prominent capacity to degrade other different dyes. Some studies found that, the degradation of azo dyes could result in the production of compounds of increased toxicity. However, most studies failed to evaluate the toxicity of either the dyes and/or the reaction products (Gottlieb et al. 2003). So, to further investigate its effect on the toxicity of dye decolorization, the toxicity experiment will be carry out.|$|R

40|$|The {{developments}} in mobile/portable electronics and alternative energy vehicles prompted engineers and researchers to develop {{electrochemical energy storage}} devices called supercapacitors, as the third generation type capacitors. Most of {{the research and development}} on supercapacitors focus on electrode materials, electrolytes and hybridization. Some attempts have been directed towards increasing the energy density by employing electroactive materials, such as metal oxides and conducting polymers (CPs). However, the high cost and toxicity of applicable metal oxides and poor long term stability of CPs paved the way to alternative electrode materials. The electroactive materials with carbon particles in composites have been used substantially to improve the stability of supercapacitors. Furthermore, the use of carbon particles and CPs could significantly reduce the cost of supercapacitor electrodes compared to metal oxides. Recent {{developments in}} carbon allotropes, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and especially graphene (G), have found applications in supercapacitors because of their enhanced double layer capacitance due to the large surface area, electrochemical stability, and excellent mechanical and thermal properties. The main objective of the research presented in this dissertation is to increase the energy density of supercapacitors by the development of nanocomposite materials composed of graphene and different CPs, such as: (a) polyaniline derivatives (polyaniline (PANI), methoxy (-OCH 3) <b>aniline</b> (POA) and <b>methyl</b> (-CH 3) <b>aniline</b> (POT), (b) poly(3 - 4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and (c) polypyrrole (PPy). The research was carried out in two phases, namely, (i) the development and performance evaluation of G-CP (graphene in conducting polymers) electrodes for supercapacitors, and (ii) the fabrication and testing of the coin cell supercapacitors with G-CP electrodes. In the first phase, the synthesis of different morphological structures of CPs as well as their composites with graphene was carried out, and the synthesized nanostructures were characterized by different physical, chemical and thermal characterization techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area pore size distribution analysis and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The electrochemical properties of G-CP nanocomposite-based supercapacitors were investigated using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in different electrolytes, such as acidic (2 M H 2 SO 4 and HCl), organic (0. 2 M LiClO 4) and ionic liquid (1 M BMIM-PF 6) electrolytes. A comparative study was carried out to investigate the capacitive properties of G-PANI derivatives for supercapacitor applications. The methyl substituted polyaniline with graphene as a nanocomposite (G-POT) exhibited a better capacitance (425 F/g) than the G-PANI or the G-POA nanocomposite due to the electron donating group of G-POT. The relaxation time constants of 0. 6, 2. 5, and 5 s for the G-POT, G-PANI and G-POA nanocomposite-based supercapacitors were calculated from the complex model by using the experimental EIS data. The specific capacitances of two-electrode system supercapacitor cells were estimated as 425, 400, 380, 305 and 267 F/g for G-POT, G-PANI, G-POA, G-PEDOT and G-PPy, respectively. The improvements in specific capacitance were observed due to the increased surface area with mesoporous nanocomposite structures (5 10 nm pore size distribution) and the pseudocapacitance effect due to the redox properties of the CPs. Further, the operating voltage of G-CP supercapacitors was increased to 3. 5 V by employing an ionic liquid electrolyte, compared to 1. 5 V operating voltage when aqueous electrolytes were used. On top of the gain in the operating voltage, the graphene nano-filler of the nanocomposite prevented the degradation of the CPs in the long term charging and discharging processes. In the second phase, after studying the material 2 ̆ 7 s chemistry and capacitive properties in three-electrode and two-electrode configuration-based basic electrochemical test cells, coin cell type supercapacitors were fabricated using G-CP nanocomposite electrodes to validate the tested G-CPs as devices. The fabrication process was optimized for the applied force and the number of spacers in crimping the two electrodes together. The pseudocapacitance and double layer capacitance values were extracted by fitting experimental EIS data to a proposed equivalent circuit, and the pseudocapacitive effect was found to be higher with G-PANI derivative nanocomposites than with the other studied G-CP nanocomposites due to the multiple redox states of G-PANI derivatives. The increased specific capacitance, voltage and small relaxation time constants of the G-CPs {{paved the way for the}} fabrication of safe, stable and high energy density supercapacitors...|$|R
40|$|Amide bond {{formation}} avoiding poor atom economy reagents are strongly preferred {{and get the}} highest attention as a priority area in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical industry. Conventionally, amides are prepared from carboxylic acids and amines via activated carboxylic acid derivatives such as carboxylic acid anhydrides or acyl chlorides or via activation with stoichiometric amount of a dehydrating agent. Lewis acid promoted amidation reaction is also developed. These methods have some limitations of low atom efficiency and production of byproducts. Lewis acid catalyzed amidation have additional drawbacks, such as limited substrate scope and high catalyst loading. These drawbacks {{may be caused by}} the suppression of Lewis acid by basic molecules (amines and water as byproduct), present in the reaction mixture. The author hypothesized that water and base tolerant Lewis acid catalyst may catalyze the amidation of carboxylic acid with amines more effectively. This thesis focuses on direct synthesis of amide bond by using base tolerant heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst. Five types of Lewis acid catalytic systems are developed for synthesis of amide and imide with a wide substrate scope. In chapter 2, various Lewis and Brønsted acid catalysts including water tolerant Sc(OTf) 3, Cs-exchanged heteropoly acid were investigated for the amidation of n-dodecanoic acid with aniline. Among them Nb 2 O 5 showed the highest catalytic activity for the above reaction. This simple and atom-efficient method tolerates various functional groups and is applicable to challenging substrates such as anilines and α-hydroxycarboxylic acids. I investigated the reusability of catalyst and general applicability of the present catalytic system. Kinetics studies showed that the Lewis acid site of Nb 2 O 5, as the active site for the amidation is more tolerant to the co-present basic molecules than other used catalyst. In chapter 3, I examined various Lewis and Brønsted acid catalysts including some effective homogeneous catalysts (La(OTf) 3, NaOMe) for direct amidation of <b>methyl</b> benzoate with <b>aniline.</b> I found that Nb 2 O 5 showed the highest catalytic activity for this reaction. I investigated the reusability of catalyst and general applicability of the present catalytic system. This Lewis acid catalyst is effective for various functionalities and is applicable to challenging substrates such as anilines and α-hydroxyesters. This result demonstrate the first successful example of heterogeneous catalysis for direct amidation of esters with amines. For chapter 4, I examined various Lewis and Brønsted acid catalysts, water tolerant homogneous and heterogeneous catalysts and commercial acidic resins for direct imidation of succinic acid with n-octylamine. Among those used catalyst Nb 2 O 5 showed highest catalytic activity to the corresponding n-octylsuccinimide. The catalyst was reusable and easy separable from the mixture. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that Lewis acid site of Nb 2 O 5 has higher tolerance to basic molecules (amines and water) than other used catalyst. This results demonstrate the first heterogeneous Lewis acid catalytic system for imidation of dicarboxylic acid with amines and ammonia. In chapter 5, for condensation reaction of carboxylic anhydride and amine, I investigated several Lewis acid catalysts including some metal oxide and water tolerant homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts. Nb 2 O 5 showed the best catalytic activity for the imidation of succinic anhydride with aniline than other screened catalyst. I investigated the reusability of catalyst and general applicability of the present catalytic system. These results demonstrate the first reusable Lewis acid catalysis to synthesize cyclic imide from carboxylic anhydrides with amines and ammonia. In chapter 6, I examined different types of catalyst for transamidation of benzamide with n-octyl amine. Among them Fe-mont acts as an effective heterogeneous catalyst for the transamidation of benzamide with n-octyl amine. I investigated the reusability of catalyst and general applicability of the present catalytic system. Catalytic cycle showed that carbonyl oxygen is activated by Fe 3 + Lewis acid. This results shows that Fe-mont is an efficient catalyst for the transamidation reaction. Chapter 7 is the general conclusion. Chapters 2 - 6 show the precise examples of heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis for the direct synthesis of amide and imide from various substrates. By using these simple methodology, I synthesized various important amides and imides from readily available starting materials. Mechanistic studies suggested that the Lewis acid site of Nb 2 O 5 is tolerant to base present in the reaction mixture which makes it highly effective for amidation and imidation reaction. These heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysts can be applied to other reactions involving activation of carbonyl groups in the presence of amines...|$|R
