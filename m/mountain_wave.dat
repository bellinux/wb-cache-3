25|$|The one-of-a-kind Lamson L-106 Alcor {{pressurized}} high-altitude research sailplane {{played a}} key role in the 1977 book Sierra Sierra, by John Joss. In the novel, Marine fighter pilot Mark Lewis saw his best friend, John O'Halloran, killed on the last day of the Vietnam War. When he travels to Seattle, Washington, to explain O'Halloran's death to his family he discovers that O'Halloran's father and sister are engaged in building a research glider, the Alcor, in which O'Halloran was to have set world records for altitude and distance, when he returned from Vietnam. Instead Lewis takes O'Halloran's place in the project, while trying to put his own life back together after the war, flying the Alcor in the <b>mountain</b> <b>wave</b> of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E

The RAF maintained a presence throughout its use by civil airlines, making it the longest continually used airfield {{in the history of}} the Royal Air Force. En route from Northolt to Dublin, on 10 January 1952, a civil Douglas C-47 Skytrain operated by Aer Lingus and named [...] "St. Kevin" [...] flew into an area of extreme turbulence caused by a <b>mountain</b> <b>wave</b> generated by Snowdon. As a result, the plane crashed into a peat bog near Llyn Gwynant in Snowdonia, killing all 20 passengers and three crew in the company's first fatal accident.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} moist {{processes}} on <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> over Sierra Nevada Mountain Range is investigated in this study. Aircraft measurements over Owens Valley obtained during the Terrain-induced Rotor Experi-ment (T-REX) indicate that <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> were generally weaker when the relative humidity maximum near the mountaintop level was above 70 %. Four moist cases with a RH maximum near the mountaintop level greater than 90 % have been further examined using a mesoscale model and a linear wave model. Two competing mechanisms governing {{the influence of}} moisture on <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> have been identified. The first mechanism involves low-level moisture that enhances flow–terrain interaction by reducing windward flow blocking. In the second mechanism, the moist airflow tends to damp <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> through destratifying the airflow and reducing the buoyancy frequency. The second mechanism dominates {{in the presence of}} a deep moist layer in the lower to middle troposphere, and the wave amplitude is significantly reduced associated with a smaller moist buoyancy frequency. With a shallow moist layer and strong low-level flow, the two mechanisms can become comparable in magnitude and largely offset each other. 1...|$|R

Enevoldson collected evidence on the location, prevalence, and strength of stratospheric <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> during the period 1992-1998. Starting in 1998 Elizabeth Austin expanded the data analysis and put the project on a firm meteorological basis, with the observation that the stratospheric polar night jet was the principal factor enabling the propagation of standing <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> high into the middle stratosphere. At this time a small group at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center analysed the flight dynamics and aerodynamics of sailplane flight up to 100,000 feet.|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> {{form in the}} lee of mountainous terrain under {{appropriate}} {{conditions of}} the vertical structure of wind speed and atmospheric stability. Trapped lee waves can extend hundreds of kilometers downwind from the mountain range, and they can extend tens of kilometers vertically into the stratosphere. <b>Mountain</b> <b>waves</b> are of importance in meteorology as they affect the general circulation of the atmosphere, can influence the vertical structure of wind speed and temperature fields, produce turbulence and downdrafts that can be an aviation hazard, and affect the vertical transport of aerosols and trace gasses, and ozone concentration. Sailplane pilots make extensive use of <b>mountain</b> lee <b>waves</b> as a source of energy with which to climb. There are many sailplane wave flights conducted every year throughout the world and they frequently cover large distances and reach high altitudes. Modern sailplanes frequently carry flight recorders that record their position at regular intervals during the flight. There is therefore potential to use this recorded data to determine the 3 D wind velocity at positions on the sailplane flight path. This would provide an additional source of information on <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> to supplement other measurement techniques that might be useful for studies on <b>mountain</b> <b>waves.</b> The recorded data are limited however, and determination of wind velocities is not straightforward. This thesis is concerned with the development and application of techniques to determine the vector wind field in atmospheric <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> using the limited flight data collected during sailplane flights. A detailed study is made of the characteristics, uniqueness, and sensitivity to errors in the data, of the problem of estimating the wind velocities from limited flight data consisting of ground velocities, possibly supplemented by air speed or heading data. A heuristic algorithm is developed for estimating 3 D wind velocities in <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> from ground velocity and air speed data, and the algorithm is applied to flight data collected during “Perlan Project” flights. The problem is then posed as a statistical estimation problem and maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimators are developed for a variety of different kinds of flight data. These estimators are tested on simulated flight data and data from Perlan Project flights...|$|R

The flows over the mountains of various half widths and heights were simulated with the model. The semianalytic solutions to the <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> through the linear theory are used to check {{the performance of the}} MCV model.

5000|$|Standing waves {{normally}} do not extend above the tropopause at temperate latitudes. A strong west wind usually decreases above the tropopause, {{which has been}} shown to cap or prevent the upward propagation of standing <b>mountain</b> <b>waves.</b> However, at the outer boundary of the polar vortex, in winter, the stratospheric polar night jet exists. Its wind field can join with the wind field of the polar jet stream. The result is a wind which increases with altitude through the tropopause and upward to 100,000 feet or above. When this conjunction of winds occurs over a barrier <b>mountain,</b> standing <b>mountain</b> <b>waves</b> will propagate through that entire altitude range.
