Therefore the content of the media should be the consideration in various fields, especially in public health. Media literacy attributed to the strengthening of media experiences.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} our {{approach}} for named entity recognition in Twitter <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{used in our}} participation in the Named Entity Recognition in Twitter shared task at the COLING 2016 Workshop on Noisy User-generated text (WNUT). The main challenge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> aim to tackle in our participation is the short, noisy and colloquial nature of tweets, which makes named entity recognition in Twitter messages a challenging task. In particular, we investigate an approach for dealing with this problem by enabling bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) to automatically learn orthographic features without requiring feature engineering. In comparison with other systems participating in the shared task, our system achieved the most effective performance on both the ‘segmentation and categorisation’ and the ‘segmentation only’ sub-tasks...|$|R
30|$|This section {{describes}} the extensions we have defined in SIP {{to support the}} LP-SIP protocol. It is {{important to point out}} that our extensions are based on the extensibility mechanisms defined in SIP. Namely, our proposal is based on three kinds of elements. Firstly, on the definition of new options-tags for different headers of SIP messages: Required, Supported, and Accept. Second, the definition of a new header named LP-SIP for conveying information related to a payment transaction. Finally, we have defined a new type of content for the body of the SIP messages. This new content conveys the <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have defined for the different exchanges of LP-SIP. Next, we describe each of these elements in more detail.|$|R

40|$|With the {{recommendations}} of the task force created to consider what to do about Confederate-era monuments in Baltimore now before Mayor Stephanie Rawlings–Blake, we are embroiled once again in the issues surrounding the display of symbols representing people, institutions or ideas that most people no longer accept. Whether the subject is a building, such as the recently renamed Byrd Stadium at the University of Maryland College Park; a monument; a plaque or a flag, the opposition to removing these negative symbols relies on two basic arguments. Those arguments are reasonable and worth exploring. At the end of the day, however, they are either inapplicable or can be accommodated. Accordingly, society can develop a principled method for removing objects <b>that</b> convey <b>messages</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> reject...|$|R
40|$|Edge servers {{are used}} to connect sensor {{networks}} to the enterprise network. Using asynchronous messaging for communication between components is attractive as it lessens the degree of coupling within the system, thereby increasing the system robustness. In order to be scalable, the messaging system itself must be distributed. Existing work in the literature describes how to build distributed messaging systems which scale to networks {{the size of the}} Internet using message routing. Here we explain why we find these solutions inappropriate for communication within the edge server architecture. We describe an alternative means of achieving scalable distributed <b>messaging</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> call <b>message</b> binning. We motivate the feasibility of our architecture through a description of its implementation and use in our edge server system...|$|R
