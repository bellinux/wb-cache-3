Most AOT trend studies used monthly or annual arithmetic means that discard details of the generally right-skewed AOT distributions. Potentially, such results can be biased by extreme values (including outliers). This study additionally uses percentiles (i. e., the lowest 5 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 95 % of the <b>monthly</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>distributions</b> fitted to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) -observed and ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) -model simulated AOTs) that are less affected by outliers caused by measurement error, cloud contamination and occasional extreme aerosol events. Since the limited statistical representativeness of monthly percentiles and means can lead to bias, this study adopts the number of observations as a weighting factor, which improves the statistical robustness of trend estimates. By analyzing the aerosol composition of AERONET-observed and EMAC-simulated AOTs in selected regions of interest, we distinguish the dominant aerosol types and investigate the causes of regional AOT trends. The simulated and observed trends are generally consistent with a high correlation coefficient (R =  0. 89) and small bias (slope± 2 σ =  0. 75  ±  0. 19). A significant decrease in EMAC-decomposed AOTs by water-soluble compounds and black carbon is found over the USA and the EU due to environmental regulation. In particular, a clear reversal in the AERONET AOT trend percentiles is found over the USA, probably related to the AOT diurnal cycle {{and the frequency of}} wildfires. In most of the selected regions of interest, EMAC-simulated trends are mainly attributed to the significant changes of the dominant aerosols; e. g., significant decrease in sea salt and water soluble compounds over Central America, increase in dust over Northern Africa and Middle East, and decrease in black carbon and organic carbon over Australia...|$|E

40|$|The Typical Meteorological Years (TMY) for Hong Kong is {{generated}} by using the weather data recorded by the Royal Observatory of Hong Kong from year 1979 to 1988. Data used in the analysis included the hourly dry bulb temperature, dew point temperature, wind velocity, total global solar radiation, etc. The <b>monthly</b> <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Distribution</b> Function (CDF) of those selected data was compared with the long term values of the CDF for each month of a year. The persistence structure was studied by Finkelstein-Schafer (FS) statistics. The deviations of CDF of the mean dry bulb temperature and total global solar radiation was examined. The weather data of the chosen typical year is compiled in TMY format. With this TMY, the building energy loads in a higher education institute in Hong Kong were simulated using the energy simulation program BLAST. The results were compared with the building energy loads of all the years from 1979 to 1988. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energies}} {{have potential}} for supplying of relatively clean and mostly local energy. Wind energy generation {{is expected to}} increase in the near future and has experienced dramatic growth over the past decade in many countries. Wind speed is the most important parameter in the design and study of wind energy conversion systems. Probability density functions such as Weibull and Rayleigh are often used in wind speed and wind energy analyses. This paper presents an assessment of wind energy at three heights during near two years based on Weibull distribution function in Abadan Airport. Extrapolation of the 10 m and 40 m data, using the power law, has been used to determine the wind speed at height of 80 m. According to the results wind speed at 80 m height in Abadan is ranged from 5. 8 m/s in Nov to 8. 5 m/s in Jun with average value of 7. 15 m/s. In this study, different parameters such as Weibull parameters, diurnal and <b>monthly</b> wind speeds, <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> and turbulence intensity have been estimated and analyzed. In addition Energy production of different wind turbines at different heights was estimated. The results show that the studied site has good potential for Installation of large and commercial wind turbines at height of 80 m or highe...|$|R
