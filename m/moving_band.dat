He saw a glittering mass, a broad, <b>moving</b> <b>band</b> of color. Everywhere waved Place flags, bright gold and blue. White faces gleamed like daisies on a golden slope. In the bleachers close to the first base massed a shirt-sleeved crowd of students, row on row of them, thousands in number. Ken experienced a little chill as he attached the famous Place yell to that significant placing of rooters. A soft breeze blew across the field, and it carried low laughter and voices of girls, a merry hum, and subdued murmur, and an occasional clear shout. The whole field seemed keenly alive.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the earlier}} genetic studies on the C4 protein {{identified}} two different groups, found within a human serum, called the Chido/Rogers (Ch/Rg) blood groups. O’Neill et al. have demonstrated that two different C4 loci express the different Ch/Rg antigens on the membranes of erythrocytes. More specifically, the two proteins, Ch and Rg, function together as a medium for interaction between the Ab-Ag complex and other complement components. Moreover, the two loci {{are linked to the}} HLA, or the human analog of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short arm of chromosome 6, whereas previously they were believed to have been expressed by two codominant alleles at a single locus. In gel electrophoresis studies, O’Neill et al. have identified two genetic variants: F, signifying the presence (F+) or absence (f0/ f0) of four fast <b>moving</b> <b>bands,</b> and S, signifying the presence (S+) or absence (s0/ s0) of four slow <b>moving</b> <b>bands.</b> The homogeneity or heterogeneity of the two loci, with the addition of these null (f0, s0) genes, allow for duplication/non-duplication of the C4 loci. Therefore, having separate loci for C4, C4F and C4S (later identified as C4A or C4B, respectively), possibly account for producing multiple allelic forms, leading to the great size and copy number variation.|$|R

50|$|At {{first he}} {{inclined}} to use gears. Then he discussed {{the problem with}} engineer Beauchamp Tower before the British Association meeting in 1872, and Tower suggested {{the use of a}} device that (as he remembered) was once used by Wheatstone. It was a chain running alternately over and under a sequence of pulleys on movable shafts. The chain was fixed at one end, and the other (free) end was weighted to keep it taut. As each shaft moved up or down it would take up or release a corresponding length of the chain. The movements in position of the free (movable) end of the chain represented the sum of the movements of the different shafts. The movable end was kept taut, and fitted with a pen and a <b>moving</b> <b>band</b> of paper on which the pen plotted a tidal curve. In some designs, the movable end of the line was connected instead to a dial and scale from which tidal heights could be read off.|$|E
5000|$|In {{traverse}} hardening systems {{the work}} piece is passed through the induction coil progressively and a following quench spray or ring is utilised. Traverse hardening is used extensively {{in the production of}} shaft type components such as axle shafts, excavator bucket pins, steering components, power tool shafts and drive shafts. The component is fed through a ring type inductor which normally features a single turn. The width of the turn is dictated by the traverse speed, the available power and frequency of the generator. This creates a <b>moving</b> <b>band</b> of heat which when quenched creates the hardened surface layer. The quench ring can be either integral a following arrangement or a combination of both subject to the requirements of the application. By varying speed and power it is possible to create a shaft which is hardened along its whole length or just in specific areas and also to harden shafts with steps in diameter or splines. It is normal when hardening round shafts to rotate the part during the process to ensure any variations due to concentricity of the coil and the component are removed.|$|E

40|$|A theory {{based on}} the shallow water {{equation}} is developed to explain the generation of moving spiral-banded structures in tropical cyclones. The theory proposes that fluctuation of the vorticity distribution in the compact core region {{can act as a}} source, generating gravity waves that produce the banded structures.

A numerical experiment using the Fifth Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM 5) code is used to test this theory.

A modified Finnigan MAT HPLC-MS <b>moving</b> <b>band</b> interface was employed to couple the HPLC system to the plasma emission source. At the heart of this transport- type interface is a thin polyimide band which acts to carry mobile phase through the interface and to the plasma source.
