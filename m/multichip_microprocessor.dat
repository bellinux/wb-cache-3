The approach relies on a coordinated placement of functional blocks on chips,and chips on the MCM, together with the use of area arrays to provide high bandwidth interconnections between the chips, and low inductance power connection to the MCM. Three stages of MCM development for this project are described. 1. Introduction This paper describes a packaging approach being developed for an experimental microprocessor which has as a goal, operation with a 1 GHz clock. The processor, which will execute a subset of the PowerPCä instruction set, is to be comprised of five custom VLSI circuits implemented in Motorola CGaAsä technology, plus level-two cache memory, which will be in silicon. (See Table 1.) The bandwidth and lat [...] ...|$|E
