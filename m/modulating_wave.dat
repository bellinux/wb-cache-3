Magnetic and charge properties are determined by systematic, large-scale, exact numerical calculations, and quantified {{as a function of}} electron doping $h$. In the solution of the self-consistent UHF equations, multiple initial configurations and simulated annealing are used to facilitate convergence to the global minimum. New approaches are employed to minimize finite-size effects in order to reach the thermodynamic limit. At low to moderate interacting strengths and low doping, the UHF ground state is a linear spin-density wave (l-SDW), with antiferromagnetic order and a <b>modulating</b> <b>wave.</b> The wavelength of the <b>modulating</b> <b>wave</b> is $ 2 /h$. Corresponding charge order exists but is substantially weaker than the spin order, hence holes are mobile. As the interaction is increased, the l-SDW states evolves into several different phases, with the holes eventually becoming localized. A simple pairing model is presented with analytic calculations for low interaction strength and small doping, to help understand the numerical results and provide a physical picture for the properties of the SDW ground state. By comparison with recent many-body calculations, it is shown that, for intermediate interactions, the UHF solution provides a good description of the magnetic correlations in the true ground state of the Hubbard model.

Analysis of conjugate Reimei data shows that such fine structures are a result of modulation of high-energy precipitating electrons. Pitch angle diffusion into the loss cone due to interaction of whistler mode waves with plasma sheet electrons is the most feasible mechanism leading to high-energy electron precipitation. This suggests that the fine structure is an indication of modulations of the efficiency of the wave–particle interaction.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is advanced that a latitudinal {{shift in the}} tropical convective heating pattern can significantly alter temperatures in the extratropics. Results of a simplified general circulation model (GCM) show that the shift of a prescribed tropical heating toward the summer pole, on time scales longer than a few weeks, leads to a more intense cross-equatorial 'winter' Hadley circulation, enhanced upper-level tropical easterlies, and a slightly stronger subtropical winter jet, accompanied by warming at the winter middle and high latitudes {{as a result of}} increased dynamical heating. The indications are that there is a robust connection between the net dynamic heating in the extratropics and the implied changes in the subtropical wind shear resulting from adjustments in the Hadley circulation associated with convective heating displacements in the tropics.

40|$|Cage {{induction}} motor (Cage-IM) {{is one of}} the main prime mover in many industrial sectors. It provides wide range of torque production, robust and lower life cycle cost relatively to other types of motor. However, with the constructional simplicity, cage-IM tradeoff control complexity. This is due to the coupling of field and armature where the rotor magnetization is depends on the stator part. The simplest way to drive cage-IM is by implementation of series resistor at the stator terminal. But this technique is not suitable for high power IM as the heat dissipated at the resistor will make the operation of IM less power efficient. The implementation of cycloconverter circuit offers other alternative but the circuit is quite complex and less efficient as the device will used power switches at active region instead of switch mode. On the other hand, Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) implementing S-PWM to provide adjustable power to the IM. S-PWM waveforms control the switching of the power switches bridge to create DC to AC conversion. In this research, the 3 -phase McMurray bridge topology is implemented. This 2 levels 3 legs topology is among the most commonly used in real application. An open loop IM drive implementing S-PWM VSI is simulated using SIMULINK. The results are comparatively analyzed through comparison with SV-PWM VSI to verify the system simulation model. Voltage and current at the stator terminal are measured and analyzed at transient and steady state to study the harmonics distortion as well as IM performance. The results shows that S-PWM VSI is capable to drive IM with 80. 23 % and 16. 86 % total harmonics distortion for voltage and current respectively. At transient state 265 % electromagnetic torque overshoot occurs and the system took 0. 2 s for setting time. This performance results are consistent for NEMA Class B IM. The S-PWM circuit is designed with the aid of SPICE software. A 3 -phase sinusoidal waves, a Centre-aligned triangle wave, 3 -phase S-PWM comparator modules are implemented with operational amplifier circuit configurations of specific ICs. The designed circuits are applied for real hardware implementation and the results are compared with the simulated results. DC offset, ringing noises, amplitude and frequency errors occur on the real hardware model which are not presented by the simulation results. These errors are managed by manual adjustment of the reference <b>modulating</b> <b>wave</b> (Vref), carrier signal (Vcarrier) though Rv adjustment knob and the amount of supplied voltage of the ICs (VCC, VEE). The isolation between control circuit module (S-PWM generator) and the high voltage side of the bridge is implemented using opto coupler ICs. For IM drives integration, IR 2130 bridge driver is used to provide deadtime to S-PWM wave pairs as well as interface the control circuit with the IGBTs module and IM. The developed S-PWM inverter module is capable to drive 0. 4 hp cage-IM at rated speed with better power utilization as compared to the conventional variable resistance implementation...|$|E
40|$|The Aurora is {{a visual}} {{manifestation of the}} complex plasma {{processes}} that occur as the solar wind interacts with the Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere. Therefore, studies of the aurora can lead to {{better understanding of the}} near-Earth space environment and of fundamental physical processes. This thesis focuses on optical studies of the aurora, both ground-based observations using the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS) and measurements from instruments onboard the Japanese micro-satellite Reimei. Various properties of the aurora are studied, such as the characteristic energy of precipitating electrons and scale sizes of diffuse auroral structures. Our understanding of the ionospheric physical processes involved in a particular auroral emission is improved using conjugate particle and optical data. Auroral light is a result of radiative transitions between excited states of the ionospheric gases. These excited states are formed either by direct electron impact or by a series of more complicated processes, involving chemical reactions, where part of the energy is converted into auroral light. Studies of auroral emissions can therefore give information about primary particle fluxes, ionospheric composition, and the magnetospheric and ionospheric processes leading to auroral precipitation. One way of deducing the characteristic energy of the precipitating particles is by using intensity ratios of auroral emissions. To be reliable, this method requires a good understanding of the processes involved in the auroral emissions used. The method works well if the measurements are made along the geomagnetic field lines. Using data from ALIS, both in magnetic zenith and off magnetic zenith, this method is tested for angles further away {{from the direction of the}} magnetic field lines. The result shows that it is possible to use this technique to deduce the characteristic energy for angles up to 35 degrees away from magnetic zenith. Using ALIS we have also been able to study structures and variations in diffuse aurora. When mapped to the magnetosphere, this provides information about the characteristics of the <b>modulating</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the magnetospheric source region. A statistical study of the scale sizes of diffuse auroral structures was made and the result shows widths and separation between structures of the order of 13 - 14 km. When mapped to the magnetosphere, this corresponds to 3 - 4 ion gyro radii for protons with a typical energy of 7 keV. Magnetometer data show that the structures move southward with a speed close to zero in the plasma convection frame. Stationary mirror mode structures in the magnetospheric equatorial plane are a likely explanation for these diffuse auroral structures. In another study we use measured precipitating electron energy spectra to improve our understanding of how the auroral process itself relates to the 427. 8 nm auroral emission, which is often used when studying intensity ratios between different emission lines. The 427. 8 nm emission is a fairly simple emission to model, with only a few processes involved, but still has some uncertainties, mostly due to the excitation cross section. Simultaneous measurements of the intensity of this emission from ALIS and the intensity and electron flux from Reimei provide a way to evaluate different sets of cross sections in order to find the best fit to the experimental data. It also allows a comparison of the absolute calibration of ALIS and Reimei imagers, improving the possibility to use the space-borne data for other detailed quantitative studies. In order to compare absolute measurements of aurora using different imagers, optical instruments are usually absolute calibrated by exposing them to a calibration light source. In 2011 an intercalibration workshop was held in Sodankylä, Finland, where nine low light sources were compared to the radioactive Fritz Peak reference source. The results were compared with earlier calibration workshop results and show that the sources are fairly stable. Two sources were also calibrated with the calibration standard source at UNIS, Svalbard, and the results show agreement with the calibration workshop in Sodankylä within 15 to 25 %. This confirms the quality of the measurements with ALIS and in turn also of the the Reimei imagers.
