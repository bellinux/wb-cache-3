This procedure offers a better representation of the current accident situation and, in particular, the barrier concept is a better reflection of front-end stiffness seen in today’s passenger car fleet compared to that of the current legislative barrier face. Based on the preliminary performance corridors of the prototype AE-MDB, a refined AE-MDB specification has been developed. A programme of barrier to load cell wall testing was undertaken to complete and standardise the AE-MDB specification. Barrier faces were supplied by the four leading manufacturers to demonstrate that the specification could be met by all. This paper includes background, specification and proof of compliance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the next}} 20 years {{the share of}} small {{electric}} vehicles (SEVs) will increase especially in urban areas. SEVs show distinctive design differences compared to traditional vehicles. Thus the consequences of impacts of SEVs with vulnerable road users (VRUs) and other vehicles will be different from traditional collisions. No assessment concerning vehicle safety is defined for vehicles within European L 7 e category currently. Focus of the elaborated methodology is to define appropriate test scenarios for this vehicle category to be used within a virtual tool chain. A virtual tool chain has to be defined for the realization of a guideline of virtual certification. The derivation and development of new test conditions for SEVs are described and are {{the main focus of}} this work. As key methodology a prospective methodical analysis under consideration of future aspects like pre-crash safety systems is applied. The studies show that certain collision types will be reduced in numbers and in average collision severity. Based on the evaluation following tests are proposed. Frontal: oblique (30 °), test speed 35 km/h, 1, 300 kg Mobile Progressive Deformable Barrier (MPDB); Side: 90 °, Advanced European <b>Mobile</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (AE-MDB), barrier speed 40 km/h; Pedestrian safety: seven pedestrian impact locations, 2 speed ranges, four different percentiles. The proposed virtual testing procedure has to be based on well validated models and tools, which can be assumed to be available in the future. The focus of the presented work is on SEVs in L 7 e category, for which no specific, urban area relevant safety regulations are available. Overall occupant and VRU safety of future SEVs will increase significantly, if additionally to the standard crash tests the elaborated tests from the European Union (EU) initiative SafeEV are applied for the design of safety measures within L 7 e vehicle class...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of structural interaction {{has been identified}} as the main challenge of the unresolved problem of frontal crash compatibility. With this background, two questions are raised: Does a better structural interaction correspond with higher safety and crash compatibility? Are current test approaches able to evaluate structural properties? Considering the structural mechanics of collisions, it is hypothesized that a poor structural interaction does not necessarily result in lower safety and should be considered together with compartment strength and restraint systems. This hypothesis is confirmed by reviewing some crash results from other studies. A spring-mass vehicle model is also used to verify the hypothesis. Finally, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted to find the answers to the two questions. For this study three different variations of a vehicle model are created, which represent different structural properties of the passenger car fleet. The crash performance of these models is analyzed in different car-to-car and car-to-barrier tests. Results of the car-to-car tests show that better structural interaction often makes the vehicle more aggressive. Generally, better structural interaction increases crash pulse and reduces intrusions. Depending on vehicle design and crash configuration, the intrusions or the crash pulse become more important as to why good or poor structural interaction cannot be overall related to more crash compatibility or occupant safety. Our criticism of the current assessment approaches for frontal crash compatibility is the establishment of a direct link between good structural interaction and higher safety. These approaches do not consider the effect of higher crash pulses due to the better structural interaction. Our recommendation is to assess the partner protection through metrics about intrusions and crash pulse of the partner, without direct {{assessment of}} the structural interaction. Instead, the test configuration should be able to reflect structural properties in intrusions or crash pulse. Results of the car-to-barrier tests show that the Progressive Deformable Barrier can reflect structural issues correctly. However, the developed metrics for this barrier result in incomprehensive interpretations. Results of the tests with other barriers are inconsistent with the structural properties of the vehicles. Finally, an exemplary test concept with the Advanced European <b>Mobile</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> is presented as an alternative assessment approach. Simulation results of the proposed assessment approach show good consistency with the crash performance of the vehicles in the car-to-car tests. Combination of this test concept with the Full-Width Rigid Barrier test can be used to assess the safety and crash compatibility of passenger cars...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) was to define an {{integrated}} set of test procedures and associated metrics to assess a vehicle’s frontal impact protection, which includes self- and partner- protection. For {{the development of the}} set, two different full-width tests (full-width <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [FWDB] test, full- width rigid barrier test) and three different offset tests (offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [ODB] test, progressive <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [PDB] test, moveable <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> with the PDB barrier face [MPDB] test) have been investigated. Different compatibility assessment procedures were analysed and metrics for assessing structural interaction (structural alignment, vertical and horizontal load spreading) as well as several promising metrics for the PDB/MPDB barrier were developed. The final assessment approach consists of a combination of the most suitable full-width and offset tests. For the full- width test (FWDB), a metric was developed to address structural alignment based on load cell wall information in the first 40 ms of the test. For the offset test (ODB), the existing ECE R 94 was chosen.

40|$|Objective: To improve vehicle {{safety in}} frontal collisions, the crash {{compatibility}} between the colliding vehicles is crucial. Compatibility aims to improve both {{the self and}} partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Methods: Within the Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research (FIMCAR) project, different frontal impact test procedures (offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [ODB] test as currently used for Economic Commission for Europe [ECE] R 94, progressive <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test as proposed by France for a new ECE regulation, moveable <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test as discussed worldwide, full-width rigid barrier test as used in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 208, and full-width <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test) were analyzed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test program and numerical simulations. Results: The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full-width test procedure with a deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current offset test as a frontal impact assessment approach that also addresses compatibility. Conclusions: By adding a full-width test to the current ODB test it is possible to better address the issues of structural misalignment and injuries resulting from high acceleration accidents as observed in the current fleet. The estimated benefit ranges from a 5 to 12 percent reduction of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from frontal impact accidents. By using a deformable element in the full-width test, the test conditions are more representative of real-world situations with respect to acceleration pulse, restraint system triggering time, and deformation pattern of the front structure. The test results are therefore expected to better represent real-world performance of the tested car. Furthermore, the assessment of the structural alignment is more robust than in the rigid wall test. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

40|$|Among {{the tests}} that {{are carried out}} to the lifting bars system of an automobile, there is one of load {{security}} denominated City Crash that consists of an impact at 30 km/h with a controlled deceleration of maximum 12 g. The test is made with a load on {{the bars of the}} 120 % of the nominal, assembled on a body fixed to a sleigh that hits against a <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier.</b> In CT SEAT exists a low speed impact installation which is unapt for this test. The project has consisted of incorporating a compatible system with the existing one for this application. The main problem to solve has been the limitation of mass of the existing pneumatic impelling system. This has forced to replace the usual sleigh in these tests by the own body to which the following is added: a crash device and carts on rails directly coupled to the fixations of the assembly line of the vehicle. Thus it is possible not to exceed the maximum mass that the impeller is able to carry to the required speed and we obtain a guidance system that does not interfere with the existing tests. The assembly is made hit against a <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> in such a controlled way that provides the deceleration prescribed in the test. The installation is complemented with a configuration of speed calibration in which the <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> is replaced by a braking system...|$|R

40|$|Automotive safety {{regulations}} vary {{in different parts}} of the world. Dynamic side impact regulations, for example, are different than the ones in Europe. United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the European Union (EU) have each produced their own distinct testing procedures such as different <b>deformable</b> <b>barriers,</b> impact configurations and anthropomorphic test devices (dummies). Although both test procedures have the same final objective, estimate occupant responses in side impact, they differ greatly in execution. One of the main differences in testing is the Moving <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (MDB) used. The US MDB is designed to represent an average midsize vehicle in the US market, while the European MDB represents a mid size vehicle in Europe. The objective of this paper is to develop a finite element model representing the US <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> for use in side impact simulations. Special emphasis is made on using the various available material models in LS-DYNA and the correct adhesive properties to predict the correct behavior of the honeycomb material. These models are validated to available full-scale tests. As known by many researchers, the main difficulty of MDB modeling is the prediction of the barrier complex failure modes. In side impact tests, the severe shear deformation of the honeycomb material, full densification of barrier edge, rupture of aluminum cover sheets, and tearing of honeycomb blocks are often observed. This complex pattern of honeycomb material failure mode makes it difficult to predict. Numerical instabilities, such as negative volume, sever hourglassing, and inaccurate predictions are often experienced...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} load cell moving <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (LCMDB) tests as a means of assessing frontal impact compatibility between vehicles. An LCMDB is employed to enable assessment of relevant partner-protection characteristics in addition to self-protection performance in a front-to-front crash test. The ability to control key characteristics of compatibility in LCMDB tests enables force measurements on the load cell wall to be used to assess structural interaction, frontal force level and passenger compartment strength. In this study, LCMDB tests have been conducted with various deformable elements to determine how well they correlated with fixed barrier tests or vehicle-to-vehicle tests. Firstly, barrier load cell data measured in a full-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test are compared with data measured in a full width <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (FWDB) test at 56 km/h. In addition, some compatibility metrics such as average height of force (AHOF) and force distribution are compared. Secondly, an offset-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted to evaluate the passenger compartment strength for small cars in an overload condition. Force measurements of the load cell wall are compared with data obtained from an offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB) test at 64 km/h. Finally, an oblique-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted and the test results are compared with vehicle-to-vehicle tests and with fixed oblique barrier tests at 50 km/h in terms of the vehicle and occupant kinematics.

40|$|Abstract: Currently various safety {{tests are}} being {{performed}} {{in many countries}} with growing interest in vehicle safety. However the vehicles which have good safety performance in these tests could not secure the good performance in real car to car accident.

In this paper 3 different tests (R. 94, EuroNCAP and PDB test) were carried out using current production vehicles with same structure. The results of these tests were compared to understand PDB test.

It consists of two parallel research activities, one focusing on car-to-car compatibility and the other on car-to-truck compatibility. The main objective of the car-to-car research is the development of crash test procedures to assess frontal impact crash compatibility. The car-to-truck objective is to develop test methods to assess energy absorbing frontal underrun protection for trucks. This paper reports on the car-to-car compatibility work completed in the first 36 months of a 45 month project. The car-to-car work program is comprised of four main activities, a structural survey, cost benefit analyses, crash testing, and supporting modelling work. A survey of European passenger vehicles has been conducted to construct a database of common crashworthiness structures and general car structures. A review of the detailed accident databases and national data in Germany and UK has been used to estimate the benefit expected from improved vehicle compatibility. Crash testing (car-to-car and car-to-barrier) has been used to identify desirable characteristics for vehicle crash compatibility as well as help determine assessment protocols to evaluate (quantify) compatible crash performance. A set of complementary modelling activities has been implemented to review crash test and fleet performance of vehicles to investigate the crash test procedures and their influence on road safety. All these activities have focussed on the development of a suite of test procedures that are capable of assessing a car’s structural interaction potential, namely the Full Width <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (FWDB) and Progressive <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (PDB) tests. These tests have different approaches; the FWDB assessment is based on Load Cell Wall force measurements whereas the PDB assessment is based on deformation measurements.

Owing to their interfacial localization, MWNTs are shown to enhance both phase dispersion and stability of the dispersed phase for long mixing time (at least 60 min) and very low filler content (0. 5 wt. -% MWNTs) compared to what was previously observed in literature. MWNTs also produce a more uniform distribution of droplets size. The main stabilization mechanism proposed is {{the formation of a}} <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> network providing a mechanical barrier against coalescence. Blends stabilized by solid anisotropic nanoparticles, like MWNTs, could therefore offer an interesting alternative to blends compatibilized by block-copolymers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{variations}} in modelling of roof crush loading scenarios upon topology and mass of a body in white (BIW) for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). These variations incorporated the proposed changes to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 216 standard. The base model used for the investigation in this paper was based upon a series of optimisation studies. The overall purpose was to minimise the BIW mass of an HEV subjected to multiple crash scenarios including high-speed front impact, offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB), side impact, pole impact, high-speed rear impact and low-speed rear impact {{in addition to a}} roof crush scenario. For the purpose of achieving this goal, finite element (FE) topology optimisation was employed. Owing to the limitations of present-day FE optimisation software, all models utilised linear static load cases. In addition, all models made use of inertia relief (IR) boundary conditions. With the above approach, the BIW topology was investigated...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. CRASH 3 is a {{computer}} program that enables a vehicle's change of velocity during a crash to be deduced from the observed damage to the vehicle(s) involved. Along with other programs that share similar mathematical techniques, it is widely used internationally, particularly by groups and individuals {{who have access to}} damaged vehicles but not the accident scene, and it is applied {{to a wide range of}} vehicles and accident circumstances. Crash tests conducted under controlled conditions provide an opportunity to assess the program's accuracy. In this paper CRASH 3 is applied to vehicles tested during 1996 - 98 in the first three phases of the EuroNCAP program. This includes results from 26 models tested in 64 km/h offset frontal impacts and 50 km/h side impacts. On average, velocity changes were underestimated by 1 km/h for the side test and 7 km/h for the frontal test–this includes the effect of a special treatment of <b>deformable</b> <b>barriers</b> not available in the standard program...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{optimize}} the longitudinal beam based on 100 % overlapping rigid barrier (100 % RB) impact and 40 % overlapping offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (40 % ODB) impact. The 100 %RB and 40 %ODB impact FE models were developed in LS-DYNA and validated by using results from crash tests. According to the requirement of crashworthiness, the peak of acceleration of left B-pillar and energy absorbed per unit mass of longitudinal beam were chosen as optimization objects, and the thicknesses of four parts of the longitudinal beam were considered as the design variables. Furthermore, uniform design was applied to build variable samples. Optimal results were obtained by surrogate model built by Kriging and optimization method NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms-II). The results showed that 100 %RB and 40 %ODB impact should be considered together when longitudinal beam was designed. The optimized longitudinal beam matches well and effectively improves vehicle crashworthiness...|$|R
