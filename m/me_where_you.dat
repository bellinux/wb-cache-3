Author Jeffrey Roessner considers it significant that Harrison mispronounces the title; in addition, he contends that the full statement – [...] "We all know Ob-la-di-bla-da / But can you show <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are?" [...] – serves {{as an example of}} Harrison, like Lennon, mocking those listeners who obsessively scanned the Beatles' lyrics for [...] "clues". Music journalist Robert Fontenot interprets the lines as an expression of distaste for [...] "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", since Harrison and Lennon were openly critical of McCartney's composition.|$|E
