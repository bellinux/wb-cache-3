25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something great! As to earning my bread, you <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} I could do that. I didn't turn {{my hand to}} it early enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Humphrey, {{that is what}} I <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not even}} {{know if there is}} such a thing as spirit. Our god was Fate; Bastin's god is a spirit, and I think yours also." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, I {{know you}} don’t {{want to talk}} to me!” she said. “Still, though I feel most horribly <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it because <b>I</b> had to.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Frank; by no <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish}} {{to say a word}} against your father. It may, perhaps have been his misfortune, rather than his fault--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Nomen nescio (/ˈnoː.men ˈnes.ki.oː/), IPA [...] {{abbreviated}} to N.N., {{is used to}} signify an anonymous or unnamed person. From Latin nomen, name, and nescio, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know (from nescire, not to know), it literally <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know the name.|$|R
60|$|DICK. But I {{shall be}} {{of age in}} a year; my money's my own, it's not as if I had to ask any one's leave; and I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know my own mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> go out with them afternoons a good deal, but I {{consider}} that {{a part of my}} duty. They are so helpless socially. You've always felt that yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|Object. 2. When I say I only seek myself, I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not find}} that I do design God's glory in mine own {{salvation}} by Christ, {{and that makes}} me fear I do not come aright.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, sir, true--especially {{when it is}} not {{actually}} necessary. Yes, I'd take the boys by all <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think you'll regret it. Of course, though, each will have to have a complete outfit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] {{said the}} poor girl, {{who was always}} ready for tears--"you shouldn't be hard upon me. I--I didn't mean--I <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to say you would to any wrong to this dear child, only--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is. What it <b>means</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, but it {{was given}} to me because of some dream that my mother had the night before <b>I</b> was born. <b>Do</b> you tell me what it means, since you seem to know so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> come up." [...] She hadn't {{meanwhile}} a bit {{believed in}} his answer, convinced {{as she was}} {{that if she had}} been difficult it would be the last thing he would have told her. [...] "I'm doing," [...] she said, [...] "as I like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} understand," [...] she cried wildly, {{beginning}} to lose self-control--"It's {{not that way}} I <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> like you; the more I've known you the more I've liked you. And {{at the same time}} the more I've known you the less would I care to marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is an abominable man, irrepressible, so thick-skinned {{that you}} cannot {{possibly}} get at him {{so as to}} hurt him. It is of no use telling {{him to keep his}} distance, for he does not in the least know what you <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt that he has left the house with a conviction that he has gained a sincere friend in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} {{straight}} from Ascot," [...] Trent replied, [...] "but my horse was beaten {{if that is}} what you <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not come here to talk about racing though. I want a word with you in private." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tu-Kila-Kila looked askance, with {{something}} very closely approaching a wink {{in his left}} eye. [...] "We two are both gods," [...] he said, with a tinge of irony in his tone. [...] "We know what that <b>means....</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel so certain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Many {{thanks to}} both of you; long life to our friendship, and that <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> most firmly believe, to these clay continents on which we fly our colours; good luck to one and all, and may God {{continue}} to be merciful.--Your old and warm friend, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut {{my eyes to}} it, you <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> all I can, but it is hard, when I wish to be nice, and do try; don't I?" [...] asked Molly. But Scamp {{was ready}} for her, and began to comb her hair with both paws as he stood on his hind legs to work so busily that Molly laughed and pulled him down, saying, as she cuddled the sly kit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Eda, we must send to England {{for a lot}} of {{fairy tales}} to teach you what I <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but jest when I speak of spirits living there. But many books, have been written about pretended spirits and fairies, which tell us of their {{wonderful}} adventures, and what they said and did long ago. I shall tell you some of these stories one of these days. But I daresay there are no spirits in this spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I do it again, {{you will}} inform him: {{is that what}} you <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not share your dread of my brother; I have always known how to defend my own position. But I shall {{certainly}} never again take any step on your behalf; you are much too thankless. I knew you were not a spontaneous nature, but I believed you were firm, and I told your father that he would find you so. I am disappointed--but your father will not be!" [...] And with this, Mrs. Penniman offered her niece a brief good-night, and withdrew to her own apartment.|$|E
6000|$|Answer: 'Those {{are fine}} words: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} them; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not care to}} understand them; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not deny that God is infinite and absolute, though what that <b>means</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. But I find nothing about his being infinite and absolute in the Bible. I find there that he is righteous, just, loving, merciful, and forgiving; {{and that he is}} angry too, and that his wrath is a consuming fire, and I know well enough what those words <b>mean,</b> though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know what infinite and absolute mean. So that is what I have to think of, for my own sake and the sake of all mankind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but what's the procedure? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> That's what I'm after. I've got to buy {{something}} at Beale's this afternoon. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> set about it?" ...|$|R
30|$|But if I’m angry towards {{somebody}} I don’t {{know how}} to deal with that. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about it? <b>I</b> can’t go up and biff ‘em.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] he said, [...] "{{there is}} no inconsistency, my {{son of the}} red spear. But {{there is a great}} deal of {{incompatibility}} of temper. I am very far from being certain that the Zulu is on an inferior evolutionary stage, whatever the blazes that may <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think there is anything stupid or ignorant about howling at the moon or being afraid of devils in the dark. It seems to me perfectly philosophical. Why should a man be thought a sort of idiot because he feels the mystery and peril of existence itself? Suppose, my dear Chadd, suppose it is we who are the idiots because we are not afraid of devils in the dark?" ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{those words}} may mean, {{or may not}} <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not intend to argue now. I only quote them to shew you that St Paul, {{just as much as}} any Old Testament thinker, {{believed}} that there were often mysteries, ay, tragedies, in the lives, not only of individuals, nor of families, but of whole races, to which we shortsighted mortals could assign no rational or moral final cause, but must simply do that which Spinoza forbade us to do, namely--"In every unknown case, flee unto God;" [...] and say--"It is the Lord, let Him do what seemeth Him good;"--certain of this, which the Cross and Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ shewed forth as nothing else in heaven or earth could shew--that the will of God toward man is an utterly good will; and that therefore what seemeth good to Him, will be good in act and fact.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have never}} seen {{anything}} about myself in print which has much correctness in it--any biographical account of myself I <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not supply such particulars when I am asked for them by editors and compilers, simply because I am asked for them every day. If you want to prime Forgues, you may tell him without fear of anything wrong, that I was born at Portsmouth on the 7th of February, 1812; that my father was in the Navy Pay Office; that I was taken by him to Chatham when I was very young, and lived and was educated there till I was twelve or thirteen, I suppose; that I was then put to a school near London, where (as at other places) I distinguished myself like a brick; that I was put in the office of a solicitor, a friend of my father's, and didn't much like it; and {{after a couple of years}} (as well as I can remember) applied myself with a celestial or diabolical energy to the study of such things as would qualify me to be a first-rate parliamentary reporter--at that time a calling pursued by many clever men who were young at the Bar; that I made my début in the gallery (at about eighteen, I suppose), engaged on a voluminous publication no longer in existence, called The Mirror of Parliament; that when The Morning Chronicle was purchased by Sir John Easthope and acquired a large circulation, I was engaged there, and that I remained there until I had begun to publish [...] "Pickwick," [...] when I found myself in a condition to relinquish that part of my labours; that I left the reputation behind me of being the best and most rapid reporter ever known, and that I could do anything in that way under any sort of circumstances, and often did. (I daresay I am at this present writing the best shorthand writer in the world.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>mean</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>I</b> {{went with}} my uncle and aunt, {{who wanted to}} persuade him to come and live with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> didn’t know I was," [...] he replied, [...] "more than usual, <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> always <b>do</b> look fairly cheerful—at least, <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There’s {{nothing to}} make me look the opposite." ...|$|R
60|$|Victory! She was here, a {{slave to}} these black conquerors. Once more I started toward her, but better {{judgment}} held me back--I could do nothing to help her other than by stealth. Could I even accomplish aught by this <b>means?</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know. It seemed beyond the pale of possibility, and yet I should try.|$|R
60|$|I {{have asked}} Colvin {{to send you}} a copy of CATRIONA, which I am {{sometimes}} tempted to think is about my best work. I hear word occasionally of the AMAZING MARRIAGE. It will be a brave day for me when I get hold of it. Gower Woodseer is now an ancient, lean, grim, exiled Scot, living and labouring as for a wager in the tropics; still active, still with lots of fire in him, but the youth - ah, the youth where is it? For years after I came here, the critics (those genial gentlemen) used to deplore the relaxation of my fibre and the idleness to which I had succumbed. I hear less of this now; the next thing is they will tell me I am writing myself out! and that my unconscientious conduct is bringing their grey hairs with sorrow to the dust. I do not know - I <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know one thing. For fourteen years I have not had a day's real health; I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary; and I have done my work unflinchingly. I have written in bed, and written out of it, written in hemorrhages, written in sickness, written torn by coughing, written when my head swam for weakness; and for so long, it seems to me I have won my wager and recovered my glove. I am better now, have been rightly speaking since first I came to the Pacific; and still, few are the days when I am not in some physical distress. And the battle goes on - ill or well, is a trifle; so as it goes. I was made for a contest, and the Powers have so willed that my battlefield should be this dingy, inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle. At least I have not failed, but I would have preferred a place of trumpetings and the open air over my head.|$|E

60|$|I return Mr. Chorley's[106] note, my dear cousin, with thankful {{thoughts}} of him--as of you. I wish I could persuade {{you of the}} rightness of my view about 'Essays on Mind' and such things, and how the difference between them and my present poems is not merely the difference between two schools, as you seemed to intimate yesterday, nor even the difference between immaturity and maturity; {{but that it is}} the difference between the dead and the living, between a copy and an individuality, between what is myself and what is not myself. To you who have a personal interest and--may I say? affection for me, the girl's exercise assumes a factitious value, but to the public the matter is otherwise and ought to be otherwise. And for the 'psychological' side of the question, do observe that I have not reputation enough to suggest a curiosity about my legends. Instead of your 'legendary lore,' it would be just a legendary bore. Now you understand what I <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not underrate Pope nor his school, but I do disesteem everything which, bearing the shape of a book, is not the true expression of a mind, and I know and feel (and so do you) that a girl's exercise written when all the experience lay in books, and the mind was suited rather for intelligence than production, lying like an infant's face with an undeveloped expression, must be valueless in itself, and if offered to the public directly or indirectly as a work of mine, highly injurious to me. Why, of the 'Prometheus' volume, even, you know what I think and desire. 'The Seraphim,' with all its feebleness and shortcomings and obscurities, yet is the first utterance of my own individuality, and therefore the only volume except the last which is not a disadvantage to me to have thought of, and happily for me, the early books, never having been advertised, nor reviewed, except by accident, once or twice, are as safe from the public as manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> still, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{the same things that}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before … <b>I</b> think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|R
5000|$|Ich mach das nich. (cf. Low Saxon: Ik mag dat nich.) 1. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> like that. (Standard German: Ich mag das nicht, Mir gefällt das nicht.), 2. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> like it. (Standard German: Ich mag es nicht, Mir gefällt es nicht.) (N.B.: The Missingsch {{sentence}} Ich mach das nich {{can also}} <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> do that/it, because what in Standard German is (ich) mag (...)

6000|$|... "Anyway, {{that is what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> have no use for a man {{who sells}} my {{property}} to his friends. You'll get out of this place to-morrow." ...|$|R
