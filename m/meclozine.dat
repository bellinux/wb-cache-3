50|$|Meclizine (INN, or <b>meclozine)</b> is an {{antihistamine}} {{considered to}} be an antiemetic. It is sold under the brand names Bonine, Bonamine, Antivert, Postafen, Sea Legs, and Dramamine II (Less Drowsy Formulation). Emesafene is a combination of meclizine (1/3) and pyridoxine (2/3). In Canada, Antivert Tab (which is no longer available) was a combination of meclizine and nicotinic acid.|$|E
50|$|Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, {{is often}} used {{alongside}} other antiemetic drugs, as it has synergistic action with many of them, although its specific antiemetic mechanism of action is not fully understood. Metoclopramide, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with possible other mechanisms, is an older drug that is sometimes used, either on its own or in combination with others. Histamine blockers such as diphenhydramine or <b>meclozine</b> {{may be used in}} rescue treatment. Lorazepam and Diazepam may sometimes be used to relieve anxiety associated with CINV before administration of chemotherapy, and are also often used in the case of rescue treatment.|$|E
40|$|Achondroplasia (ACH) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{skeletal}} dysplasias with short stature caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGFR 3 encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. We used the drug repositioning strategy to identify an FDA-approved drug that suppresses abnormally activated FGFR 3 signaling in ACH. We found that <b>meclozine,</b> an anti-histamine drug that has long been used for motion sickness, facilitates chondrocyte proliferation and mitigates loss of extracellular matrix in FGF 2 -treated rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells. <b>Meclozine</b> also ameliorated abnormally suppressed proliferation of human chondrosarcoma (HCS- 2 / 8) cells that were infected with lentivirus expressing constitutively active mutants of FGFR 3 -K 650 E causing thanatophoric dysplasia, FGFR 3 -K 650 M causing SADDAN, and FGFR 3 -G 380 R causing ACH. Similarly, <b>meclozine</b> alleviated abnormally suppressed differentiation of ATDC 5 chondrogenic cells expressing FGFR 3 -K 650 E and -G 380 R in micromass culture. We also confirmed that <b>meclozine</b> alleviates FGF 2 -mediated longitudinal growth inhibition of embryonic tibia in bone explant culture. Interestingly, <b>meclozine</b> enhanced growth of embryonic tibia in explant culture even in the absence of FGF 2 treatment. Analyses of intracellular FGFR 3 signaling disclosed that <b>meclozine</b> downregulates phosphorylation of ERK but not of MEK in FGF 2 -treated RCS cells. Similarly, <b>meclozine</b> enhanced proliferation of RCS cells expressing constitutively active mutants of MEK and RAF but not of ERK, which suggests that <b>meclozine</b> downregulates the FGFR 3 signaling by possibly attenuating ERK phosphorylation. We used the C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) as a potent inhibitor of the FGFR 3 signaling throughout our experiments, and found that <b>meclozine</b> was as efficient as CNP in attenuating the abnormal FGFR 3 signaling. We propose that <b>meclozine</b> is a potential therapeutic agent for treating ACH and other FGFR 3 -related skeletal dysplasias...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the effects of 1 mg. hyoscine hydrobromide and of 50 mg. <b>meclozine</b> hydrochloride on the performance of tasks of vigilance and short-term memory. In further trials the effects of these drugs were measured after ingestion of 32 g. ethyl alcohol. Efficiency was impaired by hyoscine taken alone, but <b>meclozine</b> alone had no significant effect. The effect of hyoscine was substantially increased by the presence of alcohol and under these conditions the effect of <b>meclozine</b> was equally great. The vigilance task appeared to be more sensitive to the effects of the drugs than the memory task, and possible reasons for this are considered in the discussion...|$|E
40|$|Antihistaminics {{are widely}} used for various {{indications}} during microbial infection. Hence, this paper investigates the antimicrobial activities of 10 antihistaminics belonging to both old and new generations using multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. The bacteriostatic activity of antihistaminics was investigated by determining their MIC both by broth and agar dilution techniques against 29 bacterial strains. Azelastine, cyproheptadine, mequitazine and promethazine were the most active among the tested drugs. Diphenhydramine and cetirizine possessed weaker activity whereas doxylamine, fexofenadine and loratadine were inactive even at the highest tested concentration (1 mg/ml). The MIC of <b>meclozine</b> could not be determined as it precipitated with the used culture media. The MBC values of antihistaminics were almost identical to the corresponding MIC values. The bactericidal activity of antihistaminics was also studied by the viable count technique in sterile saline solution. Evident killing effects were exerted by mequitazine, <b>meclozine,</b> azelastine and cyproheptadine. Moreover, the dynamics of bactericidal activity of azelastine were studied by the viable count technique in nutrient broth. This activity {{was found to be}} concentration-dependant. This effect was reduced on increasing the inoculum size while it was increased on raising the pH. The post-antimicrobial effect of 100 fg/ml azelastine was also determined and reached up to 3. 36 h...|$|E
40|$|Background. Nausea and {{vomiting}} in pregnancy (NVP) {{is a common}} complaint but risk factors for NVP are not well characterized. Methods. Occurrence of NVP was studied by questionnaires given to pregnant women at their {{first visit to the}} antenatal care unit and were returned around gestational week 28. Results. Analysis of 3675 completed questionnaires was made. Nausea {{and vomiting}} in pregnancy was reported by 79 % of the women, approximately half of which had been vomiting. Various therapies (drugs, acupuncture, acupressure) were tried by 18 % of the women with NVP, of which the majority used drugs, most notably antihistamines (specifically <b>meclozine).</b> Hospitalization occurred in 1 % of all women. Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy caused 28 % of all sick-leaves during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy. Low maternal age and parity 1 + independently increased the risk for NVP. Smoking before pregnancy and using vitamins in early pregnancy were associated with a decreased risk for NVP. Women working outside the home had a lower rate of NVP than housewives and women out of work. Conclusions. Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is a common complaint with a significant impact on leave of absence from work. The study identifies a number of factors that are related to the occurrence of NVP and that may give hints on the etiology of the condition...|$|E
40|$|Background: More than {{one-half}} of all pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), primarily during the first trimester. Methods: Prospectively ascertained information on drug use during pregnancy {{was obtained from the}} Swedish Medical Birth Register during the period July 1, 1995 to 2002. Antiemetics (antiemetic antihistamines, dopamine modulators, and ondansetron) primarily used for NVP were studied, and women reporting the use of these drugs were compared with all women who gave birth during the study period. Results: Use of these antiemetics was reported in 4. 5 % of the pregnant women - 86 % of whom reported their use before the first antenatal visit (usually weeks 10 - 12). <b>Meclozine,</b> followed by other antihistamines, accounted for 68 % of the drugs reported. Young maternal age, multiparity, non-smoking, and a period of unwanted childlessness increased the probability of using any of the antiemetics during pregnancy. Women with a low education used these drugs more often than women with a relatively higher education. Neonates born to women who used any of the antiemetics had a reduced risk for low birthweight, prematurity, being small-for-gestational age, and having a malformation. No specific differences were observed with respect to the outcome following a comparison of different antiemetic drugs. Conclusions: Women using antiemetics as a rule have a better delivery outcome than other women, probably due to an effect of a well-functioning placenta, which is associated with NVP. There were no signs of any significant teratogenicity of the drugs studied, but for some drugs the number of exposures was low...|$|E
