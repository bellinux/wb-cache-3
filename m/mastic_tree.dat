25|$|Chewing gum in {{many forms}} has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, {{has been found in}} Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is {{believed}} to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Aztec, as well as the ancient Maya before them, used chicle, a natural tree gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gums were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree.</b> Mastic gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and {{is believed to have been}} used to maintain oral health. Both chicle and mastic are tree resins. Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.|$|E

It has a small extension (1.3 ha). It, along the oak adehesado Tocina, the only witness to the climax vegetation of the area, i.e. the primitive vegetation, still undisturbed by man. Conservation over time of this stain of vegetation has occurred due to the slope makes it impracticable for cultivation.However, the Monte Beneguillas is a place frequented by residents of the environment {{as a place of}} leisure, recreation and outdoor recreation, a fact that sometimes generates dirt and attacks on the vegetation of this area of great ecological value.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} of mastika usually starts with an alcoholic base made from fermented fruit (usually grapes), which is double distilled and then {{filtered through the}} roots of the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree.</b> The alcohol can also be flavoured with the resin of the tree to give the alcoholic drink its distinctive pine-like taste.|$|E

5000|$|Chios Mastiha is {{a variant}} of mastic which has a {{protected}} designation of origin status in the European Union. [...] The main flavourings used in Chios Mastiha liqueur, mastic distillate and mastic oil, are wholly derived from PDO-certified Chios mastic.Mastic is harvested from the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistachia lentiscus var. chia), a small evergreen shrub that grows to about two to three meters on rocky terrain on {{the southern part of the}} island of Chios. This tree takes fifty years to reach maturity, and can be harvested for mastic from its fifth year onwards. Although the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> can be found around the Mediterranean Sea, the variety that produces the aromatic mastic sap only grows in the southern part of Chios. Chios mastic has also been certified by the Agricultural Products Certification and Supervision Organization as part of the Hellenic Ministry of Rural Development and Food.|$|E
5000|$|Mastic (Μαστίχα) is a resin {{obtained}} from the <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistacia lentiscus).

In Greece, it is known as the [...] "tears of Chios," [...] being traditionally produced on that Greek island, and, like other natural resins, is produced in [...] "tears" [...] or droplets.|$|E
50|$|Mastic is {{a natural}} resin that runs down when a <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> (Pistacia lentiscus) is cut. Originally mastic is sun-dried into pieces of brittle, {{resulting}} in producing translucent resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a bright natural white and opaque gummy substance. The flavour is bitter at first, but after some chewing, it releases a refreshing, Mediterranean-maple-syrup-like flavour, however it has a stickier texture than maple syrup.|$|E

The Anacardiaceae include numerous genera, several of which are economically important, notably cashew (in the type genus Anacardium), mango, poison ivy, sumac, smoke tree, marula, yellow mombin, and cuachalalate.

Where sand accumulates there is a mosaic of vegetation types including patches of Thymeleae muicrophila, Aristida pungens, Retama retam, and of tamarisks Tamarix spp. In depressions the vegetation includes a scrub consisting of the Mount Atlas <b>mastic</b> <b>tree</b> Pistacia atlantica, Ziziphus lotus, Asterichus graveolens and mallows Malva spp.|$|E
50|$|The park's main {{attraction}} is its pristine, unspoiled beauty; gently rolling limestone hills clad in natural Mediterranean vegetation of underbrush (Sarcopoterium), oak <b>trees</b> (Quercus ssp.), <b>mastic</b> <b>trees</b> (Pistacia lentiscus), carobs (Ceratonia siliqua) and buckthorns (Rhamnus lycioides), including seasonal flowers endemic to the Land of Israel (anemones, cyclamens, almond blossoms and asphodels), all within the purlieu of Jerusalem. The hills are interspersed with low-lying riverine brooks. A {{section of the}} park has been planted with pine forests by early Jewish immigrants who settled in the Lachish region at {{the founding of the}} State. The park is replete with a picnic area, a lookout point and marked trails for hikers and bikers. The main bike trail, known as the Kanim Single Track, is made {{in the form of a}} loop and extends to a full 23-kilometers, traversing the park from west to east, and is suitable for experienced cyclists with a moderate level of technical ability. The other bike trail is known as the Illegal Resident's Trail. Within the confines of the park are four principal archaeological sites of historical importance: Adullam, Hurvat Itri, Ḥurvat Burjin (Burgin ruins) and Ḥurvat Madras (Midras ruins), including two lesser known archaeological sites, Ḥurvat Kanim and Ḥurvat Rebbo, and the Adullam Grove Nature Reserve. Remnants of other ancient settlements are known to dot the hilltop landscape. The park is run jointly by the Jewish National Fund (JNF - KKL), the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) and the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), and has a visitors' center with guided tours run by the Kfar Etzion Field School. The park also caters to limited agricultural needs, such as in viniculture.|$|R
5000|$|Çeşme {{district}} has one depending township with own municipal administration, Alaçatı, where tourism is an equally important driving force as the district center area and which offers its own arguments for attracting visitors, {{as well as}} four villages: Ildırı on the coast towards the north, which is notable for being the location of ancient Erythrae, and three others which are more in the background, in terms both of their geographical location and renown: Germiyan, Karaköy and Ovacık, where agriculture and livestock breeding still forms {{the backbone of the}} economy. Some andesite, lime and marble is also being quarried in Çeşme area, while the share of industrial activities in the economy remains negligible. In terms of livestock, an ovine breed known as [...] "Sakız koyunu" [...] in Turkish (translatable literally as [...] "Chios Sheep"), more probably a crossbreeding between that island's sheep and breeds from Anatolia, is considered in Turkey as native to Çeşme region where it yields the highest levels of productivity in terms of their meat, their milk, their fleece and the number of lambs they produce. Preparations such as jam, ice cream and desserts, and even sauces for fish preparations, based on the distinctively flavored resin of the tree pistachia lentiscus from which it is harvested, are among nationally known culinary specialties of Çeşme. The adjacent Greek island of Chios (sakız in Turkish is the name for both Chios and mastic resin) is the source of mastic resin. Some efforts to produce mastic resin (in Greek mastiche, μαστίχη) in Çeşme, where climate conditions are similar, but they failed to produce the aromatic mastiche. A number of efforts are being made to rehabilitate the potential presented by the <b>mastic</b> <b>trees</b> that presently grow in the wilderness, and {{to increase the number of}} cultivated trees, especially those planted by secondary-residence owners who grow them as a hobby activity. The fish is also abundant both in variety and quantity along Çeşme district's coastline.|$|R
50|$|In {{the upper}} area the {{landscape}} {{is set in a}} land once cultivated in rows and in an ancient Mediterranean forest. Native oak (Quercus sp.) dominates above in the shrub habitats. In the woodlands, Aleppo pine, <b>mastic,</b> viburnum, strawberry <b>tree</b> (Arbutus unedo)s, and other species predominate. Each has a habitat niche in which it thrives and flourishes.Fauna large and small is in this natural area. The rare butterfly Charaxes jasius feeds only on the leaves of strawberry trees. The hoopoe and a host of various other birds are heard, but rarely seen. Tracks of fox and boar occur.|$|R
