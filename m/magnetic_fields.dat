It is shown that {{the frequency of the}} excitation <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> has a great effect on the controllability of the MR fluid damper. As the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> frequency increases, the controllability of the MR fluid damper significantly reduces. There is a maximum frequency of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for a given <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength or a minimum strength of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for a given <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> frequency to make the dynamic behavior of the MR damper be controllable. When the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> frequency is over the maximum one or the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength is less than the minimum one, the controllability of the MR fluid damper almost completely disappears and the dynamic behavior of the MR fluid damper with the sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is the same as that without the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R

In the non-magnetized case the radial component of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at the exobase is zero which limits the escape of ions along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines.
