5|$|Project Cirrus was {{the first}} attempt to <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> hurricane. It was a {{collaboration}} of the General Electric Corporation, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research, and the US Air Force. After several preparations, and initial skepticism by government scientists, the first attempt to <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> hurricane began on October 13, 1947 on a hurricane that was heading west to east and out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|In October 1951, in {{anticipation}} of a major build-up of the USAF to 95 groups, and of delays in the B-47 program, the Air Materiel Command was ordered to <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> further 180 B-29s then in storage to carry the Mark 4, Mark 5, Mark 6, and Mark 8 nuclear bombs. Modifications were carried out in Oklahoma City and Sacramento. By the time the aircraft were all delivered in September 1953, the B-29 was being phased out, and the modified aircraft went back into storage without seeing further service.|$|E

5000|$|A {{specific}} type of disjunct is the [...] (or sentence adverbial), which <b>modifies</b> <b>a</b> sentence, or a clause within a sentence, to convey the mood, attitude or sentiments of the speaker, rather than <b>an</b> adverb <b>modifying</b> <b>a</b> verb, an adjective or another adverb within a sentence.|$|R
5|$|Of the 240 {{people killed}} during the storm, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway. The {{hurricane}} {{eventually led to the}} end of pineapple production in the Florida Keys for commercial purposes in 1915, although this was amplified by two further hurricanes in the following years. In 1947, Project Cirrus, a collaboration of the United States Air Force, attempted to <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> hurricane; however, the seeded storm made a sudden re-curvature and came ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. As a result, several lawsuits were filed, although they were denied after the path of this storm was revealed to have been similar to the 1906 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court (OSC) is {{the highest}} state court in the U.S. state of Oregon. The only court that may reverse or <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> {{decision}} of the Oregon Supreme Court is the Supreme Court of the United States. The OSC holds court at the Oregon Supreme Court Building in Salem, Oregon, near the capitol building on State Street. The building was finished in 1914 and also houses the state's law library, while the courtroom is also used by the Oregon Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The LT vz. 34, {{formally}} {{designated as}} Lehký Tank vzor 34 ("Light Tank Model 34") was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Slovakia during World War II. Its suspension {{was based on}} that of the Carden-Loyd tankette, of which the Czechs had purchased three, plus a manufacturing license, in 1930. Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tančík vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided {{that it would be}} easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> tankette's chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936, of which the Germans captured 22 - including the prototype, when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939, but they promptly scrapped them. The Slovaks seized the remaining 27 (18 + 9 nine LT vz. 34 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Prešov.) when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. In Slovak service it only saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

25|$|Inflection is {{the process}} of adding inflectional morphemes that <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> verb's tense or a noun's number, rarely {{affecting}} the word's meaning or class. Examples of applying inflectional morphemes to words are adding -s to the root dog to form dogs and adding -ed to wait to form waited. In English, there are eight inflections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{phases of the}} {{replacement}} project, four design options were identified: purchase a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design, <b>modify</b> <b>a</b> MOTS design for Australian conditions, design an evolution of the Collins-class, or create a new design. Nuclear propulsion has been ruled out {{due to the lack}} of an indigenous nuclear industry in Australia and public opposition to nuclear technology.|$|E

They are often duplicated to indicate a superlative and can even be modified like verbs, mainly by the lack of a copula to link the object and adjective/adverb. Adjectives come after the noun.|$|E
