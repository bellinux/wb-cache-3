40|$|Extremely intense bubble plumes, {{like the}} North Sea 22 / 4 b blowout <b>megaplume</b> (defined {{as more than}} 10 (6) L day(- 1)), create very strong {{upwelling}} flows (> 1 m s(- 1)), which lead to detrainment of methane-enriched water, but leave direct bubble-mediated transport unaffected. Dissolved CH 4 depth profiles and atmospheric measurements during a fall 2011 survey of the 22 / 4 b site suggest strong constraint of seabed CH 4 below the thermocline. Seabed bubbles were nearly pure CH 4. The effect of the upwelling flow {{on the fate of}} bubble plume CH 4 was investigated with a numerical bubble-propagation model. The model considered different representative bubble plume size distributions, phi, and a global (total) <b>megaplume</b> bubble size distribution, Phi, synthesized from video survey data and phi from the literature. Simulations showed that none of the literature plumes or variations in the upwelling flow could constrain CH 4 sufficiently below the thermocline. Two new bubble <b>megaplume</b> processes were simulated, vortical bubble trapping (slow rise) and a hypothesized, enhanced bubble gas exchange, k(BE), an enhancement factor applied to the normal bubble gas exchange rate, k(B). The latter could arise from plume turbulence increasing bubble boundary-layer turbulence and thus its gas exchange. Observations could not be reproduced solely by slow rise, however, simulations with k(BE) similar to 6 reproduced observational constraints, as could weaker k(BE) in conjunction with slow rise. Field validation of k(BE) is needed given its implications for the fate of <b>megaplume</b> CH 4 emissions (anthropogenic or natural) for stratified and unstratified conditions. kBE suggests marine CH 4 geologic contributions to the atmosphere from all but shallow waters primarily arises from bubble plumes that are less than <b>megaplume</b> size...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the large slow region in the mantle beneath the central Pacific, identified in some early work (3) and observed in all tomographic models, is related to a <b>megaplume</b> generated by thermal boundary layer instabilities at the CMB (17). The large negative amplitude we infer in this region could be in part related to partial melt, as {{has been proposed}} to explain the ultralow velocities ob-served {{in some parts of}} this region (18). Some chemical heterogeneity, possibly involving core material, may be present as well (19). Our forward modeling predicts that the base of this possible upwelling is rather wide and that the plume narrows as it extends into the lowe...|$|E
40|$|The Institute of Atmospheric Physics of DLR {{has participated}} {{in recent years in}} several field {{experiments}} on the vertical aerosol distribution, aerosol radiative effects and long-range transport of aerosol particles. For all experiments, the DLR Falcon 20 was used. The research aircraft was equipped with extensive aerosol microphysical and optical instrumentation, trace gas instrumentation and a nadir-looking multiple-wavelength aerosol lidar. Respective field experiments are the Lindenberg Aerosol Characterisation Experiment LACE in 1998, the experiment on Intercontinental Transport of Ozone and Precursors ITOP in 2004 and the recent studies <b>MEGAPLUME</b> and Saharan Mineral Dust Experiment SAMUM in 2006. Various aerosol types have been investigated during these experiments, such as continental boundary layer aerosol at summer conditions (LACE 98), elevated forest fire smoke plumes from Northern America (LACE 98, ITOP 2004), marine boundary layer aerosol (ITOP 2004), Saharan dust near the source and in the long-range transport regime (SAMUM 2006) urban pollution plumes from North America (ITOP 2004) and Asian pollution plumes (<b>MEGAPLUME</b> 2006) after long-range transport. The experience gained from these field studies covers flight patterns dedicated for remote sensing validation studies, closure studies for aerosol optical properties which use information from the aerosol lidar, a sun photometer and aerosol microphysics, and studies on the vertical distribution of aerosol particles for various aerosol types. Lessons learned concentrate on the requirements for flight patterns, approaches for the determination of aerosol optical properties like the extinction coefficient which are required for closure studies, and requirements concerning the altitude range which should be covered by a research aircraft during satellite validation experiments. The LACE 98 results demonstrated a very good agreement of aerosol optical depths from sun photometry and from aerosol in-situ size-distributions when the scattering coefficient is calculated from the measured size distributions, while the direct measurement of the scattering coefficient by a Nephelometer suffers from inlet problems. The achieved agreement for values calculated from size distributions was better than 30...|$|E
50|$|The first {{documented}} eruption on the Juan de Fuca Ridge {{took place}} on the Cleft segment in 1986 and 1987. Hydrothermal <b>megaplumes</b> indicated a large rifting event, releasing hydrothermal fluids as a result of lavas being extruded from a dike. A majority of the eruptions along the ridge are dike injection events, where molten rock is extruded between cracks in the crust's sheeted dike layer. Typically eruptive events can be predicted, as they are preceded by large earthquake swarms in the region.|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{attenuation}} tomography is used {{to identify}} a region {{at the top of}} the lower mantle that displays very high attenuation and is likely a result of elevated water content. The tomography consists of an inversion of more than 80, 000 shear wave differential travel time and attenuation measurements for a 3 D whole-mantle model of shear-wave velocity and Qµ. The global pattern of high and low-attenuation values is dominated by the locations of subduction and of the Pacific and African <b>megaplumes.</b> However, the largest low-Qµ. anomaly occurs {{at the top of the}} lower mantle along the east coast of Asia, just above the signature of the subducted oceanic lithosphere. Seismic velocities show only a modest decrease in this region, suggesting that an increase in water is the best explanation for the anomaly. The subducting lithosphere beneath the eastern coast of Asia should remain cold enough well into the lower mantle to carry dense hydrous mineral phase D there in a stable manner. We propose that significant amounts of water are being pumped into the top of the lower mantle beneath Asia via hydrous phase D within subducting Pacific oceanic lithosphere. ...|$|R
40|$|Venus, Earth, and Mars have {{surfaces}} {{that display}} topographic domes and depressions with quasi-circular planimetric shapes, relief of 0 to several km, and large spatial scales (10 (exp 2) to 10 (exp 4) km). Our morphostructural mapping reveals hierarchical arrangements of these features. They are explained by {{a model of}} long-acting mantle convection, as a particular case of convection in a stratified and random inhomogeneous medium, which develops {{the form of a}} hierarchy of different convective pattern scales, each arising from different levels in the mantle. The hypothesis of transmantle flux tectonics parsimoniously explains a diversity of seemingly unrelated terrestrial planetary phenomena, including Earth <b>megaplumes,</b> global resurfacing epochs on Venus, and cyclic ocean formation and global climate change for Mars. All these phenomenon are hypothesized to be parsimoniously explained by a process of transmantle flux tectonics in which long-acting mantle convection generates stresses in blocks of planetary lithosphere to produce distinctive quasi-circular global-hierarchical morphostructure (QGM) patterns. Transmantle flux tectonics differs from plume tectonics in that individual plumes are not considered in isolation. Rather, a wholly interactive process is envisioned in which various spatial and temporal scales of convection operate contemporaneously and hierarchically within other scales. This process of continual change by hierarchical convective cells affects the surface at varying temporal and spatial scales, and its effects are discernable through their relic geological manifestations, the QGM patterns...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur dioxide {{pollution}} plumes {{have been}} investigated in the free troposphere onboard a research aircraft, using Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS). The measurements {{have been carried out}} during the <b>MEGAPLUME</b> campaign in spring 2006 at the German Aerospace Center (DLR, Oberpfa enhofen, Germany), and during the international African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) campaign in August 2006 inWest Africa (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso). Sulfur dioxide is an important precursor gas of sulfuric acid which strongly contributes to aerosol formation. Aerosol particles directly and indirectly a ect our climate in various ways. Two di erent pollution plumes will be discussed in this work: a plume from Southeast Asia that had reached Europe after crossing the Paci c and Atlantic ocean, and an extended biomass burning layer o the coast of Ghana. The upward transport of sulfur dioxide in large convective thunderstorms during the African Monsoon has been investigated as another part of the AMMA campaign...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{over thirty}} years of plate tectonic theory, the reasons why supercontinents like Gondwana {{disintegrate}} into smaller continents and disperse remain enigmatic. Current ideas mostly involve changes in plate-boundary driving forces (passive mantle hypothesis) in preference to an active plume mechanism, even though mantle plumes were present at most stages of Gondwana breakup. The role of these plumes in the breakup process is uncertain, and ideas vary from the chance unroofing of a pre-existing plume, which only contributed {{in the production of}} extensive flood basalts, to plumes that controlled the position of breakup. The magmatic and tectonic record along the proto-Pacific margin of Gondwana indicates that there were important changes in subduction zone forces during the initial stages of Gondwana breakup. However, the absence of subduction along the Neotethyan margin at the time of breakup, together {{with the fact that the}} initial rift formed almost at right angles to the active subducting margin, suggest a potential active role for a mantle plume in the initial separation. An active mantle mechanism, involving a very large thermal disturbance or <b>megaplume,</b> may, in contrast to a passive mantle hypothesis, more readily explain the formation and rotation of microplates in the South Atlantic region. It accounts also for the production of unusually large igneous provinces (Chon Aike province in Patagonia, Karoo province in southern Africa, and Ferrar province in Antarctica) just prior to breakup...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} lineations {{discovered by}} MGS (Mars Global Surveyor) {{have been considered}} to be evidence of early plate tectonics on Mars. However, the lineations approximately follow lines of latitude, i. e., small circles. This presents significant geometrical problems for plate-like spreading, particularly at high latitudes. However, the sublatitudinal orientation of the lineations is consistent with meridianal extension and perhaps limited crustal spreading due to a stress event centered near the geographic pole. We hypothesize that this event was the early formation of the crustal dichotomy through mantle-convective processes. This could have taken {{the form of a}} southern <b>megaplume</b> that formed the thick highlands crust or as subduction or downwelling in the north. Both would result in tensional stresses in the south that would form extensional fractures perpendicular to the CM-CF (center-of-mass/center-of-gravity) offset. The observed magnitude and distribution of magnetization indicates that crustal intrusion associated with this major mantle-convective event resulted in approximately 1000 km of extension in the Southern highlands. Subsequent spin-axis reorientation due to loss of crust in the north or gain of crust in the south brought the CM-CF offset into its present N-S alignment. A portion of the ancient valley networks observed in the southern highlands are spatially associated with crustal magnetism and are quantitatively shown to be consistent with hydrothermal discharge over crustal intrusions...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{research}} by numerous geologists and geo- physicists, {{the age and}} origin of the martian crustal dichotomy remain uncertain. Models for {{the origin of this}} dichotomy involve single or multiple impact, mantle <b>megaplumes,</b> primordial crustal asymmetry, and plate tectonics. Most of these models imply a Noachian age for the dichotomy. A major problem common to all genetic models is the difficulty separating the features resulting from the primary cause for the dichotomy from features due to younger fault- ing, impact cratering, volcanism, deposition, and erosion. highlands (the dichotomy boundary) approximates a small circle that ranges in latitude from about - 10 deg. in Elysium Planitia to about + 45 deg. north of Arabia Terra. For much of its length the boundary is characterized by relatively steep scarps separating highland plateau to the south from lowland plains to the north, generally with a complex transition zone on the lowland side of these scarps. These scarps are almost certainly due to normal faulting. The type fretted terrain, which defines the boundary in north-central Arabia Terra, also is characterized by scarps but has under- gone a more complex history of faulting and dissection [13]. In some places, notably in the Acidalia Planitia region, the dichotomy boundary is gradational. In the Tharsis region the boundary is obscured by younger volcanics...|$|R
40|$|The Mantle {{region of}} the Earth’s {{interior}} was mapped and put into a tabular form of data entitled the “Scripps 3 -D Mantle Model”. I then used thes e data tables (representing seismic velocity perturbations from a 1 -D Mantle Model) {{in order to create}} 3 -dimensional visual images of the Mantle maps in the animation program MAYA. The velocity perturbation plots are good indicators of temperature variation and phases of Mantle material, and are thus useful in revealing the locations of hot bouyant <b>megaplumes</b> and cold dense subducted material. While previous visualizations of Mantle maps only displayed twodimensional images of these three-dimensional Mantle structures, the three-dimensional animations provide a clearer picture of the size, location, and connections between the segments of major Mantle structures and could therefore facilitate the study of Mantle maps. Thus by creating these types of animations we define, in clearer detail, the internal structure of the Earth, and get clues to how the Mantle is mixing. The study of how the Mantle is convecting has persisted for over three decades and has become a source of ongoing debate between geochemists and mineral physicists who support a theory of Layered Mantle Convection, and seismologists and geodynamicists whose rebuttal is the theory of Whole Mantle Convection. Some of the 3 -D visual images I created in the visualization lab favor the latter theory in tha...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) varies in a systematic way with {{the age of the}} last major tectonothermal event in the overlying crust. This secular evolution in SCLM composition implies quasi-contemporaneous formation (or modification) of the crust and its underlying mantle root, and indicates that crust and mantle in many cases have remained linked through their subsequent history. Archean SCLM is distinctively different from younger mantle; it is highly depleted, commonly is strongly stratified, and contains rock types (especially subcalcic harzburgites) that are essentially absent in younger SCLM. Some, but not all, Archean SCLM also has higher Si/Mg than younger SCLM. Attempts to explain the formation of Archean SCLM by reference to Uniformitarian processes, such as the subduction of oceanic mantle (“lithospheric stacking”), founder on the marked differences in geochemical trends between Archean xenolith suites and Phanerozoic examples of highly depleted mantle, such as abyssal peridotites, island-arc xenolith suites and ophiolites. In Archean xenolith suites, positive correlations between Fe, Cr and Al imply that no Cr–Al phase (i. e. spinel or garnet) was present on the liquidus during the melting. This situation is in direct contrast to the geochemical patterns observed in highly depleted peridotites from modern environments, which are controlled by the presence of spinel during melting. It is more likely that Archean SCLM represents residues and/or cumulates from high-degree melting at significant depths, related to specifically Archean processes involving major mantle overturns or <b>megaplumes.</b> The preservation of island-arc like SCLM at shallow levels in some sections (e. g.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the intraplate {{volcanism}} in the Calatrava Volcanic Province (CVP) is controversial. On {{the basis of its}} geochemical signature, it has been ascribed to an “aborted ” rift, implying lithospheric thinning. However, the volcanism occurred during the generalized Cenozoic NW−SE-oriented compressive tectonic regime. On the other hand, on the basis of evidence for its deep-seated origin, it has been linked to the existence of a baby-plume detached from an active <b>megaplume</b> below the Canary-Azores Islands and the western Mediterranean. In order to understand better the aforementioned geodynamic scenarios for the {{origin of the}} CVP, we address here the study of the lithosphere in the CVP and its vicinity by means of gravity analysis and 2 + 1 / 2 D modeling. Gravity modeling results do not support the rifting model adopted for the intraplate volcanism occurred in the CVP because the crust shows a quasi-constant thickness. Density models suggest the existence of a sub-crustal, anomalous low-density block that could be underplated magmatic material {{at the base of the}} crust, suggesting that only a minor part of it intruded up into the crust and erupted. The localized magmatism of the CVP can be related to the combination of two factors: active, the gentle folding of the Iberian lithosphere and associated uplifting of the Variscan basement due to the NW-directed transmission of compressive stresses in the upper plate yielded by the subduction/collision in the south Iberian margin. The formation of the lithospheric folding in the Calatrava region results in a decrease of the pressure beneath the swell of the antiform that is likely to bring about basaltic mag...|$|E
40|$|The high-​grade gneiss {{complex of}} the Satnur-​Halagur-​Sivasamudram area in {{southern}} Karnataka forms {{a part of}} amphibolite-​granulite facies transition zone of southern India. The major lithologies are metasediments (quartzites-​pelites-​BIF-​Mn-​horizons) ​, amphibolite facies gneisses, foliated charnockites, mafic granulites, granite sheets (Closepet-​type) ​. All these lithologies show a prominent N-​S fabric which {{appears to have been}} produced during late Archaean shear deformation. Rb-​Sr whole rock isochron and U-​Pb zircon and monazite ages suggest that much of the crust accreted during 2. 96 Ga magmatic event followed by the 2. 5 Ga granulite facies metamorphism; the occurrence of a previous high-​grade metamorphism close to 2. 9 Ga remains debatable. Both gneisses and foliated charnockites show similar chem. characteristics except in LIL elements, which appear to have been disturbed during granulite metamorphism. Low Mg#(0. 18 -​ 0. 27) ​, low content of HFS elements (Ti, Nb, Ta, Hf and Y) and strongly fractionated REE patterns with HREE depletion suggest that magmatic history of the gneisses and charnockites are similar to the classical Archaean trondhjemite, tonalite, granodiorite suites (TTG) ​. The geodynamic evolution of the Satnur-​Halagur-​Sivasamudram area implies a change in the thermal structure and melting conditions of lithosphere from 3. 0 to 2. 5 Ga. Following the model of Martin (1987) ​, the magmatic protoliths of gneisses and charnockites could have been generated in an accretion zone (subduction-​mantle plume) ​ 2. 9 Ga ago, where young oceanic crust melted before dehydration. Granulite facies metamorphism occurred during latest Archaean: synchronous mantle derived melts tapped into mid-​crustal levels along a major shear-​zone where they induced migmatization (Closepet-​type batholith; Jayananda et al. 1994) immediately followed by granulite metamorphism, related to a possible 2. 5 Ga old <b>megaplume</b> (Peucat et al. 1993 b) ​...|$|E
40|$|The Abitibi greenstone belt is a volcanic-plutonic {{dominated}} subprovince of the Archean Superior structural province. In {{the southern}} volcanic zone (SVZ) of the Abitibi greenstone belt, there are numerous, well preserved, komatiite-tholeiite sequences in fault-bounded tectonostratigraphic terranes, or "assemblages". Volcanism commenced at 2750 Ma and terminated at ∼ 2700 Ma. New analyses of relatively fresh komatiites by ICP-MS from the classical Pyke Hill locality for spinifex textured komatiites, confirmed the Nb, LREE-depleted, Al-undepleted {{characteristics of the}} komatiites. The new analyses show positive Zr and Hf anomalies such that the Zr/Hf (∼ 30) ratios are less than the chondritic ratio of 36. The anomalies {{may be explained by}} a two stage melting model. Komatiite-tholeiite sequences in Tisdale Township, ∼ 80 km west of Pyke Hill include domains of carbonate-dominated alteration. Two compositional varieties of komatiite are present. Type 1 has flat REE patterns, and is Al-undepleted. Type 2 is LREE and HREE depleted, yielding concave up REE patterns, and is Al-depleted. Type 2 is more magnesian than type 1. Type 1 was derived from an undepleted, but type 2 from a depleted mantle source. Two different mantle sources are required for the komatiites, both different from the mantle source for Pyke Hill komatiites. Proximal to faults, komatiite-tholeiite sequences are intensely deformed and altered, and locally contain large gold deposits. Komatiites are of the Nb, LREE-depleted, Al-undepleted type, as at Pyke Hill, and also have positive Zr and Hf anomalies. Some komatiites show evidence of crustal contamination in the conjunction of La/Nb > 1, LREE enrichment, and negative P and Ti anomalies. Hence in the western Abitibi SVZ, distinct volcanic sequences were derived from separate mantle sources, and erupted variously through oceanic or continental crust, and were subsequently thrust together. Least altered komatiites in Whitney Township have smooth mantle normalized diagrams for Au and PGE. Komatiites have primary gold contents of 2 - 4 ppb [...] not gold rich relative to average crust. Altered komatiites have smooth PGE patterns but positive gold anomalies. Intensely altered komatiites in Whitney Township show unusual REE patterns, with relatively stable LREE and MREE, but HREE patterns that are smoothly depleted or concave down. The <b>megaplume</b> model for greenstone belts is not supported. Komatiites must have come from multiple plumes sampling different mantle sources, and coexisting basalts either from the same source as komatiites in some volcanic sequences, or from different mantle sources in other sequences.

40|$|The {{importance}} of surface temperature for mantle convection appears {{with the presence}} of adiabatic heating and cooling and the release and consumption of latent heat in the presence of phase transitions. For some planetary bodies these effects cannot be neglected. The dimensionless surface temperature T 0, which is the ratio between the temperature {{at the top of the}} convective region and the temperature drop across the mantle, is close to one for Mars and Venus. For the Earth, T 0 lies between 0. 2 and 0. 5. The dynamical influence of T 0 is especially poignant for internally heated convection with temperature-dependent viscosity. There is a tight coupling between the magnitude of the temperature field and the viscosity itself. We have studied temperature-dependent viscosity convection for both low-T 0 (0. 2) and high-T 0 (1. 2) situations and with internal heating in mantle convection with two upper-mantle phase transitions. Our results show that within this range of T 0 there exist two regimes for the evolution of upwellings in the mantle. In transient situations plume 9 ̆ 6 plume collisions lead to the formation of <b>megaplumes</b> for high-T 0 regimes but are less likely to do so for low T 0. In the long-term regime, plumes with low T 0 are prone to develop from the transition zone with a supply of hot material coming from the shallow lower mantle. In systems with high T 0, however, long-lived plumes tend to have deeper mantle origins. In quasi-layered situations high T 0 may act as a positive feed-back mechanism in inducing powerful hot upwellings into the upper mantle. Ó 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
