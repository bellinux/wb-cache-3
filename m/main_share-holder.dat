2500|$|In July 1991 the Mafia pentito (a mafioso turned {{informer}}) Francesco Marino Mannoia {{claimed that}} Roberto Calvi – nicknamed [...] "God's banker" [...] {{because he was}} in charge of Banco Ambrosiano, in which the Vatican Bank was the <b>main</b> <b>share-holder</b> – had been killed in 1982 because he had lost Mafia funds when the Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. According to Mannoia the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a mafioso living in London at the time, and the order to kill Calvi had come from Calò and Licio Gelli, the head of the secret Italian masonic lodge Propaganda Due. When Di Carlo became an informer in June 1996, he denied that he was the killer, but admitted that he had been approached by Calò to do the job. However, Di Carlo could not be reached in time, and when he later called Calò, the latter said that everything had been taken care of already.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Le Parisien alleged on 13 August 2007 {{that the}} {{agreement}} concerning nuclear technologies did not concern desalinization of sea water, but focused in particular on the ERP third-generation nuclear reactor, worth $3 billion. The Parisian newspaper cited Philippe Delaune, the deputy of {{the deputy director of}} international affairs of the CEA atomic agency. It is the <b>main</b> <b>share-holder</b> of Areva, the firm which products ERP reactors. Although the French President denied any relationship between the deal with Areva and the liberation of the six, Le Parisien points out a troubling chronology: Areva was called to present its products to Libya at the end of June 2007, a short time before the release of the six. The French Socialist Party, through the voice of Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was [...] "geopolitically irresponsible." [...] The German government also denounced the agreement. Through Siemens, they retain 34% of the shares of Areva's subsidiary in charge of building the ERP (Areva NP).|$|E

Auchi received a 15-month suspended sentence for his involvement in the Elf scandal, which the British newspaper called [...] "the biggest fraud inquiry in Europe since the Second World War", saying [...] "Elf became a private bank for its executives who spent £200 million on political favours, mistresses, jewellery, fine art, villas and apartments".

Perugia. In Perugia, he once again gained popularity among the local fans for his work-rate and immediate adjustment to the new environment, which {{proved to be a}} key-factor for Perugia's constant presence in the Serie A, under the management of Serse Cosmi.|$|E
5000|$|The French Residency {{is one of}} {{the last}} town houses built in Stockholm. It is named the [...] "Hôtel Broms" [...] or [...] "Bromska palatset" [...] and is located on Narvavägen 26. The house was built by Emil Broms, who was the <b>main</b> <b>share-holder</b> of mining {{companies}} in Gällivare (Northern Sweden). He had the house built for his family on a land he bought in the heart of the district of östermalm. The property was bought by the French state in 1921 and it officially became the Embassy of France in Sweden in 1947. While the different services have moved in 1997 to Kommendörsgatan 13, the Hôtel Broms is now the official residency of the French ambassador in Sweden.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 August 2007, the French {{newspaper}} Le Parisien {{alleged that}} the Franco-Libyan civil nuclear power agreement signed by President Nicolas Sarkozy did not concern desalinization of sea water, as claimed by the French government, but instead focused in particular on selling the EPR to Libya, a contract potentially worth $3 billion. [...] Le Parisien cited Philippe Delaune, deputy to {{the deputy director of}} international affairs for the CEA atomic agency, which is the <b>main</b> <b>share-holder</b> in Areva. [...] Following allegations that the deal had been related to the release of the Bulgarian nurses, the French Socialist Party, through the spokesperson Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was [...] "geopolitically irresponsible".

5000|$|In 1992 Gelli {{was sentenced}} to 18 years and six months of prison after being found guilty of fraud {{concerning}} the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 (a [...] "black hole" [...] of $1.4 billion was found). The Vatican bank, Istituto per le Opere di Religione, <b>main</b> <b>share-holder</b> of the Banco Ambrosiano, consequently had a [...] "black hole" [...] of $250 million. This sentence was reduced by the Court of Appeal to 12 years. The year 1992 also saw {{the beginning of the}} trial of 16 members of the P2 Masonic Lodge, which included charges of conspiracy against the state, espionage, and the revelation of state secrets. In April 1994 Gelli received a 17-year sentence for divulging state secrets and slandering the investigation, while the court threw out the charge that P2 members conspired against the state; Gelli's sentence was reduced, and he was placed under house arrest two years later.|$|E
