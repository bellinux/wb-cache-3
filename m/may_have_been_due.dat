5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries. In the west, this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> in part to the reliance of the British and Scandinavians on infantry-based warfare, where horses were only used for riding and pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{re-election}} {{was more}} difficult. In four months {{he had lost}} the temporary support of Thomas' allies in the General Assembly who had voted for him in 1818. He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E

5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald's {{period as}} {{archbishop}} {{coincided with the}} end of Wilfrid's long struggle to regain the Bishopric of York, and the two-year delay between Theodore's death and Berhtwald's election <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to climate change or human activity.|$|E

50|$|If {{the attack}} was indeed a case of {{retaliation}} it <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to Rǫgnvaldr's own involvement with enemies of the English Crown. The fleeing Briouzes were also accompanied by Hugh himself, but unlike them he managed to elude capture, and was temporarily harboured in Scotland by Ailín II, Earl of Lennox (died 1217). The Lacys' previous connections with Dublin and Ulster suggest that Hugh <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had supporters on Mann. In fact, his stay-over in Rǫgnvaldr's absence <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> enabled <b>due</b> to the fraternal discord between Rǫgnvaldr and Óláfr.|$|R
5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E
5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> partly <b>due</b> to the prejudice of the family, and partly {{to her own}} retiring nature.|$|R
5|$|In the end a {{total of}} 28 {{architectural}} firms registered their intent to submit entries to the competition—a lower number than expected, but Richardson suggests this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station. Out of those 28, {{a total of}} 26 firms submitted designs by the deadline. On 10 November 1924, before judging could be completed, the Richards Building in Currie Street was destroyed by fire, taking with it all 26 proposals.|$|E
5|$|Its {{large size}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, {{and it may have}} also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> {{to the use of}} short-term, seasonal field studies instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 1832, 55 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin; {{attendance}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> diminished <b>due</b> to {{the short}} notice. [...] The gathering {{marked the first time}} residents from each of the colonies had convened to discuss common goals.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, the Gemini was {{equipped}} with the 1.6-liter engine which produced [...] DIN there; the discrepancy in stated power (down 32 percent) <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> entirely <b>due</b> to the differences to the SAE (gross) measuring system used on Japanese market cars.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} other {{criminal}} politicians mentioned in the press, {{such as the new}} bandit queen Seema Parihar, wife of the slain dacoit Nirbhay Gujjar, do not appear on the candidate lists, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> removed <b>due</b> to irregularitiesin their nomination papers or otherwise.|$|R
5|$|Riley began sending poems to {{his brother}} again in February 1873. About {{the same time he}} and several friends began an {{advertisement}} company. The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance. The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the short duration of his job <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to his frequent drunkenness at that time.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
30|$|Lower {{agreement}} for pain management <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> <b>due</b> {{to lack of}} an agreed, standardised, objective pain assessment, particularly for non-communicative ICU patients, [36] leading to differences in responses (auditors indicated {{a higher rate of}} omissions). For audit data, one-fifth of compliant cases were not documented correctly or completely during the intervention, despite pain assessments taking place, an issue previously reported for Australian and New Zealand ICUs [4] and in emergency departments in the USA [37]. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> difficult for auditors to assess whether appropriate care was delivered. Similarly, minor discrepancies in concordance for sedation <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to lack of documentation by clinical staff [38 – 40]. Concordance with blood glucose management <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impacted by difficulties in maintaining levels within defined limits [41].|$|R
50|$|Another {{indication}} that the dam <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> diminished <b>due</b> to flooding, or an overflow, is that the dam, itself, did not contain high quantities of silt, implying that the dam {{did not last long}} enough for the river to leave an obvious residual fingerprint on it.|$|R
50|$|The {{sound of}} Aura can be {{described}} as radio-ready but the album failed to chart in the US and didn't perform well in Britain, reaching only No. 160. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> partly <b>due</b> to the label that went broke within a year of the album release.|$|R
5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>due</b> to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
50|$|This breed {{is not a}} true spaniel; its {{breeding}} and role differs quite a bit. (Spaniels are gun dogs.) The spaniel name <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given <b>due</b> to its resemblance to the bred-down lapdog versions of the hunting spaniels, such as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.|$|R
50|$|This {{leniency}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> partly <b>due</b> to doubts as to {{the legality}} of the demand for his surrender by the Hamburg authorities. Moreover, Napoleon vigorously intervened on his behalf and is even said to have made Tandy's release a condition of signing the Treaty of Amiens.|$|R
50|$|The name Nyo likely {{came about}} as an exonym {{that was later}} adopted as an endonym; the Lao Nyo did not {{actually}} originate from the ethnic Nyo of Isan and Laos. This exonym <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used <b>due</b> to the Lao Nyo's geographical origins or their language.|$|R
