40|$|Adulteration {{of olive}} oil using {{unhealthy}} substitutes is considered a threat for public health. Low-field (LF) proton (1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry and ultra-violet (UV) visible spectroscopy are used to detect adulteration {{of olive oil}}. Three different olive oil with different oleoyl acyl contents were mixed with almond, castor, corn, and sesame oils with three volumetric ratios, respectively. In addition, Arbequina olive oil was mixed with canola, flax, grape seed, peanut, soybean, and sunflower seed oils with three volumetric ratios. Transverse magnetization relaxation time (T 2) curves were fitted with bi-exponential decaying functions. T 2 times of each <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> and castor oils, and olive oils and corn oils changed systematically {{as a function of}} volumetric ratio. To detect the adulteration in the mixtures with almond and sesame oils, both LF 1 H NMR relaxometry and UV-Vis spectroscopy were needed, where UV-Vis-spectroscopy detected the adulteration qualitatively. In the mixtures of Arbequina olive oil and flax, peanut, soybean, and sunflower seed oils, both T 21 and T 22 values became longer systematically as the content of the olive oil was decreased. The unique UV-Vis maximum absorbance of flax oil at 320. 0 nm shows the adulteration of olive oil qualitatively...|$|E

40|$|Background: 2 -Deoxy-D-glucose (2 -DG), a {{structural}} analog of glucose {{is an effective}} inhibitor of glucose metabolism and ATP production. It selectively accumulates in cancer cells and interferes with glycolysis leading to cell death. 2 -DG is shown to differentially enhance the radiation-induced damage in cancer cells both under euoxic and hypoxic conditions. A combination of 2 -DG and ionizing radiation selectively destroys tumors while protecting the normal tissue. 2 -DG is being advocated as an adjuvant in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cancer. Objective: The present investigation focuses on the modulatory effect of 2 -DG on mitomycin C- (MMC) and 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 -NQO) -induced cytogenetic damage in bone marrow cells of Swiss albino mice in vivo. Materials and Methods: Experimental animals were pretreated with 2 -DG (500 mg/kg, i. p.) for five consecutive days followed by MMC (2 mg/kg, i. p) or 4 -NQO (15 mg/kg, i. p.), 24 h prior to sacrifice. Control animals were given either the <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and acetone (3 : 1) or distilled water. Bone marrow cells were processed for the micronucleus assay and metaphase analysis for estimating cytogenetic damage. Results: 2 -DG significantly (P < 0. 001) reduced the frequency of aberrant cells induced by MMC (~ 90 &#x 0025;) and 4 -NQO (~ 74 &#x 0025;).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the effect <b>of</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> phenolic compounds (PC) {{alone or in}} combination with thyme PC on blood lipid profile from hypercholesterolemic humans, and whether the changes generated are related with changes in gut microbiota populations and activities. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover human trial (n = 12) was carried out. Participants ingested 25 mL/day for 3 weeks, preceded by 2 -week washout periods, three raw virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> differing in the concentration and origin of PC: (1) a virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (OO) naturally containing 80 mg PC/kg, (VOO), (2) a PC-enriched virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> containing 500 mg PC/kg, from OO (FVOO), and (3) a PC-enriched virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> containing a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> 500 mg PC/kg from OO and thyme, 1 : 1 (FVOOT). Blood lipid values and faecal quantitative changes in microbial populations, short chain fatty acids, cholesterol microbial metabolites, bile acids, and phenolic metabolites were analysed. RESULTS: FVOOT decreased seric ox-LDL concentrations compared with pre-FVOOT, and increased numbers of bifidobacteria and the levels of the phenolic metabolite protocatechuic acid compared to VOO (P < 0. 05). FVOO {{did not lead to}} changes in blood lipid profile nor quantitative changes in the microbial populations analysed, but increased the coprostanone compared to FVOOT (P < 0. 05), and the levels of the faecal hydroxytyrosol and dihydroxyphenylacetic acids, compared with pre-intervention values and to VOO, respectively (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The ingestion of a PC-enriched virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> containing a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and thyme PC for 3 weeks, decreases blood ox-LDL in hypercholesterolemic humans. This cardio-protective effect could be mediated by the increases in populations of bifidobacteria together with increases in PC microbial metabolites with antioxidant activities.

U. Leuven, Naamsestraat 59, 3000 Leuven, Belgium Introduction Asthma {{is one of the most}} prevalent chronic airway diseases, characterized by reversible airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and non-specific airway hyperreactivity. Up to 15 % of all asthma cases in adults are due to chemical exposures at the workplace. Initially, the exposed workers do not show asthmatic symptoms but are getting sensitized. The identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we will explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein level. Methods On day 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with 0, 3 % toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a known respiratory sensitizer, 3 % TDI or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> acetone – <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (vehicle-control). On day 15 mice are sacrificed and auricular lymph nodes are collected and prepared for proteome analysis. In a second study, mice are sensitized with 0, 3 % TDI or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> acetone – <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> on day 1 and 8. On day 15, mice are oropharyngeally challenged with 0, 01 % TDI or acetone – <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> One day later, on day 16, lung function measurements are carried out to select responders from non-responders. The auricular lymph nodes of selected mice are subjected to proteome analysis. In both studies two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) was used to analyze the differential expression of proteins in the auricular lymph nodes of TDI (0, 3 % or 3 %) and vehicle-treated (control) mice. Results In the first study, three conditions were compared in one 2 D-DIGE analysis. In total, 35, 36 and 12 proteins were found differentially expressed between 0, 3 % TDI and control, 3 % TDI and control and 0, 3 % TDI and 3 % TDI respectively. Most proteins were significantly (p< 0, 05) downregulated in TDI treated mice. In the second study, (non-) responding mice were pre-selected based on lung function measurements. 36 proteins were found to be significantly (p < 0, 01) upregulated in 0, 3 % TDI treated mice (clear responders) and 18 proteins were downregulated. 21 proteins could already be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting.

40|$|Fatty liver can be {{produced}} in the rat by prolonged consumption of nutritionally ade-quate diets containing alcohol (1). The state of hepatic steatosis produced is highly de-pendent upon the level of fat in the diet (2). Prolonged consumption of liquid diets con-taming alcohol {{does not lead to}} significant hepatic lipid accumulation when the level of fat is 25 % or less of total calories (3). The chain length of the dietary fat is also important. Liver fat is elevated to similar extents by alcohol diets containing the con-ventional long-chain fats, linseed oil, coco-nut oil, or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> corn and <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> (2). However, feeding diets containing me-dium-chain triglycerides (MCT) in place of regular long-chain triglycerides (LCT) sub-stantially reduces hepatic fat accumulation (4).

A novel screening method using an automated flow injection electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry system is proposed for the simultaneous determination of five nonprotein amino acids (β-alanine, alloisoleucine, ornithine, citrulline, pyroglutamic acid) and three betaines (glycine betaine, trigonelline, proline betaine) after derivatization with butanolic HCl. MS/MS experiments were carried out in a triple-quadrupole instrument using multiple reaction monitoring mode in < 2 min. The proposed method provided high fingerprinting power to identify the presence of five of the studied compounds in different types of vegetable oils (soybean, sunflower, corn, olive) with LODs at parts per billion levels. The method was validated, and different <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with seed oils were analyzed, achieving the typification {{for the detection of}} adulterations in extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> up to 2 % w/w. The nonprotein amino acid ornithine was confirmed as a marker for adulteration in the <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> analyzedThe projects involved in this work have been: project CTQ 2009 - 09022 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Spain), project S 2009 /AGR- 1464 from the Comunidad Autónoma of Madrid (Spain) and European funding from FEDER programme (ANALISYC-II), and project CCG 10 -UAH/AGR- 5950 from the University of Alcalá and the Comunidad Autónoma of Madrid (Spai...|$|R
40|$|Studies on flavor {{profiles}} <b>of</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (VOO) {{are becoming}} more and more numerous. The VOO aromas are determined by a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> chemicals in <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> which influence its quality. Various studies around the world have shown that the volatile compounds in VOO depend on the climate, cultivation and process. The present work is a first approach to compare volatile profiles of VOO largely produced in astern of Morocco after 6 months of storage at ambient temperature in darkness. Oxidative stability measured by Rancimat method at 101 °C was also determined. VOO volatile profiles were examined using the solid-phase micro extraction fibre method (SPME) in conjunction with gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/ MS). 84 volatile compounds were identified; they belong to various chemical classes, such as aldehydes, alcohols, esters, ketones, carboxylic acids and hydrocarbons. The main volatile compounds present in <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> samples were compounds with 6 carbon atoms (C 6) such as Hexanal, (E) -hex- 2 -enal, Z- 3 -Hexen- 1 -ol and 1 -Hexanol. Ethanol and Z- 3, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 6 -octatriene, methyl acetate and ethyl acetate were also found. In general, these compounds have been identified in all VOO analyzed samples. The chemical compositions of the analyzed virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> headspaces evidenced that the most representative compounds In Isly and Kenine were carboxylic acids accounted for 59. 24 %- 49. 7 % respectively, whereas the volatile fraction of the oil from Achajara almoubaraka showed significantly higher amounts of the alcohols (46 %). Concerning oxidative stability, Isly and Kenine OO, have lower stability values compared to Achajara almoubaraka. Their potential oxidative susceptibility is therefore much higher than Achajara almoubaraka. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Up to 15 % of all asthma {{cases in}} adults {{are due to}} {{chemical}} exposures at the workplace. The identification of biomarkers of sensitization could help to move diagnosis to an earlier stage. Using a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma we will explore the process of sensitization towards chemicals at the protein and peptide level. Methods: On days 1 and 8, mice are treated on both ears with toluene diisocyanate (TDI, 0. 3 % or 3 %, 20 µl), a known respiratory sensitizer, or a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> acetone – <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (AOO, vehicle-control). On day 15, lymph nodes are collected and homogenized. We used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) to analyze the differential expression of proteins in TDI and vehicle-treated lymph nodes. Results: Body weight of control mice and TDI-treated mice did not differ. Interestingly, the weight of auricular lymph nodes significantly increased with an increasing concentration of TDI. 2 D-DIGE analysis of these lymph nodes showed 35, 36 and 12 differential proteins comparing 0. 3 % and AOO, 3 % TDI and AOO and 0. 3 % TDI and 3 % TDI respectively. 17 proteins are already identified, among which several structural proteins and lymphocyte specific protein- 1. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the use of 2 D-DIGE {{in the search for}} (early) biomarkers of chemical-induced asthma. Further studies will have to point out whether (some of) these proteins could act as valuable biomarkers. Therefore, more samples (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, serum,…) will be analysed. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Tribulus terrestris L (TT) {{is used in}} the Chinese {{medicine}} to treat various dermal disorders. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the anti psoriatic effect of TT. The mouse model of psoriasis was developed by sensitization with 100 µl of 1. 5 % oxazolone application on dorsal lumbar region for six days followed by elicitation with 20 µl of 1 % oxazolone applying on both sides of ear on day 7, 10 and 13. The first three groups of mice comprised as vehicle (<b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> acetone and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (4 : 1)) control, positive control (dermatitis induced by oxazolone) and treatment with dexamethazone at the dose level of 0. 1 % topical application on upper surface of the ear. Animals of another three groups were applied 0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 % of the T. terrestris extract on both the ears after induction of dermatitis by oxazolone. The ear of the positive control mice showed erythema, edema and/or indurations and occasionally abrasion. Oxazolone treatment of sensitized animals produced a significant increase in ear weight as compared normal control animals. A dose dependent decrease in ear weight was observed in TT treated groups. Gross macroscopic examination revealed a relatively swollen ear in the disease model as compared to the control animals. Histopathological examination of the ear belonging to the disease control revealed prominent epidermal hyperplasia and marked infiltration of inflammatory cells like monocytes, granulocytes, macrophages mainly into the dermis and some into epidermis. This investigation suggests that the protective effect of TT for oxazolone induced contact dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|The most {{abundant}} agro-food wastes in Puglia (Italy) are derived either from <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> production, e. g., olive pomace (OP) and olive mill wastewaters (OMW), or from diary activity, e. g., milk whey. All of these wastes have an acidic pH (3. 5 e 5. 5), high organic matter volatile solids, a (VS) higher than 50 g/L, and chemical substances such as total nitrogen (TN), total ammonia (TAN) and total phosphorous (TP), which {{are able to}} alter {{the properties of the}} soil and pollute aquifers in scenarios where they were released into the ground without any treatment. Two types of OP exist but have different chemical characteristics: OP from a two phase centrifugation (OPII) and OP from a three phase centrifugation (OPIII). These differ primarily in their water content, which is higher in OPIII, and in their polyphenol and ammonia content. In the present work, two <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> wastes from <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and dairy production were prepared and initially tested in a 50 L batch digester. Then, in a scaled up 2 m 3 anaerobic reactor a test in continuous mode was realized. Two feeds were tested: a first mixture containing OPII and a second mixture with OPIII. The tests were conducted in mesophilic conditions (35 C) with a total solid (TS) content of approximately 10 % w/w in continuous mode. The test including OPIII showed a productivity of 1. 23 LCH 4 / L d against 0. 83 LCH 4 /L d for the test with OPII, {{as a consequence of the}} higher organic content and the simultaneous effect of the minor inhibitory compound (ammonia and polyphenols) concentration in OPII...|$|R
