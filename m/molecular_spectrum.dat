25|$|Daily {{observations}} of color {{can be related}} to spectroscopy. Neon lighting is a direct application of atomic spectroscopy. Neon and other noble gases have characteristic emission frequencies (colors). Neon lamps use collision of electrons with the gas to excite these emissions. Inks, dyes and paints include chemical compounds selected for their spectral characteristics in order to generate specific colors and hues. A commonly encountered <b>molecular</b> <b>spectrum</b> is that of nitrogen dioxide. Gaseous nitrogen dioxide has a characteristic red absorption feature, and this gives air polluted with nitrogen dioxide a reddish-brown color. Rayleigh scattering is a spectroscopic scattering phenomenon that accounts for the color of the sky.|$|E

40|$|Germanium Fabry-Perot etalons are {{commonly}} used in diode laser spectroscopy to establish relative frequency calibration scales for molecular absorption spectra. Typically the channel spectrum of the etalon is recorded simultaneously with the <b>molecular</b> <b>spectrum</b> as the laser injection current is tuned linearly, and the etalon free spectral range (fringe spacing) is {{used to measure the}} frequency separations among lines in the <b>molecular</b> <b>spectrum.</b> For this purpose, the etalon free spectral range must be known for the measurement wavelength, and this in turn relies on knowledge of the etalon length and the dispersive index at this wavelength. It is pointed out that the most satisfactory approach is to measure directly the free spectral range or dispersive index of the etalon at the wavelength of interest.

The patient presented an early-onset, slowly progressive paraparesis associated with mild mental retardation. Neurological assessments included the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS), Mental Deterioration Battery (MDB), and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies. Targeted next-generation sequencing panels {{for the whole}} set of genes associated with HSP were performed in the probands and her relatives. Neuroimaging studies showed dorsal hydromyelia but no brain MRI abnormalities. Targeted next-generation identified two novel mutations: the c. 5 C > A/p.

40|$|Hemoglobinopathies (HBP) are {{the most}} common {{autosomal}} recessive genetic disorder in Oman. Carriers are usually asymptomatic but carrier couples are at 25 % risk of getting a severely affected child. Public health authorities have focused not only on state of the art management and patient care but also on prevention. The focus of this thesis is to study the <b>molecular</b> <b>spectrum</b> of HBP and the associated genetic determinants to work towards the development of prevention strategies for severe HBP’s in Oman. We have defined the <b>molecular</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the disease all around the country, including beta, alpha and delta globin gene mutations. Furthermore, genotype/phenotype correlation studies were investigated in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) by looking at determinants such as haplotype/sub-haplotype, alpha thalassemia and hydroxyurea response based on XmnI polymorphism. Identifying genetic determinants is necessary for prognostic purposes, accurate diagnosis and planning for the best tailored treatment to the affected patients. While providing tools for a better care and a better insight on the management of these severe diseases in Oman, the results from this thesis will help to facilitate the prevention of HBP in the country.
