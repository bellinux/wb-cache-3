Dry machining is inevitably the future trend in <b>machining</b> <b>industry.</b> In {{order to help}} dry machining methods be smoothly adapted by the industry, this paper provides an information model for cost and process of dry machining. New software tools and knowledge databases can be developed based on this model to help users to choose optimal process parameters, resources, and estimate machining time and cost. This model is in its early stage. Extension to this model is expected as dry machining technology advances. 1 Introduction Used coolant from machining processes is harmful to both environment and human health.

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of urbanization and industrialization in Chongqing, effect of heavy metals on brownfield {{has been paid}} more and more attention. 8 brownfields in steel industry, 15 brownfields in chemical industry, 18 brownfields in <b>machining</b> <b>industry</b> and 7 brownfields in pharmaceutical industry were selected as research objects, and eight heavy metals including mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), arsenic (Ar), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) in soil were analyzed. Single factor pollution index (SFPI) and integral pollution index (IPI) {{was used to assess}} the pollution degree of these sites. The comprehensive results showed that the brownfields in the 4 studied industries had been affected by the heavy metals which produced in industrial activities. <b>Machining</b> <b>industry</b> had the greatest impact on the brownfield in Chongqing, also, the effect of chemical industry and steel industry to the soil were tremendous.

40|$|There is an {{increase}} in awareness about sustainable manufacturing process. Manufacturing industries are backbone of a country’s economy. Although it is important but there is a great concern about consumption of resources and waste creation. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} explore sustainability concern in turning process in an Indian <b>machining</b> <b>industry.</b> The effect of cutting parameters, Speed/Feed/Depth of Cut, the machining environment, Dry/MQL/Wet, and the type of cutting tool on sustainability factors under study were observed. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse the data obtained from experimentation in a small scale <b>machining</b> <b>industry.</b> The process is modelled mathematically using response surface methodology (RSM). The economic and environmental aspect like surface roughness, material removal rate and energy consumption were considered as sustainability factors. The model helps to understand the effect of the cutting parameters and conditions on surface finish, energy consumption, and material removal rate. The process was optimized for minimum power consumption considering environmental concern as prime importance. Studies suggest that the cutting environment and tool type influenced on the power consumption during turning process. Extended form of the proposed model could be useful to predict the environmental impact due to machining process, which would bring environmental concern into conventional machining...|$|E
