40|$|Male Indian Flying Foxes (Pteropus giganteus) that spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{performing}} {{oral sex}} on a female also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating with her. In humans, men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating with their regular partner also perform more “semen-displacing” copulatory behaviors (e. g., deeper, more vigorous penile thrusting). We investigated whether men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> performing oral sex on their regular partner also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating {{with her and}} perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors. We proposed and tested the ejaculate adjustment hypothesis for men's copulatory behaviors: Men adjust their copulatory behaviors to increase their sexual arousal and consequent ejaculate quality, thereby increasing their chances of success in sperm competition. Two hundred and thirty-three men in a committed, heterosexual relationship responded to questions about their copulatory behavior and sexual arousal during their most recent sexual encounter with their long-term partner. The results indicated that men who spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> performing oral sex on their partner also spend <b>more</b> <b>time</b> copulating with her, perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors, and report greater sexual arousal. We discuss limitations to the current research and highlight the heuristic value of sperm competition theory for understanding human sexual behaviors...|$|R
