2500|$|Typically for a mega yacht, A is decorated, equipped, and staffed to an {{extremely}} opulent standard. [...] There is almost [...] of interior space, including [...] for the <b>master</b> <b>suite.</b> Starck, {{known for his}} occasionally risqué design choices, also added a secret [...] "nookie room" [...] hidden behind mirrored panels. Mirrored surfaces feature extensively throughout the interior, along with Baccarat crystal which is used {{not only for the}} glassware and tableware, but for the furniture too. There are six guest suites, although they have moving walls and can be converted to four larger staterooms. Much of the interior design was completed by Aleksandra Melnichenko who, as the owner's new wife, battled with designer Starck over features commissioned when her husband was still a bachelor. The original discothèque was down-sized, while the suites' decor was toned down, although she still featured leather or white stingray hides on the walls and ceilings, and crocodile-skinned furniture. Above-deck there is a helipad and swimming pool forward of the superstructure and two more pools aft, one of which is glass-bottomed and can be viewed from the below-deck disco.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{neighborhood}} fundraiser in May 1976, Mr. and Mrs. DeCaro resumed their extensive reconstruction. [...] The restoration returned the front elevation to its 1906 design yet retained most alterations {{made by the}} Hills towards the rear, including the enclosed porches and enlarged kitchen wing. [...] In cases where blueprints differed from historic photographs, the owners chose to follow Wright's plans. [...] For instance, the main chimney was known to have always been exposed brick, yet was stuccoed in the reconstruction per Wright's original plans. [...] Inside, some changes were made to accommodate the DeCaro's modern lifestyle. [...] On the main level, an updated kitchen replaced the breakfast room and pantry. [...] On the second floor, several walls were moved to widen the hallway {{and to create a}} <b>master</b> <b>suite</b> in place of two front bedrooms (see post-reconstruction plans at right). [...] On the third floor tight servants quarters were exchanged for a single bedroom suite. For their part in the restoration, the Oak Park Landmarks Commission voted in 1977 to rename the completed structure as the Hills-DeCaro House.|$|E
