40|$|In Australia trampolines {{contribute}} {{one quarter}} of all childhood play equipment injuries. The objective {{of this study was}} to gather and evaluate injury data from a non-traditional, ‘soft-edged’, consumer trampoline, where the design aimed to <b>minimise</b> <b>injuries</b> from the equipment and from falling off. The manufacturer of the non-traditional trampoline provided the University of Technology Sydney with their Australian customer database. The study involved surveys in Queensland and New South Wales, between May 2007 and March 2010. Initially injury data was gathered by a phone interview pilot study, then in the full study, through an email survey. The 3817 respondents were the carers of child users of the ‘soft-edge’ trampolines. Responses were compared with Australian and US emergency department data. In both countries the proportion of injuries caused by the equipment and falling off was compared with the proportion caused by the jumpers to themselves or each other. The comparisons showed a significantly lower proportion resulted from falling-off or hitting the equipment for this design when compared to traditional trampolines, both in Australia and the US. This research concludes that equipment-induced and falling-off injuries, the more severe injuries on traditional trampolines, can be significantly reduced with appropriate trampoline design...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} workforce in South Africa is {{one that}} is ageing. This is a global phenomenon and necessitates research into how the older cohort of the construction work force can be optimally engaged. Optimum worker productivity, high quality products that meet the specifications required, and high levels of occupational safety and health are integral factors in achieving a sustainable workforce. The purpose of the research was to quantify the injury rates among older construction workers as well as to determine the events leading to these injuries, the nature of the injuries and the bodily locations affected. The costs associated with these injuries were investigated to understand whether there were any discernable differences between injuries to older and younger workers. Apart from the literature review, two statistical construction injury databases were analysed. Qualitative questionnaire based interviews were designed to gather information related to older construction workers. Questionnaires were sent to construction site managers to gauge their perceptions of older construction workers. The statistical data was collected from the Western Cape region and was for the period 1998 through 2005 while the interviews and questionnaire data were collected during 2008. xv The potential benefits to industry are a consolidation of injury information relating to older construction workers. This should assist construction managers with developing policies and implementing strategies to prevent or at least <b>minimise</b> <b>injuries</b> and minimise the related costs, with the aim of more effectively utilising their older workers and ultimately achieving a more sustainable construction industry. The study found that older workers sustained less injuries in total compared with younger workers. No discernable variances occurred between younger and older workers when it came to events leading to injuries (causes) and the type/nature of injuries. It was, however, found that for the body parts affected, older workers were more prone to certain injuries. Older workers sustained less severe injuries compared with their younger counterparts but the injuries were more costly. The research findings supported the notion that older workers receive less training than younger workers...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Medical Science (MMSc) The Ironman triathlon is an {{individual}} sport consisting of three disciplines – swimming, cycling and running. This endurance sport has grown in popularity with over 22 races annually worldwide and 24, 000 participants. Despite this participation there are insufficient data concerning injuries in the Ironman triathlon and regarding athletes’ stretching and training habits, especially in Australia. The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional {{study was to investigate}} the incidence of overuse injuries in this sport according to anatomical site, and their relationships to gender, age, training hours, stretching habits and other factors. Questionnaires were provided in the race packs of 1250 participants of the Australian Ironman Triathlon in 2006. Two hundred and ninety-six questionnaires were returned giving a low response rate of 24 % (74. 3 % male, 25. 7 % female). In this sample, 86. 1 % reported suffering an overuse injury related to competition or training in the last year. The most common site of injury was the knee (35. 1 % of respondents), followed by the lower back (34. 1 %) and the ankle/foot (30. 7 %). There was no statistical relationship between incidence of injury and training load, gender or age, however triathletes with a triathlon coach had a lower injury rate. Participants reported stretching less before training (41. 2 %) than after training (67. 2 %). Among those participants who stretched, the most commonly stretched muscle groups were the hamstrings (88. 9 %), calves (88. 5 %) and quadriceps (86. 1 %). The lower back (61. 5 %), upper back (31. 8 %) and shoulder (53. 4 %) muscles were not stretched by as many participants. Lower back injuries had a significant association with cycling (n = 101, r = 0. 256, p = 0. 01). A strong positive trend was demonstrated between stretching after training and a reduction in total injuries (p= 0. 059). The health professional intervention most utilised by participants was physiotherapy. The overuse injuries in Ironman triathlons in other countries were reported to be most common in the knee, ankle/foot and lower back, which was confirmed in this study of Australian Ironman triathletes.

This increased participation is coupled with a growing realisation of the vulnerability of adolescents in the labour market in terms of occupational injury. Despite recent evidence that time of day {{may be an important}} determinant of adolescent injuries, the impact of non-standard and night work on adolescent injury rates has received scant attention to date. The current study addresses this shortcoming by examining injury patterns of 3201 working adolescents in Queensland. Results revealed that female adolescents are 2. 5 times more likely to sustain an injury on day shift and 4. 71 times more likely to sustain an injury on night shift than their adult counterparts when total work hours are taken into consideration. Similar results were found for male adolescents with an injury to work hours ratio of 2. 19 on day shift and 3. 05 on night shift.

5000|$|Fitimaen {{is a form}} of stick-fighting from Buru in the Maluku Islands. The term {{comes from}} the Buru word maen which means stick. The maen are either made from rattan or from native hardwood, of which there are {{hundreds}} of varieties. Sparring sessions are short to <b>minimise</b> <b>injury,</b> and training is carefully conducted for the same reason. They may be fought with one or a pair of sticks, the length of which depends on personal preference. The first written attestation of fitimaen comes from a British naturalist who recounts that the natives are [...] "adepts at quarterstaff" [...] and that even children [...] "practice with singular skill their cuts and thrusts". While spears and metal knives were also used by the Buru Alifuru for fighting, their preference has always been the fighting staff. Donn F. Draeger calls them the best stick and staff fighters in the whole of Indonesia although not a particularly combative community.

Purpose: To measure {{the length of the}} facial nerve trunk and its divisions and to measure the distance of the nerve trunk with the mastoid process and atlas. The variations in the divisions and branches were also noted. Methods: Twenty hemi-faces were dissected. The facial nerve was identified at the stylomastoid foramen and dissected meticulously through the parotid gland. The divisions and branches were identified and traced. The trunk was measured from the stylomastoid foramen to its point of bifurcation. The length of the two divisions were measured up to their branching. The distance from the nerve trunk to the mastoid process and atlas were measured. Results: Mean length of facial nerve trunk in centimetres was 1. 380 ± 0. 082, length of upper division was 0. 820 ± 0. 108 and length of lower division was 0. 890 ± 0. 090.
