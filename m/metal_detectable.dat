40|$|Results from {{aromatic}} aminations and Kumada couplings, {{together with}} spectroscopic analyses (TEM, EDX, ICP-AES, React-IR), reveal that catalysis using nickel-on-charcoal (Ni/C) {{is most likely}} of a homogeneous rather than heterogeneous nature. In {{the course of a}} reaction with Ni/C, nickel bleed from the support was calculated to be as high as 78 %. However, the existence of an equilibrium for this homogeneous species between nickel located inside vs outside the pore system of charcoal strongly favors the former, thus leaving only traces of <b>metal</b> <b>detectable</b> in solution. This accounts for virtually complete recovery of nickel on the charcoal following filtration of a reaction mixture and allows for recycling of the catalyst. TEM and EDX data were used to explain different reactivity profiles of Ni/C, which depended upon the method of reduction used to convert Ni(II) /C to Ni(0) as well as the level of nickel loading on the support...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{magnetite}} nanoparticles (< 50 nm) with high saturation magnetization (80. 23 emu/g) was successfully synthesized through co-precipitating technique by co-precipitating iron (II) and iron (III) chloride salts {{in the presence}} of 3. 00 M ammonium hydroxide at final pH 9. 5. It was found that increasing the final pH and total iron salts concentration increased saturation magnetization, but the variation of ammonium hydroxide concentration did not change the saturation magnetization. In contrast, the saturation magnetization decreased from 80. 23 emu/g to 64. 83 emu/g when the addition rate of ammonium hydroxide was increased from 5 ml/min to 20 ml/min. The reduction of saturation magnetization for these samples was due to decrease in the crystallite size of the particles with increasing addition rate. Additional continuous efforts were made to further improve the dispersion stability of magnetite nanoparticles in aqueous media by modifying the magnetite surface using surface modifiers (e. g., polyethylene glycol, oleic acid) to generate an effective repulsive force in between particles. It was found that the resultant MNPs incorporated with oleic acid demonstrated a maximum stability in maintaining good colloidal dispersion. This MNPs colloidal suspension performance was approximately 7 times higher (21 days) than the uncoated MNPs (3 days). The reason can be mainly attributed to the formation of oleate secondary layer in the bilayer oleic acid coated MNPs that enabled the MNPs to be well dispersed in polar (acrylonitrile) and non-polar (butadiene) parts of the building block of nitrile latex. In addition, the oleic acid coating layer could reduce the oxidation reaction that trigger phase transition as compared with PEG coating. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements suggested that there was two kinds of binding between molecules of oleic acid and magnetite. The coating density of PEG and oleic acid on the MNPs particle surface increased with increasing loading amount. iv The mechanical properties of nitrile butadiene rubber latex film were reduced by the addition of oleic acid coated MNPs but it is within the acceptable range. Lastly, the results proved that NBR latex film incorporated with oleic acid coated MNPs has improved magnetic properties and thermal stability. The saturation magnetization of NBR latex film was increased from 0. 19 emu/g to 1. 85 emu/g. Based on the results, oleic acid coated MNPs is the ideal magnetic additive for <b>metal</b> <b>detectable</b> glove application...|$|E

40|$|The Óbidos Lagoon is {{the largest}} shallow coastal lagoon in Portugal. Like any other {{brackish}} water system, it has been potentially exposed to different sources of contamination (e. g. livestock farming, domestic and industrial sewage). Trace metals are persistent elements present {{in the water and}} sediments in their elemental and organic/inorganic forms. In fact, Cadmium is extremely pollutant due to its great solubility in water and high toxicity for organisms. Also, it is classified as a priority substance according to the European Union Water Frame directive. In this context, a seasonal environmental monitoring program was implemented in the intertidal water margins of the Óbidos Lagoon to assess the presence of Cadmium. In 2009 and 2010, eight sampling stations (S) distributed on the shores of the Óbidos Lagoon were chosen and water and sediments were seasonally collected. In all samples, cadmium concentrations were analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, with Graphite Furnace Technique. Cadmium dissolved in the water samples was only detected during summer months, with the highest values in the Barrosa’s arm (S 3 : 0. 35 mg/l) in 2009, and at the station further downstream (S 1 : 0. 19 mg/l) in 2010. In the suspended fraction of the water samples the trace <b>metal</b> was <b>detectable</b> in all seasons, with the maximum concentration at the Barrosa’s arm (S 4 : 1. 04 mg/l) in the winter of 2010.

The highest concentration in the sediments was observed at the Barrosa´s arm (S 4 : 140. 78 mg/kg) in the spring of 2010. As a whole, cadmium contamination appears to be mostly focused on the inner areas of the lagoon, at the Barrosa´s arm, but a clear seasonal pattern of variation was not detectable.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} {{limits are}} generally decreasing and traditional samplers used for quantifying occupational exposures have numerous limitations: cost, disposability, detection of low concentrations, {{and some even}} fail to match international inhalable sampling conventions. A low cost, high-flow (10 L min- 1) inhalable prototype sampler was developed from the 37 -mm cassette and tested in previous studies. These studies called for additional field testing as an area and personal sampler. The sampler was paired with the IOM (2 L min- 1), a traditional inhalable air sampler, and deployed in metal working facilities. The samplers were compared {{to determine whether the}} prototype matched the IOM and whether the new sampler could improve the sensitivity for detecting lower concentrations of metals. The following processes were sampled: welding, grinding, soldering, pouring, sawing, tending and shooting guns. A total of 21 out of 28 paired samples had <b>detectable</b> <b>metals</b> out of 15 possible metals. There were seven out of eight personal samples and 14 out of 20 area samples with <b>detectable</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations. The average sample time was seven hours, but ranged from 4. 2 – 8. 3 hours. The most common metals that were detected on 10 or more samples were iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and lead. Metal concentrations collected by the two samplers were not statistically different for the aggregate metal concentrations collected (p = 0. 67), metals collected by sample type, personal or area (p = 0. 52) or by particle “sizes,” small or large (p = 0. 40), collected from the processes. While the samplers were not statistically different, linear regression equations to assess the sampler relationships showed that there were {{significant differences between the two}} samplers. Over the total metal concentrations collected, the prototype collected about 71 % of what the IOM collected. By sample type, the prototype performed better during area sampling as opposed to personal sampling and by particle size, the prototype performed better in the collection of smaller, heat generated particles, as opposed to larger, mechanically generated particles. Though minor differences were found between concentrations detected on the prototype and IOM, it was determined that in general, these differences were negligible in their interpretation and comparison to occupational exposure limits. Plots also indicated that the prototype sampler performs well at sampling low concentrations of metals, however, only a small amount of metals were detected on the prototype that were not found on the IOM, therefore, the improvement of sensitivity was not assessed. High-flow sampling was hindered by the ability of air sampling pumps to maintain the required operation flow rate of 10 L min- 1 for the duration of a work shift. Additional field studies are needed to determine whether the sensitivity for detecting lower concentrations of metals can be improved...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} {{and analysis of}} the most metal-poor damped Lyman α (DLA) system currently known, based on observations made with the Keck HIRES spectrograph. The metal paucity of this system has only permitted the determination of three element abundances: [C/H] = − 3. 43 ± 0. 06, [O/H] = − 3. 05 ± 0. 05 and [Si/H] = − 3. 21 ± 0. 05, as well as an upper limit on the abundance of iron: [Fe/H] ≤ − 2. 81. This DLA is among the most carbon-poor environment currently known with <b>detectable</b> <b>metals.</b> By comparing the abundance pattern of this DLA to detailed models of metal-free nucleosynthesis, we find that the chemistry of the gas is consistent with the yields of a 20. 5 [*]M_⊙ metal-free star that ended its life as a core-collapse supernova; the abundances we measure are inconsistent with the yields of pair-instability supernovae. Such a tight constraint on the mass of the progenitor Population III star is afforded by the well-determined C/O ratio, which we show depends almost monotonically on the progenitor mass when the kinetic energy of the supernova explosion is Eexp ≳ 1. 5 × 10 ^(51) [*]erg. We find that the DLA presented here has just crossed the critical ‘transition discriminant’ threshold, rendering the DLA gas now suitable for low mass star formation.

H I Lyα absorption is detected at the galaxy redshift in the spectra of all three QSOs, and metal lines of Si III, Si IV, and C IV are detected along the two major-axis sight lines. Photoionization models of these clouds suggest metallicities close to the galaxy metallicity, cloud sizes of 1 kpc, and gas masses of 10 ^ 4 solar masses. Given the high covering factor of these clouds, ESO 157 - 49 could harbor 2 x 10 ^ 9 solar masses of warm CGM gas.

The observations are designed to investigate the nature of galaxies producing metal line absorption systems in the spectrum of the QSO. Along a single line of sight, we find at least 6 metal line absorption systems (of which 3 are newly discovered) ranging in redshift from 0. 317 to 0. 892. Through an extensive program of optical and IR imaging, QSO spectroscopy, and faint galaxy spectroscopy, we have identified 5 of the 6 metal line absorption systems with luminous (L_K > 0. 1 L*_K) galaxies. These have morphologies ranging from very late-type spiral to S 0, and exhibit a wide range of inclination and position angles with respect to the QSO sightline. The only unidentified absorber, despite our intensive search, is a damped Lyman α system at z_abs= 0. 656.

40|$|AtzF, {{allophanate}} hydrolase, is {{a recently}} discovered {{member of the}} amidase signature family that catalyzes the terminal reaction during metabolism of s-triazine ring compounds by bacteria. In the present study, the atzF gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was cloned and expressed as a His-tagged protein, and the protein was purified and characterized. AtzF had a deduced subunit molecular mass of 66, 223, based on the gene sequence, and an estimated holoenzyme molecular mass of 260, 000. The active protein did not contain <b>detectable</b> <b>metals</b> or organic cofactors. Purified AtzF hydrolyzed allophanate with a kcat/Km of 1. 1 × 104 s− 1 M− 1, and 2 mol of ammonia was released per mol allophanate. The substrate range of AtzF was very narrow. Urea, biuret, hydroxyurea, methylcarbamate, and other structurally analogous compounds were not substrates for AtzF. Only malonamate, which strongly inhibited allophanate hydrolysis, was an alternative substrate, with a greatly reduced kcat/Km of 21 s− 1 M− 1. Data suggested that the AtzF catalytic cycle proceeds through a covalent substrate-enzyme intermediate. AtzF reacts with malonamate and hydroxylamine to generate malonohydroxamate, potentially derived from hydroxylamine capture of an enzyme-tethered acyl group. Three putative catalytically important residues, one lysine and two serines, were altered by site-directed mutagenesis, each with complete loss of enzyme activity. The identity of a putative serine nucleophile was probed using phenyl phosphorodiamidate that was {{shown to be a}} time-dependent inhibitor of AtzF. Inhibition was due to phosphoroamidation of Ser 189 as shown by liquid chromatography/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The modified residue corresponds in sequence alignments to the nucleophilic serine previously identified in other members of the amidase signature family. Thus, AtzF affects the cleavage of three carbon-to-nitrogen bonds via a mechanism similar to that of enzymes catalyzing single-amide-bond cleavage reactions. AtzF orthologs appear to be widespread among bacteria...|$|R
40|$|A Professional Project Report {{prepared}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements For the Degree of Master of Water Resources Administration, Water Resources Program, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, June 2000 The village of Seven Springs, New Mexico, lies north of Fenton Lake in {{the valley of the}} Rio Cebolla in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. The valley is funnel shaped [...] narrowest downstream [...] with homes most densely packed {{at the bottom of the}} funnel. It is typical of many small communities scattered throughout the state in that residents rely on private wells for drinking water and on individual septic systems for disposal of household waste. The current population in the village and the valley is light [...] about 50 permanent residents swelling to about 100 during the summer months. However, increased development of the valley is likely resulting in more permanent and seasonal residents. Ground water in the valley is shallow, ranging in depth from five to forty feet, and the threat to ground-water quality from increased development is high. To assess current and projected impacts to ground water from septic systems, water was sampled from wells at eleven homes, from two springs from which people obtain water, and from the Rio Cebolla above and below the village. Ground and surface waters were analyzed for major ions, metals, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, and coliforms. Coliform bacteria were found in Cebolla Spring, Hatchery Spring, and the Rio Cebolla. Water from Cebolla Spring tested positive for total coliform bacteria and water from the Hatchery Spring and the Rio Cebolla tested positive for both fecal and total coliforms. Residents who participated in the study were cautioned to avoid drinking water from the springs and the river. The ground water in the valley is of good quality with hardness under 37 mg/L (2. 2 grains), total dissolved solids content less than 200 mg/L, nitrate at 0. 2 mg/L or less and no coliforms or elevated <b>metals.</b> No <b>detectable</b> impact was found from the old gas station located in the village. There are some areas where anoxic conditions exist and at least one resident complained of rusty water with an odor of rotten-eggs. However, it was not determined if these conditions are the direct result of septic system discharge. Increased development may, however, adversely impact ground-water quality in the valley. Construction of a simple hydro geologic model shows that the septic discharge from only 46 homes with 127 year-round residents in the valley may be enough to increase nitrate levels in shallow ground water at the bottom of the valley to 5 mg/L [...] half of the ground-water standard. Runoff from farming and grazing operations has likely contaminated the river and Fenton Lake with excessive nutrients. Additionally, an increase in population may bring more people into contact with spring and river water, which were been found to be contaminated with coliform bacteria...|$|R
40|$|In August 2014 a metal detectorist {{discovered}} several {{objects from}} the Young Iron Age on the hill called Mannsfjellet at the Olstad-farm in Skaun municipality, Sør-Trøndelag County. This {{was followed by a}} small excavation performed by the NTNU University Museum in September/October the same year. This led to the finds of a Viking-Age sword and shield boss, as well as a leather pouch containing amongst other things several Arabic coins. Since it was assumed that this find was a remain from a larger collection of burials in the area, the NTNU University Museum performed a geophysical investigation and photogrammetric documentation on behalf of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage. This investigation was performed on the 18 th and 19 th of October. The objectives of this investigation was to: 1. Map the presence of dug features, their condition and status, 2. Map the thickness of the topsoil and 3. Map the spread of <b>metal</b> objects as <b>detectable</b> with a gradiometer. The investigation performed was a combination of a ground penetrating radar and gradiometer-surveys, as well as making a detailed landscape model by photogrammetry of aerial images photographed from a drone. The collected data was processed and analyzed to answer these objectives. No dug features relating such as pits or ditches relating to prehistoric activity was detected, but the radar survey detected a large amount of plough furrows which were in average at 20 - 50 cm depth and down to about 10 cm across. From this radar-dataset it was also possible to indicate the approximate depth of the topsoil, as well as the depth down to the bedrock in certain areas. The gradiometer survey revealed a strongly magnetic bedrock in parts of the investigation area. This prevented a possible detection of archaeological observation especially in the northern parts of the investigation area. In other parts of the area investigated with the gradiometer we could detect some anomalies interpreted as metal objects, but the position of these did not match known metal detecting hits from the 2014 -investigation. The photogrammetry produced a highly detailed terrain model, but no microtopographical evidence revealed additional cultural historically interesting observations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the release of metal {{elements}} from a Ti 6 Al 4 V modular endoprosthesis for mandibular reconstruction. Ten monkeys were included, seven of the animals had an endoprosthesis inserted and three served as controls. Mucosa, regional lymph nodes and distant organs, were assessed after the implant had been in place for 12 months, using light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP). Blood was also drawn from all animals for elemental analysis using ICP. LM and TEM evaluation showed no <b>detectable</b> <b>metal</b> particles in the mucosa surrounding the endoprosthesis, nor in the regional lymph nodes and distant organs. Blood analysis revealed that titanium and vanadium were detectable in comparable amounts in the test (Ti: 1. 63 +/- 0. 54, Va: 0. 42 +/- 0. 08) as well as in the control group (Ti: 2. 07 +/- 0. 55, Va: 0. 37 +/- 0. 07). The amount of aluminum appeared to be higher in the control group (31. 77 +/- 11. 67) compared with the test group (20. 41 +/- 9. 13), but this difference was not statistically significant. ICP showed that no titanium, vanadium or aluminum was detectable in the mucosa surrounding the endoprosthesis. In addition, no titanium and vanadium were found in the lymph nodes and distant organs using ICP. On the other hand, using ICP, the aluminum content was found to be higher in the right regional lymph nodes and all examined distant organs as compared to the control group (lymph nodes: 11. 55 +/- 22. 15 vs. 0. 36 +/- 0. 61, lung: 6. 24 +/- 11. 28 vs. 1. 40 +/- 2. 15, liver: 1. 66 +/- 0. 99 vs. 0, kidney: 15. 69 +/- 24. 88 vs 0, spleen: 2. 75 +/- 3. 09 vs. 0. 49 +/- 0. 43). However, only for the kidney and liver the higher amount of aluminum was statistically significant. In conclusion, this study quantified the release of only aluminum in lymph nodes and distant organs, when using a modular endoprosthesis made of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for mandibular reconstruction...|$|R

During the Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE- 2), filter {{samples were}} {{collected}} aboard the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Pelican aircraft near Tenerife in June and July of 1997. The flights included constant altitude measurements in the boundary layer as well as profiles up to 3800 m providing detailed chemical information about {{the composition of the}} aerosol distribution in the lower troposphere. Three cases with different air mass origins — clean marine air, anthropogenically-influenced air from the European continent, and dust-laden air from the Sahara — were identified. The samples were analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) for ionic species, by combined thermal and optical analysis (TOA) for organic carbon, and by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) for elemental composition. Particle composition and size distributions for the range of air masses encountered illustrate links in the chemical and microphysical characteristics of aerosol from different sources. Clean marine air masses were characterized by low particle number and mass concentrations with no <b>detectable</b> <b>metals,</b> while anthropogenically-influenced and dust-laden air had high number, mass, and trace metal concentrations. Anthropogenic sources were characterized by high concentrations of submicron particles and some Fe and Cu, whereas dust particle loadings included a significant mass of micron-sized particles and significant loadings of Fe, in addition to small amounts of Mn, Cu, and Ni. These results showed similar tracers for air mass origin as those found in other measurements of oceanic and continental air masses. Aerosol optical properties were estimated with a simplified model of the aerosol based on the measured compositions. The real and imaginary refractive indices and single scattering albedos differed significantly among the three types of aerosol measured, with clean marine aerosol properties showing the least absorption and dust-containing aerosols showing the most. There were only small differences in optical properties for the two different cases of clean marine aerosol, but some {{significant differences between the two}} dust cases. Since measurement uncertainties affect these calculations, we studied the type of mixing and the fraction of absorbing species and found the calculation was sensitive to these variations only for the dust-containing aerosol case, probably due to the small amount of water present. While the optical properties varied little with composition for clean marine and anthropogenically-influenced cases, they showed a strong dependence on variations in particle composition and mixing state for the dust-containing cases...|$|R
40|$|In {{its ability}} to retain {{signatures}} of tectonic events that enrich or deplete its fertilization state, the lithosphere holds {{the key to the}} tectonic evolution and history of Earth. Dewatering of the subducting slab leads to released fluids and induced melt which act to fertilize the overlying mantle in incompatible elements such as hydrogen. Conversely, rifting events lead to partial melting with fertile elements entering the melt, leaving behind a depleted lithosphere. Signatures such as these can remain in the lithosphere for hundreds of millions of years in the absence of further high temperature/melt events. Magnetotellurics (MT) is a passive geophysical tool that images the physical property of electrical resistivity and is capable of penetrating the entire lithosphere. MT is highly sensitive to minor interconnected conducting mineralogy and fluids, and thus is ideal for distinguishing between lithosphere of different degrees of enrichment. Additionally, the sensitivity to these minor phases means that fossil fluid pathways associated with the ascent of mineralising fluids and <b>metals</b> are <b>detectable</b> with MT. This is the cornerstone on which one of the main directions of the UNCOVER (Australian Academy of Science, 2012) initiative is based on- increasing the detectable signature of ore deposits by imaging the underlying fluid pathways and lateral dispersion of deposits. With these capabilities in mind, MT surveys were undertaken across western Victoria, Australia and the Ikara-Flinders Ranges and Curnamona Province in South Australia, Australia. The collection, processing and modelling of new MT sites were conducted for this thesis, with many other existing MT sites utilised to expand the dataset. In Chapter 2, 74 broadband (period of 0. 001 - 2000 s) MT sites along the 1. 2 - 5 km spaced east-west Southern Delamerian transect were processed, modelled and interpreted across western Victoria. The crust beneath the Delamerian Orogen has a heterogeneous resistivity structure, with low-resistivity fossil-fluid pathways stemming from Moho depths, intersecting an otherwise resistive upper crust. Serpentinite with interconnected magnetite is known to occur within the vicinity of the survey region, and conductivity measurements of hand samples indicate substantially lower resistivities for the serpentinised rocks, leading to the interpretation that serpentinite contributed to the low resistivity zones. Chapter 3 expands on the Southern Delamerian transect of Chapter 2 by modelling the transect using a 3 D inversion code, along with four other pre-existing datasets which, when combined, create a 500 km continuous east-west transect. Importantly, this transect traverses the transitional zone between the Delamerian and Lachlan Orogens. The elusive boundary between these Orogens has most recently been interpreted as a gradual boundary within the Stawell Zone. Results from modelling show that the lower crust and shallow upper mantle of the Delamerian Orogen are at least an order of magnitude more resistive than the adjacent Lachlan Orogen. If the location of this sharp gradient in resistivity is chosen as the Delamerian-Lachlan transition, then the boundary occurs about 20 km to the east of the Moyston Fault in a NNW-SSE orientation, in reasonable agreeance with seismologically and geochemically determined boundaries. Finally, Chapter 4 involved the collection of the first set of AusLAMP measurements across an array of 50 km spaced long-period (2 - 17, 000 s) MT sites across the Ikara- Flinders Ranges and Curnamona Province in South Australia. This longer-period dataset was capable of imaging the entire lithosphere, and resulted in the imaging of a surprisingly low resistivity crust for the Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic Curnamona Province, indicating either a long-lived retainment of enrichment from the Olarian Orogeny (over 1. 5 Ga), a more widespread reworking of the province from the Delamerian Orogeny (540 Ma), or another unrelated more recent enrichment event. The Broken Hill Domain remains largely resistive, indicating that enrichment events associated with the emplacement of the word-class Broken Hill deposit may have been erased during a high temperature or melt event. Further, two conductivity anomalies were identified in the Nackara Arc of the Ikara-Flinders Ranges, and when combined with the Curnamona Conductor, can explain the phenomenon of induction vectors across eastern South Australia all pointing toward an anomalous zone spanning the Ikara-Flinders Ranges north to south in an arcuate fashion, which had previously been interpreted as one single continuous conductivity anomaly, the Flinders Conductivity Anomaly. Coincidence of the Nackara Arc Conductors with locations of discovered kimberlites give evidence for zones of lithospheric weakness, with pathways where CO₂-rich kimberlitic melts may have deposited graphite on ascent.

40|$|Accompanied by {{the common}} {{awareness}} of the environmental protection and public hygiene in Taiwan, the pollution of the water sources and soils were increasingly received more serious concerns in recent years. The objective of this investigation were to document the variation of heavy metal cations levels in contaminants and their residue effect in animal tissue. The average levels of Lead(Pb), Copper(Cu) and Cadmiun(Cd) of different sampling specimen from the dairy herds in Taiwan werw measured and classified under various criteria: The concentrations of lead, copper and cadmium detected, respectively, were following. In raw milk: 11. 29 ± 5. 66 ng/ml, 42. 53 ± 13. 38 ng/ml, 0. 29 ± 0. 17 ng/ml. In Winter raw milk: 11. 56 ± 4. 04 ng/ml, 41. 84 ± 4. 37 ng/ml, 0. 14 ± 0. 12 ng/ml. In Summer raw milk: 10. 34 ± 1. 15 ng/ml, 43. 66 ± 6. 61 ng/ml, 0. 007 ± 0. 01 ng/ml. The concentrations of these pollutants in soils were 23. 43 μg/g(17. 3 ~ 28. 9 μg/g), 29. 12 μg/g(22. 8 ~ 39. 6 μg/g) and 0. 04 μg/g(0. 02 ~ 0. 07 μg/g), respectively, compared the roughages samples. Which were 3, 218. 52 ± 1, 362. 98 ng/g, 27, 759 ± 11, 738 ng/g and 325. 11 ± 111. 33 ng/g. The concentrations of feeds and cow serum were 910. 96 ± 508. 64 ng/g and 2. 54 ± 2. 38 ng/ml, 27, 565 ± 10, 170 ng/g and 856. 36 ± 172. 29 ng/ml, and 216. 11 ± 60. 34 ng/g and 0. 58 ± 0. 22 ng/ml, respectively. From the results of drinking water and the marketing milk samples contamination, the concentration of copper were 6. 17 ± 7. 08 ng/ml but those of the other two heavy <b>metals</b> were below <b>detectable</b> levels. According to the results described above, copper is the highest pollutant (36. 4 ~ 50. 2 ng/ml) in raw milk of the sampl ing herds in Taiwam. The second is lead contamination (9. 6 ~ 10. 7 ng/nil). The Cadmium shows the lowest level in these milk specimen (0. 2 ~ 0. 4 ng/ml). Only a trace amount of these 3 major metal were detected from the marketing milk samples. Which are all under the safty allowance. No significant difference were observed among the sampling areas except for the copper level. However, the lead and copper were significant higher in milk and soils, and the cadmium level in summer raw milk than that of in winter ra milk. Most of the polluted dairy farms and pasture ranges are located alone the country road and the highway. It was possibly related to the roughages, feeds and soils, although the real sources of pollution has yet uncertained. As to the contamination in tissue of goat, the main contaminated organs are liver, skeletal system and kidney. Experimentally, 1, 000 ppm of lead acetate can induce intra- nuclear inclusion body in hepatic cells.

Trace metals are normal constituents of natural waters and may be present {{in a wide range of}} physico-chemical forms or species. The bioavailability and toxicity of trace metals is dependent on their speciation. In laboratory experiments it has been demonstrated that the toxicity of some trace metals to aquatic organisms is related to the activity of the free metal ion rather than the total metal concentration, however, in a small number of studies it has been shown that toxicity and bioavailability of lipid soluble metal complexes may exceed that of the equivalent free metal ion species. Some toxicity data has shown that these lipid soluble metal complexes can be up to 25 times more toxic than free metal ions. LMSC are chemical complexes containing a metal and a biotic ligand. The nature of the LMSC means that it readily traverses membranes. LSMC are of great importance yet there is currently no method that has been developed that has the ability to accurately quantify the small concentrations likely to occur in the environment. The aim of this study is to firstly develop a method for the determination of ultra-trace (ng/L) concentrations of lipid soluble cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc complexes in water. Waters were extracted with 1 -octanol, a solvent with a similar dielectric constant to that of cell membranes. A preconcentration factor of 50 was achieved by extraction of 250 mL of water into 10 mL of octanol followed by back extraction into a final volume of 5 mL of acidic matrix. Metal concentrations were subsequently determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS). Detection limits (3 σ) for the method were 0. 002, 0. 003, 0. 003, 0. 001, and 0. 011 μg/L for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn respectively. The detection limits of the analytical method were lower than those previously reported in the literature. The developed method was used to conduct a survey of aquatic environments from the Sydney, NSW region. Three locations were surveyed, Centennial Park, Homebush Bay and the Cooks River. Detectable concentrations of lipid soluble Cu, Pb and Zn were found in all three locations, whereas lipid soluble Cd and Ni were only detected in the Cooks River. Lipid soluble Cd concentrations ranged from 0. 002 to 0. 004 μg/L, lipid soluble Cu concentrations ranged from 0. 003 to 0. 533 μg/L, lipid soluble Ni concentrations ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 025 μg/L, lipid soluble Pb concentrations ranged from 0. 002 to 0. 087 μg/L and lipid soluble Zn concentrations ranged from 0. 020 to 0. 499 μg/L. The results were comparable to previously reported lipid soluble metal complex concentrations in environmental samples. The developed analytical method was also used to determine the concentration of lipid soluble metal complexes in mine waste water. Xanthates such as potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) are commonly used in mining processes and are expected to be common in mine waste waters. Potassium amyl xanthate is known to form neutral <b>metal</b> complexes. <b>Detectable</b> concentrations of lipid soluble Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn complexes were measured in the waste water. Lipid soluble Cu concentrations ranged from 70. 5 to 84. 1 μg/L, Ni concentrations ranged from 0. 256 to 0. 264 μg/L, Zn concentrations ranged from 0. 044 to 0. 050 μg/L and a single Pb concentration of 0. 006 μg/L was recorded. Of these lipid soluble metal complexes, only Pb and Ni concentrations represented a considerable proportion (a proportion greater than the limit of detection of the method) of the total dissolved Pb and Ni concentration. The octanol/water partition coefficients of a number of neutral inorganic complexes were measured to assess the environmental significance of these complexes. In total, 14 complexes were tested. CdCl₂, CuCO₃, Cu(OH) ₂, NiCl₂, NiCO₃, Ni(OH) ₂, PbCl₂, PbCO₃, Pb(OH) ₂, PbSO₄, ZnCO₃ and Pb(OH) ₂ all returned low octanol/water partition coefficients (< 0. 2) indicating that if these complexes are present in natural waters they are unlikely to be lipid soluble. Octanol/water partition coefficients of 3. 28 and 0. 20 were calculated for the HgCl₂ and B(OH) ₃ neutral complexes. The partition coefficients were comparable to quoted literature values. This result indicates that if present in natural waters the HgCl₂ and B(OH) ₃complexes may have the ability to passively diffuse across cell membranes. While a robust method for measuring LSMC concentrations has been developed, the entrainment of colloids within the octanol extracts could be of significant concern. Based on analysis of Al and Fe within the back extracts (used as an indication of the entrainment of colloids within the back extracts) it was determined that, in a number of samples, the entrainment of colloids could be greater than the extraction of LSMC. This was of particular concern when assessing the concentration of lipid soluble Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The use of octanol filled dialysis cells could potentially address these concerns in addition to allowing the concentration of lipid soluble metal complexes to be determined in sediment and biota. This thesis also highlights the frequency of LSMC in the environment. Future work should also be performed to determine the concentration of lipid soluble metal complexes in a wider range of aquatic environments, both saline and freshwater. Analysis of a wider range of waste waters from industries that used synthetic organic ligands should also be included in this investigation. The stability of both organic and inorganic lipid soluble complexes in laboratory prepared waters and natural waters should be assessed to gain a better understanding about the environmental significance of these complexes. Finally toxicity testing should be performed using a range of lipid soluble metal complexes with the measurement of actual concentration rather than relying on nominal concentrations of lipid soluble metal complexes in test solutions. This may allow for more accurate toxicity data to be generated. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xx, 225 pages) colour map...|$|R
