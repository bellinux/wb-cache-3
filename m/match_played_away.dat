40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{dismissals}} of football managers and whether such decisions appear {{to contribute to}} organisational goals or else to be fruitless exercises in scapegoating. Its empirical setting is Argentina where incidence of sackings {{is more than one}} per season per club. It models 20 years of football match results and detects a tendency for a change of manager to be followed by deterioration in team performance, with adverse effects concentrated in results of <b>matches</b> <b>played</b> <b>away.</b> The evidence is consistent with decisions being driven by fan and media pressure rather than in realistic hope of improving the position of the club...|$|R
40|$|Background: Player {{activities}} in soccer matches {{are influenced by}} the match result and match venue. It is not known whether injury rates {{are influenced by the}}se factors. Purpose: To investigate whether there are associations between injury rates and the match result, venue, and type of competition in male soccer. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Twenty-six professional clubs from 10 countries were followed prospectively during 9 seasons (2001 - 2002 to 2009 - 2010). All matches, and injuries occurring in these matches, were registered by the teams medical staff. An injury was registered if it resulted in player absence from training or matches. Information about match result, venue, and type of competition for all reported matches was gathered by the authors from online databases. Injury rates in matches with varying match characteristics were compared by use of generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 2738 injuries during 6010 matches were registered. There were no associations between odds of 1 injury occurrence and match result or type of competition, whereas the odds were decreased in <b>matches</b> <b>played</b> <b>away</b> compared with home matches (OR, 0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 80 - 0. 99). The odds of 2 or more injury occurrences in a match were increased in matches resulting in a draw (OR, 1. 39; 95 % CI, 1. 15 - 1. 69) or loss (OR, 1. 66; 95 % CI, 1. 38 - 1. 98) compared with matches won and were decreased in other cup matches compared with league matches (OR, 0. 57; 95 % CI, 0. 39 - 0. 84) and in <b>matches</b> <b>played</b> <b>away</b> compared with home matches (OR, 0. 70; 95 % CI, 0. 60 - 0. 82). Finally, injuries with more than 1 weeks absence occurred more frequently in Champions League matches compared with league matches both for matches with 1 injury (OR, 1. 26; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 1. 45) and matches with 2 or more injuries (OR, 1. 57; 95 % CI, 1. 13 - 2. 20). Conclusion: The odds of 2 or more injury occurrences in professional soccer were higher in matches resulting in a loss or a draw compared with a win, whereas the odds of injury occurrences were lower in <b>matches</b> <b>played</b> <b>away</b> compared with home matches. The rate of moderate and severe injuries increased with the importance of the match...|$|R

After a number of impressive showings, Conteh renewed his contract for Palermo, which was due in June 2006, for two more years.

5000|$|It was not {{desirable}} for Melbourne to <b>play</b> four consecutive <b>away</b> <b>matches</b> {{to start the}} season. This was partly because Melbourne would then have four consecutive home matches between Rounds 12 and 15. Additionally, because of {{the proximity of the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground to Punt Road Oval, matches were never scheduled at the venues on the same day; so it would have forced [...] to open the season with four home <b>matches,</b> then <b>play</b> four <b>away</b> <b>matches</b> from Rounds 12 to 15.
