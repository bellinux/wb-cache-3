40|$|It {{is a basic}} {{understanding}} of the current discussion on sustainable development that the high consumption level of non-renewable resources in industrial societies ought to be reduced in absolute figures and that the use of renewable resources should not go beyond the carrying capacities of ecological systems. It is evident that sustainable development will not be attained without regular (annual) information on dimension, structure and development of the physical exchanges between society and nature. National material balances therefore are to be regarded as one important requirement for achieving sustainable development. As a basic requirement of ecological restructuring of economies, the production and consumption of selected materials should be registered in an accounting form. Other material flow accounts describe the total <b>material</b> <b>throughput</b> of an economy. Austria, Germany and Japan were among the first countries to provide material flow accounting data for the whole economy. In Germany, material flow balances are already a firm part of integrated environmental and economic accounting. The physical accounting of material and substance flows on a regional and national scale is a rapidly growing field of current research on sustainability. Therefore the coordination of ongoing projects on an international level is an important prerequisite for providing a coherent framework of material and substance flow accounting methodology. Estimations for Austria show an average resource consumption of 29 tons per capita and year (1990). 83 percent of the yearly total material demand (water and air excluded) is taken from domestic resources, 17 percent is imported (materials, goods). About 10 percent of the domestic <b>material</b> <b>throughput</b> is exported. More than a third of total <b>material</b> <b>throughput</b> is turned back to nature in the form of emissions and waste. About one half of annual demand remains in the system and leads to a net increase in long-term stocks (above all in the form of buildings and infrastructure). The main cause for the high increase in the total <b>material</b> <b>throughput</b> of the Austrian economy over the last twenty years is the demand for construction materials. The value added per material or energy throughput unit, the total resource productivity, has increased by about 30 percent during that period. Nevertheless, absolute figures for resource consumption increased by approximately the same amount.

30|$|The {{field of}} supply chain {{planning}} {{has a long}} history of creating sophisticated operational models that describe the flow of materials between organizations. While these models capture low-level dynamics with accuracy, they increasingly lose accuracy and become hard to construct as system size grows. Typical simulation and analytical models include detailed state variables of each individual production step such as inventory levels, bills of <b>materials,</b> <b>throughput,</b> and lead times for production. In the context of robustness to failures, several inventory and optimization models have been proposed [9, 26, 28]. However, these models cannot be extended to include the whole system because state variables are often not available because of a lack of visibility and unwillingness of suppliers to share data. Furthermore, these models are not practical for implementation at large scales due to computational limitations and the frequency with which state variables change. Several researchers have stressed the need for alternative methods to analyse system robustness that can complement low-level dynamical analysis (an excellent review can be found by Snyder et al. [24]). This inevitably means letting go of local detail, and focusing on statistical properties of the system.|$|R
40|$|Establishing a {{successful}} construction/demolition (C&D) waste recyling {{operation in the}} USA is a challenge today, especially because secondary materials markets have not yet matured. Increasingly, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill operations refuse to accept C&D waste. Skyrocketing tipping fees due to the scarcity of landfill sites, and growing concerns from regulatory agencies and the public, have placed C&D waste recycling operations under intense scrutiny. The experiences of regional C&D recyclers indicate that successful recycling operations require a minimum of 0. 8 ha of clear space for processing equipment, incoming waste stockpiles, recycled materials, and manoeuvring room for mobile equipment and operations. Reasonable quality, reliable equipment suitable for these operations generally costs between $ 300 000 and $ 750 000 for a 400 - 500 tonne/day operation. At present, operators of these facilities make a profit almost solely on tipping fees, with the recycling operation functioning mainly to maintain <b>materials</b> <b>throughput.</b> Different categories of C&D recycling machinery and waste processing strategies are presented.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{improving}} the operational efficiency of automated part storage devices, {{in this case}} Vertical Lift Modules (VLM). This was accomplished by using dynamic slotting to maximize and maintain high <b>material</b> <b>throughput,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} periodic reslotting. Multiple VLMs can be used in parallel picking operations to improve <b>material</b> <b>throughput.</b> Common industry practice is to periodically reslot items once an unbalanced workload is obvious. This thesis investigates a method to avoid periodic reslotting by using incoming parts as a means to maintain a balanced workload amongst VLMs. Three different part allocation strategies are compared, namely Randomization, Snake and Order Grouping to determine their effectiveness and respective feasibility. The three strategies are then crafted into logical systems {{that could be used to}} strategically place received parts and eliminate the need for periodic reslotting. The Snake method was found to be the most well suited for this particular situation due to the small order sizes. This method provides a 35 % savings in pick time, which is equivalent to approximately 733 hours annually. by Stephen Douglas Racca. Thesis: M.

The initial Extend model used to assess <b>material</b> <b>throughput</b> and develop equipment lists for the preconceptual design effort was upgraded with software add-ons from Simulation Dynamics, Inc.

Use of the SDI database interface allowed the upgraded model to include: 1. a material mass balance at any level of detail required by the user, and 2. a transport system model that includes all transport system movements, time delays, and transfers between systems. This model will assist in evaluating transport system capacity, sensitive time delays in the system, and optimal operating strategies. An additional benefit of using the SDI database interface is dramatically improved run time performance. This allows significantly more runs to be completed to provide better statistics for overall plant performance. The model has all system and process parameters entered into sub-component accessible tables.

This may be achieved by focusing on technological issues such as choosing materials, designing products, and recovering materials, or by looking at institutional and social barriers and incentives such as opening waste markets or changing consumer behavior. A model is presented for {{the life cycle of}} truck tires in Western Europe that is dynamic in nature and values both environmental and economic consequences. Various scenarios are simulated including longer tire lifetimes, better maintenance of tire pressure, increased use of less-expensive Asian tires, and increased use of fuel efficiency-enhancing tires ("eco-tires"). Tentative results indicate that, among other things, more than 95 % of the overall environmental impact during the life of a tire occurs during the use of the tire, due to the impact of tires on automotive fuel efficiency. Better maintenance of tire pressure and use of eco-tires produce greater environmental and economics benefits than more-durable and/or less-expensive (Asian) tires. These results imply that the emphasis in environmental policies related to tires should shift from the production and the waste stages to the consumption stage.

40|$|Spray {{deposition}} is {{a promising}} technique for the solution processing of plastic electronic devices {{due to its}} potential for high-speed, large-scale device fabrication using low capital cost equipment. Most recent reports of spray-deposited electronic devices have used ultrasonic systems for film deposition to minimise surface roughness, but such systems suffer from low <b>materials</b> <b>throughput,</b> and are consequently ill-suited to industrial manufacturing. Gas-driven spray-heads enable higher <b>throughput</b> <b>materials</b> delivery but can result in an unacceptably rough film due to the large, broadly distributed droplet sizes that are often generated and the hard-impact nature of the deposition process. This thesis describes a new automated gas-driven spray coater for the controlled deposition of a broad variety of solution processed electronic materials. It is specifically suited to the deposition of polymer films such as poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT), overcoming many of the usual disadvantages of conventional gas-driven spray coaters. Key features of the system include: a novel, high performance 3 D-printed spray-head for the generation of ultrafine sprays; full three-dimensional position and velocity control of the spray head; integrated temperature control; and independent control of solution and gas flow rates. To determine the optimum solution composition for spray-deposition of P 3 HT films, the aggregation and gelation dynamics of various P 3 HT/o-xylene solutions were first investigated by static light scattering. On {{the basis of these}} measurements, we conclude that dilute solutions (with polymer concentration < 5 mg/ml) of low (< 20 kg/mol) molecular weight polymer containing a small amount of a secondary solvent. are optimal for avoiding gelation and clogging of the spay-head. For higher weight material, heating of the solution is necessary to avoid gelation. The thesis also describes the development of an optical profiling technique for the characterisation of polymer films, which provides a fast method for quantitatively characterising the uniformity of large-area, thin polymer films. Using this technique, we were able to confirm that the spray-deposition system yields high quality, thin semiconducting polymer films, allowing for the controlled fabrication of active layers in organic photovoltaic devices from non-chlorinated solvents. The influence of solution composition and deposition variables such as gas pressure, solvent composition and substrate temperature were investigated, and optimised conditions for the deposition of high quality (device-grade) thin P 3 HT films were thereby identified.
