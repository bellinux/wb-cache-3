2500|$|When {{trust assets}} are {{mixed up with}} {{property}} of the trustee, or other people, the general approach of the courts is to resolve the issues in favour of the wronged beneficiary. For example, in Re Hallett's Estate, a solicitor sold £2145 worth of bonds he was meant to hold for his client and {{put the money in}} his account. Although money had subsequently been drawn and redeposited in the account, the balance of £3000 was enough to return all the money to his clients. According to Lord Jessel MR, a fiduciary [...] "cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust money when he had a right to take away his own money". Again, in Re Oatway, a trustee who took money and made a deposit with his bank account, and then bought shares which rose in value, was held by Joyce J to have used the beneficiary's money on the shares. This was the most beneficial result possible. When trust assets are mixed up with money from other beneficiaries, the courts have had more difficulty. Originally, by the rule in Clayton's case, it was said that the money taken out of a bank account would be presumed to come from the first person's money that was put in. So in that case it meant that when a banking partnership, before it went insolvent, made payments to one of its depositors, Mr Clayton, the payments made discharged the debt of the first partner that died. However, this [...] "first in, first out" [...] rule is essentially disapplied in all but the simplest cases. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan Woolf LJ held that it would not apply if it might be 'impracticable or result in injustice', or if it ran contrary to the parties intentions. There, Vaughan was one of a multitude of investors in Barlow Clowes' <b>managed</b> <b>fund</b> portfolios. Their investments had been numerous, of different sizes and over long periods of time, and each investor knew that they had bought into a collective investment scheme. Accordingly, when Barlow Clowes went insolvent, each investor was held to simply share the loss proportionately, or pari passu. A third alternative, said by Leggatt LJ to generally be fairer (though complex to compute) is to share losses through a [...] "rolling pari passu" [...] system. Given the complexity of the accounts, and the trading of each investor, this approach was not used in Vaughan, but it would have seen a proportionate reduction of all account holders' interest at each step of an account's depletion. A significant topic of debate, however, is whether the courts should allow tracing into an asset which has been bought on credit. The weight of authority suggests this is possible, either through subrogation, or on the justification that the assets of a recipient who pays off a debt on a thing are [...] "swollen". In Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan, however, the Court of Appeal held that pensioners of the crooked newspaper owner, Robert Maxwell, who had their money stolen, could not have a charge over the money in whose overdrawn accounts their money was deposited. It was said that when money was put into an overdrawn account, it was simply exhausted, and even if the money had been later used for the company's purposes, the law must end the tracing exercise. This result was doubted by the Privy Council in Brazil v Durant International Corporation, as Lord Toulson advised that backwards tracing is possible if there is [...] "a coordination between the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of the asset which is the subject of the tracing claim, looking at the whole transaction, such as to warrant the court attributing the value of the interest acquired to the misuse of the trust fund." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} fund mergers and liquidations are {{significant}} as the <b>managed</b> <b>funds</b> industry continues to evolve. This thesis fills a much needed {{gap in the}} <b>managed</b> <b>funds</b> literature through providing insight into causes and implications of mergers and liquidation of <b>managed</b> <b>funds.</b> The thesis explores this {{through a number of}} aspects. Firstly, the thesis develops a framework for conceptualising the causes of <b>managed</b> <b>funds</b> termination and describes the differences between strategic mergers, distressed mergers and liquidations. Then, the thesis investigates the probabilities of fund termination for Australian, French and UK <b>managed</b> <b>funds,</b> and the relationship between a fund’s probability of termination and various fund characteristics. Further, this thesis investigates the determinants for the funds’ termination status and identifies factors that influence whether a fund is merged or liquidated. Finally, this thesis investigates the impact of alternative weighting schemes on the performance of master trusts - which can serve as mitigants for the impact of mergers and liquidations, specifically addressing the problem of estimation error in forming master trust portfolios. Results from statistical analysis show important insights into the causes of mergers and liquidation of <b>managed</b> <b>funds.</b> It is found that alpha, skewness and fund family size are significant factors influencing a fund’s probability of termination, and that a larger fund is less likely to terminate. Also, skewness and family size significantly influence the termination status of a fund. From these results, this thesis discusses the implications for regulating mergers and liquidations of <b>managed</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

The focus is on Swedish and Global funds, which are the most popular choices among private investors in Sweden. The results of the study show that active management generally provides a higher risk- adjusted return for the private investor during a long term investment.
