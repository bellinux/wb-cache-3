50|$|The Accuflow <b>Multiphase</b> <b>Metering</b> System is {{an example}} of advance test separator. It {{separates}} gas from liquid for 2 Phase measurement. The main principle of the Accuflow is to effectively separate the free gas from the liquid phase and to measure each phase independently, but with more automation than a conventional seperator. With complete separation, the measurement equipment used in each phase can be utilized to their maximum effectiveness and potential.The separation of gas and liquid occurs in the Accuflow in 2 stages. Stage 1, the liquid enters a vertical pipe at a downward tangential angle creating a cyclonic action in the pipe. This cyclonic action pushes the liquid towards the pipe wall and enables the majority of the gas to release {{to the center of the}} pipe and travel up to the gas run. The liquid with some remaining gas is carried into a secondary stage of separation.|$|E

The need for cost and size reduction and the severe effects of high watercut production (> 70 % watercut) on accuracy are forcing careful evaluation of <b>multiphase</b> <b>metering</b> methods.

We have developed software models of conventional and compact separation, which allow comparison in cost and size for equal performance. Separator performance is defined here in terms of gas carry under (GCU) into the liquid stream and liquid carry over (LCO) into the gas stream. These models demonstrate that separation can rarely {{be considered to be}} perfect and that optimal system design must take realistic incomplete separation of gas and liquid into account.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{hydrocarbon}} production has resulted in improved oilfield management using various control and optimization strategies. These strategies increasingly require downhole equipment to obtain real-time {{oil and gas production}} rates with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, downhole <b>multiphase</b> <b>metering</b> can improve the production of horizontal wells by allocating the zones of oil, gas and water inflow. However, the existing downhole multiphase meters are expensive, inaccurate or accurate only within a limited operating range and therefore such monitoring is unrealistic. To overcome these problems one can use the so-called multiphase soft-sensors, i. e. estimating flow rates from conventional sensors (e. g. pressure gauges) in combination with a dynamic multiphase flow model. This methodology uses inverse modeling concepts to estimate flow rates that are not measured directly. Based on the analysis of the transient pressure response due to a rapid inflow, a real-time estimator is proposed, which uses a dynamic model of the multiphase wellbore flow and information from conventional pressure sensors. The feasibility of the proposed concept is assessed via simulation-based case studies both for noisy synthetic measurements and for artificial data generated by the OLGA simulator. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|For {{single phase}} flow meters {{more and better}} non-intrusive or even clamp-on meters become available. This allows for a wider use of meters and for easier flow control. As the demand for <b>multiphase</b> <b>meters</b> is increasing, the current aim {{is to develop a}} non-intrusive <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meter.</b> The non-intrusive {{techniques}} ideally must use simpler technologies used in <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meters</b> already present on the market. This simplification reduces capital and operation expenditures of the flow meter an end used has to incur. The technology for a <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meter</b> proposed here, is based on non-intrusive soft-sensing techniques to extract signals generated by a multiphase flow. Outer pipe wall accelerations are measured at different positions by simple non-intrusive accelerometers. The accelerometers generate a signal from which characteristic multiphase flow parameters are extracted. For instance, in case of intermittent flows, slug velocity and slug frequency arc reconstructed. These parameters are subsequently used in semi-empirical models. The models relate the parameters with flow rates of gas and liquid - operation parameters we are looking for. The algorithm for signal processing and analysis results in a good estimation of the liquid and the gas flow rates. In a certain range of 'GVF (gas volume fraction) the estimation results in flow rate measurement at commercially accepted accuracy. An important asset of the described construction of the <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meter</b> is its simplicity. The simplicity extends applicability of the flow meter which can be used in oil wells, flow lines as well as in process installations.

40|$|Multiphase {{flow in the}} oil and gas {{industry}} covers a wide range of flows. Thus, over the last decade, the investigation, development and use of multiphase flow metering system have been a major focus for the industry worldwide. However, these meters do not perform well in slug flow conditions. The present work involves experimental investigations of multiphase flow measurement under slug flow conditions. A two-phase gas/liquid facility was designed and constructed at Cranfield University. It consisted of a 0. 05 m diameter 25 m long horizontal pipeline with the necessary instrumentation. An ultrasonic <b>multiphase</b> <b>metering</b> concept has been proposed and investigated. The concept was based on the combination of non-invasive and non-intrusive ultrasonic sensors and a slug closure model. The slug closure model was based on the "slug unit" model to infer the gas and liquid phase volumetric flowrates. The slug characteristics obtained by non-invasive and non-intrusive ultrasonic techniques were inputs to slug closure model which calculates the factors KI (Liquid), K 2 (Liquid), K 3 (Gas) and K 4 (Gas). These factors are function of the slip ratio in the slug body, flow profile (CO), drift velocity (Vd), liquid holdup and gas void fraction in slug body, slug length, film length, and the total length of the slug unit. Based on ultrasonic sensor measurements, the slug translational velocity was estimated and the slug closure model then calculates the gas and liquid phase volumetric flowrates. Air water slug flow data were gathered and processed for a range of superficial velocities VSL= 0. 3 to 1. 03 ms' 1 and VsG= 0. 6 to 3. 01 ms' 1. The overall goal of a 5 % relative error metering for both phases was not achieved for the conditions tested. The liquid phase percentage errors were from - 63. 6 % to 45. 4 % while the gas phase percentage errors were from 42 % to - 14. 6 %.

40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of downhole oil, gas and water flows in wells can significantly improve the production performance of these wells when this flow rate information {{is used to}} manipulate inflow control valves. An {{example of this is}} the allocation of a gas or water cone to its entrance point in a multilateral well, allowing to close down the individual well where the gas or water cone occurs, instead of closing down the complete well. Downhole {{monitoring of}} flows can be done via direct measurement. However, downhole <b>multiphase</b> <b>metering</b> is either expensive, inaccurate, or too difficult due to the harsh conditions. An alternative is to use softsensors. Softsensors estimate downhole holdups and flow rates from (relatively) cheap and reliable conventional downhole meters, such as pressure and temperature measurements, and a dynamic multiphase flow model connecting these measurements with the quantities of interest. Soft-sensing has already been investigated before for unilateral wells in Bloemen et al. (2004) and Leskens et al. (2008). In the second of these references, the simultaneous estimation of downhole oil, water and gas flows from downhole pressure and temperature measurements is considered. It is shown there that this estimation is badly conditioned (i. e. badly observable) and, thereby, not feasible in a practical situation. Using a similar approach and focussing on gas-lift wells, in Bloemen et al. (2004) it is suggested that soft-sensing with only downhole pressure and temperature measurements should work for the case that only a liquid and gas flow are estimated. In this paper, within the same soft-sensing framework as used in the mentioned two references, solutions are sought for soft-sensing of multilateral wells, both for the two-phase (gas and liquid) and three-phase (oil, water and gas) case. For that purpose, first, the question is addressed whether the unilateral two-phase case truly can be solved using only downhole pressure and temperature measurements. If so, the multilateral two-phase case is automatically solved with the corresponding soft-sensing solution simply consisting of a collection of unilateral two-phase sensors, one for each branch. It is shown that this solution is indeed feasible. After that, the three phase case is addressed. It is shown that for this case soft-sensing of multilateral wells is not possible, even when adding surface measurements and even though, as also shown here, it is possible for the unilateral well case when adding such measurements...|$|E
40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas {{reservoirs}} {{the knowledge}} of the produced volumes of oil, gas and water from single well is important for efficiency and performance monitoring. Conventional metering systems require a two or three phase separator, followed by independent metering device for each phase. This systems need expensive and cumbersome test separators, high maintenance and field personnel intervention. They require also regular intervention by trained personnel and cannot provide continuous well monitoring. A viable and functional alternative to multiphase separators are Multiphase Flow Metering (MFM) systems. A Multiphase Flow Meter is a device to simultaneously quantify oil, water and gas flow rates in pipelines. These measurement are generally unmet but vital in the oil industry, that began to develop and use MFM in the early 1980 s especially in the off-shore oil production. The oil companies that give their main contribution to the development of MFMs are BP, Texaco, Shell, Agip and Petrobas. MFM also find a lot of application in the nuclear, food, mining and biofuels industries. MFM applications can help facility production, well testing, reservoir management, allocation metering production, well monitoring for optimization and flow assurance, subsea metering and costs, including minimizing environmental impact. MFM focus is to determinate the flow rates of the individual components (oil, water and gas) without physically separating of the flow stream in each phase. MFM is considered among the primary metering solutions for new field development. Cause the great diversity of oil field conditions, MFMs are required to work under a very wide range conditions of flow rates, gas/oil ratio, water/oil ratio, pressure, temperature, pipe size, viscosity. Hence, it is necessary to study and describe the expected flow regimes from the wells. The biggest obstacle to the successful implementation of <b>multiphase</b> <b>metering</b> is the general lack of understanding of what it is about. Multiphase flow is a complex phenomenon which can be difficulty predicted by numerical simulations. The aim of the present work is to contribute to the MFM improvement. The device studied in this work is a control valve with a measurement system integrated which can measure the flow of each phase in two-phase flow, constituted by liquid and gas. The measuring system consists of a flow meter based on pressure difference measurements on the valve body, that allows to calculate liquid flow rate, and on the internal part present {{in the body of the}} valve, that allows to calculate the total flow. In this way it will be possible to calculate liquid and gas flow rates. The device should have a good accuracy. This focus have been set on an error less than ± 10 %...|$|E

The composition of the oil was thoroughly characterized using an extended saturates−aromatics−resins−asphaltenes analysis, high-temperature gas chromatography, and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The relative dielectric permittivities of the emulsions (10 − 50 % water volume fraction) were measured at 1 kHz using a coaxial capacitor and between 0. 2 and 13. 5 GHz using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. The dielectric permittivity {{is one of the}} properties used by some <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meters</b> to determine water volume fractions in production systems. The water volume fractions calculated from the measured oil, water, and emulsion permittivities using the Bruggeman equation were systematically above the measured water fraction by an average of 10 % and a maximum of 20 %.

40|$|Crude oil {{composition}} and properties {{have been subject}} for research for several decades, {{as well as the}} correlation between the chemical composition and physical properties of crude oil. The physical properties of crude oil are strongly dependent upon the chemical composition of the oil, and both physical properties and composition provide important information for the oil producers as different challenges might occur when handling certain types of crude oil; corrosion, deposition of solids and plugging of pipelines are just some examples. As a mean of detecting possible threats and monitoring the flow through the pipelines, a number of metering devices can be applied, for example a <b>Multiphase</b> Flow <b>Meter,</b> which can provide measurements of the water cut and the flow rates of oil, gas and water in pipelines, as well as pressure and density. The aim of this work is to improve the general understanding of how the distribution of the different compounds in crude oil influence the physical properties of crude oil, in particular the properties that are involved in <b>Multiphase</b> Flow <b>Metering,</b> where permittivity is of special relevance. By improving this understanding, the project seeks to improve the knowledge base on the interactions between the chemistry of the petroleum fluids and the parameters that provide the basis for the performance of the <b>Multiphase</b> Flow <b>Metering</b> systems. In this work, calibration models of several physical properties and compositional data has been built, based on GC and IR data respectively. Several of the models are obtained with good predictive quality, for instance the models for static and high frequency permittivity, density and velocity of sound. Also, a clear biodegradation effect has been identified in the regression coefficients for these properties, indicating that biodegradation has a significant effect on their variation. A multivariate calculation tool for estimation of static permittivity of crude oils based on PVT data has been developed during the thesis work, and this tool has been vi applied by Roxar ASA. The tool gives a better initial calibration of the <b>Multiphase</b> Flow <b>Metering</b> systems, as the static permittivity is more accurately determined compared to the previously used methods.

40|$|<b>Multiphase</b> flow <b>meters</b> are {{indispensable}} {{tools for}} achieving optimal operation {{and control of}} wells as these meters deliver real-time information about their performance. For example, <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meters</b> located downhole can improve the production of multilateral and multizone wells by timely allocating the zone where a gas or water cone occurs. However, <b>multiphase</b> <b>meters</b> are either expensive, inaccurate, or cannot be used downhole due to the harsh conditions. An alternative {{that can be used}} to overcome these disadvantages is to use multiphase soft-sensors, i. e. to estimate holdups and flow rates from relatively cheap and reliable conventional meters, such as pressure and temperature measurements, and a dynamic model connecting these measurements with the unknown quantities. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate, via two simulation based case studies, some possibilities and limitations of such multiphase soft-sensors. In the first case study the question is adressed whether it is possible to use only downhole pressure and temperatures measurements to estimate in real-time the water, oil and gas flow rates in a well. This question is of practical importance as these measurements are relatively cheap and reliable. The second case addresses the question whether it is possible to allocate the gas cone in a well with multiple inflow points or zones. This question is relevant as the estimated flow rate and holdup profiles can be used to manipulate Inflow Control Valves in such a way that gas breakthrough is prevented. Using amongst others OLGA data as "real-life" data, an additional question addressed here is what the influence is of soft-sensor model error and measurement noise on the quality of the estimates. From the first case study it can be concluded that, due to bad observability, pressure and temperature measurements alone are not sufficient to accurately estimate in real-time well flow composition parameters in a practically relevant situation. The preliminary results discussed in the second case study indicate that a soft-sensing solution to the gas cone allocation problem may very well be feasible.

Development of a cost-effective <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meter</b> to determine the individual phase flow rates of oil, water and gas was experimentally investigated by means of low cost, simple and non-intrusive commercially available sensors. Features from absolute pressure, differential pressure (axial), gamma densitometer, conductivity and capacitance meters, in combination with pattern recognition techniques were used to detect shifts in flow conditions, such as flow structure, pressure and salinity changes and measured multiphase flow parameters simultaneously {{without the need for}} preconditioning or prior knowledge of either phase. The experiments were carried out at the National Engineering Laboratory (NEL) Multiphase facility. Data was sampled at 250 Hz across a wide spectrum of flow conditions. Fluids used were nitrogen gas, oil (Forties and Beryl crude oil – D 80, 33 o API gravity) and water (salinity levels of 50 and 100 g/l MgSO 4). The sensor spool piece was horizontally mounted on a 4 -inch (102 mm) pipe, and the database was obtained from two different locations on the flow loop. The ability to learn from ‘experience’ is a feature of neural networks. The use of neural networks allows re-calibration of the measuring system on line through a retraining process when new information becomes available. Some benefits and capabilities of intelligent multiphase flow systems include:  Reduction in the physical size of installations.  Sensor fusion by merging the operating envelopes of different sensors employed provided even better results.  Monitoring of flow conditions, not just flow rate but also composition of components.  Using conventional sensors within the system will present the industry with a much lower cost <b>multiphase</b> <b>meter,</b> and better reliability.

Thus, {{over the last three}} decades; the development and deployment of in-line <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>metering</b> systems has been a major focus worldwide. Accurate measurement of multiphase flow in {{the oil and gas industry}} is difficult because there is a wide range of flow regimes and <b>multiphase</b> <b>meters</b> do not generally perform well under the intermittent slug flow conditions which commonly occur in oil production. This thesis investigates the use of Doppler and cross-correlation ultrasonic measurements made in different high gas void fraction flow, partially separated liquid and gas flows, and homogeneous flow and raw slug flow, to assess the accuracy of measurement in these regimes. This approach has been tested on water/air flows in a 50 mm diameter pipe facility. The system employs a partial gas/liquid separation and homogenisation using a T-Y junction configuration. A combination of ultrasonic measurement techniques was used to measure flow velocities and conductivity rings to measure the gas fraction. In the partially separated regime, ultrasonic cross-correlation and conductivity rings are used to measure the liquid flow-rate. In the homogeneous flow, a clamp-on ultrasonic Doppler meter is used to measure the homogeneous velocity and combined with conductivity ring measurements to provide measurement of the liquid and gas flow-rates. The slug flow regime measurements employ the raw Doppler shift data from the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter, together with the slug flow closure equation and combined with gas fraction obtained by conductivity rings, to determine the liquid and gas flow-rates. Measurements were made with liquid velocities from 1. 0 m/s to 2. 0 m/s with gas void fractions up to 60 %. Using these techniques the accuracies of the liquid flow-rate measurement in the partially separated, homogeneous and slug regimes were 10 %, 10 % and 15 % respectively. The accuracy of the gas flow-rate in both the homogeneous and raw slug regimes was 10 %. The method offers the possibility of further improvement in the accuracy by combining measurement from different regimes...|$|R

The prevailing conditions of high pressure and temperature of the flow regimes makes actual measurement a great challenge. The velocity differences between phases (hold up and slip) means unless the velocities of individual phases and concentrations are known, the true flow rate is practically impossible to obtain. The system comprised of two cameras, laser source, optical arrangement, computer data acquisition system, synchronizer and MATLAB based software. An algorithm that correlates the cameras view to the volume within the pipe has been developed through this research. The computer acquires image signals from the upstream and/or downstream cameras, and carries out the calculation of cross correlation between the two image frames so that the velocity of each pixel can be found. A Gas Liquid Chromatograph (GLC) provides the composition (concentration) of the gas and the liquid hydrocarbon (HC). The product of phase velocity and phase concentration provides the flow rate of the individual phase. This work provides theoretical analysis and experimental validations, and discusses the advantages of the system and its further development...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{overview}} of the intrumentation techniques developped for multiphase flow analysis either in gas/liquid or in gas/liquid/solid reactors. To characterize properly such reactors, experimental data have to be acquired at different space scale or time frequency. The existing <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>metering</b> described give information concerning reactor hydrodynamics such as pressure, phases holdups, phases velocities, flow regime, size and shape of dispersed inclusions, axial dispersion coefficients. The measuring techniques are presented in two groups: the non-intrusive techniques that deliver global, cross-section-averaged or local data, and the intrusive probes that are dedicated to local measurements. Eventually some examples of multiphase instrumentation development are reported (trickle-bed and slurry bubble column at semi-industrial scale) in the refinery or petrochemical area...|$|R
40|$|Requirement for the {{radioactive}} source used in <b>multiphase</b> flow <b>meter</b> {{is that the}} overall shape dimensions must be fixed and the the maximum output rate of photons must be improved to 1. 5 {{times more than the}} former. As the former preparation process can not satisfy the requirement, the composition of surface glaze was changed {{in order to reduce the}} self-absorption and improve the photons’ output rate, the ratio between surface glaze and Am- 241 oxidizes was optimized, the input of radioactive material was increased,but the size of certain shape and active zone was fixed. The results showed that various kinds of technical index all satisfied demands of international standard and the feedback was good in sevice. ...|$|R
