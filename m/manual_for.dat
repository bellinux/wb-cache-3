He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5|$|Hillcourt was tasked {{to write}} a new <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good friend and {{colleague}} E. Urner Goodman, the national program director of the BSA. He and his wife moved to a house in Mendham Borough, New Jersey, to be near Schiff Scout Reservation, the BSA's national training center, {{so he could be}} in place to put this theories to a practical test. In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA. As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16years.|$|E

The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E

5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive {{decided on}} {{standard}} types of signs {{to be used}} at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, very often in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> the use of signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents {{which could not be}} practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Collins won the Democratic {{nomination}} for Clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in a five-way primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Joseph E. Lambert {{by a vote}} of 382,528 to 233,442. During her term, an amendment to the state constitution changed the name of the Court of Appeals to the Kentucky Supreme Court; Collins was the last person to hold the office of Clerk of the Court of Appeals and the first to hold the office of Clerk of the Supreme Court. As Clerk, she compiled and distributed a brochure about the new role of the Supreme Court, and worked with the state department of education to create a teacher's <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> use in the public schools, detailing the changes effected in the court system {{as a result of the}} constitutional amendment. The Woodford County chapter of Business and Professional Women chose Collins as its 1976 Woman of Achievement, and in 1977, Governor Julian Carroll named her Kentucky Executive Director of the Friendship Force.|$|E

5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E
5|$|An {{enhanced}} PC version titled Cave Story+ {{was released}} by Nicalis on the Steam service on 22 November 2011. Cave Story+ features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, {{as well as the}} option to toggle the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. Recently the game got an update that added exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story + on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color <b>manual</b> <b>for</b> the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog.|$|E

40|$|As huge {{quantities}} of documents have become available, services using {{natural language processing}} technologies trained by huge corpora have emerged, such as information retrieval and information extraction. In this paper we verify the usefulness of resource-based, or corpus-based, translation in the aviation domain as a real business situation. This study is important from both a business perspective and an academic perspective. Intuitively, <b>manuals</b> <b>for</b> similar products, or <b>manuals</b> <b>for</b> {{different versions of the}} same product, are likely to resemble each other. Therefore, even with only a small training data, a corpus-based MT system can output useful translations. The corpus-based approach is powerful when the target is repetitive. <b>Manuals</b> <b>for</b> similar products, or <b>manuals</b> <b>for</b> different versions of the same product, are real-world documents that are repetitive. Our experiments on translation of manual documents are still in a beginning stage. However, the BLEU score from very small number of training sentences is already rather high. We believe corpus-based machine translation is a player full of promise in this kind of actual business scene. 1...|$|R
