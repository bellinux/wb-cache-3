50|$|He {{was born}} at <b>Montagnac</b> in Gascony. He {{received}} a military education and went to Paris in 1748 to study mathematics. He led a dissipated life and endeavoured {{to curry favor with}} the marquise de Pompadour by secretly sending her a box of poison and then informing her of the supposed plot against her life, hoping that he could earn a reward of cash for warning her. The ruse was discovered, and Mme de Pompadour, not appreciating the humor of the situation, had Latude put in the Bastille on 1 May 1749.|$|E
50|$|This flat stage {{departed}} from Carcassonne, heading east through Caunes-Minervois and Siran to the Category 4 climb of the Côte de Minerve to 245 m. The riders then descended to Aigues-Vives, and turned north-east {{to climb the}} Category 4 Côte de Villespassans to 207 m descending through Saint-Chinian to Cessenon-sur-Orb. Continuing east, the riders passed through Murviel-lès-Béziers, Magalas and Alignan-du-Vent to an intermediate sprint at Pézenas. The race then headed through <b>Montagnac,</b> passing Valmagne Abbey, and continuing on through Montbazin. Bearing towards the north-east, the race headed through Pignan {{to the finish line}} in Montpellier.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} is the Chameau (Camel) of Béziers, which dates from 1613, {{two years earlier}} than the Poulain of Pézenas. There is a large and {{impressive}} Boeuf (Bull) at Mèze, with a huge mouth; {{it is said to}} date back to at least 1229. Lo Picart, at Saint-Jean-de-Fos, is a ferocious ram; it has existed since at least 1683. <b>Montagnac</b> has a goat. Sometimes the choice of animal is based on a play on words: Loupian has, unsurprisingly, a wolf (Loup). (One of the most recent, and possibly the most bizarre, [...] "totems" [...] is Le Porquet of Pinet, a caterpillar, created in the early 1970s.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{encounter}} was unplanned {{and poorly}} commanded by <b>Montagnac,</b> and went badly for the French troops. After a first encounter, the French's numbers were reduced from 450 to 82 chasseurs and hussars against hundreds of Algerians (Abd-el-Qader's never massed more than ca. 500 horsemen for pitched battle) Cornered, the chasseurs of the carabinier company {{took refuge in}} a marabout, from which they repulsed all assaults. After a siege lasting many days, without food or water and short of munitions, they were reduced to cutting up their musket balls {{in order to keep}} firing. Emir Abdelkader captured captain adjutant major Dutertre and taken under guard {{to the front of the}} marabout to demand the chasseurs' surrender, but instead used his time there to exhort the survivors to fight to the death, for which Abdelkader beheaded him. Abdelkader then demanded that the French bugler sound the retreat, but he instead sounded the charge, whilst one chasseur replied to another of Abdelkader's other demands for their surrender with the word, Merde! (Shit). (in reference to Cambronne's answer at Waterloo). When the remaining 80 survivors completely ran out of munitions, they managed to break through the enemy lines with a bayonet charge, but only 16 of them managed to rejoin the French lines (5 of which died some days later). Among the dead was <b>Montagnac</b> himself. The remains of the soldiers killed at Sidi Brahim were gathered at Djemmaa Ghazaouet in the [...] "Tombeau des Braves" [...] then reburied at the Musée des Chasseurs at the old fort in Vincennes in 1965.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} smaller, junior Poulains in Pézenas, made by or for children; the Pézenas fadas {{also have a}} {{full-sized}} version of their own. There have also been similar creatures or imitations elsewhere, some of which still continue. There is a very lively Poulain at Saint-Thibéry and others are (or have been) known at Adissan, Alignan-du-Vent, Florensac, Montblanc and Vias (where it is linked to a local legend of a medieval famine and is known as lo Pouli de la Fabo - the colt of the bean). They have also been recorded at Agde, Caux, <b>Montagnac,</b> Castelnau, Valros and Nizas, all in the Languedoc. An outlier in the Ariège, at St Pierre de Soulan, was instigated by a former inhabitant of Pézenas.|$|E
50|$|As of 1878 {{the company}} had also opened the Korezza, Bou-Hamra and Marouaina mines.Before the Mokta {{deposits}} started showing signs of running out Alphonse Parran obtained the deposit of Rar El Baroud near Béni Saf in 1879.The ore in the Béni Saf region near <b>Montagnac</b> (now named Remchi) is hematite with 2% manganese.Between 1867 and 1947 the region produced 30 million metric tons of ore.Alphonse Parran was also involved in the Kryvyi Rih iron ore mine in Russia in 1881 and the Gafsa phosphate deposits in Tunisia in 1886.In Tunisia as of 1893 the company owned concessions at Ras Radjid, Bou lanague, Dj Bellif and Ganara in the Kroumine between Tabarka and Cap Serrat.The ores, which {{had not yet been}} worked, were brown and red hematites with an average of 50% iron.|$|E
5000|$|The extreme bravery {{shown by}} the {{battalion}} led to its being nicknamed the battalion of Sidi-Brahim and the battle being written up among its battle honours. However, according to Gilles Manceron, the soldiers [...] "were led in quite an inconsiderate manner" [...] by Colonel de <b>Montagnac</b> [...] "whose writings boast, with no remorse, of several war crimes". The expression [...] "faire Sidi Brahim" [...] became a motto of the chasseurs. During the First World War, the 7th Battalion of Chasseurs Alpins took a German pass for several days and, lacking munitions, managed to repulse the German attack with stones. There the chasseurs won the nickname [...] "schwarzen Teufel" [...] (black devils), which later became [...] "blue devils", which they still use. The insignia of the 7th is a devil (representing them and their Sidi Brahim) in a hunting horn (representing the chasseurs).|$|E
50|$|Among others testimonies, Lieutenant-colonel Lucien de <b>Montagnac</b> {{wrote on}} 15 March 1843, {{in a letter}} to a friend:All populations who do not accept our {{conditions}} must be despoiled. Everything must be seized, devastated, without age or sex distinction: grass must not grow any more where the French army has set foot. Who wants the end wants the means, whatever may say our philanthropists. I personally warn all good soldiers whom I have the honour to lead that if they happen to bring me a living Arab, they will receive a beating with the flat of the saber.... This is how, my dear friend, we must make war against Arabs: kill all men over the age of fifteen, take all their women and children, load them onto naval vessels, send them to the Marquesas Islands or elsewhere. In one word, annihilate all who will not crawl beneath our feet like dogs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recurrent}} {{figure in}} Gaulish iconography is a deity sitting cross-legged with antlers, sometimes surrounded by animals, often wearing or holding a torc. The name usually applied to him, Cernunnos, is attested {{only a few}} times, on the Pillar of the Boatmen a relief in Paris (currently reading ERNUNNOS, but an early sketch shows it as having read CERNUNNOS in the 18th century), an inscription from <b>Montagnac</b> (αλλετεινος καρνονου αλισοντεας, [...] "Alletinos this to Carnonos of Alisontea"), {{and a pair of}} identical inscriptions from Seinsel-Rëlent ("Deo Ceruninco"). Figured representations of this sort of deity, however, are widespread; the earliest known was found at Val Camonica in northern Italy, while the most famous is plate A of the Gundestrup Cauldron, a 1st-century BCE vessel found in Denmark. On the Gundestrup Cauldron and sometimes elsewhere, Cernunnos, or similar figure, is accompanied by a ram-headed serpent. At Reims, the figure is depicted with a cornucopia overflowing with grains or coins.|$|E
