5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> full, but bad when the <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to}} have formed {{as a result of}} a single, large head-on collision.|$|E
5|$|The crater Nöther on the {{far side}} of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> named after her.|$|E

5|$|Two <b>moons</b> <b>were</b> {{claimed to}} be {{discovered}} by different astronomers but never seen again. Both <b>moons</b> <b>were</b> said to orbit between Titan and Hyperion.|$|R
50|$|On September 12, 2001, {{the full}} <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> shown. The actual {{phase of the}} <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> a waning {{crescent}} {{less than a week}} away from a new moon.|$|R

5|$|Because the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out}} in 1910, and {{named in honor of}} Jack Moon, its first inhabitant. A post office called <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1911, and remained in operation until 1953.|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{cast in the}} Korean {{adaption}} of Criminal Minds. The same year, <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> cast in Auspicious Grave, {{the third}} installment of the [...] "divining art trilogy" [...] by Han Jae-rim.|$|R
25|$|On 22 April 1961, Team <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> overrun. Two sergeants were killed, {{and team}} leader Captain Walter H. <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> captured; {{he was later}} {{executed}} while trying to escape captivity. Another sergeant was released sixteen months later.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to}} have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} {{explanation is that the}} Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> visible for {{two weeks}} every 27.3 days at the North and South Pole. The Moon's light is used by {{zooplankton}} in the Arctic {{when the sun is}} below the horizon for months on end.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening weekend}} of The Twilight Saga: New <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> the ninth-highest opening weekend in {{domestic}} history with $142,839,137. The film {{also has the}} sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total.|$|E
5|$|The Neptunian <b>moons</b> <b>are</b> {{listed here}} by orbital period, from {{shortest}} to longest. Irregular (captured) <b>moons</b> <b>are</b> marked by color. Triton, the only Neptunian moon massive enough for its surface to have collapsed into a spheroid, is bolded.|$|R
50|$|<b>Moon</b> has <b>been</b> a model {{since his}} {{traditional}} 100th day celebration in 2007. Prior to his 2008 movie Baby and I {{he was involved}} in an entertainment company and appeared in magazines. In 2010 <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> a model for the Benetton Group fashion brand. In 2012 <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> chosen as the face of kid’s brand R.ROBOT.|$|R
50|$|As {{a program}} {{director}} with the online organizing group Demand Progress, <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> active organization {{helped lead the}} fight against the Stop Online Piracy Act and related bills. <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> a co-editor of a book about that effort, called Hacking Politics.|$|R
5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in The Rape of the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> also designated UranusI.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along {{the rim of the}} crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
50|$|The Pejeng <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> first {{reported}} to the western world by G.E. Rumphius in his book The Ambonese Curiosity Cabinet, published in 1705. The <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> first systematically described by the Dutch artist W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp who reproduced the famous face motif.|$|R
50|$|In June 2007, <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{laid off}} from his {{position}} at Nonesuch as part of corporate downsizing in Warner Music Group. A few days later, <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> named senior director of A&R and artistic development at Rykodisc, also owned by WMG.|$|R
25|$|Valian Year of the {{creation}} of Sun and <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> now given as 5000, so that the time between {{the creation}} of Arda and the rising of the Sun and <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> now the equivalent of 47,910 solar years instead of 30,000.|$|R
5|$|Craters of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 {{cuts through the}} northwestern part of the {{monument}} and provides access to it. However, the rugged landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, Morgan and Lizzie are met by Alain Magnan, who orders Morgan {{to capture}} the Spanish {{treasure}} ships while he rushes ahead {{to capture the}} lake. Together Morgan and Lizzie capture the fleet, killing Delgado in the process, and capture Sahin. Sahin tells Morgan that the Circle believes the Lake of the <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> the Fountain of Youth and that his intention from the beginning was to prevent the Circle from obtaining the Fountain.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} {{distance}} from Neptune, the regular moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, S/2004 N 1, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune's rotational period is 0.6713 day) {{and thus are}} being tidally decelerated. Naiad, the closest regular <b>moon,</b> <b>is</b> also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of S/2004 N 1), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> born in Birmingham, England to Henry and Audrey Moon. Like his father, <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{educated at}} Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, {{as was his}} elder brother, Richard Henry Quentin Barker Moon, who played {{international}} rugby for England at scrum half.|$|R
50|$|Sea <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> {{sent into}} {{training}} with Michael Stoute at Freemason Lodge stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. He has been ridden {{in most of}} his races by Ryan Moore. In January 2013 Sea <b>Moon</b> <b>was</b> sold to prominent Australian racehorse owner Lloyd Williams.|$|R
60|$|The <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> wading deliciously through {{shallows}} {{of white}} cloud. Beyond {{the trees and}} the few houses was the great concave of darkness, the sea, and the moonlight. The <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> there to put a cool hand of absolution on her brow.|$|R
5|$|In particular, he forms a close {{friendship}} with archaeologist James Moon (Kenneth Branagh), another veteran, who like Birkin has been emotionally scarred by the war. <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{employed in the}} village under the same bequest, working to uncover a mysterious lost grave, but {{is more interested in}} discovering the remains of an earlier Saxon church building in the field next to the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> a {{drama and}} horror visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Ikumi Amasawa.
