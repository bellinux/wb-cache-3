50|$|<b>Monostatic</b> <b>radars</b> have a {{spatially}} co-located transmitter and receiver. It this case, {{the emission}} {{has to be}} insulated from the reception sensors as the energy emitted is far greater than the returned one.|$|R
50|$|Passive (multistatic) radar, {{bistatic}} {{radar and}} especially multistatic radar systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars,</b> since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy {{away from the}} transmitter's line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.|$|R
50|$|Target {{features}} such as variation in the radar cross section or jet engine modulation may be observed by transmitter-receiver pairs within a multistatic system. The gain in information through observation of different aspects of a target may improve classification of the target. Most existing air defence systems utilize a series of networked <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars,</b> without making use of bistatic pairs within the system.|$|R
50|$|Bistatic radar is {{the name}} given to a radar system which {{comprises}} a transmitter and receiver which are separated by a distance that {{is comparable to the}} expected target distance. Conversely, a radar in which the transmitter and receiver are collocated is called a <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar.</b> A system containing multiple spatially diverse <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> or bistatic radar components with a shared area of coverage is called multistatic radar. Many long-range air-to-air and surface-to-air missile systems use semi-active radar homing which is a form of bistatic radar.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> is radar {{in which}} the {{transmitter}} and receiver are collocated. [...] This is the conventional configuration for a radar, but the term is used to distinguish it from a bistatic radar or multistatic radar.|$|E

In the low-frequency Rayleigh scattering limit, where the circumference is less than the wavelength, the normalized RCS is σ/(πR2) ~ 9(kR)4. In the high-frequency optical limit σ/(πR2) ~ 1.|$|E

40|$|Localization and {{navigation}} of passive objects enables new important applications in wireless environments. <b>Monostatic</b> sensor <b>radar</b> networks generate interesting solutions for passive localization {{and navigation}} {{in a variety}} of scenarios. In particular, ultrawide band (UWB) sensing provides fine delay resolution enabling high localization accuracy even in harsh prop- agation environments such as indoor. We develop a framework for design and analysis of passive navigation based on UWB <b>monostatic</b> sensor <b>radar</b> networks that relies on propagation environment and time-of-arrival estimation characterized by network experiments. As a case study, an UWB <b>monostatic</b> sensor <b>radar</b> network deployed in an indoor environment is considered, and the position of moving objects is inferred. In particular, Bayesian navigation based on particle filters implementation is employed and the role of mobility model for inferring target position is shown...|$|R
5000|$|The {{range and}} {{velocity}} {{of a target}} are detected through pulse delay ranging and the Doppler effect (pulse-Doppler), or through the frequency modulation (FM) ranging and range differentiation. The range resolution {{is limited by the}} instantaneous signal bandwidth of the radar sensor in both pulse-Doppler and frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) <b>radars.</b> <b>Monostatic</b> monopulse-Doppler <b>radar</b> sensors offer advantages over FMCW radars, such as: ...|$|R
50|$|GSSR {{can work}} in two {{different}} modes. In the <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> mode, GSSR both transmits and receives. In bistatic mode, GSSR transmits and other radio astronomy facilities receive. Although more difficult to schedule, this offers two advantages - the transmitter {{does not need to}} turn off to allow the receiver to listen, and it allows the use of interferometry to extract more information from the reflected signal.|$|E
5000|$|More precisely, the RCS of a {{radar target}} is the {{hypothetical}} area required to intercept the transmitted power density {{at the target}} such that if the total intercepted power were re-radiated isotropically, the power density actually observed at the receiver is produced. [...] This is a complex statement that can be understood by examining the <b>monostatic</b> (<b>radar</b> transmitter and receiver co-located) radar equation one term at a time: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{bistatic}} {{angle is}} the angle subtended between the transmitter, target and receiver in a bistatic radar. When {{it is exactly}} zero the radar is a <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar,</b> when it is close to zero the radar is pseudo-monostatic, {{and when it is}} close to 180 degrees the radar is a forward scatter radar. Elsewhere, the radar is simply described as a bistatic radar. The bistatic angle {{is an important factor in}} determining the radar cross section of the target.|$|E
50|$|The {{angle of}} a target is {{detected}} by scanning {{the field of view}} with a highly directive beam. This is done electronically, with a phased array antenna, or mechanically by rotating a physical antenna. The emitter and the receiver can be in the same place, as with the <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars,</b> or be separated as in the bistatic radars. Finally, the radar wave emitted can be continuous or pulsed. The choice of the architecture depends on the sensors to be used.|$|R
30|$|<b>Monostatic</b> {{airborne}} <b>radar</b> with sidelooking array antennas has the desirable {{property that}} the relationship between the clutter spatial and Doppler frequencies is both linear and range invariant, i.e., clutter is stationary, thereby enabling its effective suppression using training data from adjacent ranges. However, in many practical applications, for example, <b>monostatic</b> airborne <b>radar</b> with non-sidelooking arrays [4], cylindrical arrays [5], conformal arrays [6], and bistatic airborne radar [7], the clutter spatial-Doppler frequency relationship becomes nonlinear and range dependent, especially at short range, i.e., clutter is non-stationary.|$|R
40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{interpretation of}} the records from a <b>monostatic</b> acoustic <b>radar</b> is presented. This is achieved {{with the aid of}} airplane, helicopter, and rawinsonde temperature soundings. The diurnal structure of a mountain valley circulation pattern is studied with the use of two acoustic radars, one located in the valley and one on the downwind ridge. The <b>monostatic</b> acoustic <b>radar</b> was found to be sufficiently accurate in locating the heights of the inversions and the mixed layer depth to warrant use by industry even in complex terrain...|$|R
50|$|A {{multistatic radar}} system {{contains}} multiple spatially diverse <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> or bistatic radar components with a shared area of coverage. An important distinction of systems {{based on these}} individual radar geometries is the added requirement for some level of data fusion to take place between component parts.The spatial diversity afforded by multistatic systems allows for different aspects of a target to be viewed simultaneously. The potential for information gain can {{give rise to a}} number of advantages over conventional systems.|$|E
5000|$|The Back Scattering Alignment (BSA) is a {{coordinate}} system used in coherent electromagnetic scattering. The {{coordinate system}} is defined {{from the viewpoint}} of the wave source, before and after scattering. The BSA is most commonly used in radar, specifically when working with a Sinclair Matrix because the <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> detector and source are physically coaligned. BSA gives rise to conjugate eigenvalue equations. The alternative coordinate system in electromagnetic scattering is the Forward Scattering Alignment (FSA) which is primarily used in optics. Both coordinate systems contain essentially the same information and meaning, and thus a scattering matrix can be transformed {{from one to the other}} by use of the matrix, ...|$|E
30|$|Inverse {{synthetic}} Radar (ISAR) imaging {{becomes an}} important approach to achieve high resolution images of moving targets {{from a long}} distance, which are very useful for automatic target recognition and other applications. For observing target from a fixed aspect, only limited target information {{can be obtained by}} a <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> even through the sophisticated ISAR imaging algorithm, and thus a high resolution ISAR image is sometimes unable produced in the case of target moving along the line of sight(LOS)[1 – 3]. In order to overcome these limitations in conventional <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar,</b> the bistatic radar system becomes a hot research topic[3, 4].|$|E
40|$|Passive network {{localization}} via wireless sensor radars (WSRs) {{is rising}} interest for applications in civilian, commercial, and military sectors. A clear understanding on how impairments and system parameters affect detection and localization accuracy is fundamental for the WSR network design. We introduce a mathematical {{framework for the}} analysis of WSR network which allows to consider different scenarios, network topologies, and system configurations. We focus on the effects of ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) time-of-arrival estimation on the localization accuracy.

The main field of this bistatic radar investigation is air surveillance operation with host off ground-based cooperative illuminators. Also possible is the use of noncooperative illuminators like FM radio stations, TV stations, or <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars</b> which are located in the observation area. The receiver and transmitter are build up with commercial-off-the-shelf components to reduce cost and shorten the development time.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{estimate}} parameters of the moving target using different radar configurations. First the Doppler effect and the time delay of the received signal is examined. The investigation of these phenomenons is made for radial and non-radial movement of simple <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> configuration and after that for the bistatic and multistatic MIMO configuration. The ambiguity function is presented for all these configurations. The ambiguity function is then used to estimate target parameters from the received signal. The received signal model and ambiguity function for the <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> configuration is developed using Matlab software. Finally the practical use of these implementations is presented and compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of multiple unresolved targets {{is critical in}} radar technology. To precisely detect multiple unresolved targets is a prerequisite and the basis of all other processes. For <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar,</b> the detection method of multiple unresolved targets based on the complex indicated angle difference technique is first analyzed and then extended to multistatic radar. The detector of multiple unresolved targets is designed and simulation tests are presented under several scenarios. Moreover, the effect on detection performance of SNR, sensor number, and the geometrical configuration of targets and sensors are analyzed. The results show that with the same SNR, the multistatic radar detector performs better than the <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> detector...|$|E

40|$|Bistatic radars {{have been}} {{recently}} proposed {{as an alternative}} to conventional <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars</b> since they can provide additional information in many fields of remote sensing applications. However, up to now, no bistatic radar campaigns, nor laboratory experiments, having vegetation as the target have been set up. This paper presents theoretical simulations of the bistatic scattering coefficient of crop and forest canopies. The electromagnetic model developed at Tor Vergata has been used to analyse scattering {{as a function of the}} observation angle, both in azimuth and elevation, and it will be shown that biomass monitoring can be optimized at out-of-incidence scattering planes...|$|R
50|$|Passive (multistatic) radar, {{bistatic}} {{radar and}} especially multistatic radar systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars,</b> since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F117) reflects energy {{away from the}} transmitter's line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor. Such a system typically uses either low frequency broadcast TV and FM radio signals (at which frequencies controlling the aircraft's signature is more difficult). Later stealth approaches do not rely on controlling the specular reflections of radar energy and so the geometrical benefits {{are unlikely to be}} significant.|$|R

40|$|Detection {{of moving}} targets in {{stationary}} clutter {{can be accomplished}} by STAP radar. In contrast to <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar</b> the performance of bistatic STAP depends strongly on the actual radar-target geometry. Even for sidelooking radar the clutter Doppler is generally range dependent which causes special problems in estimating the space-time clutter covariance matrix. For certain bistatic constellations clutter notches as appearing during track (i. e. areas of low probability of detection) may be considerably wider than in <b>monostatic</b> <b>radar.</b> The bistatic transmitter-receiver constellation has strong implications on ground moving target tracking, which is basic for producing a recognized ground picture as well as for analyzing traffic flows, identifying sources and sinks of traffic, or detecting lines of communication. Aspects of a bistatic GMTI tracking algorithm are described and some typical tracking results are given. Special emphasis is placed on a suitable modeling of the bistatic radar characteristics within the tracker...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{multisensor}} networks {{constructed of}} homogeneous sensors, sometimes called Multiple-Input-Multiply-Output (MIMO), offer several advantages compared to classical <b>monostatic</b> <b>radars.</b> As they illuminate targets from various aspects angles and as reflections are received from several locations simultaneously these distributed homogeneous sensor networks easily outperform Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) systems. Target detection and parameter estimation is dramatically improved {{due to this}} spatial diversity. Hence, such homogeneous sensor networks are attracting more and more researchers. This paper proposes a homogeneous sensor network composed of several distributed Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) routers as transmitters and dedicated receivers for detecting multiple targets and estimating their location and velocity with high accuracy. Compressed sensing is applied to reduce the sample rate dramatically, which has {{to be transferred to}} a central processing unit...|$|R
