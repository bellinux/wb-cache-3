The verifier's role is to ensure that the source proxy is only presented with the business information using the simple data format it is expecting.

A collision-free hash function uniformly maps an arbitrary length message into a fixed length message digest, so that, finding two distinct messages that produce the same digest is computationally infeasible. This property of hash functions is used to provide data integrity. A typical application of hash functions is to generate a checksum of a message whose integrity needs to be protected.

40|$|Designing {{distributed}} protocols {{is complex}} and requires actions at very different levels: from the design of an interaction flow supporting the desired application-specific guarantees to {{the selection of the}} most appropriate network-level protection mechanisms. To tame this complexity, we propose AnBx, a formal protocol specification language based on the popular Alice & Bob notation. AnBx offers channels as the main abstraction for communication, providing different authenticity and/or confidentiality guarantees for message transmission. AnBx extends existing proposals in the literature with a novel notion of forwarding channels, enforcing specific security guarantees from the <b>message</b> <b>originator</b> to the final recipient along a number of intermediate forwarding agents. We give a formal semantics of AnBx in terms of a state transition system expressed in the AVISPA Intermediate Format. We devise an ideal channel model and a possible cryptographic implementation, and we show that, under mild restrictions, the two representations coincide, thus making AnBx amenable to automated verification with different tools. We demonstrate the benefits of the declarative specification style distinctive of AnBx by revisiting the design of two existing e-payment protocols: iKP and SET...|$|E

40|$|Information-security {{technologies}} are often implemented with redundant data fields attached to message containers. In a Key Recovery System that employs public key cryptography, a data recovery field (DRF) {{attached to a}} message typically contains a session key encrypted with a Key Recovery Agent’s public key. At a later time when needs arise, the session key can be retrieved from DRF and used to recover the original message without {{the involvement of the}} <b>message</b> <b>originator</b> or recipient. Two problems with such a system are (1) that DRF is at least as long as the public modulo of the Key Recovery Agent, which represents an increasingly large communication overhead, (2) and that DRF is not created in an authenticated way, which opens a door for an originator to create a bogus DRF and deny his/her act at a later time. The main purposes of this paper are to address the two problems and exhibit a possible solution to them. In particular, we propose an authenticated Key Recovery System using a recently discovered signcryption primitive that combines the functions of digital signature with those of public-key encryption. We also carry out a detailed comparison between our proposal and existing Key Recovery Systems. ...|$|E

Specifically, a 5 % exchange rate is {{more than double the}} probability of a message exchange for HUMANET. In the results below, we performed a more fair comparison using a 2 % probability of exchange. In Figure 1, the difference in exchange rate between HUMANET, 2 % and 5 % random walk is presented.

40|$|Existing {{authentication}} protocols {{to secure}} vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) raise challenges such as certificate distribution and revocation, avoidance of computation and communication bottlenecks, and {{reduction of the}} strong reliance on tamper-proof devices. This paper efficiently copes with these challenges with a decentralized group-authentication protocol {{in the sense that}} the group is maintained by each roadside unit (RSU) rather than by a centralized authority, as in most existing protocols that are employing group signatures. In our proposal, we employ each RSU to maintain and manage an on-the-fly group within its communication range. Vehicles entering the group can anonymously broadcast vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) messages, which can be instantly verified by the vehicles in the same group (and neighboring groups). Later, if the message is found to be false, a third party can be invoked to disclose the identity of the <b>message</b> <b>originator.</b> Our protocol efficiently exploits the specific features of vehicular mobility, physical road limitations, and properly distributed RSUs. Our design leads to a robust VANET since, if some RSUs occasionally collapse, only the vehicles that are driving in those collapsed areas will be affected. Due to the numerous RSUs sharing the load to maintain the system, performance does not significantly degrade when more vehicles join the VANET; hence, the system is scalable...|$|E

In this paper paper, we present a physical layer assisted message authentication scheme that uses Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation to verify the <b>message</b> <b>originator</b> location based on the claimed location information. Within the considered vehicular communication settings, fundamental limits of AoA estimation are developed {{in terms of its}} Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) and existence of efficient estimator.

The observation posterior likelihood function is shown to satisfy regularity conditions necessary for asymptotic normality of the ML-AoA estimator. Thus, we give $P_D$ and $P_F$ in a closed form.

30|$|DSR {{protocol}} is a {{routing protocol}} for MANET where no infrastructure is required.

Upon reaching every node, each node can read the packet information such as sender address, destination address, and request ID determined by the originator. Further, each node appends its identity when forwarding RREQ to the next nodes. Once the information has reached the target node, it sends a route replay <b>message</b> to the <b>originator.</b> Further, the entire route recorded in the RREQ packet is copied to route reply (RREP) and forwarded back to the originator. The originator upon receiving this information caches the route for subsequent routing.

(This does not include modified tweets that sometimes are referred to as retweets.) Despite the fact that retweets are routinely studied and reported, many important questions remain about user motivation for their use and their significance. In this paper we answer the question of what users indicate when they retweet. We do so in a comprehensive fashion, by employing a user survey, a study of user profiles, and a meta-analysis of over 100 research publications from three related major conferences. Our findings indicate that retweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the <b>message</b> and the <b>originator,</b> and agreement with the message contents. However, the findings are significantly weaker for journalists, some of whom beg to differ declaring so in their own user profiles.

The protocol serves two aims: first, to discover all bidirectional links, and second, to identify the best-next-hop for every other node in the network. A key element is that each node will flood the network at regular intervals with so-called <b>originator</b> <b>messages.</b> This paper describes in detail a formalisation of the B. A. T. M. A. N. protocol. This exercise revealed several ambiguities and inconsistencies in the RFC. We developed two models. The first implements, if possible, a literal reading of the RFC, while the second model tries {{to be closer to}} the underlying concepts. The alternative model is in some places less restrictive, and rebroadcasts more often when it helps route discovery, and will on the other hand drop more messages that might interfere with the process. We verify for a basic untimed model that both interpretations ensure loop-freedom, bidirectional link discovery, and route-discovery. We use simulation of a timed model to compare the performance and found that both models are comparable {{when it comes to the}} time and number of messages needed for discovering routes. However, the alternative model identifies a significantly lower number of suboptimal routes, and thus improves on the literal interpretation of the RFC.
