40|$|Tuberization is an {{important}} process in potato that is governed by a complex of environmental as well as internal factors. As a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process,</b> it is closely connected with regulation of frequency and orientation of cell division. Thus, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to transform potato with mitotic activator cdc 25 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Spcdc 25) and to follow the resulting changes in potato phenotype with a special focus on tuber formation. In previous studies with tobacco, {{it has been shown that}} the expression of the above mentioned Spcdc 25 gene results in dramatic changes in morphology (leaf structure, restricted root development and growth, and also remarkable developmental change - acceleration of flowering). Moreover, many other characteristics that can be induced in control by cytokinin application have been observed (e. g. cytokinin independent de novo shoot formation, carbohydrate metabolism changes). The two last characteristics - cytokinins independency of <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process</b> and changes in carbohydrate metabolism (e. g. increased starch deposition) - are important from the point of view of expected changes in characteristic of Spcdc 25 transgenic potato.

While molecular mechanisms remain unclear, PTEN interacts through its C 2 membrane-binding domain with the scaffold protein β-Arrestin 1. Because β-Arrestin 1 binds and suppresses the Cdc 42 GTPase-activating protein ARHGAP 21, we hypothesize that PTEN controls Cdc 42 -dependent <b>morphogenic</b> <b>processes</b> through a β-Arrestin 1 -ARHGAP 21 complex. Here {{we show that}} PTEN knockdown (KD) impairs β-Arrestin 1 membrane localization, β-Arrestin 1 -ARHGAP 21 interactions, Cdc 42 activation, mitotic spindle orientation and 3 D glandular morphogenesis. Effects of PTEN-deficiency were phenocopied by β-Arrestin 1 KD or inhibition of β-Arrestin 1 -ARHGAP 21 interactions. Conversely, silencing of ARHGAP 21 enhanced Cdc 42 activation and rescued aberrant <b>morphogenic</b> <b>processes</b> of PTEN-deficient cultures. Expression of the PTEN C 2 domain mimicked effects of full-length PTEN but a membrane-binding defective mutant of the C 2 domain abrogated these properties.

However, there are unique features of mammalian tissue fusion that remain poorly understood. Notably, detachment and apoptosis occur at the leading front in mammals but not in invertebrates. We found that in the mouse embryo, expression of the Nf 2 tumor suppressor, merlin, is dynamically regulated during tissue fusion: Nf 2 expression is low at the leading front before fusion and high across the fused tissue bridge. Mosaic Nf 2 mutants exhibit a global defect in tissue fusion characterized by ectopic detachment and increased detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis). By contrast with core components of the junctional complex, we find that merlin is required specifically for the assembly but not {{the maintenance of the}} junctional complex.

The {{results indicated that}} the <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process</b> occurred more efficiently when hypocotyl segment-derived explants were cultured in media supplemented with cytokinin and AgNO(3) incubated under a 16 -h photoperiod. The shoot bud elongation and plant development were obtained by transferring the material to MSM culture medium supplemented with GA(3) and incubated in flasks with vented lids. Histological analyses of the process revealed that the difficulties in obtaining plants could be related to the development of protuberances and leaf primordia structures, which did not contain shoot apical meristem. Roots developed easily by transferring elongated shoots to 1 / 2 MSM culture medium. Plant acclimatization occurred successfully, and somaclonal variation was not visually detected.

40|$|ABSTRACT Epimorphin is a mesenchymal {{morphogen}} {{that has}} been shown to mediate epithelial–mesenchymal signaling interactions in various organs. We now show that epimorphin functions in hair follicle morphogenesis; using a novel ex vivo organ culture assay, we define a mechanism for epimorphin signaling that may provide insight into general developmental processes. We found that epimorphin was produced by follicular mesenchymal cells and bound selectively to follicular epithelial cells, and that treatment with recombinant epimorphin could stimulate procession of hair follicles from telogen (resting stage) to anagen (growing stage). Based on analyses of epimorphin proteolytic digests that suggested a smaller peptide might be able to substitute for the full-length epimorphin molecule, we determined that pep 7, a 10 -amino acid peptide, was capable of inducing telogen-to-anagen transition both in the culture assay and in the mouse. That pep 7 showed maximal activity only when modified with specific sulfhydryl-reactive reagents suggested that a particular structural conformation of the peptide was essential for activity; molecular dynamics studies were pursued to investigate the active peptide structure. These findings define a previously unknown <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process</b> in the hair follicle that may have applications to many other organs. OTakebe, K., Oka, Y. ...|$|E

Based on the results obtained, the explants collected from the 4 -day-old seedlings were then cultured in MS basal medium supplemented with different concentrations of BAP (0, 1. 1, 2. 2, 3. 3, 4. 5, or 5. 5 µM) and incubated under a 16 -h photoperiod at 27 ºC. In vitro organogenesis was most efficient with explants collected from 4 -day-old seedlings cultured in medium supplemented with 4. 5 µM of BAP.

We used a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in an in vitro zinnia (Zinnia elegans L.) culture model system to gather fundamental information about the gene regulation underlying the transdifferentiation of plant cells. In this model, photosynthetic mesophyll cells isolated from zinnia leaves transdifferentiate into xylem cells in a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process</b> characterized by features such as secondary-wall formation and programmed cell death. More than 8, 000 zinnia cDNA clones were isolated from an equalized cDNA library prepared from cultured cells transdifferentiating into xylem cells.

Expression of differentiation markers of epidermal keratinocytes including cholesterol sulfotransferase and cytokeratin K 1 was induced in culture, as it occurs alsoin vivo. The <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process</b> was observed by time-lapse videomicrography. In this culture system, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor α specifically and completely inhibited the hair follicle formation with marginal effects on interfollicular epidermis. The inhibitory action by EGF was reversible and stage specific, i. e., at an early stage of the development of hair rudiments. Among known ligands to the EGF receptor, Schwannoma-derived growth factor and heparin-binding EGF were expressed inin vivoepidermis during the period of the initial formation of hair follicles. EGF receptor is expressed in epidermis throughout the developing period examined. Using an adenovirus vector, we demonstrated that the lacZ gene was transduced into the epidermal and dermal cell layers without appreciable toxicity.

We suggest that this stress-dependent distribution is the result of both the force-dependent binding to actin filaments and cooperative interactions between bound myosin heads. By assuming that the binding of myosin heads induces and/or stabilizes local conformational changes in the actin filaments that enhances myosin II binding locally, we successfully simulate the cooperative binding of myosin to actin observed experimentally. In addition, we can interpret the cooperative interactions between myosin and actin cross-linking proteins observed in cellular mechanosensation, provided that a similar mechanism operates among different proteins. Finally, we present a model that couples cooperative interactions to the assembly dynamics of myosin bipolar thick filaments and that accounts for the transient behaviors of the myosin II accumulation during mechanosensation. This mechanism is likely to be general for a range of myosin II-dependent cellular mechanosensory processes...|$|R

R-Ras 2 /TC 21 is a GTPase with high sequence and signaling similarity with Ras subfamily members. Although it has been extensively studied using overexpression studies in cell lines, its physiological role remains poorly characterized. Here we used RRas 2 -knockout mice expressing â-galactosidase under the regulation of the endogenous RRas 2 promoter to investigate the function of this GTPase in vivo. Despite its expression in tissues critical for organismal viability, RRas 2 -/- mice show no major alterations in viability, growth rates, cardiovascular parameters, or fertility. By contrast, they display a marked and specific defect {{in the development of the}} mammary gland during puberty. In the absence of R-Ras 2 /TC 21, this gland forms reduced numbers of terminal end buds (TEBs) and ductal branches, leading to a temporal delay in the extension and arborization of the gland tree in mammary fat pads. This phenotype is linked to cell-autonomous proliferative defects of epithelial cells present in TEBs. These cells also show reduced Erk activation but wild type - like levels of phosphorylated Akt.

40|$|Embryogenesis is a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>process</b> {{which leads}} to the {{production}} of a bipolar structure containing a root-shoot axis with a closed independent vascular system - the embryo. Three types of embryogenesis are considered based on the plant material from which the embryo derives: zygotic (zygote), somatic (somatic tissues) and gametic (microspores and ovules). Somatic and gametic embryogenesis to be considered as "true-to-type" should mimic the embryonic developmental stages of zygotic embryogenesis. Although real suspensor-like cells are often not present in somatic embryogenesis, the similarity between zygotic and somatic embryogenesis is remarkable from the globular to the early cotyledon stages. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro, in callus, cell suspension cultures, and protoplast cultures (indirect embryogenesis), or directly from cells of organized structures such as leaves or zygotic embryos (direct embryogenesis). As an approach for plantlet regeneration, somatic embryogenesis has several advantages over organogenesis providing useful systems to obtain large-scale clonal propagation and artificial seeds, and for clonal propagation of transgenic plants. For these reasons, the control of plant regeneration by somatic is, at present, one of the major goals of agrobiotechnology. The lack of knowledge of the factors controlling somatic embryogenesis, the asynchrony of somatic embryo development, and low true-to-type embryonic efficiency, are responsible for its reduced commercial application and, they simultaneously, have been the driving force of the fundamental research studies performed in the last decades. Although some basic knowledge of the process of somatic embryogenesis in dicotyledonous species has been achieved through the Daucus carota experimental model system, knowledge of the factors responsible for inducing the process and the meaning of embryogenic competence is still lacking. The complexity of the process and the lack of a good experimental model system are frequently suggested as being responsible for the lack of progress achieved [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Complex {{asparagine}} (N) -linked oligosaccharides appear late in phylogeny and {{are highly}} regulated in vertebrates. Variations in these structures are {{found on the}} majority of cell-surface and secreted proteins. Complex N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis is initiated in the Golgi apparatus {{by the action of}} Mgat- 1 -encoded UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:alpha- 3 -D- mannoside beta- 1, 2 -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI). To determine if these structures govern ontogenic processes in mammals, mouse embryos were generated that lacked a functional Mgat- 1 gene. Inactivation of both Mgat- 1 alleles produced deficiencies in GlcNAc-TI activity and complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Embryonic lethality occurred by day 10. 5, thus establishing that complex N-linked oligosaccharides are required during post-implantation development. Remarkably, embryonic development proceeded into day 9 with the differentiation of multiple cell types. Complex N-linked oligosaccharides are important for <b>morphogenic</b> <b>processes</b> as neural tube formation, vascularization and the determination of left-right body plan asymmetry were impaired {{in the absence of a}} functional Mgat- 1 gene...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the expression, postnatal ontogeny, and localization of mouse GH (mGH) and its relative expression during pregnancy, lactation, and weaning in the mouse. mGH mRNA and protein was expressed predominantly in the epithelial component of the mammary gland, and maximal expression was observed during the pubertal period. Autocrine mGH expression dramatically decreased during late pregnancy and lactation. Concordantly, autocrine mGH expression is repressed during forced differentiation of mouse HC 11 mammary epithelial cells in culture. Forced expression of mGH in HC 11 cells abrogated lactogenic differentiation as indicated by reduced expression of beta-casein and reduced expression and loss of lateral epithelial localization of E-cadherin. Forced expression of mGH in mouse mammary epithelial cells increased cell survival and proliferation and consequently increased the size of mammary acinar-like structures formed in three-dimensional Matrigel. Thus, autocrine mGH expression in the mouse mammary epithelial cell is maximal at puberty and prevents mammary epithelial cell differentiation. Autocrine GH will therefore participate in mammary <b>morphogenic</b> <b>processes</b> at puberty...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} no {{financial}} conflicts of interest. At this time, brain tumor stem cells remain a controversial hypothesis while malignant brain tumors continue {{to present a}} dire prognosis of severe morbidity and mortality. Yet, brain tumor stem cells may represent an essential cellular target for glioma therapy as they are postulated to be the tumorigenic cells responsible for recurrence. Targeting oncogenic pathways that {{are essential to the}} survival and growth of brain tumor stem cells represents a promising area for developing therapeutics. However, due to the multiple oncogenic pathways involved in glioma, it is necessary to determine which pathways are the essential targets for therapy. Furthermore, research still needs to comprehend the <b>morphogenic</b> <b>processes</b> of cell populations involved in tumor formation. Here, we review research and discuss perspectives on models of glioma in order to delineate the current issues in defining brain tumor stem cells as therapeutic targets in models of glioma.
