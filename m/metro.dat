40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{influence}} of US metropolitan spatial structure evolution on regional employment growth rate. The {{first part of this}} study investigates the evolution of US metropolitan spatial structures from 2000 to 2010. At the macro level, I categorized metropolitan areas (<b>metros)</b> into three groups (i. e., monocentric, polycentric, and coreless) {{based on the number of}} employment centers these <b>metros</b> had in 2000 and 2010. At the micro level, I sub-grouped the three macro spatial structure groups into micro-level clusters based on each <b>metro?s</b> rank of employment shares in five sub-metro locations: the main-center, sub-centers, non-center clusters, non-cluster urban areas, and rural areas. The results show that (1) among 361 US <b>metros,</b> over 80 percent of <b>metros</b> remained in their original macro spatial structure type, and (2) less than 10 percent of <b>metros</b> experienced employment decentralization. The second part of this study explores {{the influence of}} spatial structure evolution on regional growth rate. At the macro level, a series of two-sample t-tests showed that the group of monocentric <b>metros</b> that remained monocentric had no significant difference in employment growth rate from the group of monocentric <b>metros</b> that evolved to be polycentric. Conversely, the group of polycentric <b>metros</b> that remained polycentric had a higher employment growth rate than the group of polycentric <b>metros</b> that evolved to be monocentric. At the micro level, a regression analysis showed that the initial sub-centers? employment share had a larger positive effect on regional employment growth rate than the initial main-center employment share, while the change in non-cluster urban areas? employment share had a larger negative effect on regional employment growth rate than the change in the non-center clusters? employment share. The main conclusions from this dissertation are that (1) employment decentralization from the main-center to sub-centers increases regional employment growth rate, whereas employment dispersion ? employment migration from centers (i. e., main-center and sub-centers) to non-centers (i. e., non-center clusters, non-cluster urban areas, and rural areas) ? decreases regional employment growth rate, and (2) <b>metros?</b> macro and micro spatial structure types were relatively stable over the study period...|$|R

5|$|Although {{historically}} <b>Metro</b> has had {{a significantly}} lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States, crime on <b>Metro</b> {{as a whole was}} rising in the late 2000s.

Crime on the Green Line continued to be high: Gallery Place–Chinatown had the most robberies of any station throughout the <b>Metro</b> system, followed by Anacostia (25 percent fewer than Gallery Place) and L'Enfant Plaza (20 percent fewer than Anacostia). Crime by juveniles (generally robbery, or assault) also continued to be a serious issue for <b>Metro,</b> with more than 260 juvenile arrests {{in the first nine months}} of 2009, and <b>Metro</b> Transit Police continued to engage in large numbers of high-visibility patrols. Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue continued to be trouble spots, and <b>Metro</b> added <b>Metro</b> Center to the list in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Controversies {{regarding}} the siting of the Green Line continued. In May 1980, {{a group of}} business owners near the former proposed terminus at Branch Avenue and Auth Road near Marlow Heights sued <b>Metro</b> {{on the grounds that}} the decision to change the course of the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro's rules). In February 1981, Judge Norman Park Ramsey of the U.S. District for Maryland held that <b>Metro</b> did not correctly advertise the hearings at which the change would be discussed. <b>Metro</b> appealed the ruling, and Judge Ramsey did not enjoin <b>Metro</b> from proceeding with construction until the appeal was resolved. The Prince George's County government, however, reaffirmed in April 1981 its support for the Rosecroft Raceway terminus, and <b>Metro</b> promised to hold a public hearing on the issue in June 1981. Shortly thereafter, the civil rights office in the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter to <b>Metro</b> warning that the Rosecroft Raceway route could negatively impact two historically black communities nearby. In May 1981, <b>Metro</b> changed its estimate for the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia to early 1988.|$|E

40|$|Accessibility {{is a key}} {{objective}} of regional planning, one requiring the coordination of transportation and land use. Several metropolitan planning organizations in the United States and Europe have started to incorporate accessibility metrics into their evaluation of future regional scenarios. This paper describes changes in accessibility to employment by auto and transit for four contrasting metropolitan areas between 2000 and 2010. The effect of changing residential locations, changing employment locations, and changing travel speeds on accessibility change is decomposed and analyzed. Residential locations are generally shifting toward low-accessibility locations, degrading regional accessibility. Shifting employment locations have differential effects across <b>metros,</b> improving the accessibility of central locations in some <b>metros</b> while improving the accessibility of peripheral locations in others. Travel speeds also show strongly contrasting patterns across <b>metros,</b> with speed-related accessibility benefits concentrated in high-density locations for some <b>metros</b> (Chicago), while low-density locations are the primary beneficiary in other <b>metros</b> (Charlotte and St. Louis) ...|$|R

In February 1983, the Reagan administration proposed cutting Metro's construction budget by $145 million to $230 million, which <b>Metro</b> said would push the opening of the Green Line to 1991. <b>Metro,</b> {{for the first time in}} its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from Wheaton to Glenmont, or the Yellow Line from Franconia-Springfield to King Street – Old Town.|$|E
