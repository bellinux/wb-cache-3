5|$|After {{handling}} the <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito describes as a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E

That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to shoot a music video for the song. The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E

In this research, we explore {{the relationship between the}} size of <b>market</b> <b>for</b> brands and the vertical disintegration of production, as antecedent of the rise of <b>market</b> <b>for</b> brands. We take an industry-level perspective and focus on trademark transactions in the US as the empirical setting for our analysis. The results uncover a positive relationship between the degree of industry vertical disintegration and the size of <b>market</b> <b>for</b> brands.

The film is now mostly lost, although one badly damaged reel was salvaged from the RMS Lusitania in 1982.|$|E

40|$|Price {{formation}} {{and integration of}} markets supplied by both farmed and captured fish is studied. <b>Markets</b> <b>for</b> trout and potential substitutes imported to Germany are analysed, and market delineation and market leaders identified. It is found that <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> small portion-sized farmed trout with white meat are related to, rather than completely separate from, other fish markets, and that <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> these trout are more closely linked to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> captured fish than to farmed salmon. The implications are that although {{the part of the}} trout business operating with small freshwater ponds remains relatively unaffected by developments in other fish markets, careful attention should be paid to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> and management of capture fisheries like cod, halibut, redfish, and mackerel, than to <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> farmed salmon.

5|$|The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega {{planned to}} release in fall 1995, with the retail price {{planned to be}} {{something}} less than US$200. Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> the Saturn while being priced {{too close to the}} Saturn to be a viable competitor. Electronic Gaming Monthly used the Sega Neptune as an April Fools' Day prank in its April 2001 issue. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> the match, {{a unique}} design concept has been {{developed}} for each Champions League final since 1997, inspired by the cultural and historical heritage of the host city.

The design {{was based on a}} colour scheme of deep red and gold, inspired by the predominant colours of Red Square, the Kremlin and the gold domes of Moscow's cathedrals, and featured images of the Moscow skyline, as well as the UEFA Champions League logo and trophy rendered in a Russian artistic style, with text in a font similar to Cyrillic script.|$|E
5|$|Eidos's German {{branch and}} the KMF agency handled <b>{{marketing}}</b> <b>for</b> Lara Croft. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E

5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the {{development}} of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the idea is to have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, after {{spending}} some {{two years in}} Medan with the daily Sinar Soematra, Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine Doenia Film, a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine Filmland; although an adaptation, Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng (The Lost Lutung), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> 1929's Njai Dasima, which emphasised the exclusively native cast. In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film {{and was replaced by}} Bachtiar Effendi.|$|E
5|$|The initial budget, at {{approximately}} $140 million, led Evan Almighty {{to become the}} most expensive comedy film ever made. Added costs such as set construction, visual effects, and problems with filming multiple animals in a controlled location brought the budget up to $175 million. Once <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> the film was also included, the film's entire budget was estimated to be around $200 million. The ballooning budget caused Sony to drop the project and hand it over entirely to Universal Studios. Part of the budget was Carell's payroll, where he earned a reported $5 million for his leading role. The Virginia Film Office estimates the film brought $20–25 million to Virginia, with the majority of it in the Charlottesville area.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the {{previous}} game in the Mana series, 1999's Legend of Mana, several members of the development team for the game left Square to form a new development studio, Brownie Brown. These included character designer Kameoka Shinichi and lead artist Kouji Tsuda, as well as several other writers and artists. Square, in turn, outsourced development of the fifth game in the Mana series to Brownie Brown. The producer for the game was Square's Koichi Ishii, who had directed or designed the previous games in the series. Ishii had served as the director for the original game in the series, Final Fantasy Adventure, which Sword of Mana is a remake of. The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games in the series, such as the Ring Command menu system, and to expand the game's storyline. It also removed elements from the Final Fantasy series, which had been placed in the original game {{as a part of the}} <b>marketing</b> <b>for</b> the game before its sequels moved to be a distinct series.|$|E
