Praise for Liverpool also came from outside England, including from Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who said, [...] "Even the Brazil team that won the 1970 World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles really do exist. I've now made Liverpool <b>my</b> <b>English</b> team. They showed that football {{is the most beautiful}} sport of all. You knew they could defend, but the team showed they could play too and wrote a page in the history books. The match will last forever. The Liverpool supporters didn't let me go to sleep the night before. There were 10 of them to every three Milan supporters. They showed their unconditional support at half-time when they were losing 3–0 and still they didn't stop singing." ...|$|E

2500|$|He sailed for India on 20 September 1882, {{and arrived}} in Bombay on 18 October. He {{described}} this moment years later: [...] "So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking {{four or five}} years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them." [...] This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: [...] "There were yet three or four days’ rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, <b>my</b> <b>English</b> years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength".|$|E

2500|$|In Danny Eccleston's {{review of}} Live from the Artists Den, he {{describes}} [...] "The Art Teacher" [...] as [...] "a great, great song" [...] {{and one of}} Wainwright's [...] "best-loved numbers and for good reason". He writes, [...] "It's transformational... the tragedy of her unspoken love seems to resonate endlessly, as if bouncing mercilessly around in your chest." [...] Sarah Metz, a media arts specialist for the National Endowment for the Arts and a contributor to its [...] "Art Works Blog", related [...] "The Art Teacher" [...] {{to one of her}} own experiences in her 2015 article, [...] "My Artist Crush: Rufus Wainwright": [...] "I had developed a huge crush on one of <b>my</b> <b>English</b> teachers in high school, and was in awe of how he perfectly captured those feelings in a four-minute song." [...] In The Cambridge Companion to the Singer-Songwriter (2016), Katherine Williams said the pronoun shifts within the song's lyrics allow Wainwright [...] "play between genders", and noted that the singer usually sings in the first person.|$|E
2500|$|The Saharanpur Botanical Gardens, {{known as}} the Company Garden and once the {{preserve}} of the British East India Company, {{is one of the}} oldest existing gardens in India, dating to before 1750. Then named Farahat-Bakhsh, it was originally a pleasure ground set out by a local chief, Intazam ud-ullah. In 1817, it was acquired by the British East India Company and placed under the authority of the District Surgeon. Joseph Dalton Hooker says of this Botanical Garden that [...] "Amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from China, a fact I allude to, as many of <b>my</b> <b>English</b> readers may not be aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and Assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore. In 1887, when the Botanical Survey of India was set up to reform the country's botanical sciences, Saharanpur became the centre for the survey of the northern Indian flora. The Garden is seen historically as being second only to the Calcutta Gardens for its contribution to science and economy in India. Under private auspices today, it is full of greenery and has many different kinds of plants and flowers.|$|E
