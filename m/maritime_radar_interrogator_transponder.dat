40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is the development of}} an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna demonstrator for civil <b>maritime</b> <b>radar.</b> AESA technology has been applied {{in a wide range of}} fields; however, it has been restricted to high-end and military markets, mostly because of its high overall costs. This research aims to fulfil regulatory requirements of civil <b>maritime</b> <b>radar</b> at reduced cost. An AESA antenna whose single active antenna element supports mixed signal operation (analogue and digital) allows to solve the additional challenges imposed by this regulation. Moreover, an innovative RF feeding network operation and a plain antenna aperture concept are proposed. The array can be produced with an inexpensive extrusion process, resembling existing navigation radar antennas. The RF feeding network lacks any isolation between its ports. The similarity between simulated beam-forming and the measured patterns show that ideal performance is almost achieved. In addition, the pattern sensitivity to interferences is analysed, and inexpensive protection solutions are proposed. In summary, this work shows how phased-array technology can be open to further fields of applications...|$|R

30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to note that the proposed system presents great robustness in its performance against changes in sea clutter and ship conditions. Moreover, due to the mutual integration of vertical and horizontal information in the rhombus mode, this mode is able to work correctly and independently of the relative direction of movement of the ocean waves and ships with respect to the radar site. Moreover, although the proposed scheme is applied for a medium-range <b>maritime</b> <b>radar,</b> it could be also used in high-range radars, where ships can be located farther.|$|R
