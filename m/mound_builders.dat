5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in what is today South Dakota for several {{thousand}} years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC. Between 500AD and 800AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> lived {{in central and eastern}} South Dakota. In the 14th century, the Crow Creek Massacre occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{knowledge}} of the region helped him to become {{an expert on the}} West's natural history. Over the years he welcomed travelers, including those interested in natural history, to his home overlooking the Ohio River. Clark supplied details on the area's plant and animal life to John Pope and John James Audubon, and hosted his brother, William, and Meriweather Lewis, prior to their expedition to the Pacific Northwest. Clark also provided information on the Ohio Valley's native tribes to Allan Bowie Magruder and archaeological evidence related to the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> to John P. Campbell.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) {{from the head of}} the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} St. Louis, Missouri {{began with the}} {{settlement}} of the St. Louis area by Native American <b>mound</b> <b>builders</b> who lived {{as part of the}} Mississippian culture from the 9th century to the 15th century, followed by other migrating tribal groups. Starting in the late 17th century, French explorers arrived. Spain took over in 1763 and a trading company led by Pierre Laclede and Auguste Chouteau established the settlement of St. Louis in February 1764. It attracted French settlers leaving Illinois when Britain took control east of the Mississippi. The city grew in population due to its location as a trading post on the Mississippi River, as the western fur trade was lucrative. The city played a small role in the American Revolutionary War and became part of the U.S. through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.|$|E
25|$|People {{also claimed}} that the Indians were not the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> because the mounds and related {{artifacts}} were older than Indian cultures. Caleb Atwater's misunderstanding of stratigraphy caused him {{to believe that the}} <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> were a much older civilization than the Indians. In his book, Antiquities Discovered in the Western States (1820), Atwater claimed that Indian remains were always found right {{beneath the surface of the}} earth. Since the artifacts associated with the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> were found fairly deep in the ground, Atwater argued that they must be from a different group of people. The discovery of metal artifacts further convinced people that the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> were not Native Americans. The Indians encountered by the Europeans and Americans were not thought to engage in metallurgy. Some artifacts that were found in relation to the mounds were inscribed with symbols. As the Europeans did not know of any Indian cultures that had a writing system, they assumed a different group had created them.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, certain sects {{affiliated}} with the Black nationalist Moorish Science philosophy theorized an association with the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders.</b> They argue that the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> were an ancient advanced Black civilization that developed the legendary continents of Atlantis and Mu, as well as ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica. These black groups claim that the American Indians were too primitive to have developed the sophisticated societies and the technology believed necessary to build the mounds.|$|E

25|$|Next came {{another group}} of Indians known as <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders.</b> The <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> were more {{prevalent}} in the area, {{although many of the}} mounds were destroyed by early white settlement, by either not knowing their significance, or by cultivating the ground in such a manner that would level them out. It was indicated that these Indians were a fun-loving people. They loved to hunt, fish and even to put out gardens in the summer. This may have been because the sparse population allowed them to not need to be over-protective of their hunting grounds. Archeologists report that pieces of pottery unearthed from the mounds were not only skillfully produced, but beautifully decorated; revealing an artistic flair and skill much improved compared to the Bluff Dwellers.|$|E

50|$|The Alum Creek valley was {{inhabited}} by the Adena over 2,000 years ago. This <b>mound</b> <b>builder</b> culture constructed seven mounds along Alum Creek. The Lenape (Delaware) Indian tribe later established many settlements near the creek.|$|R
25|$|We can {{conclude}} that these <b>mound</b> <b>builders</b> were organized. Hundreds or even thousands of workers had to dig up tons of earth with the hand tools available, the dirt had to be moved long distances, and finally workers had to create the shape the builder had planned.|$|E
25|$|After {{the close}} of the Woodland period (around 500 CE), Native Americans made less and less use of Russell Cave. Occasionally, small parties of hunters left objects {{distinct}} from those of the Woodland period occupants. These visitors (<b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> of the Mississippian period) came from permanent villages which had successfully implemented agriculture near the rich river bottomlands. The last occupants departed around 1000 CE.|$|E
25|$|The namesake {{cultural}} {{trait of}} the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> was {{the building of}} mounds and other earthworks. These burial and ceremonial structures were typically flat-topped pyramids or platform mounds, flat-topped or rounded cones, elongated ridges, and sometimes {{a variety of other}} forms. They were generally built as part of complex villages. The early earthworks built in Louisiana c. 3500 BCE are the only ones known to have been built by a hunter-gatherer culture.|$|E

25|$|Fort Ancient culture flourished from 1000 to 1650 CE among {{a people}} who {{predominantly}} inhabited lands along the Ohio River in areas of southern Ohio, northern Kentucky and western West Virginia. They were <b>mound</b> <b>builders.</b> Fort Ancient culture was once {{thought to have been}} an extension of the Mississippian culture. But, scholars now believe Fort Ancient culture developed independently and was descended from the Hopewell culture (100 BCE—500 CE), also a mound builder people.|$|E
25|$|The various {{cultures}} collectively termed <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> were {{inhabitants of}} North America who, during a 5,000-year period, constructed various styles of earthen mounds for religious and ceremonial, burial, and elite residential purposes. These included the Pre-Columbian {{cultures of the}} Archaic period; Woodland period (Adena and Hopewell cultures); and Mississippian period; dating from roughly 3500 BCE (the construction of Watson Brake) to the 16th century CE, and living in regions of the Great Lakes, the Ohio River Valley, and the Mississippi River valley and its tributary waters.|$|E
25|$|In one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills {{one of the}} gods' cousins, so the god {{kills the}} serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the {{mountains}} and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear. The <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, though {{we are unable to}} unravel the particular associations.|$|E

25|$|Various amateur {{archaeologists and}} Mormon authors have cited {{controversial}} evidence that North American <b>mound</b> <b>builder</b> cultures {{were familiar with}} the elephant.

25|$|The mounds and mound {{remnants}} in Beattie Park {{date from}} an era during the Late Woodland {{known as the}} Effigy mound Period. This period spanned from about 700-1100 C.E. in the Upper Mississippi River Valley in parts of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Native American <b>Mound</b> <b>builders</b> were not a single culture but several groups that interacted and made artifacts and structures such as mounds in similar ways. The mounds in Beattie Park probably date from {{the early part of}} the time period 700-1100, when most of the effigy mounds seem to have been built.|$|E
25|$|The Western United States {{has been}} {{populated}} by Native Americans {{since at least}} 11,000 years ago, when the first Paleo-Indians arrived. Pre-Columbian trade routes to kingdoms and empires such as the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders</b> existed {{in places such as}} Yellowstone National Park since around 1000 AD. Major settlement of the western territories developed rapidly in the 1840s, largely through the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush of 1849. California experienced such a rapid growth in a few short months that it was admitted to statehood in 1850 without the normal transitory phase of becoming an official territory.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{a common}} belief {{was that the}} Jews, {{particularly}} the Lost Ten Tribes, were the ancestors of Native Americans and the <b>Mound</b> <b>Builders.</b> The Book of Mormon (published first during 1830) provides a related belief, as its narrative describes two major immigrations to the Americas from Mesopotamia: the Jaredites (c. 3000–2000 BCE) and an Israelite group during 590 BCE (termed Nephites, Lamanites and Mulekites). While the Nephites, Lamanites, and Mulekites were all of Jewish origin coming from Israel around 590 BCE, the Jaradites were a non-Abrahamic people separate in all aspects, except in a belief in Jehovah, from the Nephites. The Book of Mormon depicts these settlers building magnificent cities, which were destroyed by warfare about CE 385.|$|E
25|$|Many ancient {{man-made}} earthen mounds {{from various}} prehistoric <b>mound</b> <b>builder</b> cultures survive, {{especially in the}} areas of present-day Moundsville, South Charleston, and Romney. The artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of village societies. They had a tribal trade system culture that crafted cold-worked copper pieces.|$|R

50|$|The {{highest point}} in the {{community}} {{is dominated by the}} Shannon Methodist Church and a mound built by the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. The ovoid earthwork is 8 to 10 feet high and 100 feet in diameter.
