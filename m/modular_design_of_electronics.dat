40|$|The present theses {{discusses}} the development, technical design and realization {{as well as}} the read-out <b>electronics</b> <b>of</b> a detection system for the identification and tracking of low energy spectator protons. With the knowledge of the four-momentum of such spectator protons {{it will be possible to}} use deuterium as an effective neutron target. Previous measurements with an early version of the detection system have already shown that this method works quite well to investigate for instance the omega or eta-meson production in proton-neutron collisions. Moreover, after the completion and installation of the polarized internal target (PIT) at ANKE, it will be even possible to engage in that field with double polarized experiments. To increase the luminosity the polarized target is equipped with an extended target cell. The described detection-system will provide the vertex reconstruction for this extended interaction region. In addition, it will act as an independent beam polarimeter at ANKE. The detection system consists of three layers of double-sided silicon strip detectors which are arranged in a telescope structure and placed inside the accelerator vacuum as close as 2 cm to the interaction region. The <b>modular</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electronics</b> and the support structures for the detectors allows one to exchange detectors and electronics in a maximum flexible way. In a minimum configuration the telescope is equipped with two detectors, a thin (69 um) double-sided Silicon strip detector as a first layer and a very thick (>= 5 mm) double-sided micro-structured Lithium-drifted Silicon detector as a second layer. With this arrangement it is possible to track and identify protons in a kinetic energy range from 2. 5 MeV to 25 MeV. For deuterons this range for such a telescope configuration is from 4 MeV to 34 MeV$. The performance concerning the energy determination and tracking is shown based on data taken during a beam-time in November of 2003. With the existing setup an energy resolution of 120 keV for the 69 um thick first detection layer could be achieved. The proton-deuteron separation was in the order of 3. 8 sigma. First results of the measurements of the analyzing powers Ay and Ayy for the reaction dp -> dp as well as Ay for the reactions dp -> (pp) n and dp -> (np) p are presented to demonstrate the possible applications of the detection-system...|$|R
