Game-theoretic models of public-goods provision under ‘meritocratic matching’ succinctly capture this tradeoff: under zero meritocracy (society is randomly formed), theory predicts maximal inefficiency but perfect equality; higher levels of meritocracy (society matches contributors with contributors) are predicted to improve efficiency but come {{at the cost of}} growing inequality. We conduct an experiment to test this tradeoff behaviorally and make the astonishing finding that, notwithstanding theoretical predictions, higher levels of meritocracy increase both efficiency and equality, that is, meritocratic <b>matching</b> <b>dissolves</b> the tradeoff.

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of probe M 5 branes with <b>dissolved</b> <b>M</b> 2 charge in bubbling geometries with SO(4) × SO(4) symmetry. These solutions were constructed by Bena-Warner and Lin-Lunin-Maldacena and correspond to the vacua of the maximally supersymmetric mass-deformed M 2 brane theory. We find that supersymmetric probe M 2 branes polarize into M 5 brane shells whose backreaction creates an additional bubble in the geometry. We explicitly check that the supersymmetric polarization potential agrees with the one found within the Polchinski-Strassler approximation. The main result {{of this paper is}} that probe M 2 branes whose orientation is opposite to the background flux can polarize into metastable M 5 brane shells. These decay to a supersymmetric configuration via brane-flux annihilation. Our findings suggest the existence of metastable states in the mass-deformed M 2 brane theory. ar X i...|$|R

Aromatic diagnostic hydrocarbons, expressed in multiple pairs, from PIANO (gasoline-range hydrocarbons consisting of paraffin, isoparaffin, (mono-) aromatic, naphthene, and olefin compounds) analysis were identified using analyte aqueous solubility and structure relationships, which were found to be useful in distinguishing the source(s) of hydrocarbons in groundwater. Gasoline and coal tar NAPLs and associated groundwater were chemically characterized at a number of contaminated sites to confirm the diagnostic relationships that can link the BTEX present in remote offsite areas of groundwater to source hydrocarbons at a contaminated site...|$|R

A separation may be initiated by the worker (a quit) or the firm (a layoff), or may result from a joint decision. A dissolution of a worker-firm match may be ineffcient {{if it can be}} prevented by wage renegotiation. In this paper we study worker separations in the Dutch labor market. From an analysis of matched worker-firm data we conclude that both quits and layoffs are less likely to occur in high quality matches. We also find that workers with a high propensity to quit are offered higher wages to prevent them to quit. Similarly, workers with a high layoff probability give up some of their wage to prevent them from being laid-off. Despite these wage renegotiations some ineffciency in separations remains. However, there is a clear difference between quits and layoffs. Whereas ineffcient quits are rare ineffcient layoffs occur frequently. These phenomena may be related to downward wage rigidity. While it is easy to renegotiate higher wages to prevent quits it is much more difficult to renegotiate lower wages to prevent layoffs even if that would overall be beneficial to the workers involved. ...|$|R

For all entry modes, firms must invest in a continuum of tasks to bring a product to market. Each firm possesses a core competency in the task space, though firms are otherwise identical. For acquisitions and joint ventures, a multinational enterprise (MNE) must match with a local partner, where the local partner may provide complementary expertise within the task space. However, for joint ventures, investment in tasks is shared by multiple owners, and hence is subject to a holdup problem. In equilibrium, ex-ante identical multinational enter the local matching market, and ex post, three different types of ownership within a heterogeneous group of firms arise. Specifically, the worst <b>matches</b> <b>dissolve</b> and the MNEs invest greenfield, the middle matches form joint ventures, and the best matches integrate via mergers and acquisitions.
