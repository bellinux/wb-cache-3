5|$|The game {{incorporates}} {{an inventory}} system for items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using an inventory icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game will present a <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown.

25|$|In mathematics, {{the four}} color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any {{separation}} {{of a plane}} into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, {{no more than four}} colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called adjacent if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions. For example, in the <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.|$|E
25|$|For the program's first 25 years, weather {{reports were}} {{delivered}} by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway illustrated the day's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a still image of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties. When Floyd Kalber was brought in as newsreader in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.|$|E
500|$|The fourth song {{played and}} {{depicted}} in the program was Urban Rhapsody. Music played was George Gershwin's American classic Rhapsody in Blue. From the Coliseum's peristals, 85 grand pianos appeared. Followed by the orchestra and over 200 dancers. Followed immediately by The World Stage, a 1940s big band orchestra medley featuring songs mostly from Broadway, the movies and pop charts. Among the songs heard in this segment were Sing, Sing, Sing, Steppin' Out With My Baby from Easter Parade, One from A Chorus Line, the theme from Fame, and the Michael Jackson hit Beat It. [...] Joining the orchestra were 1500 dancers. The segment ends with the entire cast forming the outlined <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States to the strains of America the Beautiful.|$|E

500|$|The Indian side {{designed}} by Laura Fraser features a dramatically rendered Native American, standing erect with outstretched arm in what Vermeule {{describes as a}} gesture of peace. The Indian was added by the Frasers to the original map design concept endorsed by the OTMA. Swiatek and Breen noted that the Indian's [...] "position has been irreverently compared to that of a traffic policeman demanding 'Halt!'" [...] Such statements were made from the time of issue; The Numismatist in November 1926 stated that the Indian's left hand [...] "is upraised as if warning the people of the East of the perils and hardship of the Trail". Meeker's 1928 obituary in The New York Times averred that the Indian was [...] "standing with hands upraised to stop the white man's progress westward". The Native American wears a headdress, has a blanket and bow, and is superimposed on a <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, with a line of Conestoga wagons heading west. The design is carried to the rim of the coin; Hudson Bay is visible in the upper right.|$|E
500|$|Following Fight Clubs release, several fight clubs were {{reported}} to have started in the United States. A [...] "Gentleman's Fight Club" [...] was started in Menlo Park, California in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate [...] "Project Mayhem". In September 2015, two employees at Lightbridge Academy, a New Jersey daycare center, were charged with instigating [...] "Fight Club–style" [...] brawls between children aged four to six years of age. The fights {{were reported}}ly filmed and uploaded to Snapchat, a video messaging application, and involved approximately a [...] "dozen boys and girls". In the videos, one of the perpetrators, Erica Kenny, can be heard making references to Fight Club. The charges stem from an incident that occurred on August 13, 2015, but investigators are looking into whether the fights were ongoing.|$|E
