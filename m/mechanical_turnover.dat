40|$|Sewage sludge (SS) {{has been}} widely used as organic fertilizer. However, its {{continuous}} use can cause imbalances in soil fertility as well as soil-water-plant system contamination. The study aimed to evaluate possible improvements in the chemical and microbiological characteristics of domestic SS, with low heavy metal contents and pathogens, through the composting process. Two composting piles were set up, based on an initial C/N ratio of 30 : 1, with successive layers of tree pruning waste and SS. The aeration of piles was performed by <b>mechanical</b> <b>turnover</b> when the temperature rose above 65 ºC. The piles were irrigated when the water content was less than 50 %. Composting was conducted for 120 days. Temperature, moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), carbon and nitrogen contents, and fecal coliforms were monitored during the composting. A reduction of 58 % in the EC of the compost (SSC) compared with SS was observed and the pH reduced from 7. 8 to 6. 6. There {{was an increase in}} the value of cation exchange capacity/carbon content (CEC/C) and carbon content. Total nitrogen remained constant and N-NO 3 - + N-NH 4 + were immobilised in organic forms. The C/N ratio decreased from 25 : 1 to 12 : 1. Temperatures above 55 ºC were observed for 20 days. After 60 days of composting, fecal coliforms were reduced from 107 Most Probable Number per gram of total solids (MPN g− 1) to 104 MPN g− 1. I one pile the 103 MPN g− 1 reached after 90 days in one pile; in another, there was recontamination from 105 to 106 MPN g− 1. In SSC, helminth eggs were eliminated, making application sustainable for agriculture purposes...|$|E
50|$|Stoppel and Leite {{developed}} {{a study in}} 2013 to evaluate the predicted and actual energy consumption of two twin buildings using the energy model process documented during the LEED design phase and the utility meter data after 12 months of occupancy. The authors found that energy model predicted 14% and 25% more energy consumption for each building compared to the actual buildings energy use. The study’s results suggests that <b>mechanical</b> systems <b>turnover</b> and occupancy assumptions significantly differing from predicted to actual values.|$|R
40|$|The {{shrinkage}} temperature (Ts) and the pepsin-solubilizability of collagen fibrils in bone matrix obtained from decalcified femur diaphysis from 2 -, 5 -, 15 - and 25 -month-old rats {{were found to}} decrease with age. Digestion with human fibroblast collagenase dissolved {{less than half of}} the collagen, whereas sequential treatment by pepsin followed by collagenase resulted in its complete dissolution. This result shows that collagenase and a telopeptide-cleaving enzyme, when acting in an appropriate sequence, have a great potential for the degradation of bone collagen. The 'melting' profile of the pepsin-solubilized collagen showed a biphasic transition with transition peak at 35. 9 degrees C and 40. 8 degrees C. With increasing age an increasing proportion of the collagen 'melted' in the transition peak at 35. 9 degrees C (pre-transition), and the 'melting' temperature (Tm) of the collagen decreased in parallel with Ts in relation to age. Both Ts and Tm decreased by 3 degrees C in the age span investigated. The age-related change in Ts could therefore be accounted for by the decrease in molecular stability. The collagenase-cleavage products of the bone collagen obtained by the sequential treatment with pepsin and collagenase showed only one peak transition (at 35. 1 degrees C), and the Tm for the products was independent of age. The results indicate that the pre-transition for the pepsin-solubilized collagen is due to an age-related decrease in thermal stability may have implications for the <b>mechanical</b> strength and <b>turnover</b> of the bone collagen. In contrast with bone collagen, soft-tissue collagen showed neither the age-dependency of thermal stability nor the characteristic biphasic 'melting' profile...|$|R
30|$|High {{levels of}} the {{articular}} cartilage degradative marker CTX-II, the C-telopeptide of type II collagen, have also previously been associated with greater risk (Cibere et al. 2009) and severity (Fang et al. 2001, Jiao et al. 2016) of radiographic OA, {{as well as with}} MRI-detected knee cartilage defects in subjects with and without radiographic OA (Ding et al. 2005). Elevated CTX-II has also been found in the urine of growing children, attributed to growth plate activity, and was found to decrease with age in a study of healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 55  years (Mouritzen et al. 2003). These findings could explain the significantly higher levels of CTX-II in both groups of adolescents than in adult volleyball players in our study at both BL and FU and the decrease in CTX-II from BL to FU in the BL open adolescents, reflecting the transition from open to closed growth plates. However, our finding that levels of CTX-II at FU were greater in both groups of adolescents than in adults, when all adolescents but one had closed growth plates, suggests that CTX-II also reflects elevated cartilage turnover due to the adolescents’ higher volleyball activity levels in addition to growth. Similarly, a study by O’Kane at al. in varsity college athletes found that CTX-II was significantly higher in runners than in crew, swimmers, or controls (O’Kane et al. 2006). They concluded that the high levels of CTX-II in runners were caused by the increased amount of cartilage remodeling or degradation in that group due to joints stressed by high amplitude loading of the lower skeleton (O’Kane et al. 2006). Volleyball players likely experience similar amounts of mechanical loading as runners, as both are high-impact sports with substantial loading of the lower limbs. Thus, this study adds to previous findings suggesting that CTX-II reflects <b>mechanical</b> loading-induced cartilage <b>turnover,</b> making it a promising biomarker to assess pre-OA cartilage changes in an athletic, high-risk population.|$|R
