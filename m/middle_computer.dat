Analysis of the alignment of the amino acid sequences of 10 E 2 proteins reveals three distinct regions: two partially conserved domains at the N and C termini of the proteins and a region variable in size and sequence in the <b>middle.</b> A <b>computer</b> prediction of the secondary structure of the 10 sequences outlines interesting conserved features, including two long amphiphilic alpha helices at the N terminus.

The test of their capacity to trans-activate or repress different viral constructs shows that the C-terminal domain of the E 2 proteins is involved exclusively in DNA binding whereas the N-terminal domain is probably required for interaction with other components of the transcriptional machinery.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Elettra control system is presented {{by focusing on the}} major technical upgrades. The Elettra control system has been operating since 1993. The orginal control system architecture was based on a three layer de-sign. A field bus connected the low level computers used to interface the accelerator devices whilst a ten Mbit/s shared Ethernet network linked the <b>middle</b> layer <b>computers</b> to the servers and operator workstations. A first control system upgrade started in 1998 in order to dismiss the field bus and to provide more computing power. A couple of years later a major rework of the network infrastructure was car-ried out with the introduction of a switched Ethernet ar-chitecture. Starting from 2003, in view of the construc-tion of a new booster injector for the storage ring and of the FERMI@elettra free electron laser, new control sys-tem hardware and software platforms have been selected. Driven by the additional necessity of cutting development and maintenance costs, the Tango control system has been adopted.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} emphasis today on realistic applications of school mathematics. However, many educators assert that mathematics exists independently of its applications {{and that it}} should be taught in its “pure ” form.

These applications include such topics as geometry in Ancient Egypt, astronomy in the <b>middle</b> ages, and <b>computers</b> in the modern era.

40|$|With the {{availability}} of technology, hardware, and software, learning objects become fundamental to the learning process and change {{the way in which}} learning materials are designed. The vast development of technology forces both teacher and learner to modify their roles. Teachers become facilitators, while learners became active and responsible for selecting modes and styles of learning. Assuming this attitude of implementing technology in the learning process and seeking new methods of facilitating learning, universities and colleges have to adopt new techniques. One of these new techniques is the use of learning objects. Although learning objects are considered products of technology developed in the USA, Japan, and European countries, universities in the Middle East have been influenced by this development.

40|$|The {{debate over}} the {{possible}} interactions between language and thought has been an enduring and controversial one till this day. From a relativistic standpoint, language modulate our perception {{and understanding of the}} world; contrarily, universalists advance that language effects have little to no bearing on our cognitive machinery which is deemed to be universal. While previous research has delved into a multitude of lexicogrammatical domains (e. g., grammatical gender), cross-linguistic variations in the differentiation of relative distances between objects remains as one area that has received scant empirical attention. In English, prepositions like above/on and beneath/below are often used to denote distal and proximal relationships (e. g., "the clouds are above the fields" versus "the ball is on the floor"). Conversely, such spatial discriminations are not obligatorily encoded in Mandarin where shang (上) encompasses both above and on, and xia (下) signifies beneath and below. In light of this, we investigated the prospect of such cross-linguistic inconsistencies contributing to cognitive dissimilarities amongst English-Mandarin bilinguals. Participants were assigned to either the English or Mandarin experiment which contained 96 trials each. In every trial for the English experiment, a sentence describing the spatial relationship between two objects using prepositional primes was first presented (see Table 1). Following which, a spatial decision task was attempted where participants were required to click on either a superior or inferior region relative to a blue object in the <b>middle</b> of the <b>computer</b> screen (see Figure 1). The Mandarin experiment was methodologically similar and comprised matched Mandarin sentences. The results revealed that the English primes affected responses on the spatial decision task: Primes conveying proximal (on, beneath) and distal (above, below) relationships induced participants to click on positions closer and further away from the blue object respectively. Contrastingly, such distinctions in spatial decisions were not mirrored for the Mandarin primes (shang, xia). The findings bear several notable implications. First, we argue that the asymmetric results across the English and Mandarin experiments represent an interaction between spatial language and cognition. In considering the results from previous studies (Munnich, Landau, & Dosher, 2001; Suárez, Koh, & Zhang, 2013) with our current findings, we posit that the spatial language-thought relationship {{is likely to be a}} dynamic one, where the influence of language on cognition is selective rather than exhaustive. Second, we demonstrated the priming effects of language nonlinguistically. Thus far, only two other studies have explored how prior linguistic exposure can induce conceptual thinking that perseverates even in contexts devoid of language (Boroditsky, Ham, & Ramscar, 2002; Holmes & Wolff, 2010). Third, while the vast majority of the literature illustrates bilinguals’ performance resembling those of L 1 or L 2 monolinguals or falling somewhere in-between, our findings suggest that bilinguals may adopt and rely on distinct L 1 and L 2 modes of thinking...|$|R
