25|$|Artificial levees block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh water and {{sediment}} to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> leaving the region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|E

[...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings."

[...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E

Mortgage adviser Bruce Patten said the trend was 'disturbing' and added to the gap between the 'haves and have-nots'.|$|E

2500|$|Cinematographer Daniel Mindel {{stated that}} The Force Awakens would use real {{locations}} and scale models over computer-generated imagery {{to make it}} aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy.

[...] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.|$|E
