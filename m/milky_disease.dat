50|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} controls is used during the larva stage. Beetle larva can be controlled using <b>milky</b> spore <b>disease</b> (Bacillus popilliae), which occurs naturally in some larva. Milky spore treatment was first developed by the USDA in the 1930s to combat the Japanese beetle but milky spore controls the June bug and Oriental beetle as well. Milky spore treatment was the first microbial product ever registered in theUS. Milky spore begins working after treatment wherever larva are feeding. In warm climates <b>milky</b> spore <b>disease</b> can achieve control in 2-3 years. Colder climates may require longer. The soil is inoculated annually for from 3 to 5 years and once the treatment is established, it is effective for 10 years or more dependent upon climate conditions.|$|R
50|$|During the larval stage, the Japanese beetle {{lives in}} lawns and other grasslands, where it eats {{the roots of}} grasses. During that stage, it is {{susceptible}} to a fatal <b>disease</b> called <b>milky</b> spore <b>disease,</b> caused by a bacterium called milky spore, Paenibacillus (formerly Bacillus) popilliae. The USDA developed this biological control and it is commercially available in powder form for application to lawn areas. Standard applications (low density across a broad area) take from one to five years to establish maximal protection against larval survival (depending on climate), expanding through the soil through repeated rounds of infection.|$|R
50|$|<b>Milky</b> <b>disease</b> of {{lobsters}} {{developed in}} Vietnam in late 2006, and {{is assumed to}} be the result of poor quality lobster handling and rearing aquaculture techniques. The disease is likely to be induced by stress during handling and because of inadequate water quality conditions through long-distance transport from catching to farming locations. Similar symptoms are seen in other crustaceans such cultured shrimp and are also induced by stress-related problems. Similar stress symptoms caused by low-quality water conditions are thought to trigger this disease as well as inducing a number of opportunistic pathogens due to the lobsters immune system being compromised by stress. However, milky haemolymph has been experimentally transmitted among lobsters by cohabitation and by infection of unfiltered haemolymph from diseased lobsters into healthy lobsters. Filtered haemolymph from a 0.45 μm filter is not infectious which probably indicates the involvement of a pathological entity transmitted by either water or food. Symptoms are commonly seen where there are too many lobster farming cages in one area. <b>Milky</b> <b>disease</b> caused a large decline in annual lobster production in Vietnam from 1,900 t in 2006 to 1,400 t in 2007. In a closed culture system, <b>milky</b> <b>disease</b> is seldom observed, but the lobsters can be infected by several other diseases, reducing survival rates. First, the shells of sick lobsters slowly change from a natural blue coloration to brown and finally dies without feeding for weeks. Second, at the base of the crawling leg as well as the abdominal segments, the orange colour comes out and one week later, the leg may be broken and lobsters die. It is also found that several lobsters of 10-30 g had special symptom in which the white rod shape look like frame of leaf on the abdominal segments and lobsters will die in mass very soon. These observation is reported from cultured lobster in recirculation system in Vietnam and unpublished.|$|E

The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} all available milky-disease species and strains that have been isolated around the world from beetle larvae (family Scarabaeidae). Included {{in the study were}} Bacillus popilliae Dutky, B. lentimorbus Dutky, and B. lentimorbus var. maryland from the United States; B. euloomarahae Beard and B. lentimorbus var. australis Beard from Australia; B. fribourgensis Wille from Switzerland; and New Zealand <b>milky</b> <b>disease</b> (Dumbleton). The organisms were classified into three groups: (i) those containing parasporal bodies, including B. popilliae Dutky, B. fribourgensis Wille, and New Zealand <b>milky</b> <b>disease</b> (Dumbleton); (ii) those without a visible parasporal body and with spore morphology similar to B. lentimorbus Dutky, including B. lentimorbus var. australis Beard; and (iii) those with very tiny spores and no parasporal body, including B. euloomarahae Beard and B. lentimorbus var. maryland. All available milky-disease species and strains were cultivated in vitro on Brain Heart Infusion Agar plates. However, the most fastidious organisms—B. euloomarahae and B. lentimorbus var. maryland—could not be grown until they were passed through a life cycle in larvae of a large scarabaeid beetle infesting rotting wood. Then they remained stable for only one or two subcultures. All the milky-disease organisms produced larger cells in vitro than they did in vivo. The pattern of sugar fermentations was similar for all milky-disease species. It appears that there is a very low percentage of strains of B. popilliae, B. lentimorbus, and the other milky-disease organisms that have the inherent genetic makeup to permit them to sporulate on artificial media, if conditions are favorable. Among these conditions are a sufficiently high cell population and a reduced oxygen tension.

40|$|Fourteen {{pesticides}} (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides) {{were tested}} {{to determine whether}} they had deleterious effects on the bioinsecticide Bacillus popilliae, the causal agent of <b>milky</b> <b>disease.</b> All of these pesticides reduced levels of spore viability, spore germination, and/or vegetative cell growth when they were tested over a range of concentrations from 0 to 1, 000 ppm of active ingredient, and the fungicides had the greatest detrimental effects. As determined by tests in water, the level of spore viability was significantly reduced by chlorothalonil, iprodione, (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid plus 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid, and 2 -[(4 -chloro-o-tolyl) oxy]propionic acid plus (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid. In tests performed with iprodione, loss of viability was evident at concentrations less than the concentration calculated to result from recommended use. Tests performed in soil demonstrated that triadimefon, chlorothalonil, (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid plus 2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid, and pendimethalin at concentrations resulting from recommended rates of application reduced spore titers. Spore germination did not occur in the continued presence of 2 -[(4 -chloro-otolyl) oxy]propionic acid plus (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid, isofenphos, and chlordane, whereas exposure of spores to triadimefon or pendimethalin for 2 days stimulated germination. The tests to determine effects on spore germination were inconclusive for all other pesticides. Triadimefon, chlorothalonil, iprodione, pendimethalin, and chlorpyrifos at concentrations less than the concentrations recommended for use inhibited vegetative cell growth of B. popilliae, and chlordane at a concentration that was twice the concentration expected to result from the recommended rate of application repressed cell growth.

40|$|Studies of {{the common}} grass grub (Costelytra zealandica (White)) covered two major aspects, {{population}} ecology and pest assessment. The object or these studies {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of developing models, predicting population density and estimating the associated losses in pasture productivity, as a basis for the formulation of a pest management programme. I. Population Studies Studies of natural populations of soil insects such as grass grub require the development of accurate and efficient mechanical methods of sampling and extraction as well as a statistically precise and efficient sampling plan. 1. Population Studies a) Mechanical aspects. A split barrelled manually operated corer was developed for sampling grass grub. This implement permitted 175 to 245 samples to be taken daily by one man. Sample sites were drawn randomly within strata by a computer as rectangular co-ordinates and converted to polar co-ordinates, originating from the centre of the 20, 20 x 20 m subplots in each study plot. Sites were then sorted and listed in numerical order based on the polar ordinate. The use of the computer allowed large savings in the time taken to draw and list random co-ordinates and made it possible to randomly draw samples from irregular shaped strata. A large compass wheel enabled sample sites to be located rapidly in the field. Sampling times were based on beetle flights, seasons and, in the case of pupal sampling, pilot sampling. Extraction or all the developmental stages of grass grub from soil was accomplished by means of a modified Ladell process which gave a 96 to 98 % recovery rate and, dependent on the stage of the insect, a processing rate of between 4. 4 and 6. 5 man minutes per sample. The extraction process did not impair the insect’s viability. b) Statistical aspects. The main consideration {{in the development of a}} sampling plan was to obtain, for the lowest cost, an estimate of population density with a precision of ± 10 % SE. The variance minimizing efficiencies of different methods of stratified sampling and sample allocation were assessed. The different strata used were based on the division of the study plots by; subplots, damaged and undamaged pasture and damaged and undamaged pasture within each subplot. The most efficient method of stratification was influenced by the accuracy with which damaged areas of pasture could be defined and the population level. Although optimal allocation of samples gave spectacular gains in efficiency, the use of this method of sample allocation in the field was not practical. The adoption of a flexible rather than a rigid sampling plan in which the strata varied with population level and the ease with which pasture damage could be identified, enabled, except at very low population levels, the required level of precision to be attained with the resources available. Sample size was inversely related to population density but was highest for the egg stage in which grass grub are most aggregated. The sample size required to attain the level of precision sought ranged between 131 sample units, for high third instar larval populations, and 2450 units for low egg populations. 2. Population Dynamics Over the period of study at Takapau marked changes were not evident in the flight behaviour of female beetles. No parasites, or important invertebrate or vertebrate predators were found at Takapau and the effect of disease organisms on Takapau populations was considered unimportant. In the Waikato region, however, where the native <b>milky</b> <b>disease</b> may infect up to 40 % of the third instar grass grub population, disease is considered to be an important factor in population regulation. Analyses of age specific mortalities within generations indicated that mortality over the autumn and winter was strongly density dependent and above a certain threshold density compensated completely for change in population density. Laboratory experimentation showed that the major contribution to density dependent mortality arose from larval combat which increased as food supply declined. From this observation the hypothesis was proposed that weather conditions which influence the survival of damaged plants and therefore dispersal and aggregation of larvae, influences larval combat. From field data it was found that the autumn threshold for combat mortality over the autumn-winter period was linearly related to pasture production over this period. At Takapau when summer soil moisture levels were in excess of wilting point larvae were found feeding close to the surface. Under these conditions combat mortality occurred and thus summer mortality was density dependent. When soil moisture levels approached and fell below wilting point summer mortality became linearly related to soil moisture. At Rukuhia as distinct to Takapau highest soil moisture levels under drought conditions were found close to the surface. As a result, larvae did not descend in the soil profile in response to drought and for this reason summer mortality at Rukuhia, under drought conditions, was attributed to the direct effect of the lethally high soil temperatures found near the surface. It was concluded from these studies that grass grub populations at Takapau fluctuate in response to low summer or high spring soil moisture levels and are regulated in relation to food supply by larval combat. The effect of summer mortality on generation mortality is moderated by the density dependent nature of combat mortality of larvae in autumn-winter. Consequently, mortality in the summer only influences generation mortality if it decreases population density below the threshold density at which autumn-winter combat mortality occurs. The knowledge gathered from these studies explains why grass grub populations are so difficult to control with transient insecticides and has suggested better ways of using insecticides. A population model was developed for predicting population changes within and between generations at Takapau. The model was based on the relationships described above and gave encouragingly accurate results. However, it did highlight the need for more accurate definition of the relationships between the major mortalities identified by these studies and the important variables which affect them such as soil moisture, rainfall, pasture production and population density. II. Pest Assessment Studies A technique which does not involve the use of insecticides was developed for measuring losses in pasture production arising from grass grub damage. This technique is suited to areas of relatively low summer rainfall where the occurrence of grass grub can be located visibly by pasture damage. The method involves the division of a paddock into, and the measurement of herbage production from, three strata; undamaged areas, areas damaged by previous generations and areas damaged solely by the current generation. The sizes of the strata were measured by aerial photography or estimated from a growth curve of the area visibly damaged or, the relationship established between the area of visible damage and insect density. Given the size and herbage production from each stratum the total production for each plot or paddock can be estimated. Pasture damaged by grass grub showed deterioration in botanical composition with an increase in litter and grass weeds and a decrease in white clover. Damaged pasture had a higher percentage of bare ground and in the autumn and winter was poorly utilized by livestock. Seasonal herbage losses were highest in autumn and winter, although the highest loss in monthly herbage production was recorded in late summer. In newly damaged areas seasonal losses in herbage production of 70 % and 74 % were recorded in autumn and winter respectively whereas the respective losses in the areas damaged by previous generations in autumn and winter were 54 and 34 %. Recovery, in terms of pasture production, of damaged areas was complete in late spring. Observations made in these studies showed that within the strata described the severity of damage caused by low and high populations of grass grub was not significantly different, and that increased losses in pasture production associated with higher populations resulted from an increase in the damaged area rather than an increase in the severity of damage in damaged areas. Based on this information losses in pasture productivity caused by different population levels were estimated from the relationship between population density and the area of visible damage and the mean pasture production from each stratum. Two models were developed which simulated the growth, over successive generations, in area of visible damage under environmental conditions which favoured the increase or maintenance of grass grub populations. Both models describe the growth in area of damage up to a stage where damage was extensive, ill-defined and impossible to measure. One model is based on the relationships between, the size of individual patches of damage and the factor by which these grow over successive generations, and the rate of appearance of damaged areas in the following generation and proportion of the paddock currently damaged. The other model involves the growth curve of May larval populations under conditions which are favourable for population increase and the relationship between population density and pasture damage. The latter model tended to underestimate the actual growth of the area damaged by approximately 20 %. It was found that the establishment of accurate economic threshold levels for different classes of farms run at different intensities and in different regions is attended by many problems. In the light of current knowledge the translation of losses in herbage production into animal production and economic terms for different farming intensities under different climatic conditions will lead to such grossly inaccurate estimates that the worth of pest assessment studies would be lost. From these studies it was concluded that at best pest assessment studies of grass grub could provide the farmer with information that will allow him to predict population density and the associated losses in herbage production. Given this information the farmer is in the position to make more objective decisions, than would otherwise be possible, on the course of action to follow based on his own socio-economic circumstances...|$|E
