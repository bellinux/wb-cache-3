40|$|Since the 1990 s, Salt River has {{undergone}} significant changes to its socio-economic, cultural and physical structures {{due to the}} withdrawal of {{both public and private}} investments from the area. These changes are interpreted by the City of Cape Town (CoCT) as an indication that Salt River is in decline and, consequently, in need of regeneration. In response to this perception, the CoCT has developed a number of spatial frameworks and plans to guide regeneration in the area. This dissertation assesses the manner in which 'neighbourhood change' is taking place in Salt River, and how the CoCT is facilitating and managing this change. I develop a theoretical framework using Fanstein's (2010) concept of the 'just city' and consequently I establish criteria for urban justice. These are used in this research to assess the manner in which neighbourhood change is occurring in Salt River and how the CoCT is facilitating and managing this change. The main research question thus asks: How should <b>municipal</b> <b>planners</b> and policymakers engage more effectively with processes of decline and regeneration that are leading to changes in the spatial and socio-economic fabric of Salt River? The research uses the case study, oral history and discourse analysis methods to address this question. Data is collected through non-participant observation, oral history and individual semi-structured interview techniques. The focus is on capturing the views and opinions of users of Salt River; more specifically, the area's long-term residents. The research findings indicate that only the residential parts of Lower Salt River are in decline. The commercial portions of Salt River are regenerating. In adopting a minimal intervention stance in relation to the regeneration of Salt River, the CoCT has left the market to direct regeneration in the case area. <b>Municipal</b> <b>planners</b> need {{to take the lead in}} the regeneration of Salt River to ensure that social development is prioritised and that working class households do not continue bearing the costs of regeneration. I recommend that <b>municipal</b> <b>planners</b> and policy makers create a social development framework for the area in conjunction with all residents. Moreover, <b>municipal</b> <b>planners</b> and policy makers should mandate that affordable housing be kept as affordable housing in perpetuity and that one-to-one replacement policies for affordable housing be established. This will ensure that affordable housing in the area is not lost and consequently, that working class households are not displaced as property and land values in the area increase...|$|R

40|$|Urban farming {{projects}} often {{involve the}} (temporarily) redevelopment of urban space by local co-productions of citizens and/or entrepreneurs. To realize their ambitions these coalitions often need support of public (government) {{resources such as}} time, money, space and regulation (Green Deal Stadslandbouw, 2013). This paper asks the question {{to what extent the}} development of urban farming projects can be understood as an example of planning through direct citizen participation/ participatory governance (e. g. Cornwall, 2004; Roberts, 2004) and what this means for the role of the municipal planning professional or civil servant in making these projects successful. Literature {{on the role of the}} <b>municipal</b> <b>planner</b> or civil servant in urban farming projects mainly concerns the role as enabler of projects given the many difficulties for projects. However, when looked at the development of urban farming as an example of citizen participation/ participatory governance and the transfer of social functions towards society other roles and tasks of planners seem to be important to make urban farming successful. This discussion paper looks to the role of planners and civil servants in some related government domains such as landscape (e. g. Van Dam et al. 2008, 2010, 2011) and neighbourhood development (e. g. Frieling et al., 2014) to complement our understanding of the role of planners in making urban farming projects successful.

40|$|The {{global and}} {{everlasting}} {{quest for the}} limited resources of the earth has developed into a need to chisel out how each spatial area {{will be able to}} sustain its inhabitants. The connection between global and local sustainability is direct and undisputed. However, the global vision of sustainability and its concrete meaning in local terms are vastly separate. In {{order to be able to}} bridge this gap, there is a need to anchor the vision and make it more tangible locally. Physical planning at a local level has in many ways been pin-pointed as the tool to achieve this, since local planning results in a merging of the economic, ecological and social aspects of sustainable development. Alongside this broadened view, the governmental vision of democracy is turning towards increased decentralization. Citizen participation is therefore becoming a part of, and even a uniting link, in the realization of sustainable development. This has created entirely new demands for the individual <b>municipal</b> <b>planner.</b> His/her new task is mainly to merge local stakeholders into functioning planning processes. As a response to this new network-based view of society, collaborative-or communicative-planning is being tested both theoretically and practically as a tool for realizing it. There are, however, major reservations as to how well it serves this purpose. The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to this discourse on these reservations, perhaps offering some useful input for further research and/or future development of guidelines for the practising planner. It is based on two case studies of communicative planning processes carried out in a Swedish context. The main conclusions are that communicative planning, both theoretical and practical, should be developed in a more post-modern and pragmatic sense, anchoring it firmly in its local, spatial setting and releasing it from preset assumptions of the formal and informal rules and boundaries of government and/or governanceGodkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the daily {{patterns}} of social and spatial behaviour in the barrios of Quito, Ecuador. Latin American barrios are low-income settlements which emerge illegally in {{the periphery of the}} cities, without basic infrastructure, and which are built progressively through the self-help efforts of owner-residents. Barrios are in quantitative and qualitative terms the most important phenomenon of Latin American urbanization. Between 25 - 50 % of the residents of the cities live in such settlements. The social organization of barrio residents is rich, complex and distinct from other urban groups such as high-income sectors, which traditionally aspire to a North American or European way of life. Despite the fact that barrio populations have specific patterns of daily, social and spatial behaviour, urban planning by municipal authorities in Latin America has been tailored towards the lifestyle of high-income groups. The city of Quito, a capita of one million inhabitants, is no exception to this pattern. It is evident from the literature and from my own professional experience [...] as an educator in the barrios and later as a <b>municipal</b> <b>planner</b> [...] that the prevalent planning orientation towards high-income groups is partly {{due to a lack of}} common language between social scientists and planners. It is, however, also due to a lack of knowledge by planners and geographers of how the urban culture of barrio groups works. Much research has been carried out to date in the barrios but it suffers from inadequate understanding of the spatial dimensions of daily social behaviour. The social geography of barrios is indeed poorly known. I argue here that the spatial analysis of daily social interaction is a crucial component in explaining the obvious differences in spatial behaviour between low-income and high-income groups and in communicating this understanding in a practical and tangible form to municipal planners. Thus, the purpose of this thesis is to help fill this gap in knowledge through a geographical examination of daily patterns of social and spatial behaviour. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
