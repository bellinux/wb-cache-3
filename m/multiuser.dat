2500|$|At its introduction, the 68000 {{was first}} used in high-priced systems, {{including}} <b>multiuser</b> microcomputers like the WICAT 150, early Alpha Microsystems computers, Sage II / IV, Tandy TRS-80 Model 16, and single-user workstations such as Hewlett-Packard's HP 9000 Series 200 systems, the first Apollo/Domain systems, Sun Microsystems' Sun-1, and the Corvus Concept; and graphics terminals like Digital Equipment Corporation's VAXstation 100 and Silicon Graphics' IRIS 1000 and 1200. Unix systems rapidly moved to the more capable later generations of the 68k line, which remained popular in that market throughout the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{electric}} breast pumps, hospital grade and personal use pumps. Hospital grade pumps are larger and intended for multiple users. Personal use pumps are smaller and generally intended for one user. Electric breast pumps are powered by a motor which supplies suction through plastic tubing to a horn that fits over the nipple. [...] The portions of the pump that come into direct contact with the expressed milk must be sterilized to prevent contamination. [...] This style provides a lot more suction, making pumping significantly faster, and allows pumping of both breasts at the same time. [...] Electric breast pumps are ideal for when a mother will be pumping daily. [...] Electric breast pumps are larger than manual ones, but portable models are available (e.g. in a backpack or shoulder bag) that allow the mother to transport the pump. Some manufacturers have battery packs or built in batteries to allow portable operation of the pumps. Some electric pumps allow for <b>multiuser</b> operation, requiring only an accessory kit for each user.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, ArcGIS Server editions are {{available}} at two levels, scaled according to capacity: Workgroup and Enterprise. ArcGIS Server Workgroup can be deployed on a single machine to support a maximum of 10 simultaneous connections to a <b>multiuser</b> geodatabase. With Workgroup, the <b>multiuser</b> geodatabase storage capacity cannot exceed ten gigabytes. ArcGIS Server Enterprise supports distributed deployment of ArcGIS Server components, unlimited simultaneous connections to a <b>multiuser</b> geodatabase, and unlimited <b>multiuser</b> geodatabase storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|Both {{single user}} and <b>multiuser</b> {{libraries}} {{can be built}} with c-treeACE. The <b>multiuser</b> support is a shared-file mode implementation where the operating system provides the locking rather than the server process. Resource contention can become an issue with the standalone <b>multiuser</b> model as concurrency requirements and network operations increase.|$|E
50|$|The company's {{first product}} was Citrix <b>Multiuser,</b> an {{extension}} of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft, and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix <b>Multiuser.</b> <b>Multiuser</b> allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2. Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made <b>Multiuser</b> nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company {{to work on a}} new version of <b>Multiuser.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Multiuser</b> {{diversity}}: <b>Multiuser</b> {{diversity is}} obtained by opportunistic user scheduling at either the transmitter or the receiver. Opportunistic user scheduling is as follows: {{at any given}} time, the transmitter selects the best user among candidate receivers according to the qualities of each channel between the transmitter and each receiver. A receiver must feed back the channel quality information to the transmitter using limited levels of resolution, {{in order for the}} transmitter to implement <b>Multiuser</b> diversity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multiuser</b> DOS {{suffered}} from several technical limitations that restricted {{its ability to}} compete with LANs based on PC DOS. It required its own special device drivers for much common hardware, as PC DOS drivers were not <b>multiuser</b> or multi-tasking aware. Driver installation was {{more complex than the}} simple PC DOS method of copying the files onto the boot disk and modifying CONFIG.SYS appropriately it was necessary to relink the <b>Multiuser</b> DOS kernel (known as a nucleus) using the SYSGEN command.|$|E
50|$|<b>Multiuser</b> {{detection}} deals withdemodulation of the mutually interfering digital {{streams of}} information that occur {{in areas such as}} wireless communications, high-speed data transmission, DSL, satellite communication, digital television, and magnetic recording. It is also being currently investigated for demodulation in low-power inter-chip and intra-chip communication. <b>Multiuser</b> detection encompasses both receiver technologies devoted to joint detection of all the interfering signals or to single-user receivers which are interested in recovering only one user but are robustified against <b>multiuser</b> interference and not just background noise.|$|E
50|$|Qubes {{is not a}} <b>multiuser</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Mutual {{interference}} {{is unavoidable}} in modern spectrally efficient wireless systems: even when using orthogonal multiplexing {{systems such as}} TDMA, synchronous CDMA or OFDMA, <b>multiuser</b> interference originates from channel distortion and from out-of-cell interference. In addition, in multi-antenna (MIMO) systems, the digitally modulated streams emanating from different antennas interfere at the receiver, and the MIMO receiver uses <b>multiuser</b> detection techniques to separate them. By exploiting {{the structure of the}} interfering signals, <b>multiuser</b> detection can increase spectral efficiency, receiver sensitivity, and the number of users the system can sustain.|$|E
50|$|ArcGIS Server is {{also used}} to manage <b>multiuser</b> geodatabases. <b>Multiuser</b> geodatabases {{leverage}} ArcSDE technology, implemented on a relational database management system (RDBMS). ArcGIS Server Enterprise supports IBM DB2, IBM Informix Dynamic Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. ArcGIS Server Workgroup supports Microsoft SQL Server Express R1 and R2.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>multiuser</b> MIMO systems {{where the}} number of users are higher than {{the number of}} {{transmit}} antennas, a <b>multiuser</b> diversity can be achieved by performing user scheduling before applying zero-forcing beamforming. <b>Multiuser</b> diversity is a form of selection diversity among users, the base station can schedule its transmission to those users with favorable channel fading conditions to improve the system throughput. In order to achieve <b>multiuser</b> diversity and apply zero-forcing precoding, the CSI of all users are required at the base station. However, the amount of overall feedback information increases with the number of users. Therefore, it is important to perform a user selection at the receiver side to determine the users which are fed back their quantized channel state information to the transmitter side based on pre-defined threshold.|$|E
