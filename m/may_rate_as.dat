500|$|Moderation points add to a user's rating, {{which is}} known as [...] "karma" [...] on Slashdot. Users with high [...] "karma" [...] are {{eligible}} to become moderators themselves. The system does not promote regular users as [...] "moderators" [...] and instead assigns five moderation points {{at a time to}} users {{based on the number of}} comments they have entered in the system [...] once a user's moderation points are used up, they can no longer moderate articles (though they can be assigned more moderation points at a later date). Paid staff editors have an unlimited number of moderation points. A given comment can have any integer score from −1 to +5, and registered users of Slashdot can set a personal threshold so that no comments with a lesser score are displayed. For instance, a user reading Slashdot at level +5 will only see the highest rated comments, while a user reading at level −1 will see a more [...] "unfiltered, anarchic version". A meta-moderation system was implemented on September 7, 1999, to moderate the moderators and help contain abuses in the moderation system. Meta-moderators are presented with a set of moderations that they <b>may</b> <b>rate</b> <b>as</b> either fair or unfair. For each moderation, the meta-moderator sees the original comment and the reason assigned by the moderator (e.g. troll, funny), and the meta-moderator can click to see the context of comments surrounding the one that was moderated.|$|E

50|$|The {{protein content}} lies between 8 and 18%. The European market is {{economically}} highly {{interested in the}} protein content, mostly as feed for cattle. Protein content also may be interesting for the food industry, because about 80% of the protein is water-soluble and not extractable within a pH range of 2-10. The lipid content is very low, below 1%. Altogether, the tuber shows a very good nutritional composition.

40|$|Birth {{month in}} humans is {{associated}} with certain biological variables such as reproductive success, health and mortality rate. At the same time, physical attractiveness is {{regarded as one of}} the reliable markers of human health and genetic quality, which suggests that female attractiveness may vary according to their season of birth. To test this hypothesis, ratings of females’ photographs from a popular Polish social networking website were analyzed. The sample included 5294 females aged 21 - 23 years.

Such tapes are generally low voltage and safe for skin to touch but can be shorted by fine metal objects. Water resistant strip lighting is covered in a heat conducting epoxy or silicone to protect the circuitry from direct contact with water, and can be rated IP65, IP67, or with suitable sealed connections IP68. Both coated and uncoated LED tapes have a two sided adhesive backing to stick to walls, desks, doors, etc.|$|R

40|$|General {{practitioners}} are often reluctant to administer brief cognitive tests, and {{to question the}} relatives of patients who appear to be demented, for fear of causing distress. Diagnoses of dementia are therefore often based on guesswork, and non-demented patients <b>may</b> be <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> cognitively impaired in error. A randomly selected sample of 174 general practice patients aged 80 years and over {{were asked to complete}} a simple test of orientation and information in order to assess the usefulness and acceptability of such a procedure. If patients scored 10 points or less out of 12, a relative or other knowledgeable informant was questioned about their changes in mental state and behaviour. Assessments proved acceptable to patients, relatives and doctors; diagnoses were revised in 29 cases; and practical initiatives were proposed in 15 cases. Open discussions with patients and their families proved innocuous and have much to commend them...|$|R
40|$|The trawl {{data from}} the International 0 -group fish surveys in the Barents Sea are analyzed. The fishing powers of the {{participating}} vessels are estimated and corrected for. A relative index of year class strength is computed on a logarithmic scale applying the method described by RANDA (1982). The average yearly recruitment of Norwegian spring-spawning herring is very low in the period, and only the 1983 year class can be caracterized as a strong one. A few other year classes, 1966, 1973, 1979 and 1984 <b>may</b> be <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> slightly above the average if the 1983 year class is not taken into account. In the period 1975 - 82 an index of recruitment of herring was obtained through bioacoustic measurements in the fjords of northern Norway.

50|$|Further, {{according}} to LBT, all emotions can be uniquely identified by their specific object (O) and rating (R) elements. For example, the O of anger {{is always an}} action; and the rating is a strong negative evaluation of the action itself or the individual performing the action. In depression, the O is an event or state of affairs; and the R is a strong negative rating of the said event or state of affairs, {{on the basis of}} which one strongly negatively rates one's own existence. Thus, you <b>may</b> <b>rate</b> the divorce <b>as</b> terrible, on the basis of which you strongly negatively rate your own existence (as in wishing you were dead).|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of optimal keywords dictionary {{is one of}} the most important tasks in developing of thesaurusbased Informational Retrieval Systems and some other NLP applications. The problem is, which parameters of keywords dictionaries <b>may</b> be <b>rated</b> <b>as</b> consistent ones from statistical point of view (that is not dependent on sample size) ? Analysis of the recent scientific works and the results of our own investigations allowed us to determine a rather complete list of parameters, which may be used for description of texts and language resources. Each of these parameters was exposed to the consistency test. Methodology for consistency test has been elaborated using the method of least squares with a number of principle modifications. Our main results are the following: 1) Theoretically all analyzed parameters have either upper or lower limits. That means that in principle they are statistically consistent. However, for the most of parameters actual consistency is achieved only in the ve [...] ...|$|R
