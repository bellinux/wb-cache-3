5000|$|Around {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the latter words were coined as the {{concepts}} that they described evolved into widespread existence. Therefore, during the Machine Age, machining referred to (what we today might call) the [...] "traditional" [...] machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, <b>milling,</b> <b>broaching,</b> sawing, shaping, planing, reaming, and tapping. In these [...] "traditional" [...] or [...] "conventional" [...] machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry.|$|R
50|$|In gear form cutting, {{the cutting}} edge of the cutting tool has a shape {{identical}} with the shape of the space between the gear teeth. Two machining operations, <b>milling</b> and <b>broaching</b> can be employed to form cut gear teeth.|$|R
40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of manufacturing industries and {{production and the}} increased need of accuracy and precision throws the spotlight on the nontraditional machining processes. The machining of metals and nonmetals having special properties like high strength, high hardness and toughness is done by non- conventional machining methods. Wire electrical discharge machining {{is one of the}} earliest non-traditional machining processes. This machining process competes with conventional machining such as <b>milling,</b> <b>broaching,</b> grinding etc. However, its ability to cut extremely intricate and delicate shapes with utmost accuracy makes this process most suitable among all other processes. The otherwise hard to be machined materials like carbides, tungsten, zirconium etc. can be easily machined using this process.

50|$|Gear cutting is any {{machining}} process {{for creating a}} gear. The most common gear-cutting processes include hobbing, <b>broaching,</b> <b>milling,</b> and grinding. Such cutting operations may occur either after or instead of forming processes such as forging, extruding, investment casting, or sand casting.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{manifold}} efforts to reach a total renouncement {{of the use of}} cooling lubn'cants in metal cuttingfor en-vironmentally reasons, cooling lubrication is an essential condition to achieve an economical tool life and the re-quired surface quality in many cases. Against this background, the minimum quantity cooling lubrication is an interesting possibility for an economical and environmentally compatible production which combines the functional-ity of the cooling lubrication with an extremely low consumption of cooling lubricants. With help of various results achieved in turning, <b>milling</b> and <b>broaching</b> experiments, this report describes the possibilities of application of mini-mum quantity cooling lubricating systems in machining with geometrically defined cutting edges...|$|R
50|$|Square {{heads and}} sockets were {{the easiest to}} make in the era when hand filing was the typical method of manufacture. With the {{proliferation}} of modern manufacturing methods, such as <b>milling,</b> shaping, <b>broaching,</b> and advanced die forging, it became just as easy to make hex heads and sockets as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet pawl to catch the next tooth.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014, an {{estimated}} 80% of all gearing produced worldwide {{is produced by}} net shape molding.Molded gearing is usually either powder metallurgy or plastic. Many gears are done when they leave the mold (including injection molded plastic and die cast metal gears), but powdered metal gears require sintering and sand castings or investment castings require gear cutting or other machining to finish them. The {{most common form of}} gear cutting is hobbing, but gear shaping, <b>milling,</b> and <b>broaching</b> also exist. 3D printing as a production method is expanding rapidly. For metal gears in the transmissions of cars and trucks, the teeth are heat treated to make them hard and more wear resistant while leaving the core soft and tough. For large gears that are prone to warp, a quench press is used.|$|R
5000|$|Planers and shapers are now , {{because other}} machine tools (such as <b>milling</b> machines, <b>broaching</b> machines, and {{grinding}} machines) have mostly eclipsed them as the tools of choice for doing such work. However, {{they have not yet}} disappeared from the metalworking world. Planers are used by smaller tool and die shops within larger production facilities to maintain and repair large stamping dies and plastic injection molds. Additional uses include any other task where an abnormally large (usually in the range of 4'×8' or more) block of metal must be squared when a (quite massive) horizontal grinder or floor mill is unavailable, too expensive, or otherwise impractical in a given situation. As usual in the selection of machine tools, an old machine that is in hand, still works, and is long since paid-for has substantial cost advantage over a newer machine that would need to be purchased. This principle easily explains why [...] "old-fashioned" [...] techniques often have a long period of gradual obsolescence in industrial contexts, rather than a sharp drop-off of prevalence such as is seen in mass-consumer technology fashions.|$|R
40|$|In general, {{machine tool}} {{structures}} like lathe, <b>milling,</b> <b>broaching,</b> and grinding machines, etc. {{are subjected to}} regular unwanted vibrations. These machine tool vibrations or chatter are deleterious to machining operations. It results in degraded quality on the machined parts, shorter tool life, and unpleasant noise, hence are to be necessarily damped out. The important characteristics of the machine tool structures for metal cutting are high damping and static stiffness which ensure manufacture of work pieces of the required geometries with acceptable surface finish at the required rate of production in the most economical way. The unwanted vibrations must be arrested in ordet to ensure higher accuracy along with productivity. In the present work, the chatter vibrations on a slotted table Horizontal Milling Machine have been damped out using composite structure {{as a substitute for}} the base of the work piece. Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy plates are fixed on to the slotted table as a secondary bed material and the workpiece is mounted on this bed for feeding to the rotating milling cutter. Initially four holes are drilled on each plate of the composite and a set of five plates of each type of composite are mounted for conducting the experiments. A mild steel specimen of similar dimension of the composite plate is placed on the pile of the composites and the setup is fixed to the slotted table using bolts and nuts. An up milling operation is carried out and the vibration signal is recorded on the screen of the digital phosphorus storage oscilloscope. The signal and RMS amplitude, frequency and time period of vibrations are recorded. The experiment is repeated for different sets of composite plates by decreasing the number and the corresponding readings are recorded and tabulated. Moreover, experiments are also conducted without any composite material below the mild steel specimen. It is observed that the vibration amplitude decreases with increase in number of layers of sheets of composites and then increases with increase in number of plates. Moreover, the optimum number of composites are also experimentally determined. The design of the experimental setup has been modeled using CatiaV 5 R 15. Apart from total damping of the system, emphasis has also been focused to find out the material damping of the composite materials so as to select the same for effective damping of the structures. An energy balance approach has been used for calculating the material damping of the fiber reinforced composites used in the experiment. ...|$|R

50|$|Several {{technologies}} {{are capable of}} removing substantial amounts of material. Among them are: sawing, turning, <b>broaching,</b> <b>milling</b> and grinding. Turning and milling {{are the most popular}} machining technologies; turning is mainly used for round products (though a specialized variant called whirling can modulate the turning axis to produce non-round shapes), whereas milling has a broad range of applications. Certain ‘difficult to machine’ materials like titanium, stainless steels, and exotic high-nickel alloys can be challenging to process when high stock removal is the goal, due to local heat generation at the cutting edge and the difficulty in removing it. These challenges can be mitigated, however, by strategies such as high-volume flood coolant, specialized cutting tool geometries, optimized speed and feed settings, and tool coatings like AlTiCN which tend to divert heat into the chip, away from the cutting tool.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTitanium alloys such as Ti 6 Al 4 V {{are often}} {{employed}} in turbine industry components {{due to their}} outstanding mechanical properties.

Within this paper a comparison between grinding and WEDM of Ti 6 Al 4 V concerning surface integrity aspects proved by bending fatigue life is set up. Due to visual inspections and surface roughness measurements a higher fatigue life of the ground specimen is assumed. In contrast the EDMed specimen show higher fatigue strength. Further surface integrity aspects have been conducted to analyse the fatigue result. Summarized, the better correlation between visual part quality, influenced rim zone and fatigue strength, shows a user-friendly quality check of EDMed parts. Furthermore, this paper shows that WEDM is an alternative to conventional processes for machining titanium alloys...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSuperalloys such as Inconel 718 {{are widely}} used in {{turbomachinery}} industry due to their outstanding mechanical properties. Inconel alloys {{are very difficult to}} machine using conventional mechanical processes like <b>broaching,</b> <b>milling</b> or grinding. Wire electrical discharge machining (W-EDM) is an alternative competitive process to manufacture complex Inconel part geometries. However, surface integrity of W-EDMed Inconel components is poorly understood. This study presents the characteristics of surface integrity vs. discharge energy in W-EDM of Inconel 718. The results show that the EDMed surface topography shows dominant coral reef microstructures at high discharge energy, while random micro voids are dominant at low discharge energy. Surface roughness is equivalent for parallel and perpendicular wire directions, and average roughness can be significantly reduced for low discharge energy. The thick white layers are predominantly discontinuous and non-uniform at relative high discharge energy. Micro voids are confined within the thick white layers and no micro cracks were found in the subsurface. The thin white layers by trim cut at low discharge energy become more continuous, uniform, and are free of micro voids. Compared to the bulk material, white layers have dramatic reduction in microhardness due to significant thermal degradation. In addition, surface alloying from wire electrode and water dielectric are obvious in main cut at high discharge energy, but it can be minimized in trim cuts at very low discharge energy...|$|R
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} play {{an important}} role in the performance of machined components. Component characteristics that are influenced by residual stress include fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and part distortion. The functional behavior of machined components can be enhanced or impaired by residual stresses. Because of this, understanding the residual stress imparted by machining is an important aspect of understanding machining and overall part quality. Machining-induced residual stress prediction has been a topic of research since the 1950 s. Research efforts have been primarily composed of experimental findings, analytical modeling, finite element modeling, and various combinations of those efforts. Although there has been significant research in the area, there are still opportunities for advancing predictive residual stress methods. The objectives of the current research are as follows: (1) develop a method of predicting residual stress based on an analytical description of the machining process and (2) validate the model with experimental data. The research focuses on predicting residual stresses in machining based on first principles. Machining process output parameters such as cutting forces and cutting temperatures are predicted as part of the overall modeling effort. These output parameters serve as the basis for determining the loads which generate residual stresses due to machining. The modeling techniques are applied to a range of machining operations including orthogonal cutting, <b>broaching,</b> <b>milling,</b> and turning. The strengths and weaknesses of the model are discussed as well as opportunities for future work. Ph. D.

40|$|Gears are {{components}} in mechanical assemblies used for transmitting power and motion. Gear form cutting (<b>broaching,</b> <b>milling)</b> and gear generating (shaping and hobbing) {{are two of}} the main gear manufacturing methods. Usually production involves three stages: (i) soft machining, (ii) heat treatment, and (iii) hard machining. Limitations introduced by conventional methods can be listed as follows: - In machining difficult to cut materials, high cost of specialized cutting tools, high cutting tool failures is a major issue and high cost of machine tools. - Stresses generated due to heat (thermal stresses) and cutting force affect the component life and cost. This demands alternative ways of material removal without affecting the mechanical properties while delivering right quality in a cost effective way which is the goal of the industry. - Increasing standards on environmental impacts associated with products force the modern manufacturing industry to take critical approach on making processes environmental friendly. Large volume of material is removed during conventional gear production resulting in higher lead time, more use of cutting fluids (and its disposal), chip handling (and its disposal) and dust. In this context, abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting {{is considered to be a}} good addition to the current production system due to the low amount of applied force, negligible heat generated during machining, minimal change in material properties, versatility, lower initial investment and environmental friendliness (no chip generation and no need for cutting fluids). To demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in manufacturing spur gears and helical gears, forged gear blanks typically used on automobile industry were used for initial tests and two gears were produced using 3 -axis KimTech and 5 -axis FineCut precision AWJ machine tools. Individual teeth have been separated from each gear and tested against each other from different perspectives. The metrological, surface integrity, productivity and production cost comparisons were presented. While improvements were achieved from environment and surface integrity perspectives, AWJ cutting cannot replace soft machining stage due to increased lead time and production cost. Novel hybrid gear manufacturing method was proposed from the experiences from this research and compared against the conventional method employed in the automotive industry. Proposed hybrid approach comprises AWJ cutting process as the major material removal method and conventional 5 -axis machining for final finishing or maintenance of tight tolerances and at the same time, decreasing initial investment and adding further flexibility to production system.

40|$|Due {{to global}} warming, {{the demand for}} more {{efficient}} gas turbines has increased. A way to achieve this, is by increasing the operating temperature of the gas turbine. Therefore, nickel-based superalloys {{have been developed to}} withstand these extreme temperatures and loads, especially in the hot sections. Today, the way of operating land-based gas turbines is changing. Instead of running for long periods of time, the operation is becoming more flexible, with ever-increasing cyclic loads and number of start and stop cycles. To handle the increased stress and cycles, component resistance to fatigue failures need to be improved. Surface integrity is critical to fatigue performance, since fatigue cracks normally initiate at a surface. Machining changes the surface integrity which can result in worse fatigue resistance. The work presented in this Ph. D. thesis was conducted in collaboration with Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB in Finspång, Sweden. Surface integrity changes which are induced during machining and their effects on fatigue performance have been studied on the alloy Inconel 718. Inconel 718 is a widely-used nickel-based superalloy for high temperature applications in modern gas turbines. <b>Broaching,</b> <b>milling,</b> and wire electrical discharge machining, related to component manufacturing in turbo machinery industries, were included in this study. Machining induced surface defects provide preferential sites for fatigue crack initiation which influence the fatigue performance of the alloy. If compressive residual stresses are induced during machining, they benefit the fatigue life by retarding fatigue crack initiation away from surface regions. Shot peening was performed on machined Inconel 718, by which high compressive residual stresses are deliberately induced. It results in enhanced fatigue performance. The high temperatures in gas turbines generally deteriorate the surface integrity. Recrystallization often occurs in the highly deformed surface layer. Microstructural degradation, in the form of α-Cr precipitates, have also been frequently observed in the deformed surface and sub-surface microstructure. Oxidation at elevated temperatures degrades the surface integrity and thereby also the fatigue performance. Fatigue cracks are preferably initiated at oxidized surface carbides, if thermal exposure has been made prior to the test. It is even worse when high temperatures relax the beneficial surface compression induced by shot-peening and thereby lowering the fatigue resistance. Machinability of a newly developed nickel-based superalloy, AD 730 TM, and the surface integrity induced during turning have also been studied in this thesis project. AD 730 TM is a candidate for turbine disc applications with an operating temperature above 650 °C. At such high temperatures, Inconel 718 is no longer stable and its mechanical properties start to degrade. To summarize, the results from this thesis work show the importance of understanding surface integrity effects for fatigue applications, especially in harsh environments. Moreover, the knowledge gained through this work could be used for surface enhancement of turbine components which are subjected to a high risk of fatigue failure. These will contribute to more efficient and flexible power generation by gas turbines...|$|R
40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. <b>milling,</b> turning, and <b>broaching),</b> research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|R
