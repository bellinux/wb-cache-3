40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the possibilities offered by modelassisted commissioning in residential buildings. Three examples are considered: two small detached houses and a large <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> building. A static multi-zone building model is used in each case. A model of the heating system is also used for the multi-storey building. Both co-heating and tracer gas measurements are used in order to adjust the parameters of each building model. A complete monitoring of the central heating plant, with measurements of water temperatures and flow rates is used to adjust {{the parameters of the}} boiler model...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study {{is concerned with}} the integrated appraisal of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> blocks which incorporate large concrete panel systems (LPS). The first step was to look at U. K. <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock in general, and under the management of Birmingham City Council in particular. The information has been taken from the databases of three departments in the City of Birmingham, and rearranged in a new database using a suite of PC software called `PROXIMA' for clarity and analysis. One hundred of their stock were built large concrete panel system. Thirteen LPS blocks were chosen {{for the purpose of this}} study as case-studies depending mainly on the height and age factors of the block. A new integrated appraisal technique has been created for the LPS dwelling blocks, which takes into account the most physical and social factors affecting the condition and acceptability of these blocks. This appraisal technique is built up in a hierarchical form moving from the general approach to particular elements (a tree model). It comprises two main approaches; physical and social. In the physical approach, the building is viewed as a series of manageable elements and sub-elements to cover every single physical or environmental factor of the block, in which the condition of the block is analysed. A quality score system has been developed which depends mainly on the qualitative and quantitative conditions of each category in the appraisal tree model, and leads to physical ranking order of the study blocks. In the social appraisal approach, the residents' satisfaction and attitude toward their <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> block was analysed in relation to: a. biographical and housing related characteristics; and b. social, physical and environmental factors associated with this sort of dwelling, block and estate in general. The random sample consisted of 268 residents living in the 13 case study blocks. Data collected was analysed using frequency counts, percentages, means, standard deviations, Kendall's tue, r-correlation coefficients, t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analysis. The analysis showed a marginally positive satisfaction and attitude towards living in the block. The five most significant factors associated with the residents' satisfaction and attitude in descending order were: the estate, in general; the service categories in the block, including heating system and lift services; vandalism; the neighbours; and the security system of the block. An important attribute of this method, is that it is relatively inexpensive to implement, especially when compared to alternatives adopted by some local authorities and the BRE. It is designed to save time, money and effort, to aid decision making, and to provide ranked priority to the <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> stock, in addition to many other advantages. A series of solution options to the problems of the block was sought for selection and testing before implementation. The traditional solutions have usually resulted in either demolition or costly physical maintenance and social improvement of the blocks. However, a new solution has now emerged, which is particularly suited to structurally sound units. The solution of `re-cycling' might incorporate the reuse of an entire block or part of it, by removing panels, slabs and so forth from the upper floors in order to reconstruct them as low-rise accommodations...|$|E
40|$|The paper gives {{methodology}} of the Latvian buildings’ energy certification scheme proposed in 2000 for existing and new <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> buildings. It shows {{the results of}} the trial implementation of the scheme done with the support of EU LIFE programme in Ogre town in 2002 - 2004 that had proved it to be an effective mechanism of the reduction of buildings heat consumption. The existing buildings’ energy certification scheme considers only space heating and hot water supply. In order to comply with the requirements of the Directive 2002 / 91 /EC on the certification by total energy consumption the building energy certification scheme has to take into account also gas and electricity consumption. The paper for the first time presents and analyses measured data on total building energy consumption in Latvia. The paper gives theoretical basis and methodology for incorporation of electricity and gas consumption in the standardized annual specific energy consumption used as criterion in the existing building energy certification scheme...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{ventilation}} systems in dwelling buildings {{is to ensure}} optimal comfort conditions and indoor air quality (IAQ) for inhabitants. While temperature and humidity level are crucial indicators for human comfort, CO 2 concentration is significant factor for human health. Since PVC windows have got wide expansion the problems with IAQ became more urgent. The air-exchange rates in dwelling buildings commonly are calculated by the same methods irrespective of the apartment’s level. This paper is devoted to modeling of air exchange rates and air distribution in multi-storey apartment buildings. A stack effect could be observed in the multi-storey buildings during the winter: the cold outdoor air infiltrates trough {{the lower levels of}} building and comes out through the upper levels. When internal walls and ceilings are not airtight, in addition to heat circulation, CO 2 circulation from building’s lower levels to upper levels is also taking place. In such case the calculation methods of air-exchange rate should differ for upper and lower building’s levels. The paper provides the results of monitoring of the IAQ features in <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> buildings paying particular attention to the influence of building’s level on IAQ parameters...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{the results of}} monitoring on the specifics of indoor air quality in Latvian dwelling buildings. It will present {{the results of the}} evaluation of the ventilation system’s operation in different working regimes in Latvian climatic conditions. Until the end of 90 -ties all dwelling buildings in Latvia were equipped with mandatory natural ventilation systems with stack effect. Installation of regular mechanical “inflow - outflow” ventilation systems in dwelling buildings was limited by such factors as high noise level during operation time, limited buildings’ area and high construction expenses. At the beginning of 2007 the part of Latvian multi-storey apartment buildings which were constructed with natural ventilation systems took 75 % of all buildings. The inflow of fresh air acquired through the gaps between window frame and window carcass. The exhaust of air acquired through the vents, which are situated in kitchens and bathrooms. Old <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwelling</b> buildings in Latvia were mainly built using wooden window frames with low heat insulation quality. It was assumed that such constructive decision would provide sufficient air exchange rate without any mechanical devices. Nowadays the PVC windows have got a great expansion at Latvian market due to their acceptable prices and high heat and noise insulation qualities. At the same time air tight windows require the introduction of mechanical ventilation systems that certainly reduces the positive energy saving effect of improvements of thermal performance of building structures. In the scope of this paper the influence of ventilation on building energy performance was evaluated...|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the space}} {{restrictions}} imposed by the narrowness of the [...] "tail", and the advantages of living within the defensive wall, the Old Town became {{home to some of}} the world's earliest [...] "high rise" [...] residential buildings. <b>Multi-storey</b> <b>dwellings</b> became the norm from the 16th century onwards. Many of these buildings were destroyed in the Great Fire of Edinburgh (1824); the rebuilding of these on the original foundations led to changes in the ground level and the creation of many passages and vaults under the Old Town. The construction of new streets including North Bridge and South Bridge in the 18th century also created underground spaces, such as the Edinburgh Vaults below the latter.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the participation of}} households in recycling programmes in areas of multi-storey, low income housing which are often considered unattractivefor such programmes. A model of the material recycled is presented together with a review of socio-economic, housing, technological, policy and other factors influencing household recycling. This {{is followed by a}} case study of two areas in the city of Edinburgh. Results suggest that the level of recycling is influenced by collection methods, for all materials except glass, with half of the recyclers starting {{as a result of the}} introduction of kerbside collection. Housing characteristics such as the storey-level in buildings without lifts, household size and access to cars all influenced recycling participation rates. Housing tenure was not found to be significant. This suggests that well designed kerbside collection programmescan have a significant impact in areas with high levels of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwellings,</b> low income and public housing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSound {{classification}} scheme opens new enhanced possibilities to ensure noise protection in buildings and included in Lithuanian {{legislation in force}} since 2004 as a Building Regulation STR 2 : 01 : 07. The {{classification scheme}} comprises five acoustic comfort classes. For each sound class are defined airborne and impact sound insulation, reverberation time and environmental noise limit values. Sound classes are applicable for newly designed <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwellings,</b> double-apartments, blocks of multifamily housing, and some non- residential buildings with noise-sensitive indoor environment. In this article is summarized experience of nine years of application the classification scheme to management acoustic comfort. Acoustic comfort of newly constructed dwellings has significantly improved in recent years through two factors: new demands for sound insulation quality of buildings and enforcement legal requirements through pre- completing control. Good practice lessons as well results of implementation of these requirements for buildings were commenced. Due to development this sound classification scheme, more strict requirements could be voluntary applied to low-rise dwellings by application acoustic classes designed for the high-rise apartment buildings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} of a project with the aim to achieve {{a deeper understanding of}} how the design process and its ICT tools may support the development towards industrialised building. The project focuses on the construction process for <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and how object-oriented ICT-tools may be designed to enable different technical solutions as well as competition among builders. The paper presents a definition of industrialised building and its characteristics with a discussion of different project types with regard to complexity and suitability for industrialisation. These are compared with results from a preliminary study of the ship building process, which shows great resemblance to the building industry. Requirements on object oriented ICT that supports process and product platforms for housing construction are discussed. The study has shown that the more well known the processes are, the greater the possibilities are to develop supporting applications; and the higher the product volume is, the more advanced computer software can be used. Finally conclusions are made and plans for continued research work in the project are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Märsta ( [...] ; roughly {{pronounced}} [...] ) is {{a suburb}} of Metropolitan Stockholm, a locality and the seat of Sigtuna Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 27,034 inhabitants in 2015. The town is situated close to Stockholm's main international airport, Arlanda. Even if its origins go back to around 500 AD, Märsta is a widespread modern residential area. Märsta has a mix of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwellings</b> and smaller houses. It is in a phase of expansion and new residential areas are built both in central parts of Märsta and in the surrounding areas like for instance Steningehöjden. Märsta {{can be reached by}} commuter trains from Stockholm running at quarterly intervals during daytime and by bus from Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The central parts of Märsta has a shopping area [...] "Märsta Centrum" [...] with various shops, pub and restaurants. Another smaller shopping area is [...] "Valsta Centrum". East of the central parts of Märsta there is an industrial area and a bit further east close to the airport a shopping mall [...] "Eurostop". Most parts of Märsta and the municipality of Sigtuna can be reached with local bus services originating at the railway station and also connecting with commuter trains.|$|R
40|$|A huge {{increase}} in residential and business-commercial construction has characterised Grosuplje, a young town and suburban settlement of the greater Ljubljana area, {{over the last two}} decades, thereby increasing the number of possible users of its open space. The arrangement of this settlement development to date has not been successfully followed and urban green areas undergoing the urbanisation process were not treated fully or equivalently to other spatial utilisation. Based on these departure points, a basic question has arisen: what types and quantities of planned green areas are needed in Grosuplje today? It was assumed that such planned areas which would effectively serve the needs of users were lacking in the town, yet doubt regarding accessibility and the public nature of existing green areas has arisen, which could pose a considerable obstacle to users. In order to verify these assumptions and departure points, a short research survey was carried out with the residents, with a spatial analysis performed simultaneously. There were two key findings. The problem of urban green areas and open spaces is more {{about the quality of the}} arrangement and content of these spaces rather than the quantity. The need for planned green areas was expressed by the residents of both single homes and <b>multi-storey</b> <b>dwellings.</b> General guidelines for planning green areas in Grosuplje as well as guidelines which could aid in designing the town's appearance were given based on these findings...|$|R
40|$|The United Arab Emirates (UAE) {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on desalination for water supply in urban areas, which comes at significant financial and environmental costs. Therefore, reducing the demand for water is a strategic objective of water authorities in the UAE. The concentration of the UAE population in multi-story buildings in urban areas makes residential water conservation, including greywater recycling, a highly attractive option for reducing water demand and wastewater generation. However, the unique composition of the UAE population poses challenge to adopting water conservation policies that are suitable for the UAE national and expatriate sectors of the population. Furthermore, the current water recycling policies and legal framework do not encourage greywater recycling for internal use in residential buildings. In this study, a framework for assessing the potential and feasibility of water conservation, including greywater recycling, in <b>multi-storey</b> and detached <b>dwellings</b> in the UAE was developed and discussed. The results confirmed that significant potential existed for reducing the residential water demand in the UAE through adopting simple water conservation measures and greywater recycling in multi-story buildings. The discussion was extended to proposing greywater recycling systems suitable for multi-story buildings in the UAE. Such systems involve partial greywater recycling from the higher floors of multi-storey buildings to serve the toilet flushing needs of the whole building and locating greywater treatment systems on the roofs of buildings...|$|R
