30|$|A {{conditional}} operation is performed {{to determine whether}} or not to update the synaptic weights. For the unsupervised training method, the adaptation step requires that the <b>machines</b> <b>output</b> an equal value. Even if both outputs are equal, another condition is set comparing the <b>machine’s</b> <b>output</b> to the value of a hidden node’s output. This ensures that only the hidden node, whose weights are mismatched to the <b>machine’s</b> <b>output,</b> are updated. Additionally, the adaptation step uses a learning rule to modify and update the weights. The result of the learning rule is clipped to satisfy the specified boundaries L of the weights. After complete synchronization of the machines, the weights are used as keys for a cryptosystem. A special case is seen when determining the sign of a zero value.

Using Taguchi’s recommended design of experiments, we initially conducted experiments with eight input parameters at different levels. Significant parameters were identified with the help of the signal-tonoise ratio and ANOVA. Finally, another set of experiments was conducted for analysis of the process and development of empirical expressions for MRR and EWR. Experimental results established that rotary electrical discharge machining with a polarity reversal magnetic field delivers better <b>machining</b> <b>output</b> than <b>machining</b> in a non-magnetic field.

50|$|In the present, Mark {{has begun}} {{deciphering}} {{one of the}} pictures found on Frost: a large blueprint of an ancient mechanical device. Janis takes the blueprint to an antiquities professor {{to figure out what}} it means. When Janis shows a copy of the blueprint to the pet store lady, she orders Janis to take back the blueprint and destroy the other copy on Mark’s mosaic board. Janis successfully infiltrates the professor’s office and takes the blueprint, and also wipes his computer’s hard drive. When she sneaks into Mark’s office to take the copy, Mark catches her, and Janis hurriedly explains she needs it to replace the one that the professor had lost. Mark tells her he’ll make a copy in the morning; the next day, the professor tells them his findings, as he had already taken pictures of the blueprints: he uses a computer to construct a model of the blueprints, which depict a clock-like device with many gears. The professor explains the <b>machine</b> <b>outputs</b> dates, with the first one being October 6, 2009, the day of the blackout. Meanwhile, Mark tries to interpret Frost’s dying words: “You’ll be saved by the lady you see every day.” Mark realizes the “lady” to be the white queen chess piece tacked on his mosaic board, the one found with Frost at Utah. Mark breaks the chess piece open to reveal a ring, the same one Suspect Zero had been wearing. Lloyd and Simon identify the ring as a QED, or quantum entanglement device, and wearing it would make someone immune to the effects of the blackout. Mark theorizes that this might be the reason men come to attack him on April 29. Later, Janis reports to her handler, who orders her to retrieve the ring and not mess up again like she did with the blueprints. She also gives her a final task: to kill Mark Benford.|$|E

30|$|In the {{physical}} method, a new attack algorithm is described to evaluate cryptosystems utilizing TPM.

First, faster synchronization of session keys can thwart the attack due to its accuracy depending on the number of traces gathered.

30|$|The {{main idea}} of {{developing}} an experimental setup for SCAs revolves {{around a large}} amount of stored measurements from a leakage source in the target device. From this, a testbed is constructed utilizing the following instrumentation: TektronixTM DPO 4054 B oscilloscope, ATmega 328 P microcontroller, 10 Ω resistor, and a PC station. The resistor is utilized as a measurement point to connect the oscilloscope’s probes and read the power consumption of the microcontroller along its GND rail. The microcontroller hosts an implementation of a TPM-AES cryptosystem with added triggers for leakage evaluation of certain intermediate operations: memory reads, <b>machine</b> <b>outputs</b> inside the TPM, and key transfers to AES. The triggers are sent to the oscilloscope to capture the time frames of the intermediate functions chosen. This is possible due to the availability of a customizable environment within the Arduino®; platform. Since it compiles code via a C/C++ wrapper, implementations can be examined to insert triggers in specific locations that hold special significance. The PC station acts as the master controller of the measuring system to read and store oscilloscope data via a custom interface.|$|E
40|$|A machine solves {{a problem}} using space s(·) if, for every input x, the <b>machine</b> <b>outputs</b> {{the correct answer}} and uses only the first s(|x|) cells of the tape. For a {{standard}} Turing machine, we can’t do better than linear space since x itself must be on the tape. So we will often consider a machine with multiple tapes: a read-only “input ” tape, a read/write “work ” or “memory ” tape, and possibly a write-once “output ” tape. Then we can say the machine uses space s if for input x, it uses only the first s(|x|) cells of the work tape. We denote by L the set of decision problems solvable in O(log n) space. We denote by PSPACE the set of decision problems solvable in polynomial space. A first observation is that a space-efficient machine is, to a certain extent, also a time-efficient one. In general we denote by SPACE(s(n)) the set of decision problems that can be solved using space at most s(n) on inputs of length n.

Here n is usually written in standard base B notation, though other numeration systems are also considered. A typical example is the Morse-Thue sequence �tn � which is usually defined in terms of iterated morphisms. However, there is an alternative characterization that shows that tn is the digit-sum of the binary expansion of n modulo 2. Thus, the Morse-Thue sequence is 2 -automatic. The study of automaticity has lately attracted a lot of attention, see the excellent book by Allouche and Shallit [AS]. Alas, {{little is known about the}} state complexity of the finite state machines in question: given an automatic sequence, what is the size Μ�a � of the smallest machine that recognizes it? Often there is a canonical machine that witnesses the automaticity of a sequence and provides an upper bound on Μ�a�, but the inherent complexity of the minimization process often makes it very difficult to pin down the exact state-complexity of the sequence. Using a suitable computational environment one can generate sample data that can lead to plausible conjectures. More computation can then help to prune false assumptions and produce answers, at least in a few selected cases. This is particulary important since the combinatorics of our problem will turn out to be fairly complicated so that in general no simple closed form solutions are available. � Divisibility and Horner Automat...|$|E
40|$|Ideally pattern {{recognition}} machines provide constant output when the inputs are transformed under a group 6 of desired invariances. These invariances {{can be achieved}} by enhancing the training data to include examples of inputs transformed by elements of G, while leaving the corresponding targets unchanged. Alternatively the cost function for training can include a regularization term that penalizes changes in the output when the input is transformed under the group. This paper relates the two approaches, showing precisely the sense in which the regularized cost function approximates the result of adding transformed examples to the training data. We introduce the notion of a probability distribution over the group transformations, and use this to rewrite the cost function for the enhanced training data. Under certain conditions, the new cost function is equivalent to the sum of the original cost function plus a regularizer. For unbiased models, the regularizer reduces to the intuitively obvious choice-a term that penalizes changes in the output when the inputs are transformed under the group. For infinitesimal transformations, the coefficient of the regularization term reduces to the variance of the distortions introduced into the training data. This correspondence provides a simple bridge between the two approaches. 1 Approaches to Invariant Learning In machine learning one sometimes wants to incorporate invariances into the function learned. Our knowledge of the problem dictates that the <b>machine</b> <b>outputs</b> ought to remain constant when its inputs are transformed under a set of operations G. l In character recognition, for example, we want the outputs to be invariant under shifts and small rotations of the input image.

This subject area is thoroughly researched and the major problem areas are briefly discussed. The tracking areas to be simulated include pursuit and compensatory tracking tasks, multi-dimensional tracking tasks as well as environmental control criteria for the subject, the latter consisting of an environmentally controlled chamber. Facilities were selected, based upon previous tracking studies to vary some of the basic environmental conditions: illumination, sound pressure and temperature. The tracking tasks available can be varied in type of input signal display media, operator control unit as well as waveform of the input signal, operator control response function and performance data collection. Timed, random and cumulative timed data collection features are designed into the system.

The study aims at examining the translation output against translation techniques to find out which of them are used in the translation process, and what influence they have on conveying the accurate meaning of the news headlines. Besides, the study intends to evaluate the machine translated versions of selected news headlines produced by the used machine translators, namely Google and Babylon, in terms of clarity, accuracy and style through a questionnaire distributed to experienced professionals working in different academic institutions. The data for the study consists of 40 Arabic news headlines with their manually translated versions which were selected from three online sources, namely Aljazeera, Al-Hayat, and Al-Sharqalawsat, and which were retranslated electronically into English using two machine translators, Google and Babylon. The outputs of the machine translations are analysed to determine the structure of each translated headline in terms of Swan’s model (1996) and the influence of that structure {{on the quality of the}} original meaning of the news headline. Besides that, the selected data was also examined to find the types of translation techniques that are available in both <b>machine</b> <b>outputs.</b> Furthermore, this study will make use of Hutchins and Somers‘s evaluation criteria (1992), namely on clarity, accuracy and style.

Recently, Marcin Sabok showed that in fact this ideal is not ∆ 1 2 on Σ 1 1, and the ideal indeed is not ZFCcorrect. This has some unpleasant repercussions if one wants to develop the theory of countable support iteration for Mathias forcing in ZFC. in particular, I do not know if the countable stages of that iteration are of the form Borel modulo a σ-ideal. In Section 3. 5, I did not state any ZFC results for Π 1 1 on Σ 1 1 σ-ideals, because I did not know that in such a case the Baire category game is determined. In fact, the game is determined in this case as proved below, and so all the theorems and corollaries in this section have a ZFC counterpart for such σ-ideals! After Definition 3. 7. 1, I say that ergodicity does not imply c. c. c. or vice versa and I do not provide examples documenting this cryptic sentence. There is in fact a very instructive counterexample to the left-to-right implication. Consider the Turing equivalence E on 2 ω. It most certainly has countable classes. Every Borel E-invariant set is either disjoint from or contains a cone by a basic determinacy result. The collection I of all sets B ⊂ 2 ω disjoint from a cone forms a σ-ideal, and the ideal is ergodic with respect to E. At the same time, there is an uncountable antichain of pairwise disjoint sets in the quotient. Before I construct it, note that the quotient forcing adds a point x ∈ 2 ω such that all ground model reals are Turing reducible to it, and therefore the size of the continuum must be collapsed to ℵ 0.
