50|$|The Harbour Island People Mover was an {{automated}} guideway transit people <b>mover</b> <b>service</b> used to carry visitors between Downtown Tampa and Harbour Island across the Garrison Channel in Tampa, Florida, United States. Privately owned but operated by the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority (HART), service commenced on June 27, 1985. Due to low ridership and operating losses, the service was discontinued on January 16, 1999. The money given to {{the city for the}} closure of the system in a settlement with ownership served as the foundation of an endowment to cover the operating expenses of the TECO Line Streetcar System.|$|R

In the long term, the Commission is {{planning for a}} fixed track transit system along the Niagara Parkway, although no decision has been taken on the exact technology to be used. In the meantime, the Commission joined forces with Niagara Falls Transit to launch the fully accessible WEGO bus system in 2012, {{and in the process}} discontinued the People <b>Mover</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} {{anticipated}} sporadic terabyte demands generated by high-end time-constrained applications, dynamically reconfigurable optical networks services are envisioned. However, {{the time and}} rate granularities of a bandwidth reservation service and those of transfer tasks using the reserved capacity is not necessarly {{in the same order}} of magnitude. This may lead to poor resource utilisation and overprovisionning. Transfer request aggregation is able to limit this problem. This paper explores the interactions between a bandwidth reservation service and a data <b>mover</b> <b>service</b> guaranteeing bulk data transfers. We formulate the underlying optimisation problem and propose an optimal strategy for bandwidth provisionning when time-constrained bulk data transfer requests are known in advance. Simulations show that the temporal parameters of requests (deadline and patience) are the dominant criteria...|$|R

W. Caspersen (1941-2009). When the Harbour Island People <b>Mover</b> opened for <b>service</b> on June 27, 1985, it marked the return of rail transit to Tampa since the closure of its streetcar network in 1946. Costing $7 million to complete, former President Gerald Ford took part in the inaugural ride. Although it opened to much fanfare, ridership of the system remained relatively low. By 1989, ridership averaged 1,200 riders on a weekday and 1,500 on the weekend or for an average of about 2 riders per trip. The low ridership was attributed to the perceived difficulty in accessing the downtown station and the addition of a lunch-time shuttle bus service between downtown and Harbour Island by January 1989.|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} {{the effects of}} financial innovation on bank performance. Specifically, we {{examine the effects of}} financial innovation on interest rate spread in the Tunisian banking industry over the 1987 - 2010 period. The results indicate that, contrary toour expectations, in Tunisia, the financial innovation process significantly affects spread pricing policy. We found that adoption of unconventional products, source of commissions, allows banks to offer lower spread rates, while the first mover’s initiatives in process innovation increase spread rates. On the other hand, banks practicing lower spread rates are encouraged to be the first adopters of banking services and to first develop their own risk assessment system to cover their credit risk by building up provisions. Moreover, high spread rates do not encourage the bank to be the first <b>mover</b> in banking <b>services</b> but rather to imitate their adoption. High spread practice makes banks more willing to install a retailing apparatus and automated teller machines...|$|R
40|$|Of late, the Indian {{economy is}} booming {{by leaps and}} bounds, mainly powered by the service sector. In turn, Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Service (ITES) {{industries}} are the prime <b>movers</b> of the <b>service</b> sector. Although these two industries are somewhat related, they differ in significant ways. In addition, {{a large number of}} women are entering workforce, posing new challenges for organizations in managing diversity at the workplace. There is evidence that high job satisfaction leads to greater productivity. Research also shows that committed employees have less turnover intent. The present study examines the impact on industry background and gender on job satisfaction, organizational commitment and turnover intent. A total of 313 respondents were selected through convenience sampling from different IT and ITES organizations of National Capital Region (NCR), Delhi. The results showed that the IT group had lower job satisfaction and organizational commitment compared to the ITES group, while it displayed higher turnover intent. The male group showed significantly higher job satisfaction and significantly lower turnover intent compared to the female group. Further, job satisfaction increased organizational commitment. Finally, both job satisfaction and organizational com-mitment decreased turnover intent. The findings are discussed {{in the light of the}} expectations of employees and the future directions for research are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{services}} industry is undergoing tremendous transformation due to regulatory changes and technological developments. The thesis discusses these changes including {{the advent of}} internet {{and how it is}} impacting the financial {{services industry}}. The paper provides a detailed account of XML evolution and its comparison with SGML and HTML. Several organization bodies have been formed {{over the past few years}} to define and push XML based standards for various industries. Even though XML is still in its evolving stage, there is wide consensus that it will be the enabler for disparate systems to communicate with each other. The research provides an overview of various XML standards pertaining to financial services and firms behind these standards. The author derives the conclusion that several standards with in financial services will co-exist and the industry will converge to these standards. The thesis also provides an overview of some financial applications that are XML compliant along with examples of first <b>mover</b> financial <b>services</b> firms that have successfully applied XML to address systems issues. Based on the XML standards, changes in the industry and customer needs author predicts some future trends and milestones that will happen in the financial services industry. They include; General changes in industry Landscape, formation of Central Limit Order Book (CLOB), Emergence of HUBs and Exchanges, Global Straight Through Processing, Settlement time of T +O, Emergence of Aggregators and Enterprise Portals. The future trend section further discusses the role of XML in this changing environment and how it will help achieve some of the key break-throughs that were not possible before. In order to fully harness the potential of XML, firms need to understand the various elements of XML. The last section of the thesis provides an overview of internal factors; issues around understanding DTD's and other relevant factors firms need to consider for successful implementation. The factors are based on author's own understanding of XML, issues faced by financial services industry and interviews with financial services firms. by Noor Hasan. Thesis (S. M. M. O. T.)

40|$|Summary In the {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis Selected Economic Aspects of Social Care Services, I present a definition and {{an overview of the}} statutory regulation of social care services in the historical perspective and from the viewpoint of the valid law. The subsequent section, which is the core segment of {{the theoretical}} part of my thesis, sets forth a specification and a general outline of all social care services available in our jurisdiction. The chapter about the funding of social services identifies the available financial resources, and the range of options associated with the payment of social care services. The services and particularly the financing methods constitute a frequent topic for discussion among all main initiators (promoters, <b>movers)</b> of social <b>services.</b> In the practical part of the thesis, I present an identification of financial resources of one selected social service provider, and an analysis of its income from transfers, users payments for meals, from the accommodation and care allowances, and other revenue generated from 2005 to 2015. This part of the thesis also shows a comparison of the amount of individual transfers and payments from users, including per-user care allowance per year and month in the period from 2005 to 2015. The analysis is then used to identify the system for subsidy allocation, to draw conclusions on specific findings, and to present some recommendations. The last section of the practical part compares the selected social service provider with other organizations providing the same services in the year 2014...|$|R
40|$|The fleet {{consists}} of 6 LNG carriers where 3 have a loading capacity of 44 000 tons while the remaining 3 ships can lift 33 00 tons of LPG. Since the ships {{are set to}} operate at speeds between 14 and 20 knots {{it is necessary to}} upgrade the prime <b>movers</b> as the <b>service</b> speeds range from 14. 5 to 16. 7 knots. BW Clipper will prove to be far more effective in terms of fuel consumption compared to the other ships due to higher initial service speed and a relatively efficient engine. The fleet will operate within tramp shipping fulfilling 18 contracted orders and serving the spot market in between ordered shipments. The duration and the profitability of the orders influenced the net income. It is favorable to be committed to profitable contracted orders in recession while it is unfavorable to be bound to low rate contracted orders in prosperity. The ships were assigned to two to four contracted orders each. The fuel prices are changing rapidly and the magnitude of the variations can be vast. This impacts the shipping companies as the fuel costs are a large item of expenditure in the shipping industry. For the period between second half of 2006 and end 2007 I estimated the IFO 180 price to be 353 USD/ton, while it was 383 USD/ton in a defined prosperity level and 138 USD/ton in a defined recession level. The freight rates for the actual level, the prosperity level and the recession level were estimated to 36. 5 USD/ton, 63 USD/ton and 25. 7 USD respectively. The spot market potential was fully utilized at the prosperity level, 88 % in the actual level while only 57. 5 % was utilized in the recession level. </p...|$|R
