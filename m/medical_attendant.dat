25|$|In 1912 he {{was drafted}} into {{the army of the}} Tsar. During the First World War he served in Lutsk and then in Tomsk, where he was a <b>medical</b> <b>attendant</b> at the hospital.

25|$|While {{glowing in}} {{praise for the}} helicopter's {{advances}} over piston-engined helicopters, the Army reports from the service tests of the YH-40 {{found it to be}} underpowered with the production T53-L-1A powerplant producing a maximum continuous 770 shaft horsepower (570 kilowatts). The Army indicated the need for improved follow-on models even as the first UH-1As were being delivered. In response, Bell proposed the UH-1B, equipped with the Lycoming T53-L-5 engine producing 960shp (720kW) and a longer cabin that could accommodate either seven passengers or four stretchers and a <b>medical</b> <b>attendant.</b> Army testing of the UH-1B started in November 1960, with the first production aircraft delivered in March 1961.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} at Exeter House in London, the {{grandson}} of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and son of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 2nd Earl of Shaftesbury. His mother was Lady Dorothy Manners, daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland. According to a story told by the third earl, the marriage was negotiated by John Locke, who was a trusted friend of the first earl. The second Lord Shaftesbury has been traditionally, and possibly unfairly, regarded to have been both physically and mentally inadequate, although the letters sent by a youthful third earl to both his parents reveal a rather more complex picture, not least the emotional manipulation attempted by his mother in refusing to see her son unless he cut off all ties to his father. At {{the age of three}} the future Third Earl was made over to the formal guardianship of his grandfather. Locke, who in his capacity of <b>medical</b> <b>attendant</b> to the Ashley household, had already assisted at the child's birth, was now entrusted with the supervision of his education. This was conducted according to the principles enunciated in Locke's Thoughts concerning Education, and the method of teaching Latin and Greek conversationally was pursued with such success by his instructress, Elizabeth Birch, that at the age of eleven, it is said, Ashley could read both languages with ease. Birch had moved to Clapham and Ashley spent some years there with her.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Sina {{subsequently}} {{settled at}} Rey, {{in the vicinity}} of modern Tehran, the home town of Rhazes; where Majd Addaula, a son of the last Buwayhid emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (Seyyedeh Khatun). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shams al-Daula, however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as <b>medical</b> <b>attendant,</b> and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the Canon and the Sanatio, were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.|$|E
