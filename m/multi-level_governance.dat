40|$|<b>Multi-level</b> {{environmental}} <b>governance</b> {{has become}} a commonplace, yet few {{attempts have been made}} to explain in economic terms why it should have emerged. This article examines four economic explanations for <b>multi-level</b> environmental <b>governance.</b> The first explanation considers <b>multi-level</b> environmental <b>governance</b> as a solution for overcoming collective action challenges when a large number of actors are involved. The second explanation has it that multiple levels of environmental governance may be needed to minimise governance costs. Third, path dependency and economies of scope could explain multilevel environmental governance. Fourthly, ecosystem service flows generated by complex and multifunctional resource systems may have benefit catchments of different size, and multilevel governance solutions may be needed to link providers and beneficiaries. While they are to a degree complementary, the analysis suggests that the multi-functionality explanation is the most nuanced one of them and offers the best diagnostic for governance challenges that an environmental resource system poses...|$|R

The accelerated diffusion of low-carbon technology innovation can possibly be achieved by interactive processes such as: (1) mutually reinforcing cycles of policy-induced domestic market growth, innovation, and policy feedback; (2) lead markets and political lesson-drawing, the reinforced international adoption of innovations from pioneer countries; and (3) interaction between the vertical and horizontal dynamics in <b>multi-level</b> systems of <b>governance.</b> The three mechanisms are not exclusive.

5000|$|The {{theory of}} <b>multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> {{belongs to the}} second phase. <b>Multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> characterizes the {{changing}} relationships between actors situated at different territorial levels, both from {{the public and the}} private sectors. The <b>multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> theory crosses the traditionally separate domains of domestic and international politics and highlights the increasingly fading distinction between these domains in the context of European integration. <b>Multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> was first developed from a study of EU policy and then applied to EU decision-making more generally. An early explanation referred to <b>multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> as a system of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several territorial tiers [...] and described how supranational, national, regional, and local governments are enmeshed in territorially overarching policy networks. [...] The theory emphasized both the increasingly frequent and complex interactions between governmental actors and the increasingly important dimension of non-state actors that are mobilized in cohesion policy-making and in the EU policy more generally. As such, <b>multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> raised new and important questions about the role, power and authority of states.|$|E
40|$|Brazil is {{an example}} of a {{challenging}} governance context par excellence: continental size, <b>multi-levelled</b> <b>governance</b> structures and diverse administrative cultures meet with ambitious, large-scale policy needs and objectives. The multilevel governance approach is applied here to analyse implementation and governance coordination of the Bolsa Verde Programme (BVP). Through a close reading of the narratives told by three programme officials – and zooming in on jointly exercised governance functions known from the metagovernance approach – we analysed how BVP’s programmatic governance coordination was made sense of. The analysis showed that our interviewees were well aware of the shortcomings of the governance coordination in BVP, understood as rather hierarchical, centrally driven and often tackling challenges of vertical multi-actor coordination in a reactive ad-hoc manner. However, since the implementers have been able to creatively and skilfully solve governance coordination challenges, possibilities for developing more systematic and inclusive (meta) governance approaches seem feasible...|$|R
40|$|The post-conflict case of Bosnia-Herzegovina {{provides}} a challenging {{case for the}} approaches employed by the European Union to bolster state and non-state actor capacities related to environmental governance in post-socialist states. This article examines four major consultative environmental impact assessment processes in Bosnia-Herzegovina {{in order to identify}} factors that either enable or impede the development of <b>multi-level</b> environmental <b>governance</b> at the state and sub-state entity levels. Larger environmental non-governmental organisations provide scientific opinions and smaller organisations lack capacity to participate at all. The complex configuration of state institutions, compounded by inadequate staffing and funding, creates impediments for effective governmental hierarchy during environmental impact assessments. However, international financial institutions and technical consultants involved in environmental impact assessments have taken a pivotal tutelage role to familiarise local stakeholders with best practice, which has led to some improvements in <b>multi-level</b> environmental <b>governance</b> during environmental impact assessments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, though the impact is dependent on staff retention in Bosnian public bodies...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} role of {{changing}} arrangements of <b>multi-level</b> territorial <b>governance</b> in the European Cohesion Policy.

The article seeks to understand the implications of such a duality using case study analysis, with the theoretical aim of exploring in-depth the connections between the European and the local scale. It analyses in the long term (1994 - 2013) the use of Structural Funds for urban development in a specific context, the city of Palermo in the Objective 1 region of Sicily, under-explored by international literature. The phases of Structural Funds are understood in the wider context of Palermo, Sicily and Southern Italy, emphasising the temporal coherence between (i) the phases of autonomous/dependent development, (ii) evolution/involution in the implementation of cohesion policies, and (iii) shifting <b>multi-level</b> territorial <b>governance</b> arrangements. The local case confirms the duality hypothesised and, based on this, wider considerations for the future of Cohesion Policy are set out...|$|R

40|$|Scholars {{have tended}} to treat the European Union (EU) as an {{environmental}} ‘leader’. Yet significant potential nonetheless exists for it to learn lessons {{in areas such as}} water policy where it has a long and successful history of involvement. The EU's Water Framework Directive (2000) imposes potentially far reaching requirements on its Member States to enhance public participation in the process of catchment management. However, to date, its implementation has been highly variable across and even within individual states. As the EU starts to revise the original Directive, thoughts will turn to how the current situation could be improved. One potentially productive avenue, which has not yet been fully explored, is to draw lessons on public participation from comparable <b>multi-levelled</b> <b>governance</b> contexts such as in the USA and Australia, where public engagement has arguably been more advanced. Drawing on theoretical accounts of the most likely facilitators and obstacles to lesson drawing, this paper assesses the scope for transfer. It finds that while the EU could potentially learn from these jurisdictions, there are likely to be significant obstacles in practice. These should be born in mind by would-be policy learners...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, the Ninginganiq National Wildlife Area (NNWA) was {{formally}} established at Isabella Bay, Baffin Island, Nunavut. This designation suggests the site’s importance for wildlife conservation, {{and as a}} potential component of an emerging network of Canadian marine protected areas. However, upon closer inspection, this wildlife area also represents a complex and lengthy initiative to conserve wildlife habitats, and to support local livelihoods and culture in the region. This long-term process, referred to here as the Igalirtuuq Conservation Initiative (ICI), {{dates back to the}} early 1980 s when it began as a community driven initiative. Over the subsequent decades the initiative moved through several phases as it was shaped by surrounding socio-political events. The process remains ongoing today. This thesis takes an historical approach to understanding the formation of collaborative and <b>multi-level</b> environmental <b>governance</b> (CMEG). In order to do so, temporal and organizational, and thematic analyses are used to construct a detailed case study of the ICI. In addition to this, a framework of conditions for successful <b>multi-level</b> environmental <b>governance</b> is tested and refined based on the case study. This exploratory research finds that the many important conditions necessary for CMEG formation can be identified in governance theory, as well as by looking at social-political contexts specific to the case study...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multi-level</b> {{regulatory}} <b>governance</b> {{is becoming}} a priority in many OECD countries. High quality regulation at {{a certain level of}} government can be compromised by poor regulatory policies and practices at other levels, impacting negatively on the performance of economies and on business and citizens’ activities. The most common problems that affect the relationship between the public and the private sectors are duplication, overlapping responsibility and low quality. These affect public service delivery, citizen’s perception, business services and activities, as well as investment and trade.

But to what extent is a similar impact occurring in the so-called ‘potential candidate countries’ of the EU in the Western Balkans? From the perspective of environmental NGOs and their engagement in Environmental Impact Assessment processes in Bosnia–Herzegovina, it appears that the impact of donor-driven capacity building is exaggerated by assessments based on quantitative data.

50|$|However, the {{consequences}} of multilevel governance are debated. In the eyes of its detractors, multilevel governance exacerbates corruption (Treisman 2000), leads to gridlock (Scharpf 2007), engenders moral hazard (Rodden 2006), constrains redistribution (Obinger, Castles, Leibfried 2005), obfuscates accountability (Peters & Pierre 2004), and wastes money (Berry 2009).

50|$|Another {{criticism}} on {{the theory}} of <b>multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> is that it's not really a proper theory, rather {{that it is an}} approach. The main difference between <b>multi-level</b> <b>governance</b> and other theories of integration is that it gets rid of the continuum or grey area between intergovernmentalism and supranationalism and leaves in its place a descriptive structure. This theory does not address the sovereignty of states directly, but instead simply says that a multi-level structure is being created by subnational and supranational actors. One of the main questions of integration theory, namely, the transfer of loyalty and sovereignty between national and supranational entities and the future of this relationship in the EU is not specifically addressed in this theory.|$|E

30|$|Overcoming {{structural}} {{barriers and}} managing transition challenges does not only require radical changes in government policy {{but also in}} the current systems of governance (the orientation of society and patterns of interaction over collective issues) [47]. Within a <b>multi-level,</b> polycentric <b>governance</b> system, cooperation rather than competition should guide the future approaches to dealing with resource-efficiency in Europe [48]. The deepening and broadening of stakeholder engagement processes in all levels of governance based on a new “social contract” [10] would help to recognize the joint responsibility of states, business, science, civil society and even individuals for tackling sustainability challenges. Participatory processes lead to increased trust and new forms of interaction between the different societal actors, who bring together creativity, resources, capacity, legitimacy and political will to achieve common goals [48]. This fosters societally relevant innovation and supports effective decision-making at all levels. It also empowers citizens and non-governmental organizations to create a strong bottom-up process that may drive the transition to a more sustainable and resource-efficient Europe.|$|R
