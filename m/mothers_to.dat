5|$|Actor {{and activist}} Ruby Dee and Juanita Poitier (wife of Sidney Poitier) {{established}} the Committee of Concerned <b>Mothers,</b> <b>to</b> raise funds {{to buy a}} house, and pay educational expenses for the Shabazz family. The Committee {{held a series of}} benefit concerts at which they raised $17,000. They bought a large two-family home in Mount Vernon, New York, from Congressmember Bella Abzug.|$|E
5|$|The tear streaks are a {{means of}} visual communication. The tear streaks {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscure from a distance, {{and so are the}} expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> direct juveniles to follow them.|$|E

50|$|Moseley {{had three}} sons. He married Alice Dodds in 1902 and married Florence DuBois in July 1930. Alice was <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> George & Francis, Florence was <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> James.|$|R
5000|$|Perdita (voiced by Pam Dawber): The {{mother of}} the Dalmatians, and the wife/mate of Pongo. She is <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> the fifteen puppies, and adoptive <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> eighty-four {{orphaned}} pups. She is Anita's beloved pet.|$|R
5|$|After her {{delivery}} to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used to}} transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star <b>Mothers</b> <b>to</b> France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E
5000|$|Wendla {{asks her}} <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> {{tell her about}} [...] "the stork," [...] causing her <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> become {{suddenly}} evasive. Anxious, she tells Wendla that women have children when they are married and in love.|$|R
50|$|Kennedy married {{high school}} friend Glen Woodward in 2003, {{in a private}} {{ceremony}} on Magnetic Island, Queensland. She is step <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> Woodward's oldest son Hayden (b. 1995), and <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> sons Sam (b. 2004) and Will (b. 2008).|$|R
5000|$|She {{is perhaps}} best known for her {{recurring}} role as Jackie Taylor, <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> Kelly Taylor on the original Beverly Hills, 90210. She reprised the role during the first season of 90210 as <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> both Kelly and Erin Silver.|$|R
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Bono Juancito Pinto program {{provided}} US$29 {{per month}} to poor families for every young child that they had, while 2008's Renta Dignidad initiative provided around $344 per month to low-income citizens over 60. 2009's Bono Juana Azurduy program offered cash transfers to uninsured <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> improve their likelihood of seeking medical care. Conservative critics of Morales' regime claimed that these measures were simply designed to buy off {{the poor and}} ensure continued support for the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{right whale}} spends the summer months in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. It migrates north in winter for breeding, and can be seen around the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay. Since hunting of the {{southern right whale}} ceased, stocks are estimated to have grown by 7% a year. The South American, South African and Australasian groups apparently intermix very little, if at all, because of the strong fidelity of <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> their feeding and calving grounds. The mother passes these instincts to her calves.|$|E

5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old <b>mothers</b> <b>to</b> 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{contrast}} between the Younger Lady {{and a number of}} influential queen mothers from the later reigns of the 18th dynasty, who had a large presence in the reigns of their sons. Tiaa served as queen <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> Thutmose IV, Mutemwiya as queen <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> Amenhotep III, and Tiye as queen <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> Akhenaten. It seems likely that Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten never had a queen mother, indicating that the Younger Lady (or any other mother) had died before his rise to the throne.|$|R
