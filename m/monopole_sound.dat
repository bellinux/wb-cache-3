5000|$|Hughes joined Altec Lansing in May 2002 {{to serve}} as senior {{engineering}} manager in the professional audio division. This included both component-level and overall product engineering for the installation market {{as well as for}} touring systems. While at Altec, Hughes was granted two patents. The first was a patent for the optimum spacing of driver elements in a line array, using a minimum of drivers. This technology, marketed as [...] "InConcert", was at the core of Altec's compact computer speaker system FX 6021, a satellite and subwoofer system which used the patented process for its two satellite speakers, each containing six drivers mounted vertically. The two center drivers covered the frequency range from 150 hertz up to 20 kHz, the next two drivers above and below covered up to 6 kHz, and the top and bottom drivers covered up to 1 kHz. This allowed for good sounding results with six drivers mounted on a columnar surface that could physically accommodate eight or nine. Hughes' third patent, his second with Altec, was a patent for a dipole and <b>monopole</b> surround <b>sound</b> speaker system which used indirectly aimed drivers added {{to the top of the}} usual front left and front right loudspeakers. Altec brought the technology to market as the GT 5051R—a 3.1 system which included a center speaker and a subwoofer. The front left and right speakers bounced surround information off of the walls and ceiling for customers who did not want to clutter their listening space with a pair of rear speakers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the generation of}} a particular noise, referred to as crackle, first observed by Ffowcs Williams et al. in a full-scale jet engine. Schlieren pictures along with far-field acoustic data obtained for high-temperature axisymmetric supersonic jets were {{used to examine the}} crackle characteristics. Experimental data from a full-scale engine were also used to validate the features obtained from small-scale laboratory experiments. The experimental data cover a velocity range from 600 m/s to 1. 05 km/s. A schlieren picture of the radiation field of an M = 2 high temperature jet (U(j) = 1. 05 km/s), depicts shock-wavelike structures emanating from the jet and propagating in the downstream direction at shallow angles to the jet axis. The frequency of occurrence of these intense waves increases with jet exit velocity/temperature. It is suggested that microexplosions of the cold entrained ambient fluid in the hot jet generate these intense waves, which are believed to be associated with crackle. When an entrained cold lump of fluid is exposed suddenly to the hot jet fiuid, it expands, giving rise to a <b>monopole</b> source of <b>sound.</b> The convection of the monopoles at supersonic speed leads to the observed directionality of the wave front/crackle sound.

40|$|Abstract Combustion {{experiments}} are often performed on freely propagating flames. However, these flames {{suffer from the}} influence of entrainment of cold ambient gas. This influences not only the equivalence ratio but also the adiabatic flame temperature or leads to quenching effects downstream of the nozzle exit. Thus, a transfer of the results from such studies {{to the case of}} technically more relevant confined flames is difficult. To avoid entrainment effects without losing easy optical access and free field acoustics, a new burner setup was evaluated and tested. A hot exhaust gas stream is generated by a porous burner, which encloses the investigated swirl flame and avoids influences from the walls of a combustion chamber. A further advantage in combustion noise studies is that the flame can be considered as a <b>monopole</b> source emitting <b>sound</b> into the environment with no acoustical influence of constraining walls. Durability tests of the burner showed that an operation of the burner over several hours is possible, but a continuous monitoring is recommended. For the purpose of the proper porous burner design the flow field of the swirl burner was measured with a high-speed PIV system. The shielding of the hot co-flow from the porous burner on the velocity fields and the chemiluminescence distributions were investigated. It was found that the velocity field is almost identical for the flame with and without hot enclosure. However, the CH * chemiluminescence (CL) measurements and the planar OH-LIF distributions are substantially influenced by the entrainment of cold ambient gas. The equivalence ratio drops downstream since fresh air is mixed with the fuel-air mixture from the TD 1 burner. Thus, the flame temperature decreases and so does the intensity of the chemiluminescence signals. With the presented setup a simple option for experimental investigations {{of the effects of the}} entrained cold medium on the burning behavior of unconfined flame is provided...|$|R
40|$|With strict {{environmental}} regulations, {{gas turbine}} emissions have been heavily constrained. This requires operating conditions wherein thermo-acoustic flame instabilities are prevalent. During this process the combustor acoustics and combustion heat release fluctuations are coupled {{and can cause}} severe structural damage to engine components, reduced operability, and inefficiency that eventually increase emissions. In order to develop an engine without these problems, {{there needs to be}} a better understanding of the physics behind the coupling mechanisms of this instability. Among the several coupling mechanisms, the “velocity coupling” process is the main focus of this thesis. The majority of literature has treated axisymmetric disturbance fields which are typical of longitudinal acoustic forcing and axisymmetric excitation of ring vortices. Two important non-axisymmetric disturbances are: (1) transverse acoustics, in the case of circumferential modes of a multi-nozzle annular combustor and (2) helical flow disturbances, seen in the case of swirling flow hydrodynamic instabilities. With significantly less analytical treatment of this non-axisymmetric problem, a general framework is developed for three-dimensional swirl-stabilized flame response to non-axisymmetric disturbances. The dynamics are tracked using a level-set based G-equation applicable to infinitely thin flame sheets. For specific assumptions in a linear framework, general solution characteristics are obtained. The results are presented separately for axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric mean flames. The unsteady heat release process leads to an unsteady volume generation at the flame front due to the expansion of gases. This unsteady volume generation leads to sound generation by the flame as a distributed <b>monopole</b> source. A <b>sound</b> generation model is developed where ambient pressure fluctuations are generated by this distributed fluctuating heat release source on the flame surface. The flame response framework is used to provide this local heat release source input. This study has been specifically performed for the helical flow disturbance cases to illustrate the effects different modes have on the generated sound. Results show that the effects on global heat release and sound generation are significantly different. 	Finally, the prediction from the analytical models is compared with experimental data. First, a two-dimensional bluff-body stabilized flame experiment is used to obtain measurements of both the flow and flame position in time. This enables a local flame response comparison since the data are spatially resolved along the flame. Next, a three-dimensional swirl-stabilized lifted flame experiment is considered. The measured flow data is used as input to the G-equation model and the global flame response is predicted. This is then compared with the corresponding value obtained using global CH* chemilumenescence measurements. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|Two {{complementary}} {{methods have}} been developed that are capable to determine the reflection coefficient of acoustic absorbing materials in situ. The methods are compared with a measurement in the Kundt's tube. The first method {{is based on the}} measurement of the surface impedance [1], [2], [3]. Here a prototype device based on this method is presented that for calibration and impedance determination uses of a well defined sound source [9]. The surface impedance method proves to work best for materials with a not too high reflection coefficient [1]. A second (novel) method is developed for materials with a high reflection coefficient. It uses of a <b>monopole</b> <b>sound</b> source that is placed close by the acoustic reflecting material. A Microflown [8] is placed close to the monopole source in such way that its sensitive direction is aiming at the acoustic reflecting material and its non sensitive direction is aiming at the source. This way it is only measuring the 'mirror source': the reflected image of the <b>monopole</b> <b>sound</b> source. It is therefore called 'the mirror source method'. From the transfer function between the reference velocity sensor inside the monopole source and the Microflown outside the source, the reflection coefficient can be determined. First results of this method are presented. The results of both methods are compared to a Kundt's tube measurement. Traditionally this method works with two pressure transducers but it is also possible to use a combinational pressure and velocity transducer (the PU probe). This PU method is already reported in [1], [5], [6], [7]. The calibration should be very accurate to be able to measure highly reflective materials in a reliable way [5], [9]. In this paper an improved calibration procedure for this method is presented. © (2006) by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Noise {{constraints}} {{is one of}} {{the limiting}} factors for helicopter operation. It is therefore necessary to minimise the perceived noise on the ground. This can be achieved by modification of the flight path of the helicopter {{in such a way that}} noise intense flight conditions are avoided and noise is redistributed to less noise sensitive areas. The presence of wind has influence on the flight conditions of the helicopter and also on the propagation of sound from the helicopter, through the atmosphere, to the ground. To take into account the effects of wind, wind gradients and temperature gradients the computational method at DLR is extended with a ray tracing algorithm. The effects of wind are illustrated for a <b>monopole</b> <b>sound</b> source and for a complete helicopter approach with the EC 135. The shape and level of the sound exposure level contours right below the flight path are mostly affected by changes in flight conditions,. i. e. changes in acoustic source.

40|$|The {{amount of}} air traffic is {{increasing}} and cities {{become more and}} more populated. Since airports tend to be located close to or inside cities, an increasing amount of people suffer from aircraft noise pollution. More silent aircraft are needed to be able to reduce this noise pollution. One {{way to do this is}} through blocking the engine noise propagation with elements of the aircraft itself such as the wings. This method is called aircraft engine noise shielding To be able to shield the aircraft engine noise efficiently, a noise shielding assessment tool is required. In this thesis project, such a tool is developed for conventional tube with wing aircraft. This tool needs to have low computational cost while the accuracy should be sufficient for the preliminary design. To create a fast and accurate noise prediction tool, the aircraft's fuselage is modelled as a cylinder and the wings as planar surfaces. The engine is represented by a <b>monopole</b> <b>sound</b> source. The most suitable noise shielding calculation methods are found to be the barrier shielding method for the wings and the analytic solution of a cylinder for the fuselage. The noise shielding assessment tool is validated against results obtained with the Kirchhoff theory of diffraction. The noise shielding prediction tool developed in this thesis project has shown to be able to determine the noise attenuation by a point source of different aircraft configurations with low computational cost. The addition of the analytic results of the cylinder to the barrier shielding method has increased the accuracy by including the creeping rays.
