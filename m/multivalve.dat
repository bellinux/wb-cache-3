25|$|Power: Because each {{cylinder}} on a {{radial engine}} {{has its own}} head, it is impractical to use a <b>multivalve</b> valvetrain on a radial engine. Therefore, almost all radial engines use a two valve pushrod-type valvetrain which may result in less power for a given displacement than multi-valve inline engines. The limitations of the poppet valve were largely overcome {{by the development of}} the sleeve valve, but at the cost of increased complexity, maintenance costs and reduced reliability.|$|E
5000|$|The terms [...] "multivalve" [...] and [...] "DOHC" [...] are {{separate}} distinctions; not all <b>multivalve</b> engines are DOHC {{and not all}} DOHC engines are <b>multivalve.</b> Examples of DOHC engines with two valves per cylinder include the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine and the Jaguar XK6 engine. Most recent DOHC engines are <b>multivalve,</b> with between three and five valves per cylinder.|$|E
50|$|From 1987 {{there have}} also been Ducati <b>multivalve</b> motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|Increased Valvetrain Friction and Wear: Because OHV engines {{generally}} {{use only}} a single intake and exhaust valve, the valves are larger and heavier than those used in <b>multivalve</b> OHC engines. Furthermore, when the valve is closed, the spring must accelerate not only the valve and rocker arm, but also the pushrod and lifter. Therefore, OHV engines must use heavier valve springs than OHC engines (<b>multivalve</b> or otherwise). As a result, valvetrain friction and wear is increased. This is especially true with high performance OHV engines utilizing high lift/duration/ramp rate cams with heavier than stock valve springs.|$|E
50|$|All EWs are DOHC <b>multivalve</b> with {{displacement}} from 1749 to 2231 cc. They {{are mainly}} used for {{large family cars}} and executive cars, as well as large MPVs, although the 2.0 L is also used for some hot hatch models.|$|E
50|$|The <b>multivalve</b> Sprint {{version of}} the Triumph Slant-4 engine used a system where the {{camshaft}} was placed directly over the inlet valves, with the same cams that opened the intake valves directly also opening the exhaust valves through rocker arms.|$|E
50|$|In {{automotive}} engineering a multi-valve or <b>multivalve</b> {{engine is}} one where each cylinder has more than two valves. A multi-valve engine has better breathing and {{may be able to}} operate at higher revolutions per minute (RPM) than a two-valve engine, delivering more power.|$|E
50|$|The dohc Genesis engine {{has five}} valves per {{cylinder}} and downdraft carburetors. Yamaha adopted the 5-valve concept, using three intake valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, because it allowed both excellent volumetric efficiency and high rpm. As designers began {{to appreciate the}} benefits of multi-valve layout, 4-valves-per-cylinder (and even 3-valves) became common. In a <b>multivalve</b> engine, maximum rpm {{is limited by the}} size of the largest valves: in a 3-valver, the exhaust valve is larger, and in a 4-valver, the inlet valves are larger. The significance of the five-valve engine compared to other <b>multivalve</b> configurations engines is that (like a 3-valver) there were more intake valves than exhaust ones; yet all valves were small and of very similar sizes and weights. There are diminishing returns: the benefits of increasing numbers of valves actually decrease after five-valves-per-cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The Honda B20A engine series, {{known as}} the B20A and B21A was an inline four-cylinder engine family from Honda {{introduced}} in 1985 in the second-generation Honda Prelude. Also available in the contemporary third-generation Honda Accord in the Japanese domestic market, along with the Accord-derived Vigor, the B20A was Honda's first line of <b>multivalve</b> DOHC inline four-cylinder engines, focused towards performance and displacing 2.0 to 2.1 litres.|$|E
5000|$|The Monster {{line has}} had {{numerous}} variations over the years, from entry level [...] bikes up to {{top of the}} line [...] <b>multivalve,</b> water-cooled superbike-engined versions, with as many as nine different Monster versions in a single model year. The Monster's elemental simplicity has also made it a favorite platform for custom motorcycle builders, showcased at competitions like the Monster Challenge. Monsters eventually accounted for two-thirds or more of Ducati's output.|$|E

50|$|Although the GS500E twin was {{developed}} from an existing design, for the 1988 GS500EJ model Suzuki {{came up with}} a brand new frame, running gear and bodywork aimed at urban riders, novice motorcyclists and those on a budget. Additionally, the GS500EJ debuted with carburetors from the Mikuni ‘Slingshot’ series, a design which was simultaneously being used on the Suzuki GSX-R750 racer-replica. Although it did not produce as much horsepower as comparable <b>multivalve</b> engines, the two-valve GS500 engine had proportionally more torque at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|Although most {{multi-valve}} engines have overhead camshafts, either SOHC or DOHC, a <b>multivalve</b> engine {{may be a}} pushrod {{overhead valve}} engine (OHV) design. Chevrolet has revealed a three-valve version of its Generation IV V8 which uses pushrods to actuate forked rockers, and Cummins makes a four-valve OHV straight six diesel, the Cummins B Series (now known as ISB). Ford also uses pushrods in its 6.7L Power Stroke engine using four pushrods, four rockers and four valves per cylinder. The Harley-Davidson Milwaukee Eight engine, introduced in 2016, uses four-valves per cylinder driven by pushrods and a single in-block camshaft.|$|E
5000|$|SOHC designs offer reduced {{complexity}} {{compared with}} overhead valve designs — when used for <b>multivalve</b> cylinder heads, {{in which each}} cylinder has more than two valves. An example of an SOHC design using shim and bucket valve adjustment was the engine installed in the Hillman Imp (four cylinder, eight valve); a small, early 1960s two-door saloon car (sedan) with a rear mounted aluminium-alloy engine based on the Coventry Climax FWMA race engines. Exhaust and inlet manifolds were both {{on the same side}} of the engine block (thus not a crossflow cylinder head design). This did, however, offer excellent access to the spark plugs.|$|E
5000|$|Originally envisioned as a Ferrari {{competitor}} {{equipped with}} a special [...] version of the S70 engine, essentially a bored out version of the M70 with experimental <b>multivalve</b> cylinder heads. A common misconception is that this engine powered the McLaren F1. When this was suggested to McLaren's designer Gordon Murray, however, the idea was rejected because the engine was too heavy and long for the McLaren F1. Rather, variations on the original S70 used on the 850csi, the S70/2 and S70/3 {{were used for the}} McLaren F1. (The variation used on the M8 prototype was the S70/1 engine.) ...|$|E
5000|$|This [...] {{engine was}} {{a version of}} the 3.3 but with a larger bore of 96 mm and the {{important}} addition of overhead cams. The 3.5L version has an intake arrangement with two separate manifolds and throttle bodies connected with a crossover valve. This provides better low and midrange torque. The four valves per cylinder are driven by a single overhead camshaft as opposed to the conventional DOHC arrangement for <b>multivalve</b> engines. Another difference with the 3.5 as opposed to the 3.3 is that it has a timing belt, not a timing chain. The water pump is also driven by the timing belt on the 3.5, whereas on the 3.3, the accessory belt drives it.|$|E
50|$|The Toyota Motor Corporation G-family {{engine is}} a family of straight-6 piston engines {{produced}} from 1979 to 2006. It is notable in that only a single displacement, 1988 cc L, was produced in this series. All were belt-driven OHC non-interference engines (except the VVT-i version in the IS200 which is an interference engine), with <b>multivalve</b> DOHC (except the 1G-EU SOHC 12 valve engine) and even variable valve timing added later. The 1G-GEU was Toyota's first four-valve twincam engine. A prototype version of the 1G-GEU called the LASREα - X, featuring twin turbos, variable valve timing and intake as well as variable displacement, was fitted to the Toyota FX-1 show car at the 1983 Tokyo Motor Show. It showcased a number of technologies which were later to become commonplace.|$|E
50|$|A dual {{overhead}} camshaft (DOHC) valvetrain layout is characterised by two camshafts {{located within the}} cylinder head, one operating the intake valves {{and the other one}} operating the exhaust valves. This design reduces valvetrain inertia more than is the case with a SOHC engine, since the rocker arms are reduced in size or eliminated. A DOHC design permits a wider angle between intake and exhaust valves than do SOHC engines. This can allow for a less restricted airflow at higher engine speeds. DOHC with a <b>multivalve</b> design also allows for the optimum placement of the spark plug which, in turn, improves combustion efficiency. Engines having more than one bank of cylinders (e.g. V6, V8 — where two cylinder banks meet to form a 'V') with two camshafts in total remain SOHC, unless each cylinder bank has two camshafts; these latter are DOHC, and are often known as 'quad cam'.|$|E
50|$|The B-series are {{a family}} of inline four-cylinder DOHC/SOHC {{automotive}} engines introduced by Honda in 1989. Sold concurrently with the D-series which were primarily SOHC engines designed for more economical applications, the B-series were aimed more as a performance option featuring dual and single-overhead cams along with the first application of Honda's VTEC system (available in some models). To identify a Honda B-series engine, the letter B is normally followed by two numbers to designate the displacement of the engine, another letter, and in US-spec engines, another number. The Japanese spec-engines are normally designated with a four character alphanumeric designation. The B-series, the B20B variant in particular, {{is not to be}} confused with the earlier Honda B20A engine introduced in 1985 and primarily available in the Prelude and Accord-derived vehicles from 1985-1991. While sharing some design elements and both being <b>multivalve</b> Honda four-cylinders, the B-series and B20A differ substantially in architecture, enough to be considered distinct engine families.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the change}} to Daihatsu engines, a new De Tomaso version with a turbocharged, [...] version of the 993 cc three-cylinder engine was {{presented}} in December 1983. Italian sales began the next month. This was the two-valve version; the considerably more powerful <b>multivalve</b> version used in the Charade GTti was never used in the Innocenti. The bodywork was also revised, with the headlights now sloping backwards and with new bumpers, skirts, and bumper extensions to fit the 160/65 SR315 (TRX) alloys. The sporty steering wheel received a leather rim. The original version was equipped with an Italian development of the naturally aspirated CB22 engine (called CB-DT, for [...] "De Tomaso"), with an IHI RHB5 turbocharger and the same 9.1:1 compression ratio as for the CB22. Max power was reached at 6200 rpm for the original version. In road tests the Innocenti came in for complaints for its awkward driving position, mediocre comfort, and instability under braking. Plus points were steering, light weight, and appearance. The CB-DT engine was also noted for its lack of [...] "brio".|$|E
5000|$|Ford's {{strategy}} was to introduce two high-performance versions to steal some of the lucrative hot hatch market, using the well known XR3i and RS2000 badges. The XR3i was to be powered by tweaked versions of the new Zetec 1.8-litre engine from the standard Escort range, but the 2.0 Zetec unit being developed for the new Mondeo was a still a year away. Rather than wait for the new engine to become available, Ford took the unusual decision to take the longitudinally mounted I4, install a highly efficient <b>multivalve</b> cylinder head and tubular exhaust manifold, and mount it transversely in an FWD application. Designated N7A, critics remarked on its similarity in both specification and appearance to the Astra GTE's legendary C20XE [...] "Redtop" [...] unit which itself was {{widely regarded as the}} top hot hatch engine of the time. Given the success performance versions of the Astra enjoyed with the C20XE engine, it is perhaps only natural that Ford benchmarked it when developing the 16V I4. The RS2000's engine was well regarded, and is still seen as lively and characterful today.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{objective}} was to develop and validate a simple risk score to predict postoperative permanent pacing (PPM) after valve surgery. BackgroundOur ability to identify patients preoperatively that will require PPM is poor. A simple preoperative risk score to predict PPM after valve surgery could assist both clinical practice and research. MethodsAll valve surgery patients at our institution from 1992 to 2002 were included (n = 4, 694). Two-thirds of the patients were randomly selected to form a risk score prediction group (PG), and the score was then applied to the remaining patients (validation group [VG]). ResultsPreoperative right bundle branch block (odds ratio [OR], 3. 6; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 3 to 5. 7) and <b>multivalve</b> surgery that included the tricuspid valve (OR, 3. 7; 95 % CI, 2. 3 to 6. 1) were the strongest independent predictors of PPM, while <b>multivalve</b> surgery that {{did not include the}} tricuspid valve (OR, 2. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 3 to 3. 3), preoperative left bundle branch block (OR, 2. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 3 to 2. 9), preoperative PR interval > 200 ms (OR, 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 3 to 3. 0), prior valve surgery (OR, 1. 8, 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 2. 7), and age > 70 years (OR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 04 to 2. 0) also predicted PPM. A risk score from 0 to 6 identified patients in the VG with incidences of PPM of 1. 9 %, 5. 2 %, 8. 7 %, 11. 5 %, 21 %, 36 %, and 50 %, respectively. ConclusionsA simple risk score incorporating preoperative conduction, age, prior valve surgery, and surgery type predicts PPM after valve surgery.

The global investigation illustrates the noticeable effect of the valve lift on the engine head breathability. Furthermore, the experimental analysis demonstrates that the throttling process has a significant influence on the volumetric efficiency of the intake system and this effect increases with the valve lift. Finally, alternative strategies are studied in order to improve the engine fluid dynamic efficiency at partial loads.
