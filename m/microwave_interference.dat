5000|$|Twelve {{systems were}} built between 1958 and 1962. The {{prototype}} at Eufaula, Alabama, was perched atop a steel lattice structure tower of shorter (but unconfirmed) height. Depending {{on the location}} {{it was to be}} deployed in operational production, the radar antenna (sail) itself was perched atop one of two different towers: a cast-in-place concrete tower or a metal-sided steel-framed tower both with equal dimensions of 84'6" [...] in height and side dimensions of 60'3" [...] square (63'3" [...] square when including the thickness of corner buttresses). This tower design was also used for the AN/FPS-35 frequency diverse SAGE search radar built by Sperry Corporation. The FPS-24 radar antenna sail rotated 5 revolutions per minute (a SAGE specification, but varied slightly depending on wind conditions) and was often the cause of <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> reported by nearby residents who could hear the radar signal in television and radio broadcasts. At some locations, the radar signal was [...] "blanked" [...] as it passed over television broadcast antenna sites such as Mt. Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California. However, at DEFCON 3 or higher, the signal was ordered [...] "unblanked" [...] in all directions. The 7.5 Megawatt (maximum power) transmitter ran in normal operation at 5 Megawatt output pulse (nearly 20 microseconds in duration) and was conveyed from the transmitter to the antenna feed horn via a 9-inch diameter rigid coaxial connector. The feed horn consisted of a cross dipole antenna design for both A and B channels.|$|E
40|$|Microwave or {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) can couple into electronic circuits and systems intentionally from high power microwave (HPM) sources or unintentionally {{due to the}} proximity to general electromagnetic (EM) environments, and cause "soft" reversible upsets and "hard" irreversible failures. As scaling-down of device feature size and bias voltage progresses, the circuits and systems become more susceptible to the interference. Thus, even low power interference can disrupt {{the operation of the}} circuits and systems. Furthermore, it is reported that even electronic systems under high level of shielding can be upset by intentional {{electromagnetic interference}} (IEMI), which has been drawing a great deal of concern from both the civil and military communities, but little has been done in terms of systematic study and investigation of these effects on IC circuits and devices. We have investigated the effects of high power <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> on three levels, (a) on fundamental single MOSFET devices, (b) on basic CMOS IC inverters and cascaded inverters, and (c) on a representative large IC timer circuit for automotive applications. We have studied and identified the most vulnerable static and dynamic parameters of operation related to device upsets. Fundamental upset mechanisms in MOSFETs and CMOS inverters and their relation to the characteristics of <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> (power, frequency, width, and period) and the device properties such as size, mobility, dopant concentration, and contact resistances, were investigated. Critical upsets in n-channel MOSFET devices resulting in loss of amplifier characteristics, were identified for the power levels above 10 dBm in the frequency range between 1 and 20 GHz. We have found that <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> induced excess charges are responsible for the upsets. Upsets in the static operation of CMOS inverters such as noise margins, output voltages, power dissipation, and bit-flip errors were identified using a load-line characteristic analysis. We developed a parameter extraction method that can predict the dynamic operation of inverters under <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> from DC load-line characteristics. Using the method, the effects of <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> on propagation delays, output voltage swings, and output currents as well as their relation to device scaling, were investigated. Two new critical hard error sources in MOSFETs and CMOS inverters regarding power dissipation and power budget disruption were found. EMI hardened design for digital circuits has been proposed to mitigate the stress on the devices, the contacts, and the interconnects. We found important new bit-flip and latch-up errors under pulsed <b>microwave</b> <b>interference,</b> which demonstrated that the excess charge effects are due to electron-hole pair generation under <b>microwave</b> <b>interference.</b> We proposed a theory of excess charge effects and obtained good agreement of our excess charge model with our experimental results.

This project explores the effects of high-power wideband <b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> on feedback circuits in switching power supplies.

40|$|Nanodiamond imaging {{is a novel}} {{biomedical}} imaging technique that non-invasively records the distribution of biologically-tagged nanodiamonds in vivo, {{in two or three}} dimensions. A nanodiamond imaging system optically detects electron spin resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds, a non-toxic nanomaterial that is easily biologically functionalized. Two systems were built to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique. Using the first system, we imaged 2 D projections of multiple nanodiamond targets within pieces of chicken breast; it is the first demonstration of imaging within scattering tissue by optically-detected magnetic resonance. The first system achieves a sensitivity equivalent to 740 pg of nanodiamond in 100 s of measurement time with a spatial resolution of 800 μm over a 1 cm 2 field of view. The second system was built with a field of view large enough to image a mouse, and with the capability to acquire multiple 2 D projections of the subject for 3 D reconstruction of the nanodiamond distribution. In this thesis, we briefly review existing imaging modalities. We show how nanodiamond imaging has the potential to image with both high sensitivity AND high spatial resolution over organism-scale fields of view, features which are mutually exclusive in existing modalities (except at the shallowest imaging depths). Nanodiamond imaging's combination of high sensitivity and high resolution is potentially one of its greatest advantages. With reasonable sensitivity increases we expect to achieve a sensitivity of 100 fg and potentially as low as 25 ag; spatial resolution could reasonably be extended to < 100 μm and is only limited by the strength of the magnetic gradient. We discuss practical ways to achieve these sensitivity increases, including various different modulation schemes. We also review the nitrogen-vacancy center and its optically-induced spin polarization and optical spin detection mechanisms starting from a group-theoretic understanding of its energy levels. We build upon knowledge of the nitrogen-vacancy center, starting from its spin Hamiltonian, to present a model of the optically-detected magnetic resonance lineshape of nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamond powder. This model is compared to measurements. We explore the imaging point-spread function and show how imaging at just above the NV zero-field frequency [...] 2. 872 GHz, rather than 2. 869 GHz [...] improves the contrast.

40|$|UnrestrictedOne {{of the key}} {{steps in}} the design or {{refinement}} of an application or network protocol is, testing of the protocol for correctness and performance. Simulation and state space exploration {{are the most popular}} ways of testing protocols. Simulation tools like NS, OPNET etc., allow the designer to test/evaluate a protocol's performance on fully specified instances of topologies. State space exploration tools like SPIN allow the designer to test the protocol state space on fully specified instances of topologies for the desired properties. Correctness or (target) behavior of protocols can be expressed using designer specified reachability properties and standard structural properties (invariants on states), whereas, performance of protocols is often expressed as aggregate over states of the protocol (average throughput, average packet loss, etc.). The scope of this study is limited to the correctness of control or house keeping functions of protocols.; Correctness and performance of many protocols and distributed applications in Internet Protocol (IP) based network depends on the network topology, i. e., on the end and intermediate nodes, their physical and logical (MAC, IP, transport etc.) inter-connectivity, as well as the relationship between the control fields of the different nodes. Theoretically, since topology controls packet delivery, it affects of state space of the system and hence must be considered as an input during testing. Though end to end topology abstractions are routinely used to evaluate and test protocols, it is not sufficient as specific topology configurations can drive the performance of the protocol to unacceptable levels or cause the protocol to misbehave. For example, certain topology configurations may cause the throughput of the protocol to decrease by orders of magnitude (<b>microwave</b> <b>interference</b> for 802. 11 protocol) or the node requesting an IP address may not get an IP address (specific configurations of tunnels) or a node that is supposed to detect mobility may not detect mobility (in the presence of virtual machines). Not relying only on the high level abstraction of the end to end topology is especially important in today's world due to the large scale use of intermediate nodes that do not adhere to the end-to-end principles. When America On Line (AOL) introduced a load balancing transparent HTTP proxy for its users, a great majority of its subscribers were unable to use a the AOL chat client to communicate with others {{on the other side of}} the proxy. Detecting such topology induced errors in protocols after deployment can be a costly affair due to the large scale disruption and its associated support costs. In short topology can severely affect protocol performance and correctness and hence the topology space on which the protocol is expected to execute needs to be characterized.; To thoroughly test IP based protocols and applications, for each protocol behavior or protocol property, the testing procedure must iterate implicitly or explicitly over the set of all topology configurations (potentially large in case of IP) on which the protocol is expected to execute. Formally, for a given behavior B a testing procedure is given by; Loop 1 : All valid topologies; [...] Loop 2 : All inputs, initial states and sequences of injection; [...] Loop 3 : Check of behavior B occurs; Today, simulation and state space enumeration tools are used to test a protocol on a specific topology instance. In the above procedure, the loops within the outermost topology enumeration loop, those representing state space enumeration over a given topology instance has been extensively studied. Though this work has to deal with the complexity of state space enumeration indirectly, addressing the state space enumeration problem itself is not a part of this work. Any testing procedure, be it simulation or state space enumeration has to deal with the very large space of scenarios that can exist in the behavior space. Addressing the large scenario space is beyond the scope of this work.; In the above procedure, the outer most loop enumerating individual instances of topologies in the topology configuration space, will incur impractical runtime complexity due to combinatorial explosion in the number of topology instances when the number of components that make up the topology and/or their configurations are very large. Further, to ensure thorough testing, the set of topologies on which the protocol can misbehave must be used during testing. Thus, an approach that can differentiate between the set of topologies on which the behavior occurs, and, the set on which the behavior does not occur, can be very useful to reduce the complexity arising out of the necessity to consider all topology configurations to ensure thorough testing. Though several studies have attempted to study the influence of topology on protocol behavior, a methodology to systematize selection or generation of topologies that can used for effective protocol testing has received little attention. This has often resulted in errors in protocols triggered by specific topology configuration going unnoticed at design time only to show up after deployment. The focus of this work is to generate necessary topology conditions that any topology on which the target behavior occurs must satisfy. This can be used to systematize topology coverage while protocol testing, by eliminating the large class of topologies that do not satisfy the necessary conditions and focusing the simulation and state space enumeration efforts on the topology space on which the problematic behavior occurs.; To generate the necessary topology conditions, the procedure must implicitly or explicitly consider all topology configurations and for each topology, determine weather the target behavior occurs or not. A direct approach that uses reachability analysis on each topology configuration has very high complexity due to the potentially large state space for each instance of the topology configuration. There is a trade-off between the computational and space complexities and accuracy of practical search techniques. On one hand, the complexity of the problem can be reduced by restricting the properties of the systems where efficient decidability is guaranteed. On the other hand, trade-offs can be made between the quality of the solution (closeness to sufficient conditions and/or decidability) and complexity. Two of the most common techniques used in practical fault detection techniques are state space folding (abstraction) and sampling. State space folding obtained by abstracting details of the system introduces false positives for error detection, whereas, the sampling technique introduces false negatives for error detection; To generate necessary topology conditions that a topology must satisfy for the target behavior to occur, a methodology called "Compressed Representation of State Space for topology configuration generation" (COMPRESS) is developed. This is based on the novel combination of two basic ideas (a) represent complex topologies as a composition of simple end to end topology component abstractions derived from packet destination types (e. g., IP unicast, IP broadcast, etc) (b) use the information already embedded in the protocol FSMs (folded state space) to drive the composition of the end to end topology abstractions to obtain more complex, but relevant topologies. For a given behavior, COMPRESS, indirectly, i. e., without explicit topology enumeration, identifies necessary conditions satisfied by the set of all topologies on which that behavior may occur, without solving the reachability problem. To our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the problem of generation of necessary topology conditions for a target behavior to occur.; The usefulness of the COMPRESS methodology is evaluated using case studies of several different class of protocols including client server protocol, resource discovery protocol, emergency location information server protocol and multicast based micro-mobility protocol. For each protocol, behaviors that include errors that either appear as 100 % performance degradation or unexpected behavior to the end user are studied. The necessary topology conditions generated by COMPRESS were highly non-intuitive and revealed unexpected or severe errors triggered often by small topology configurations. It is also shown how necessary topology conditions generated by COMPRESS can, not only be used to effectively and efficiently characterize the problematic topology space causing that behavior by eliminating a very large set of uninteresting topologies (up to 99. 4 %), but also be a powerful tool to characterize the severity of the problematic behavior itself. Through these case studies, it is shown that the topology conditions generated are highly non-intuitive, close to sufficient conditions and practically useful, but also the practical runtime complexity is quite manageable.; The contributions of this work are multifaceted. The first contribution is articulating and characterizing the role of topology in systematic protocol testing. This also includes understanding the fundamental properties of the components that make up the solution space of the topology generation problem and properties of possible solution approaches. The second contribution is the COMPRESS methodology, especially the topology augmented TCG data structure, extensions to handle topology dynamics and theoretical framework characterizing the properties (including limitations) of the results generated by COMPRESS. The third contribution is the set case studies that not only illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the COMPRESS methodology, but also reveal unexpected behavior in existing and proposed protocols in the presence of specific topology configurations...|$|E

A survey {{using data from the}} AMSR-E instrument launched in May 2002 shows the interference to be widespread in the C-band (6. 9 GHz) channels. The RFI is located mostly, but not always, near large highly populated urban areas. The locations of interference are persistent in time, but the magnitudes show temporal and directional variability. Strong and moderate RFI can be identified relatively easily using an RFI index derived from the spectral difference between the 6. 9 - and 10. 7 -GHz channels. Weak RFI is difficult to distinguish, however, from natural geo-physical variability. These findings have implications for future microwave sensing at C-band, particularly over land areas.

40|$|Abstract—Microwave radiometers, while {{traditionally}} {{utilized in}} atmospheric and oceanic studies, {{can also be}} used in land surface applications. However, the problem of undesirable atmospheric effects caused by clouds and precipitation must be addressed. In this paper, temporal composite surface brightness images are generated from special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) data with the aid of new algorithms to eliminate smallscale distortion caused by clouds or precipitation. Mean, secondhighest value, modified maximum average (MMA), and hybrid compositing algorithms are compared. The effectiveness of each algorithm is illustrated through simulation and real data distribution analysis. The results show that the second-highest value algorithm is biased high. MMA provides a more accurate brightness temperature estimate in areas of atmospheric distortion, while the mean is superior in regions with little or no distortion. A hybrid algorithm is developed that is a combination of MMA and mean. It utilizes the strengths of both to create a superior algorithm for regions with varying levels of distortion.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{wireless}} devices (smartphones, laptops, sensors) {{that use the}} 2. 4 GHz ISM band is rapidly increasing. The most common communication system in this band is Wi-Fi (IEEE 802. 11 b/g/n). For that reason coexistence between Wi-Fi and other systems {{becomes more and more}} important. In this paper we have investigated the influence on Wi-Fi communication for different interference sources, i. e., wireless Audio/Video (A/V) transmitter, microwave and Bluetooth. A measurement tool has been developed to measure this influence both at the Physical (PHY) Layer and at the link layer to assess the overall Quality of Service (QoS). At link layer the tool allows to analyze the received packets types and sub fields; a sophisticated approach to analyze interference mechanisms compared to traditional packet sniffers that focus on throughput and packet error rate only. In addition, this tool allows to identify the type of interference source based on the occurring interference mechanisms at these lower two layers of the OSI protocol stack. The experimental results show severe impact of A/V transmitters which causes significant overall QoS degradation of WiFi communication in contrast to <b>microwave</b> and Bluetooth <b>interference...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dissertation (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a data collection system for a small unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight. The following three facets comprise of a UAV system: (1) a UAV aircraft; (2) onboard avionics; and (3) a ground control station subsystem (Taha et al., 2010 : 1). In this project, the UAV aircraft is based on the low-cost autonomous quad-rotator system named “Arducopter Quad”, where the onboard avionic system utilizes both an ArduPilot Mega (APM) on-board controller and IMU sensor shield, while the “Mission Planner” software operates as GCS software to gather essential flight data (Xiang & Tian, 2011 : 176). The approach provides the UAV system structure and both hardware and software with a small UAV data collection system, which is examined throughout the study. And introduce the concept of Arducopter dynamics for better understanding with its flight control. The study also considers the communication process between the UAV and the ground control station. The radio wave is an important aspect in the UAV data collection system (Austin, 2010 : 143). The literature review introduced the basis of the radio wave in respect of its travelling speed, and its characteristics of propagation, including how different frequencies will affect radio wave propagation. The aim of this project was to develop a platform for a small UAV real-time data collection system. The pendulum system was involved to simulate the “Roll” movement of the small UAV, while real-time IMU sensor data was successfully collected at ground control station (GCS), both serial communication and wireless communication, which was applied in the data collection process. The <b>microwave</b> generator <b>interference</b> test proves that the 2. 4 GHz XBee module is capable of establishing reliable indoor communication between the APM controller and the GCS. The work of this project is towards development of additional health monitoring technology to prevent the safety issue of the small UAV. The data collection system can be used as basis for the future research of real-time health monitoring for various small UAVs...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) consists {{of a number of}} electronic devices called sensor nodes, which are capable of sensing, computation and wireless communication. The variable properties of wireless communication links make robust and fault-tolerance sensor communication an interesting topic. In radio (wireless) communication, channel quality and interference level are two of the important factors for effective performance, they will affect handling of errors, choosing routes, etc. Therefore, making protocols and transmission techniques that efficiently cope with different channels and interferences is essential. Generally, network simulation and real deployment are the two main ways to test and evaluate techniques and protocols in radio communication. The network simulation, which uses theoretical models and computer simulation to model real world network, is usually used as an effective first step. However the models it rests on are often simple, and sometimes far away from the real network. On the contrary, the real deployment, which uses real hardware and real environment, is generally very good as final test. But it is time consuming, and difficult or sometimes impossible to reproduce. In this report, we introduce a new approach, which can overcome some of the disadvantages in traditional simuation and real world experiment. Our approach combines measured channels and interferences, and with real sensor node radio hardware to do the testing. It is therefore much more realistic than the traditional simulation, while it retains the repeatability of simulations and a fair level of flexibility. The advantage over the real world experiment is that once we have obtained the real channels from different environments, we can test different techniques in the lab, and thus save lots of time. The very good agreement between the data from our approach and the theoretical curve indicates this mote-in-the-loop approach is feasible. Moreover, based on the similar tendency between results from our approach and results from a real experiment, our approach shows one more advantage in addition to those mentioned in above paragraph: one can analyze the cause of certain behavior in detail afterwards. For instance, the reason for the flat parts in the packet error rate curves for <b>microwave</b> oven <b>interference</b> would have been very hard to find without access to the recorded sequences.

40|$|Abstract—Transmissions from {{ground-based}} {{systems in}} C- and X-bands present a significant {{challenge to the}} use of these bands for passive microwave remote sensing from aircraft and satellites. Because future missions plan to continue to use these frequencies, it is important to characterize and understand the nature of interference in as much of the candidate spectrum as possible. This paper presents a statistical analysis of interference observed in the continental U. S. using six months of data collected from the C- and X-band channels of the WindSat microwave radiometer. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies by Li et al. and Njoku et al., which are based on data obtained from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS using somewhat similar center frequencies and bandwidths. Results show significant radio-frequency interference (RFI) at C-band, including brightnesses in horizontal and vertical polarizations in excess of 330 K, while X-band RFI is less obvious through direct examination of measured linearly polarized brightnesses. Evidence of lower levels of RFI is provided through use of the spectral and polarization indexes of Li et al., which reveal likely RFI contributions at X-band as well. Further confirmation of X-band RFI is obtained through analysis of the polarimetric channels, which are shown to provide direct evidence of RFI in contrast to the linearly polarized channels. A temporal analysis of the largest C-band RFI sources is also provided in an attempt to further understand their properties.

40|$|Whilst {{access to}} {{location}} based {{information has been}} mostly possible in the outdoor arena {{through the use of}} GPS, the provision of accurate positioning estimations and broad coverage in the indoor environment has proven somewhat problematic to deliver. Considering more time is spent in the indoor environment, the requirement for a solution is obvious. The topography of an indoor location with its many walls, doors, pillars, ceilings and floors etc. muffling the signals to from mobile devices and their tracking devices, {{is one of the many}} barriers to implementation. Moreover the characteristically noisy behaviour of wireless devices such as Bluetooth headsets, cordless phones and <b>microwaves</b> can cause <b>interference</b> as they all operate in the same band as Wi-Fi devices. The limited range of tracking devices such as Wireless Access Points (AP), and the restrictions surrounding their positioning within a buildings' infrastructure further exacerbate this issue, these difficulties provide a fertile research area at present. The genesis for this research is the inability of an indoor location based system (LBS) to locate devices beyond the range of the fixed tracking devices. The hypothesis advocates a solution that extends the range of Indoor LBS using Mobile Devices at the extremities of Cells that have a priori knowledge of their location, and utilizing these devices to ascertain the location of devices beyond the range of the fixed tracking device. This results in a cooperative localisation technique where participating devices come together to aid in the determination of location of devices which otherwise would be out of scope...|$|R

They function as electrolytes, as a building block of hemoglobin for oxygen transport within the blood, {{as a component}} for follicle stimulating hormones and as inorganic cofactors for some enzymes. However, ingestion of absorption of certain specific metals, as well as overwhelming exposure to essential metals, can be harmful when absorbed and lead to health complications and conditions. While metals can be found to deposit in large quantities from environmental sources, the effect of anthropogenic activities can result in metal pollution in surrounding areas. In order to study the impact of anthropogenic actions Environmental indicators, such as moss, water, and soil, combined with metal-detecting instrumentation {{may be used to}} measure concentrations of metals present in the biosphere. In order to monitor the environmental impact of rocket combustion, samples collected at the Kennedy Space Center have been analyzed for metals using inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The results are presented in Chapter 1. A two-part teaching lab experiment enlightens students with the use of environmental indicators and ICP-OES to monitor anthropogenic activities that may result in metal pollution in environmental samples. In part one, an experiment is designed to simulate the metal pollutants that originate from sparklers (small-scale fireworks). Two environmental indicators, surface water and Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), are exposed to a lit sparkler in a closed container. The Spanish moss is subsequently microwave digested, and both samples are analyzed for 16 elements by ICP-AES. In part two, the metal content of real samples taken from the environment (topsoil and surface water) surrounding the KSC launch pads before and after a shuttle launch are analyzed.

An effortless and cost-effective access to the synthesis of a nanocomposite material of polyaniline (PANI) -iron oxide Fe 3 O 4 nPs has been improved. Polyaniline-iron oxide (PANI-nFe 3 O 4) nanocomposites were synthesized by increasing the wt% of nano iron oxide (nFe 3 O 4) with {{in the presence of}} PANI materials. Mechanical mixing method is used in the preparation of PANI-nFe 3 O 4 nanocomposites material. The chemical structure of pure PANI and PANI-nFe 3 O 4 nanocomposites is characterized by using Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy and it is also used to analyze the stretching vibration, wavenumber shifting and chemical structure changes of nanocomposites. The optical properties were characterized by using UV-Visible spectroscopy and the band gap value of pure PANI, PANI-nFe 3 O 4 (50 %), PANI-nFe 3 O 4 (100 %) are 3. 284 eV, 3. 214 eV and 3. 201 eV respectively; it was observed that the band gap value of nanocomposites decreased with increase in the concentration of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Crystalline nature of pure PANI and its nanocomposites were analysized by using the X-Ray diffraction spectroscopy. pure PANI has amorphous nature. By increasing the iron oxide nPs the amorphous nature of pure PANI decreases while its crystalline nature increases. The bacterial growth (E-Coli and staphylococcus aureus), the resultant increase in the zone of inhibition due to increase in the weight % of Fe 3 O 4 nPs were studied using antibacterial activity. Introduction. In recent research, the preparation of conducting polymer nanocomposites (CPnCs) has obtained a great deal of interest in physics and chemistry materials research community because of different potential applications of these materials in chemical sensing, polymer batteries catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, light emitting diode (LED), organic light emitting diode (OLED) and medical diagnosis etc., [1]. The synthesis of organic-inorganic nanocomposites has become the subject of extensive studies. The nanocomposites containing organic polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, poly-o-toluidine etc.,) and inorganic particles in nano metal oxide (nFe 3 O 4, nNiO, nSb 2 O 3, nZnO, nTiO 2, nCuO, nCrO 2, nV 2 O 5 and nAl 2 O 3 etc.,) provide an entirely new class of materials with novel properties. Nowadays, syntheses of new CPnCs with improved mechanical properties, processability, or heat resistance in comparison to corresponding pure conducting polymers alone, as well as the studies of their electrical, optical, magnetic, and catalytic properties constitute a great scientific challenge [2]. Polyaniline (PANI) {{is one of the most}} extensively studied conducting polymers because of its simple synthesis and doping-dedoping chemistry, low cost, high conductivity, excellent environmental stability, and wide potential applicability, erasable optical information storage, shielding of electromagnetic <b>interference,</b> <b>microwave</b> and rada...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by marine mussel adhesives, the {{dopamine}} (DA) polymerization {{process has}} been introduced as a versatile deposition method to coat almost all kinds of material surfaces and form a nanoscale polydopamine (PDA) thin film. Although the DA polymerization mechanism and the PDA structure have not been fully explored, PDA films have gained great interest for their promising applications, such as anti-corrosion coating, drug delivery, biosensing and nanocomposite functionalization. In this project, we started with the fundamental investigations of the surface, adhesion, friction and cracking properties of PDA thin films. A series of surface characterizations and mechanical tests were performed to reveal the static and dynamic properties of PDA films coated on glass, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and epoxy substrates in {{both dry and wet}} conditions. The systematic studies of the PDA film provide insights into its stability, mechanical and adhesive properties; further investigations are focused on the effective transferring of this nano-material to functional devices and biocompatible coatings. To achieve this goal, we combined PDA with polypyrrole (PPy), {{which is one of the}} most extensively investigated electrically conductive polymers because of its economic preparation, long-term stability and good biocompatiablity. After being functionalized by PDA, the PPy morphology changed from globular to fibrous; the adhesion between PPy film and glass substrates was enhanced due to the PDA self-adhesion property and the use of proper DA/pyrrole (Py) ratios also improved PPy conductivity. All of these new features significantly improve PPy processability and broaden its potential applications. In order to understand the effect of DA on Py polymerization, we performed a detailed and systematic investigation using three types of bioinspired catechol derivatives simple catechol (CA), L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in addition to the dopamine and 2 -pheny-lethylamine (PA) in the synthesis of PPy. These studies provided strong evidence that catechol modification can be applied as a general protocol to functionalize conducting polymers to overcome their poor water dispersibility and low interfacial adhesion of PPy. Although DA-PPy has shown promise in many biological applications, its conductivity still requires further improvement, especially at higher DA/Py mole ratios. As a result, we developed new synthetic approaches to the preparation of DA-PPy nanostructures, which have both improved electrical conductivity and water dispersibility. Moreover, we explored the suitable application of each as-fabricated nanomaterials depending on the DA/Py reacting mole ratio. In particular, DA-PPy produced using a 0. 032 DA/Py mole ratio demonstrated superior capacitance for supercapacitors, DA-PPy obtained from a 0. 064 DA/Py mole ratio can be used as co-fillers in the epoxy network to prepare functional composites for electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), DA-PPy synthesized from a 0. 64 DA/Py mole ratio was found to have the impressive capability of absorbing electromagnetic <b>microwaves</b> for electro-magnetic <b>interference</b> (EMI) shielding applications. Due to the synergetic effect of DA modification, conducting polymer DA-PPy exhibit multifunctional and unique properties, which opens a brand new field of nanomaterial syntheses and applications...|$|R
