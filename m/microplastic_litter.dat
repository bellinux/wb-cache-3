50|$|The UNEP {{report on}} {{microplastics}} in cosmetics was released. The study, entitled Plastic in Cosmetics: Are We Polluting the Environment Through our Personal Care: Plastic ingredients {{that contribute to}} marine <b>microplastic</b> <b>litter</b> is a compilation of currently available knowledge on the linkages between cosmetics and plastic pollution in the oceans.|$|E
40|$|<b>Microplastic</b> <b>litter</b> is a {{pervasive}} pollutant present in marine systems across the globe. The legacy of microplastics {{pollution in the}} marine environment today may remain {{for years to come}} due to the persistence of these materials. Microplastics are emerging contaminants of potential concern and as yet there are few recognised approaches for monitoring. In 2008, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008 / 56 /EC) included microplastics as an aspect to be measured. Here we outline the approach as discussed by the European Union expert group on marine litter, the technical Subgroup on Marine litter (TSG-ML), with a focus on the implementation of monitoring microplastics in seawater in European seas. It is concluded that harmonization and coherence is needed to achieve reliable monitoring...|$|E
40|$|<b>Microplastic</b> <b>litter</b> is a {{pervasive}} pollutant present in aquatic systems across the globe. A range of marine organisms {{have the capacity}} to ingest microplastics, resulting in adverse health effects. Developing methods to accurately quantify microplastics in productive marine waters, and those internalized by marine organisms, is of growing importance. Here we investigate the efficacy of using acid, alkaline and enzymatic digestion techniques in mineralizing biological material from marine surface trawls to reveal any microplastics present. Our optimized enzymatic protocol can digest > 97 % (by weight) of the material present in plankton-rich seawater samples without destroying any microplastic debris present. In applying the method to replicate marine samples from the western English Channel, we identified 0. 27 microplastics m− 3. The protocol was further used to extract microplastics ingested by marine zooplankton under laboratory conditions. Our findings illustrate that enzymatic digestion can aid the detection of microplastic debris within seawater samples and marine biota...|$|E
40|$|For many years, the {{pollution}} {{of the oceans}} with marine litter received only little attention from the public although the global plastic production has grown steadily. However, since the “discovery” of the oceanic garbage patches and <b>microplastics</b> the <b>littering</b> of the oceans has become a hot topic, which is reflected in strong recent increases {{in the number of}} publications. Despite growing research efforts many questions remain unanswered and the new wealth of information does not readily transpire to the general public, which is left unsettled. For example, it is still unclear what the overall extent of ocean pollution is, or how the enormous amounts of oceanic plastics affect marine life and ecosystems. To overcome this uncertainty and make best use of the existing knowledge, we currently develop an online portal for marine <b>litter</b> and <b>microplastic</b> pollution named LITTERBASE. As of early 2017, LITTERBASE will provide access to the current state of understanding of marine <b>litter</b> and <b>microplastics</b> to the general public and stakeholders. Published records of marine <b>litter</b> and <b>microplastics</b> and their impact on marine life will be compiled in a database. The regularly updated information will be displayed in distribution maps and other graphs in an interactive online portal. In the long run, data from citizen scientists may also be integrated into these infographs...|$|R
40|$|Pollution {{caused by}} plastic debris is an urgent {{environmental}} problem. Here, we assessed {{the effects of}} microplastics in the soil surface litter on the formation and characterization of burrows built by the anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris in soil and quantified the amount of microplastics that was transported and deposited in L. terrestris burrows. Worms were exposed to soil surface <b>litter</b> treatments containing <b>microplastics</b> (Low Density Polyethylene) for 2 weeks at concentrations of 0 %, 7 %, 28 %, 45 % and 60 %. The latter representing environmentally realistic concentrations found in hot spot soil locations. There were significantly more burrows found when soil was exposed to the surface treatment composed of 7 % microplastics than in all other treatments. The highest amount of organic matter in {{the walls of the}} burrows was observed after using the treatments containing 28 and 45 % microplastics. The highest microplastic bioturbation efficiency ratio (total microplastics (mg) in burrow walls/initial total surface <b>litter</b> <b>microplastics</b> (mg)) was found using the concentration of 7 % microplastics, where L. terrestris introduced 73. 5 % of the surface microplastics into the burrow walls. The highest burrow wall microplastic content per unit weight of soil (11. 8 ± 4. 8 g kg- 1) was found using a concentration of 60 % microplastics. L. terrestris was responsible for size-selective downward transport when exposed to concentrations of 7, 28 and 45 % microplastics in the surface litter, as the fraction ≤ 50 μm microplastics in burrow walls increased by 65 % compared to this fraction in the original surface litter plastic. We conclude that the high biogenic incorporation rate of the small-fraction <b>microplastics</b> from surface <b>litter</b> into burrow walls causes a risk of leaching through preferential flow into groundwater bodies. Furthermore, this leaching may have implications for the subsequent availability of microplastics to terrestrial organisms or for the transport of plastic-associated organic contaminants in soil. <br/...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} anthropogenic-driven changes to our planet in the last half-century. One of the most evident changes is the ubiquity and abundance of litter in the marine environment. The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008 / 56 /EC) establishes a framework within which EU Member States shall take action to achieve or maintain good environmental status (GES) of their marine waters by 2020. GES is based on 11 qualitative descriptors as listed in Annex I of the MSFD. Descriptor 10 (D 10) concerns marine litter. As a follow-up to the related Commission Decision on criteria and methodological standards (2010 / 477 /EU) in which 56 indicators for the achievement of GES are proposed, the EC Directorate-General for the Environment, on {{the request of the}} European Marine Directors, established a Technical Subgroup on Marine Litter (TSG ML) under the Working Group on GES. The role of TSG ML is to support Member States through providing scientific and technical background for the implementation of MSFD requirements with regard to D 10. Started in 2011, TSG ML provides technical recommendations for the implementation of the MSFD requirements for marine litter. It summarizes the available information on monitoring approaches and considers how GES and environmental targets could be defined with the aim of preventing further inputs of litter to, and reducing its total amount in, the marine environment. It also identifies research needs, priorities and strategies in support of the implementation of D 10. The work of TSG ML also focuses on the specification of monitoring methods through the development of monitoring protocols for litter in the different marine compartments, and for <b>microplastics</b> and <b>litter</b> in biota. Further consideration is being given to monitoring strategies in general and associated costs. Other priorities include the identification of sources of marine litter and {{a better understanding of the}} harm caused by marine litter...|$|R
40|$|Plastic debris is {{widespread}} in the environment, but information {{on the effects of}} microplastics on terrestrial fauna is completely lacking. Here, we studied the survival and fitness of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae) exposed to microplastics (Polyethylene, < 150 μm) in litter at concentrations of 7, 28, 45, and 60 % dry weight, percentages that, after bioturbation, translate to 0. 2 to 1. 2 % in bulk soil. Mortality after 60 days was higher at 28, 45, and 60 % of <b>microplastics</b> in the <b>litter</b> than at 7 % w/w and in the control (0 %). Growth rate was significantly reduced at 28, 45, and 60 % w/w microplastics, compared to the 7 % and control treatments. Due to the digestion of ingested organic matter, microplastic was concentrated in cast, especially at the lowest dose (i. e., 7 % in litter) because that dose had the highest proportion of digestible organic matter. Whereas 50 percent of the microplastics had a size of < 50 μm in the original litter, 90 percent of the microplastics in the casts was < 50 μm in all treatments, which suggests size-selective egestion by the earthworms. These concentration-transport and size-selection mechanisms may have important implications for fate and risk of microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, various {{environmental}} {{issues from the}} shipping industry which {{ends up in the}} oceans are described. Oil pollution, wastewater, antifouling paint, ballast water and litter are all described in detail. Various sources of oil pollution exist, ranging from large accidents to small continuous leakages from, e. g., propeller shaft bearings. The behaviour of oil when it enters the sea can differ, ultimately affecting the environment. Wastewater from ships is divided into sewage and grey water, and different regulations can affect their characteristics. Fouling on ship hulls affects the drag on the ship, which increases fuel consumption when maintaining a constant speed. The various antifouling paints used today to combat fouling are described herein, and a review of the environmental implications of using these paints is provided. Ballast water contains organisms that can become invasive if released into a new geographical area. Invasive species can entail costs on the order of millions of euros. Finally, litter is discussed in this chapter. Litter is deposited in the ocean via several sources and can affect organisms over long periods of time. Plastic causes the largest litter-related problem because it does not biodegrade; such material only becomes smaller, ultimately reaching a <b>microplastic</b> state. Henee, <b>litter</b> can affect organisms in different ways...|$|R
30|$|Sundt et al. [57] {{evaluated}} {{the most relevant}} sources for direct release of microplastics to the Norwegian environment. Such ‘primary sources’ of <b>microplastics</b> exclude macroplastic <b>litter,</b> but include abrasion of microplastics (e.g. from paints and tyres), i.e. are not confined to primary microplastics as defined in the present review. As far as possible, first estimates were provided for annually released amounts. These amounts are upstream or ‘start of the pipe’ amounts; transport processes are not considered. The estimated annually used amount of microplastics in personal care products (40  t) is in good agreement with the estimate of Gouin et al. [53] for Norway (43  t). According to Sundt et al. [57] microplastics from personal care products account for approx. 0.5  % of all direct emissions of microplastics in Norway. Other sources such as losses of pre-production plastics during transport and spills (approx. 5  %), abrasion from ship paints, other protective paints, house and road paints (approx. 17  %), release of textile fibres during household and commercial laundry (approx. 8  %) and, especially, abrasion from tyres (approx. 54  %) were considered more relevant. Sundt et al. [57] assumed that macroplastic litter substantially contributes to the overall release of microplastics to the Norwegian environment. However, the available data were not considered sufficient for deriving estimates of this contribution. First estimates were only provided for annual amounts of three types of macroplastic litter in Norway: plastic waste from fisheries and aquaculture (> 1000  t), littered plastic bags (60  t) and macroplastics released during sewer overflow events (460  t). Estimates derived for Germany and Denmark also indicate that personal care products are a minor source of microplastics in the environment and that other sources such as the fragmentation of plastic debris and abrasion from tyres are more relevant [51, 59]. For Denmark, emissions of microplastics from personal care products to the aquatic environment were estimated to account for 0.1  % of the overall emissions to the aquatic environment [51].|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{environmental}} concern regarding ‘microplastics’: microscopic plastic granules, fibres and fragments, categorised as < 1 or < 5 mm diameter. Microplastics are manufactured to be of a microscopic size, or derive from the photo- and mechanical degradation and subsequent fragmentation of larger plastic <b>litter.</b> <b>Microplastics</b> debris has been identified in the water column and sediments of marine and freshwater ecosystems across the globe, although difficulties in sampling and isolating smaller particulates has resulted in the abundance of < 333 µm microplastics being under-reported. Microplastics are bioavailable to a range of aquatic organisms, including fish, seabirds and benthic invertebrates, and can be trophically transferred. The consumption of plastic debris can result in gut blockages, heightened immune response and a loss of lipid reserves. The potential risk to food security, and thereby human health, has led regulators to call for better understanding of the fate and effects of microplastic debris on marine life. Here I tested the hypothesis that microplastics can be ingested by and may negatively impact upon zooplankton. Zooplankton encompass a range of aquatic animals that form a key trophic link between primary producers {{and the rest of the}} marine food web. I used a suite of feeding experiments, bio-imaging techniques and ecotoxicological studies to explore the interactions and impacts of polystyrene microplastics on marine zooplankton. My results demonstrate that a range of filter-feeding zooplankton taxa, including copepods and bivalve and decapod larvae, have the capacity to ingest microplastics. Microplastics significantly reduced algal feeding in the copepods Centropages typicus and Calanus helgolandicus. With prolonged microplastic exposure C. helgolandicus produced smaller eggs with reduced hatching success, and had reduced survival owing to declining energetic reserves. Microplastics egested by copepods significantly altered the properties and sinking rates of faecal pellets, with potential repercussions for marine nutrient flux. This investigative work highlights that microplastics pose a significant risk to the health of animals at the base of the marine food web. NER...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{significant}} {{growth in the}} field of sensor networks, which are currently collecting large amounts of environmental data. This data needs to be collected, processed, stored and made available for analysis and interpretation in a manner which is meaningful and accessible to end users and stakeholders with a range of requirements, including government agencies, environmental agencies, the research community, industry users and the public. The COMMONSENSE project aims to develop and provide cost-effective, multi-functional innovative sensors to perform reliable in-situ measurements in the marine environment. The sensors will be easily usable across several platforms, and will focus on key parameters including eutrophication, heavy metal contaminants, marine <b>litter</b> (<b>microplastics)</b> and underwater noise descriptors of the MSFD. The aims of Tasks 2. 1 and 2. 2 which comprise the work of this deliverable are: •	To obtain a comprehensive understanding and an up-to-date state of the art of existing sensors. •	To provide a working basis on “new generation” technologies in order to develop cost-effective sensors suitable for large-scale production. This deliverable will consist of an analysis of state-of-the-art solutions for the different sensors and data platforms related with COMMONSENSE project. An analysis of relevant technical issues and deficiencies of existing sensors and related initiatives currently set and working in marine environment will be performed. Existing solutions will be studied to determine the main limitations to be considered during novel sensor developments in further WP’s. Objectives & Rationale The objectives of deliverable 2. 1 are: •	To create a solid and robust basis for finding cheaper and innovative ways of gathering data. This is preparatory for the activities in other WPs: for WP 4 (Transversal Sensor development and Sensor Integration), for WP(5 - 8) (Novel Sensors) to develop cost-effective sensors suitable for large-scale production, reducing costs of data collection (compared to commercially available sensors), increasing data access availability for WP 9 (Field testing) when the deployment of new sensors will be drawn and then realized...|$|R
