5|$|Jamia Hafsa was a <b>madrassa</b> {{for women}} located near Lal Masjid. It {{was the largest}} Islamic {{religious}} institution {{for women in the}} world, with more than 6,000 students. It was constructed by Maulana Qari Abdullah in 1992. After his assassination, supervision passed to his son Abdul Aziz. Students were taught general subjects, including mathematics and geography but were not tested on these subjects; the only exams were on religious subjects.|$|E
25|$|Militias {{controlling}} the different areas often surrendered without a fight. Omar's commanders were {{a mixture of}} former small-unit military commanders and <b>madrassa</b> teachers.|$|E
25|$|The Chenagai airstrike {{took place}} on October 30, 2006, around 5:00 am local time. Missiles were fired at a <b>madrassa</b> in Chenagai village in Bajaur region of Pakistan. An {{eyewitness}} has stated that the <b>madrassa</b> was filled with local students who had resumed studies after the Eid ul-Fitr holiday. 82 {{people died in the}} attack. It was initially reported that the Pakistani military carried out the attack, but the United States was later accused of the attacks. The U.S. government denied involvement.|$|E
25|$|On 30 March 2014, Siraj ul Haq became ameer. He {{resigned}} from {{his role as}} senior minister of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. This coincided with a drone attack on <b>Madrassa,</b> Bajour Agency.|$|E
25|$|He {{was sent}} to the town of Sárí for a <b>madrassa</b> education. Sometime in the mid-1830s he met Mullá Husayn (the first Letter of the Living) and other future Bábís after he joined a small group of {{students}} in Mashhad.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{had since}} 1992 been {{studying}} in the Sang-i-Hisar <b>madrassa</b> in Maiwand (northern Kandahar Province), {{was disappointed that}} Islamic law had not been installed in Afghanistan after the ousting of communist rule, and now with his group pledged to rid Afghanistan of warlords and criminals.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{preserved}} Ayyubid dome {{is that of}} the Matbakh al-'Ajami in Aleppo, {{resting on}} muqarnas pendentives. It may have been the palace residence of the al-'Ajami family. The mausoleum over the tomb of Iman Al-Shafi‘i (built in 1211) has a large wooden double dome (rebuilt in 1722) about 29 meters high and, with the tombs of al-Malik al-Silah and the so-called Tomb of the Abassid Caliphs, is one of three important Ayyubid tombs in Cairo dating from {{the first half of the}} 13th century. The domed mausoleum was built 35 years after the <b>madrassa</b> ordered by Saladin at the site in 1176-7, which were introduced in Egypt after 1171 to counter Shia Islam. The only <b>madrassa</b> from the period to partly survive is the 1242 construction by As-Salih Ayyub on the site of the Fatimid Eastern Palace. The 10 meter wide domed tomb at its northern end led to the series of funerary madrassas built in Cairo by the Mamluk Sultans.|$|E
25|$|Some {{representative}} {{examples of}} the Anatolian beyliks' architecture are İlyas Bey Mosque at Balat (Milet) (1404), İsabey Mosque at Selçuk (1375), Ulucami Mosque at Birgi (1312) built by the Aydın beylik. The above mosques, although being successors of Seljuq architecture, differ greatly in the increase of decorations in the interior and exterior spaces and the different placement of the courtyards and minarets. Karaman beylik also left noteworthy architectural works, such as Ulucami Mosque in Ermenek (1302), Hatuniye <b>Madrassa</b> in Karaman (1382), Akmedrese <b>Madrassa</b> in Niğde (1409), all of which respect a new style that considers and incorporates the exterior surroundings also. One of the first {{examples of the}} Anatolian beylik architecture hinting at the forming of the Ottoman architecture that aims at uniting the interior space beneath one big dome and forming a monumental architectural structure is Ulucami Mosque in Manisa (1374) built by the Saruhan beylik. Also worth noting is the increase in constructions of madrassas that points at the beyliks' attaching greater importance to sciences.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of the Madrassa-e Tawheed was unique in Afghanistan and promulgated the fusion of modern science and religion, hence its attraction among the young university students of that time who required more from Islam than just interpretations and fatwas given by the established, traditional mullahs {{out of touch with}} modern developments in science, technology, and politics. Additionally, the <b>madrassa</b> developed an intensive program of Zhikr (remembrance of Allah) and Fikr (tafakkur), which was also well-suited to military personnel stationed in far-flung and out of the way locales (a common occurrence in Afghanistan).|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise {{a fine example of}} the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and madrassas, the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped corniche, doorway or moulded window frame. Among the finest is the <b>madrassa</b> al-Burtasiyah, with an elegant façade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from her}} {{political}} concerns, Hürrem engaged in several major works of public buildings, from Mecca to Jerusalem, perhaps modelling her charitable foundations in part after the caliph Harun al-Rashid's consort Zubaida. Among her first foundations were a mosque, two Koranic schools (<b>madrassa),</b> a fountain, and a women's hospital near the women's slave market (Avret Pazary) in Istanbul (Haseki Sultan Complex). It {{was the first}} complex constructed in Istanbul by Mimar Sinan in his new position as the chief imperial architect. The {{fact that it was}} the third largest building in the capital, after the complexes of Mehmed II (Fatih) and Süleyman (Süleymaniye mosque), testifies to Hurrem's great status. She also built mosque complexes in Adrianopole and Ankara.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{religious}} {{institutions of the}} Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Jāmi’ah al-Ahmadīyya, sometimes translated as Ahmadiyya University of Theology and Languages, is particularly notable. It is an international Islamic seminary and educational institute with several campuses throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Founded in 1906 as a section in <b>Madrassa</b> Talim ul Islam (later Talim-ul-Islam College) by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, it is the main centre of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community for Islamic learning and the training of missionaries. Graduates may be appointed by the Caliph either as missionaries of the Community (often called Murrabi, Imam, or Mawlana) or as Qadis or Muftis of the Community with a specialisation in matters of fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence). Some Jamia alumni have also become Islamic historians. As of 2008, there are over 1,300 graduates of the University working as missionaries throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The dynastic founder Husayn ibn Ali (1669–1740, r.1705–1735), an Ottoman cavalry officer (agha of the spahis) of Cretan origin, {{managed to}} acquire the {{sovereign}} power in 1705. His military units were included in those Tunisian forces that fought and defeated the then Algerian invasion. The Turkish janissary then selected their own Dey as the new ruler. Husayn ibn Ali, however, opposed the Dey and sought the backing of Tunisian khassa (notables), the ulama and the religious, {{as well as local}} tribes. Thus, though also a Turkish-speaking foreigner, he worked to obtain native loyalties against the Turkish soldiery and eventually prevailed. Accordingly, as ruler he sought to be perceived as a popular Muslim interested in local issues and prosperity. He appointed as qadi a Tunisian Maliki jurist, instead of an Hanafi preferred by the Ottomans. He also restricted the legal prerogatives of the janissary and the Dey. Under Husayn b. Ali as Bey of Tunis support was provided to agriculture, especially planting olive orchards. Public works were undertaken, e.g., mosques and <b>madrassa</b> (schools). His popularity was demonstrated in 1715 when the kapudan-pasha of the Ottoman fleet sailed to Tunis with a new governor to replace him; instead Husayn Bey summoned council, composed of local civil and military leaders, who backed him against the Ottoman Empire, which then acquiesced.|$|E

2500|$|Madrasa ( [...] , , pl. , [...] ) is the Arabic {{word for}} {{any type of}} {{educational}} institution, whether secular or religious (of any religion), and whether a school, college or university.

Immediately, the ISPR claimed that the operation was only by the Pakistan Army, not by the U.S. Army.

The defense expert and others, however, remain skeptical of ISPR statements and gave credibility to local's testimonies.|$|E
