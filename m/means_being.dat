5|$|After the {{suggestion}} {{by the head}} of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by the Government due to much greater <b>means</b> <b>being</b> needed, the Government agreed that a public inquiry should be opened. A public inquiry into the plans was opened in December 1944, with the hearing lasting for three days. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman of the inquiry. The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{place in}} 1997, {{the story begins}} when Laura Harris is {{contacted}} by Los Angeles police, receiving a disturbing message: her father, Dr. Richter Harris, has gone on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself in the hospital. Laura rushes {{to the scene of}} the crime, desperate to find an explanation for the well-respected doctor's actions. Upon entering the hospital, she is so horrified at the murdered bodies lying about the halls that she covers her eyes. When she uncovers them again, she finds herself in an unknown medieval castle. Unwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the castle. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long <b>means</b> <b>being</b> stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father.|$|E

25|$|Words {{translatable}} as 'spirituality' {{first began}} to arise in the 5th century and only entered common use {{toward the end of}} the Middle Ages. In a Biblical context the term <b>means</b> <b>being</b> animated by God, to be driven by the Holy Spirit, as opposed to a life which rejects this influence.|$|E
25|$|Being closeted or in {{the closet}} <b>means</b> <b>being</b> aware of one's lesbian, gay or {{bisexual}} orientation or true gender identity yet averse to revealing it because of various personal or social motivations. It can also include denial or refusal to identify as LGBT. Overall, most reasons not to come out stem from homophobia, transphobia and heterosexism, which marginalize LGBT people as a group.|$|E
25|$|The word tenge in the Kazakh {{and most}} other Turkic {{languages}} means a set of scales (cf the old Uzbek tenga or the Tajik borrowed term tanga). The origin of the word is the Turkic teŋ- which <b>means</b> <b>being</b> equal, balance. The name of this currency is thus similar to the lira, pound and peso. The name of the currency {{is related to the}} Russian word for money , which was borrowed from Turkic.|$|E

25|$|According to Jean Chapelle, a {{professor}} of History specializing on Chadian ethnic groups, the clan system developed out of necessity. Nomadic life <b>means</b> <b>being</b> scattered throughout a region; therefore, belonging to a clan means that the individual is likely to find hospitable clan people in most settlements or camps of any size. A second factor is the maintenance of ties with the maternal clan. Although the maternal clan does not occupy the central place of the parental clan, it provides ties. The third factor is protective relationships at the primary residence.|$|E
25|$|Below is {{an example}} of bit-banging the SPI {{protocol}} as an SPI master with CPOL=0, CPHA=0, and eight bits per transfer. The example is written in the C programming language. Because this is CPOL=0 the clock must be pulled low before the chip select is activated. The chip select line must be activated, which normally <b>means</b> <b>being</b> toggled low, for the peripheral {{before the start of the}} transfer, and then deactivated afterward. Most peripherals allow or require several transfers while the select line is low; this routine might be called several times before deselecting the chip.|$|E
25|$|Play stops {{when the}} ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a {{touchdown}} (see below) or a field goal is scored; {{when the ball}} leaves the playing area by any <b>means</b> (<b>being</b> carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in a standing position but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from scrimmage.|$|E

500|$|... "Travelers" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In a 2000 review of season five for the New Straits Times, Francis Dass {{noted that the}} episode possessed a [...] "nice retro feel throughout". Dass was also complimentary towards the fact that [...] "Mulder senior is shown in action" [...] during the episode. Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote positively of it, noting that, although the entry {{was designed as a}} [...] "stall", it felt like a [...] "weird backdoor pilots for [...] that never happened." [...] He noted that the episode [...] "isn’t as good as it could have been" [...] but argued that the story was [...] "still a mostly fun". In addition, VanDerWerff wrote positively of McGavin's guest starring role and was complimentary towards the [...] "alien spider thing", describing it as [...] "wonderfully gross". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five and called it [...] "fresh and urgent". [...] The two wrote that, while the episode was a stopgap, it [...] "cannot be better placed." [...] They argued that [...] "Travlers" [...] use of the [...] "Communist witch hunt" [...] conceit and its idea that [...] "serving" [...] <b>means</b> <b>being</b> a patriot, whereas [...] "resisting" [...] <b>means</b> <b>being</b> a traitor —a reference to the previous episode's tagline—themes were well-played. [...] Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, praised McGavin's acting, noting that he was [...] "the series' spiritual father".|$|E

2500|$|Antinomianism {{literally}} <b>means</b> <b>being</b> [...] "against or {{opposed to}} the law" [...] and was a term used by critics of those Massachusetts colonists who advocated the preaching of [...] "free grace". The term implied behavior that was immoral and heterodox, being {{beyond the limits of}} religious orthodoxy. [...] The free grace advocates were also called Anabaptists and Familists, groups that were considered seriously heretic in early New England. [...] All three of these terms were used by magistrate John Winthrop in his account of the Antinomian Controversy called the Short Story to discredit the antinomians.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Warner popularized {{the term}} in 1991, {{in one of the}} first major works of queer theory. [...] The concept's roots are in Gayle Rubin's notion of the [...] "sex/gender system" [...] and Adrienne Rich's notion of {{compulsory}} heterosexuality. From the outset, theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at gender; Warner wrote that [...] "every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows {{in one way or another}} that her stigmatization is intricated with gender. [...] Being queer <b>means</b> <b>being</b> able, more or less articulately, to challenge the common understanding of what gender difference means." ...|$|E
2500|$|Volume {{is a part}} {{of natural}} space. So, volume is {{classified}} in a more general class than that of being a [...] "part of nature", which does not include all the parts of space in nature. 1 m³ of air as a [...] "part of nature", like buffalo, egg, human, does not fit into 1 m³ toward being a [...] "part of natural space". We must define unambiguously. The borders are differences among the things in the same classification. So, [...] "volume" [...] <b>means</b> <b>being</b> in accord with the definition above. Science defines the organization of facts by generalizations such as geometry. This is the last step in thinking [...] "madilogically".|$|E
