40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> {{plays in the}} livelihood strategies of rural-urban migrants. It {{contributes to the literature}} on <b>market</b> <b>gardening,</b> livelihood strategies and migration by positioning <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> as a highly flexible and adaptable mechanism for managing the rural-urban transition among households with few labour alternatives. Such perspective elevates <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> from simply being a land use category to being an active instrument in the management of rural-urban migration processes. The expanding urban centre of Kapit, Sarawak, Malaysia is used as a case study of a rapidly expanding small town in a predominantly rural domain. <b>Market</b> <b>gardening</b> emerges as an important source of income for both individuals and households as rural-urban migrants negotiate the transition between farming and urban settlement. Many rural-urban migrants adopt <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> or associated <b>market</b> selling as their first employment in urban centres. First generation migrants often have low off-farm skills which limit their ability to take on alternative occupations. While a rise in <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> activity is enabled by a growth in demand for fresh vegetables, in the context of Sarawak it is also heavily influenced by the involvement of the state that actively encourages participation, provides advice to farmers and offers subsidies. The expansion of roads from rural to urban areas also {{plays an important role in}} improving market gardeners access to urban markets, as well as their access to material inputs. At the same time, increased access has heightened competition by attracting new entrants to urban vegetable markets. Interviews with 10 sellers and 30 market gardeners from Kapit were conducted in 2004. In contrast to <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> in larger centres documented in the literature, this small isolated town case identifies market gardeners as typically middle-aged, rural-urban migrant women with limited education and employment skills other than subsistence farming. <b>Market</b> <b>gardening</b> and associated selling is adopted because they are unable to acquire alternative employment to support their household and children’s education. As such, <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> in the urban setting is a logical extension of the woman’s role as the primary farmer in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|The <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> {{practices}} of Sydney 's culturally diverse inhabitants {{have long been}} neglected in the plans for growth of this aspiring global city. Yet, in providing fresh food {{for the city and}} local employment, practices such as <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> arguably contribute not only to Sydney's globalizing demographic and cultural fabric, but also to the city's environmental sustainability. Encroaching urbanization, however, currently threatens over 50 percent of the <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> on Sydney's peri-urban fringe suggesting that the current planning vision neglects this productive aspect of the city. In the face of urban encroachment discourses of heritage have been mobilised around the <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) growers in the city's South-West. Exhibitions on the histories of these growers have sought to highlight the place of CALD migrant farmers within the city's historical landscape and their role in shaping the city physically and culturally. The extent to which a heritage framing will serve to protect what is a 'living' tradition of <b>market</b> <b>gardening,</b> however, is less than certain. While they continue to contribute to the city's fresh food supply, the alternative land use {{practices of}} these groups such as <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> are often (too easily) dismissed as marginal or periphery {{to the life of the}} city. Recognition through prevailing heritage discourses which privilege built form risk framing the practice of <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> by CALD growers as essentially an antiquated tradition that is only ever an ephemeral element of urban growth. More broadly conceived notions of 'heritage' are possible however -ones that acknowledge that all inhabitants have a stake in the city, environmentally, economically and culturally. In drawing attention to Sydney's 'diverse urban isms' this paper explores the historical role of <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> in 'growing' the city and their potential contributions to sustaining Sydney into the future. 13 page(s...|$|R
