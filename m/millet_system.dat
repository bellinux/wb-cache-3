40|$|The (semi-) {{arid area}} of West Africa is {{characterized}} by erratic rainfall that causes highly variable performances of cropping systems. This creates difficulties in strategic decision-making based on future-oriented production systems. In this paper, the degree of variation in inputs and outputs of future-oriented millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) systems is quantified using a dynamic crop growth simulation model and a static technical coefficient generator. To determine inputs and outputs of future-oriented <b>millet</b> <b>systems</b> under (semi-) arid conditions, the target-oriented approach was operationalized for low-yielding conditions. Economic yield, N-loss and labor requirement were used as benchmarks for outputs and inputs of future-oriented land use systems. Weather data for 31 year characterize two sites in the (semi-) arid zone of Mali, while for each site two soil types with distinct properties were considered. In all four physical environments, inputs and outputs of <b>millet</b> <b>systems</b> have coefficients of variation (CV) exceeding 50 ½ Consequences of the variable performances of these systems are discussed for both policy-makers and designers of future-oriented systems. Engineering tools exist which help policy-makers to quantify consequences of variability at different scale levels so that variability can be reduced or better managed. Examples are given of future-oriented cropping systems aimed at less variable yield. At one site, fine tuning of the sowing date to seasonal water availability reduced CVs yield to 20 – 30 hile long-term average yields increased with 40 to more than 130 &Eth;Water conservation measures increased yields by 40 – 230 nd reduced their CVs by 28 – 50 n all four physical environments.

40|$|During the 2004 {{food crisis}} in Niger, the {{weakness}} of the main production <b>system,</b> <b>millet,</b> to produce enough food to sustain short term crises, has been revealed. Questions arise how the Nigerian smallholder systems can be assisted by research and development policies to intensify production and improve food security. The paper assesses technical options according to their economic sustainability. A sequence of models is applied: On plot level, production functions of inter cropping systems were estimated to determine yields and their variability of the major crops. These data were fed in a nonlinear program to test the inn ovations, first at stable prices, then at declining prices that were obtained from an interregional trade model. The latter was shocked by the excess obtained from the innovations' surpluses. Results show that due to risk aversion and price volatility of output markets, farmers adopt intensive innovations less than expected. Instead, they switch to low-input techniques. Recommendations derived from the study are that research has to develop low-risk technologies to intensify Nigerian <b>millet</b> <b>systems,</b> and that domestic market policies have to stabilize prices in order to reduce market risks and set incentives for intensification. Price stabilization has to be done in a market-conform way, through buying and selling of millet, but not through price fixing or subsidizing.

40|$|Pearl millet {{plays an}} {{important}} role for food security in arid regions of Africa and India. Nevertheless, it lags far behind other cereals in terms of genetic improvement. Improving its root system could improve pearl millet tolerance to abiotic constraints (drought and low nutrient availability) and lead to a significant increase in production. The objective of this work is to characterize pearl system root system development in order to produce knowledge for breeding, mainly targeted on tolerance to drought stress occurring at the early growth stages. First, we described the dynamics of early pearl <b>millet</b> root <b>system</b> development and the anatomy of the different root types. This work revealed the existence of three anatomically distinct types for lateral roots. We also showed the existence of variability in primary root growth and lateral root density in a diversity panel derived from cultivated varieties. Our study also revealed a large variability among the growth profiles of lateral roots. To further analyze this diversity, the growth rates {{of a large number of}} lateral roots were measured daily and a statistical model was developed to classify these lateral roots into three main trends, according to their growth profiles. These three categories distinguish roots according to their growth rate and their growth duration. These different lateral root types are randomly distributed along the primary root and there seem to be no influence of root types on the intervals between successive lateral roots. The three growth types correspond, though imperfectly, to the three anatomical types evidenced in the first chapter. A similar work has been performed on maize, which was used to compare these two phylogenetically close cereals. Finally, we initiated the search for genetic markers associated to primary root growth, a trait potentially involved in early drought stress tolerance. A large panel of genetically fixed pearl millet inbred lines was phenotyped, confirming the presence of a large variability existing for this trait. These lines were then genotyped by sequencing. Analyses of association between phenotype and genotype are underway. This work provides a precise description of pearl <b>millet</b> root <b>system</b> that was little studied to date. Our data were used for parameterization and testing of functional structural plant models simulating root growth and water transport. The statistical tool developed for the characterization of the different lateral root growth types is an original approach that can be used on other cereals. Finally, results from our association study will reveal new information on the genetic control of root growth and open the way to marker assisted selection for root traits in pearl millet.
