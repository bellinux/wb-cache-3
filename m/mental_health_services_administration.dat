40|$|Objectives: Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at high}} risk for HIV, hepatitis, {{overdose}} and other harms. Greater drug treatment availability has been shown to reduce these harms among IDUs. Yet, little is known about changes in drug treatment availability for IDUs in the U. S. This paper investigates change in drug treatment coverage for IDUs in 90 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1993 - 2002. Methods: We define treatment coverage as the percent of IDUs who are in treatment. The number of IDUs in drug treatment is calculated from treatment entry data and treatment census data acquired from the Substance Abuse and <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Administration,</b> divided by our estimated number of IDUs in each MSA. Results: Treatment coverage was low in 1993 (mean 6. 7 %; median 6. 0 %) and only increased to a mean of 8. 3 % and median of 8. 0 % coverage in 2002. Conclusions: Although some MSAs experienced increases in treatment coverage over time, overall levels of coverage were low. The persistence of low drug treatment coverage for IDUs represents a failure by the U. S. health care system to prevent avoidable harms and unnecessary deaths in this population. Policy makers should expand drug treatment for IDUs to reduce blood-borne infections and community harms associated with untreated injection drug use...|$|R

5000|$|States {{are able}} to design unique models for {{delivering}} behavioral and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services,</b> but are largely defined by their choice in structure for administrative services. The two main classifications for administrative services are [...] "carved-in" [...] or [...] "carved out."

25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance Abuse and <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were {{the basis of a}} legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E
40|$|Published {{research}} in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology and the American Society for Clinical Pathology has confirmed {{that the presence of}} Zinc Sulfate in adulterated urine samples can influence the testing results using EMIT and ELISA immunoassay testing when testing for Cannabinoids (THC), Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine), Methamphetamines, Opiates (Morphine, Methadone, and Propoxyphene), Phencyclidine (PCP), and Ethanol (Alcohol Dehydrogenase). This {{research in}}cluded adding Zinc Sulfate directly to urine samples. In 2006, the Substance Abuse and <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Administration</b> (SAMHSA) released an advisory that the use of Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) as a new biomarker as an indicator for the past-use of alcohol was promising and warranted more research. Ethyl glucuronide is a direct metabolite of the biotransformation of ethanol in the human body. This compound is excreted in urine and {{can be used as a}} specific biomarker for the ingestion of alcohol. Because EtG is only produced when ethanol is metabolized, there are no false positives due to fermentation and a much longer detection window exists for its detection. Scientific literature states that EtG can be present in urine long after ethanol has been eliminated. Testing for EtG is commonly referred to as the “ 80 hour test” for the ability of EtG to be measured up to 80 hours after consuming alcohol. It was hypothesized that if the presence of Zinc Sulfate added to urine falsely reduced urine alcohol level when measuring for Alcohol Dehydrogenase enzyme, will the presence of Zinc Sulfate added to SurineTM falsely reduce the urine alcohol level when measuring for EtG? Since it is very likely that EtG would still be present in the body after ethanol has been eliminated, samples contained either no ethanol or 5 % (5 g/dL) of ethanol. Samples were spiked at 10 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL or contained 0 mg/mL of Zinc Sulfate. Additionally, duration testing was conducted to see if there was any observed differences between testing the samples fresh and then after a one week duration in a refrigerator and brought to room temperature prior to testing. Two different immunoassay EtG tests were used to perform the analysis. It was concluded that Zinc Sulfate directly added to the sample affected one of the immunoassay test regardless of whether EtG or ethanol were present, by fading the Test and Control regions. Additionally, it is concluded that SurineTM samples containing Zinc Sulfate could easily be distinguished from samples free of Zinc Sulfate because of the presence of a white cloudy precipitate...|$|R

40|$|In 2006 it was {{estimated}} by the Substance Abuse and <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Administration</b> (SAMHSA, 2007) that 19. 9 million Americans used illicit drugs, computing to roughly 8. 0 % of the United States population. In 2007, there were 2. 1 million active cocaine users, comprising 0. 8 percent of the population. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) estimates that the total expenditure of drug-related complications is greater than 500 billion dollars when healthcare, legal procedures and job loss are considered. Research has shown that prolonged drug use has {{a profound effect on}} the EEG recordings of drug addicts when compared to controls during cue reactivity tests. Cue reactivity refers to a phenomenon in where individuals with a history of drug abuse exhibit excessive psychophysiological responses to cues associated with their drug of choice. The goal of this research is to develop gamma band EEG indices to determine the effectiveness of neurofeedback therapies which are thought to offer a non-invasive method of mediating EEG abnormalities resulting from prolonged substance abuse. Method: Ten current cocaine abusers were treated using neurofeedback protocol to simultaneously increase SMR and decrease Theta activity, combined with Motivational Interviewing sessions. Eight of them completed all planned pre and post-neurofeedback cue reactivity tests with event-related EEG recording and clinical evaluations. Cue reactivity tests consisted of a visual oddball task with images from the International Affective Picture System and drug-related pictures. Evoked and induced gamma responses to target and non-target drug cues were analyzed using wavelet analysis and coherence protocols via custom algorithms implemented in MatLab. Results: Outpatient subjects with cocaine addiction completed the bio-behavioral intervention and successfully increased SMR while keeping theta practically unchanged in 12 sessions of neurofeedback training. Neurofeedback treatment resulted in a lower EEG gamma reactivity to drug-related images in a post-neurofeedback cue reactivity test. In particular, evoked gamma showed decreases in power to non-target and target drugrelated cues at all topographies (left, right, frontal, parietal, medial, inferior); while induced gamma power decreased globally to both target and non-target drug cues. Also, long range coherence was found to increase in specified electrode pairings post neurofeedback. Our findings supported our hypothesis that gamma band cue reactivity measures are sufficiently sensitive to functional outcomes of neurofeedback treatment. Both evoked and induced gamma measures were found capable of detecting changes in EEG responses to both target and non-target drug cues. Conclusion: Our study emphasizes the utility of cognitive neuroscience methods based on EEG gamma band measures for the assessment of the functional outcomes of neurofeedback-based bio-behavioral interventions for addictive disorders. This approach may have significant potential for identifying both physiological and clinical markers of treatment progress. These methodologies can also be adapted and used in additional pathologies to provide fast and reproducible evidence of treatment outcomes...|$|R
