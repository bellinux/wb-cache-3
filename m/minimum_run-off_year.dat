40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hydrological risk phenomena is conditioned by aseries of factors, related to climatic, geologic, geomorphologic, pedologic, vegetal aspects etc., which {{are specific to}} the drainage basin of the Ozana river. The hydrological risk that has a major impact upon the human settlements in the area, is conditioned {{by the presence of}} floods which frequently occur in the rivers flood plain. In this present study, we have emphasised the floods that took placebetween 2005 and 2008, including the maximum maximorum run-off rate of 456 m³/s, recorded at the Dumbrava hydrometric station, in 2005. By utilising the data gathered from the hydrometric stations, located on the Ozana river valley, we have analysed the propagation of the flood waves generated in the three sectors of the drainage basin: the upper, middle and lower sector. After the analysis, we have observed the fact that the area that was most affected by thefloods is the upstream river sector, where numerous households and roads have been flooded. Another aspect of the hydrological risk is related to the <b>minimum</b> <b>run-off</b> of the Ozana river, which is influenced by climatic conditions and alluvial deposits from the riverbed. Therefore, during draughts, taking into considerationthe presence of very thick Quaternary deposits, the river runs dry on its lower course, for a variable period of time, which can be from a few days, to six months, every year. This phenomenon directly affects the local population, especially through the diminished water reserve in the area...|$|R

5000|$|Mean annual {{precipitation}} {{in the basin}} is 35.8 inches, much of which falls as winter snow in the mountains. Mean annual river flow at a mid-river gage is 344 ft³/s, with the highest mean monthly flows occurring in May (939 ft³/s) and the lowest mean monthly flow in September (54.7 ft³/s). Peak river flows for a 100-year event exceed 4,150 ft³/s. [...] Pack River and its tributaries often experience more than one <b>run-off</b> event per <b>year.</b> Mid-winter rain-on-snow events can result in rapid snow melt, and in some years the peak flow from tributary watersheds occurs during these events. Following the 56000 acre Sundance wildfire in 1967, removal of the forest canopy was hypothesized to have produced an increase in annual stream flow from the basin and an advance of the peak flows by virtue of decreased transpiration losses and earlier snowmelt runoff generation.|$|R
40|$|The Niger Delta {{produces}} the oil wealth {{that accounts for}} the bulk of Nigeria’s foreign earnings, but it paradoxically suffers pervasive local poverty. The problem of poverty in the midst of ballooning oil revenues amongst other issues has spawned discontent and disillusion and created the restiveness for which the region is now known World-wide. The Niger Delta has a humid, semi-hot equatorial climate and due to heavy and frequent rainfalls, soils consisting mainly of silt and clay become saturated, reducing infiltration to the barest <b>minimum</b> and encouraging <b>run-off,</b> making it more expensive to construct sustainable infrastructure; physical (e. g., roads, canals and bridges); social (e. g., health and educational facilities, and public utilities); and institutional (e. g., credit institutions and postal services). The terrain is difficult, debilitating while the effects of prolonged and reckless exploitation of natural resources has massively polluted the environment. Given the fact that the mangrove swamp zone is a massive swamp with scattered islands, population is sparsely distributed making the task of promoting sustainable human development infrastructure which usually involves large capital outlays and great elements of risk harder.

40|$|Both {{continuous}} infiltration experiments over {{a period}} of 2 <b>years,</b> <b>run-off</b> experiments in summer 2000 were carried out in order to investigate the behaviour of EDCs in agricultural soils after sewage sludge application. The soils were either loaded with double deionised water, digested sludge, EDC spiked digested sludge, or solely a mixed EDC solution containing 4 -nonylphenol, 4 -tert-octylphenol (OP), bisphenol A, 17 β-estradiol, and 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2). In infiltration experiments, dislocation of alkylphenols and EE 2 towards lower soil horizons was observed. For example, 125 µg/kg of OP and 60 µg/kg of EE 2 were determined in the depth of 20 – 30 cm of a sandy soil. In most cases, EDC concentrations decreased with increasing soil depths. No considerable EDC concentrations were detected in the leachate. We conclude that adsorption to the soil matrix and/or biodegradation prevented a direct EDC transport to groundwater. In run-off experiments one sandy soil and one loamy soil were studied. The results demonstrate an extensive transport of EDCs with run-off water. EDC mass fluxes washed off the sandy soil were higher than those washed off the loamy soil, except in the case of EE 2 which showed an inverse behaviour. Adsorption of EDCs to soil was more extensive in loamy soil than in sandy soil...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{tests are}} often used to {{identify}} areas at risk of excessive phosphorus (P) exports. We investigated the changes in soil P (0 - 20 mm) in four recently laser-graded ( 10 years) irrigated pastures in south-eastern Australia before and after 3 years of irrigated dairy production. At the second sampling, soil water P and nitrogen (N), and P and N in surface run-off (overland flow) were also measured enabling comparison of P in surface run-off with measures of soil P. In surface soil (0 - 20 mm), grading reduced measures of soil P, while P sorption increased. Over 3 years, in the graded bays, Olsen P, Colwell P and P sorption decreased and water extractable P and P sorption saturation increased, while Olsen P and Colwell P decreased in the established bays. After 3 years, total dissolved P (TDP) concentrations in soil water were greater in the established bays, but dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations were unaffected. Organic P in soil water comprised 70 and 32 % of TDP in the established and graded bays, respectively. The soil water analyses were reflected in surface <b>run-off.</b> After 3 <b>years,</b> laser grading decreased TDP, TDN, TP and TN exports in wetting front run-off by 40, 29, 41 and 36 %, respectively, compared with established bays.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} a depressional (lowland) and an upland site in sandy soils to evaluate the effects of surface run-off on the transport of agricultural chemicals to ground water. Approximately 16. 5 cm of water was applied to both sites during the experiment, representing a natural precipitation event with a recurrence interval of approximately 100 <b>years.</b> <b>Run-off</b> was quantified at the lowland site and was not detected at the upland site during the experiment. Run-off of water to the lowland site {{was the most important}} factor affecting differences in the concentrations and fluxes of the agricultural chemicals between the two sites. Run-off of water to the lowland site appears to have played a dual role by diluting chemical concentrations in the unsaturated zone as well as increasing the concentrations at the water table, compared to the upland site. Concentrations of chloride, nitrate and atrazine plus metabolites were noticeably greater at the water table than in the unsaturated zone at both sites. The estimated mass flux of chloride and nitrate to the water table during the test were 5 – 2 times greater, respectively, at the lowland site compared to the upland site, whereas the flux of sulfate and atrazine plus metabolites was slightly greater at the upland site. Results indicate that matrix flow of water and chemicals was the primary process causing the observed differences between the two sites. Results of the experiment illustrate the effects of heterogeneity and the complexity of evaluating chemical transport through the unsaturated zone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract,An {{increased}} {{public perception}} {{of the role of}} agriculture in non-point source pollution has stimulated the need for information on the effect of conventional and sustainable agricultural management systems on water quality. While information on run-off and soil erosion is readily available in Zimbabwe, there is dearth of knowledge on the relative losses of nutrients as a result of soil erosion and their effect on water quality. This study sought to quantify the amount of nutrients lost as a result of soil erosion and thus enable conclusions to be drawn on the implications on water quality. Research work was carried out in the semi-arid region of Zimbabwe under granite-derived, inherently infertile sandy soils. Soil erosion was quantified under three tillage systems conventional tillage (CT); mulch ripping (MR); tied ridging (TR) over three <b>years.</b> <b>Run-off</b> and sediments were analysed for N, P and K. The results showed that N and K losses were significantly higher (p < 0. 001) under CT (15. 8 and 34. 5 kg haâˆ’ 1 yrâˆ’ 1, respectively) compared to the MR (2. 3 and 0. 6 kg haâˆ’ 1 yrâˆ’ 1, respectively) and TR (2. 7 and 4. 3 kg haâˆ’ 1 yrâˆ’ 1, respectively). Due to the immobility of P and its small quantities in these soils, P losses were also low across all treatments (< 1 kg haâˆ’ 1 yrâˆ’ 1), however CT had significantly higher losses (p < 0. 001). The study showed that CT results in high losses of nutrients, which would in turn reduce the quality of surface waters, due to high nutrient concentrations of especially, N, which stimulates the growth of algae and other aquatic weeds. The gravity of the situation would be higher, where soils are more fertile. MR and TR were efficient in reducing soil erosion and thus nutrient losses with run-off and sediments. Pollution of surface water sources can be greatly reduced if conservation tillage systems are used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} can reduce off-farm movements of fertilizers and pollutants {{and improve the}} water use efficiency of irrigated agriculture. Here we compared the effects of furrow and subsurface drip at different irrigation rates, based on a percentage of daily crop-evapotranspiration rates (ETc), on run-off and off-site movement of suspended sediment, nutrients and pesticides from cotton crops grownon a vertisol. Our results show that furrow irrigation significantly increased suspended soil loss, of 5. 26 t ha− 1, {{compared to that of}} subsurface {{drip irrigation}} at 120 % of ETc, of 2. 53 t ha− 1, whereas no erosion was recorded with deficit subsurface drip irrigation. Off-site movement of nitrogen in furrow, of 18. 63 kg ha− 1, was five times greater than subsurface drip irrigation at 120 % ETc. It was much less with 105 % ETc(0. 37 kg ha− 1) and 90 % ETc (0. 15 kg ha− 1), and absent for 75 % and 50 % of ETc. Phosphorus loss from furrow, of 778 g ha− 1, was greater than for the wetter subsurface drip treatments that gave 23 g ha− 1 for 90 % ETc and 19 g ha− 1 for 120 % ETc. No P loss was recorded from drier subsurface drip irrigation rates. Herbicides such as atrazine and diuron were applied in the year prior to the experiment, but considerable amounts were recorded in furrow <b>run-off</b> in both <b>years,</b> but only at 90 and 120 % ETc subsurface drip irrigation in the first year. Concentrations of applied herbicide residues in the runoff exceeded the minimum threshold level for 99 % species protection and, although the total amount of herbicide movement was higher in furrow, at times the concentration was greater for wetter subsurface drip irrigation run-off. Residues of insecticides, such as endosulphan applied in a previous year and dimethoate applied in the current years, were recorded in runoff from subsurface drip at 120 % and furrow irrigation. Their concentrations in each year exceeded minimum threshold level. Subsurface drip irrigation at 75 % ETc offered the best trade-off between off-site run-off, erosion and pesticide movement and yield and water use efficiency...|$|R
