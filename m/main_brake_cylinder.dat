50|$|A {{development}} {{introduced in}} the 1950s was the direct admission valve, fitted to every <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These valves responded to a rise in train pipe pressure as the brake was applied, and admitted atmospheric air directly to {{the underside of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{lower than that of}} the reservoir, the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> exhaust portal is closed and air from the car's reservoir is fed into the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Pressure increases in the <b>cylinder,</b> applying the <b>brakes,</b> while decreasing in the reservoir. This action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Various type of levers {{are used}} on the ICF Bogie [...] The typical levers being the [...] "Z" [...] lever, {{floating}} lever and the connecting lever. Theses levers are used to connect the brake beam with the piston of the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The location of the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinders</b> decides whether the bogie shall be a BMBC Bogie or a non BMBC Bogie. Conventional bogies are those ICF bogies in which the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{mounted on the body}} of the coach and not placed on the bogie frame itself.|$|R
50|$|In an ICF BMBC Bogie, the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is mounted}} on the bogie frame itself. Traditionally, the ICF Bogies were {{conventional}} type i.e. the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> was {{mounted on the body}} of the coach. However, in the later modification, the new bogies are being manufactured with the BMBC designs only. Even the old type bogies are being converted into BMBC Bogies. The BMBC bogie has many advantages over the conventional ICF bogie. The foremost being that, since the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is mounted on}} the bogie frame itself and is nearer to the brake beam, the brake application time is reduced. Moreover, a small <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is adequate for braking purpose. This also reduces the overall weight of the ICF bogie apart from the advantage of quick brake application.|$|R

25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the reservoir charging valve, and the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{contained}} in a larger housing—this gives a reserve of vacuum as the piston operates. The cylinder rocks slightly in operation to maintain alignment with the brake rigging cranks, so it is supported in trunnion bearings, and the vacuum pipe connection to it is flexible. The piston in the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> has a flexible piston ring that allows air to pass from {{the upper part of}} the cylinder to the lower part if necessary.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s the {{automatic}} coupler project saw the underframes replaced. The new design was all-steel, reinforced with centre sills {{in lieu of}} the truss rods and heavier bracing on the ends, and the brake equipment on the first 201 wagons was upgraded from the previous combined <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> and auxiliary reservoir to a larger <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a separate auxiliary reservoir. When the buffers and truss rods were removed in the 1950s, the wagon capacity was boosted a further ton.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} master <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In turn the master <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a brake fluid supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled brake fluid pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|R

The throwing mechanism consists of a magnetic <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which was developed to overcome the problems of the internal pressure fall of the pneumatic cylinder when moving light loads. However, the first magnetic <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> designed does not have the necessary structure and mechanism to provide control over the child machine’s throwing distance.

2500|$|Virtually all {{railroad}} {{rolling stock}} {{is equipped with}} manually operated mechanical hand brake devices that set and release the brakes.

The use of vacuum braking instead of steam braking became standard practice on locomotives built from 1944 onwards and was welcomed by SAR drivers, who were always reluctant to make use of steam brakes for fear of skidding the coupled wheels. In practice, the trigger on the steam brake attachment to isolate the proportional device which admitted steam to the <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> automatically upon the application of the vacuum brake, was invariably wedged down with a wooden peg by drivers to eliminate the steam brake entirely.|$|R
