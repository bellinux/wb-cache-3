500|$|The CIPM's draft proposal, {{which was}} an {{extensive}} revision and simplification of the <b>metric</b> <b>unit</b> definitions, symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units, was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954. In accordance with Giorgi's proposals of 1901, the CIPM also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical would be derived. The definitions for the ohm and volt {{that had previously been}} in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the metre, ampere, second and kilogram. After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP, two further base units, the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units. [...] The full system and name [...] "Système International d'Unités" [...] were adopted at the 11th CGPM.|$|E

The unqualified ton usually refers to the long ton (...) in the UK and to the short ton (...) in the US (but note that the tonne and long ton differ by only 1.6%, and are roughly interchangeable when accuracy is not critical; ton and tonne are usually pronounced the same in speech).|$|E

2500|$|A 1992 {{amendment}} to the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), which took effect in 1994, required labels on federally regulated [...] "consumer commodities" [...] to include both metric and US customary units.

Likewise, Canada also legally allows for dual labelling of goods provided that the <b>metric</b> <b>unit</b> is listed first {{and that there is}} a distinction of whether a liquid measure is a US or a Canadian (Imperial) unit.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} proposal {{for what is}} now known as the metric system was by John Wilkins, a Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1668. The metric system was further developed during the French Revolution to replace the various measures previously used in France. The metre (also spelled [...] "meter" [...] in some dialects of English) is the unit of length in the metric system and was originally based on the dimensions of the earth, as far as it could be measured at the time. [...] The litre (also spelled [...] "liter"), is the unit of volume and was defined as one thousandth of a cubic metre. The <b>metric</b> <b>unit</b> of mass is the kilogram and it was defined as the mass of one litre of water. The metric system was, in the words of French philosopher Marquis de Condorcet, [...] "for all people for all time".|$|E
