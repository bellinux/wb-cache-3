5|$|Before the Taylor Report {{demanded that}} the stadium be all-seated, Easter Road had vast banks of {{terracing}} on three sides, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could hold crowds in excess of 60,000. The record attendance of 65,860, {{which is also a}} record for a football match played in Edinburgh, was set by an Edinburgh derby played on 2 January 1950. Such vast crowds were drawn by the success of the Famous Five.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in society}} and {{approaches}} towards education, including equal opportunities, has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is now recognised that all children deserve {{to have the same}} educational opportunities without singling out those who learn at a slower rate than others, thus every child has the opportunity to gain secondary school level qualifications or similar, regardless of background or intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not survive Henry's death. The other was his inability to control his sons and to force the other sons to accept Gruffydd as his successor.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you may suppose, I {{particularly}} inquired. Do {{you know}} what she had the cheek to tell me?" [...] Owen asked. [...] "She didn't better it much: she said she <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> excessively unnatural." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was ordered}} to attack Liverpool, but {{problems}} with night navigation <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> instead <b>it</b> bombed Tipton, Bradley, Wednesbury, and Walsall: killing over 30 people - including Julia Slater, Walsall's Lady Mayoress.|$|R
2500|$|The {{size of the}} {{territory}} of the tribe of Judah <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> in practice <b>it</b> had four distinct regions: ...|$|R
5|$|Detachment Lika was {{an ad hoc}} {{formation}} {{consisting of}} the 44th Infantry Regiment and one battery of the 17th Artillery Regiment. On 6 April, it was concentrating in the Otočac region, but the poor response of personnel of the 44th Infantry Regiment to the mobilisation orders <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only at 35–40 percent of its strength.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second lift arrived, the first supply drop was made onto LZ 'L'. Although most {{supplies}} arrived, {{only a small amount}} could be collected as the area was not under full British control. The poor radio communication <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not possible to alert the RAF and unsecured drop zones would be a major problem in the days to come.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would not have to}} be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I didn't know,' said Lactimel, meekly. 'Perhaps Fidus only <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> as <b>it</b> is one {{of those}} offices where the people have {{something}} to do, the commissioners couldn't be in their offices and in Parliament at the same time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She met {{him with}} the full memory {{of what he had}} tried--not an inch, not an ounce of which was lost to her. [...] "What I <b>meant</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> seems a hundred years ago." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} chutney {{being in the}} Caribbean has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> been {{in close contact with}} {{different}} peoples, traditions, and other musical styles since its inception. According to the government of Trinidad and Tobago, roughly 35% of the country's population is of Indian descent, another 34% of African descent, and the remaining 31% composed of a mix of European, Chinese, Middle Eastern, and other ancestry. This has allowed chutney to fuse with other genres and/or implement new instruments into its own style, creating an array of syncretic subgenres including ragga chutney, chutney-bhangra, chutney hip-hop, soca-bhangra, and chutney soca.|$|R
5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not properly recorded or published, and the exact {{facts of the}} argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it {{was not able to}} be considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E
5|$|Though Nenana also {{received}} heavy rain {{from the storm}} system that began the flood, its position further downstream on the Tanana River <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not receive the first effects of the flood until the 30th, when Alaska Railroad officials suspended operations south of Nenana due to track damage caused by rising water.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, all I <b>meant</b> was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn't {{the sort}} of thing I cared for myself. The public will eat it. Take it from me, the time is just about ripe for a revival of comic opera." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nettie laughed, {{and turned}} {{so that the}} lamplight touched her face. “Oh, I talk quite casually now and then. I <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> being Cuban <b>it</b> couldn’t be English.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Rollo, [...] "but what {{he really}} <b>meant</b> was, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be bad {{for her to get}} down from the steamer into the small boat at the landing. I am afraid that she will not like it, though I think <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be real good fun." ...|$|R
5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was possible to begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E
50|$|González {{has eight}} matches {{of the eleven}} matches than the team has played in total and in the Copa Chile. González also has played one and the only match for the copa chile against Deportes Antofagasta they lost 2-1 on <b>that</b> {{occasion}} <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> despite <b>it</b> lost a classic also was eliminated of the cup.|$|R
60|$|The Major decided, {{after some}} consideration, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> mantraps; <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> {{plotting}} and snaring; that Miss Tox was digging pitfalls. 'But you won't catch Joe, Ma'am,' said the Major. 'He's tough, Ma'am, tough, is J.B. Tough, and de-vilish sly!' over which reflection he chuckled {{for the rest}} of the day.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the reason}} for the {{terminology}} [...] "elementary charge": it is <b>meant</b> to imply <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is an indivisible unit of charge.|$|R
5|$|Morshead {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 10 October 1939 and was given the AIF serial number NX8. He was given the rank of colonel and made temporary brigadier three days later. A delay in preparing 18th Infantry Brigade's camp in the Hunter Region <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not concentrated there until December. In the meantime its battalions trained in their home states. After the 16th Infantry Brigade departed for Palestine in January 1940, the 18th Infantry Brigade moved into its vacated accommodation at Ingleburn, New South Wales. As a consequence, its training proceeded more slowly {{than that of the}} 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding and {{shortages}} of equipment in England <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was decided to}} keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter, during which time they would undertake further training in order {{to prepare them for}} their eventual use in the trenches in France. Despite this, however, the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received in this time could only be considered very rudimentary in nature, and despite popular opinion at the time, it did little to prepare them for what was to come.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{on top of}} a late Roman church, the cathedral, reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s, {{follows a}} cross-domed plan with a bell tower and a triple apse. Richly {{decorated}} on both the exterior and interior, its internal walls now feature modern frescoes, the presence of which has <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has not been reconsecrated. Though not active as a Christian place of worship, it has been open for visitors since 1985.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Michael's Birthday", Kevin gets {{tested for}} skin cancer, which takes the mood away from party festivities, much to Michael's displeasure. The results end up {{negative}} (though Michael thought <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he had <b>it).</b>|$|R
60|$|The clear rose colour {{crept into}} Grace's cheeks, {{and she did}} not trouble to prevent his seeing it. She knew what the simple {{admission}} <b>meant,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must have cost him toil incredible to make that journey with a double burden. It was for her he had borne it.|$|R
5|$|The {{advent of}} the {{southern}} winter and adverse ice conditions <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{more than three months}} before Shackleton was able to achieve the relief of the men at Elephant Island. His first attempt was with the British ship Southern Sky, then the government of Uruguay loaned him a ship, while searching on the Falkland Islands he found the ship Emma for his third attempt but the ship's engine blew, then finally, with the aid of the steam-tug Yelcho commanded by Luis Pardo, the entire party was brought to safety, reaching Punta Arenas in Chile on 3 September 1916.|$|E
5|$|Triton was {{discovered}} by William Lassell in 1846, just seventeen days after the discovery of Neptune. Nereid {{was discovered}} by Gerard P. Kuiper in 1949. The third moon, later named Larissa, was first observed by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen on May 24, 1981. The astronomers were observing a star's close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to those discovered around Uranus four years earlier. If rings were present, the star's luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planet's closest approach. The star's luminosity dipped only for several seconds, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was due to a moon rather than a ring.|$|E
5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} the Los Alamos Laboratory {{with the first}} significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be highly likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> intersects US 98, the {{designation}} of SR 298 is not <b>meant</b> to imply <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is an auxiliary route of US 98.|$|R

50|$|There was a 70-metre-long tunnel on a curve {{near the}} former Gmundbrücke station at Tristram Gorge until 1933/34, {{when it was}} {{converted}} into a cutting because the introduction of 4-axle carriages <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> its profile <b>it</b> was too small.|$|R
