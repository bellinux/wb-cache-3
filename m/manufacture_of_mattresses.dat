He published aggressive propaganda brochures pointing out that British workers were not to consider their contributions a form of charity while Spanish people were fighting and dying for their fellow workers. To answer a shortage of bandages and dressings in Spain, he recalled that in the First World War, sun dried peat moss sewn into muslin bags {{was used as a}} substitute for cotton dressings. Soon, moss collected by volunteers in Britain {{was on its way to}} Spain. Throughout this period Pyke was short-tempered with other supporters of the Spanish loyalists; at meetings, he could not understand why his own plans were not wholeheartedly supported by others; he was frequently loud and rude.|$|E

2500|$|J.W.Roberts Ltd. {{was founded}} in Armley in 1874 as a textile producer, {{primarily}} working with cotton, hemp and jute. By 1906, its factory on Canal Road, known as the Midland Works, specialised in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> asbestos insulation <b>mattresses</b> for steam locomotive boilers and {{is believed to have}} been one of only two factories in the world at the time which processed blue asbestos. In 1920 it merged with Turner Brothers Asbestos Company Ltd., Newalls Insulation Company Ltd., and the Washington Chemical Company Ltd., to form Turner & Newall Ltd., which in 1925 became a public company. T's rapid growth has been attributed to a product called [...] "Sprayed Limpet Asbestos", developed in the Armley works in 1931. This was made by mixing raw asbestos with water and cement, the resulting slurry being spray applicated on to the surface to be insulated, creating a cheap sound- and fireproof coating. Sprayed Limpet Asbestos generated huge profits for T who exported the product to 60 countries where it was applied to a wide range of buildings including schools, churches and theatres and also the London Underground. The factory at Armley closed in 1959.|$|R

The interface pressure around sacral region was measured infour types <b>of</b> <b>mattresses</b> with 0, 30, 45 and 70 degrees of bed-backrest lifting angle respectively: astandard mattress, an iris urethane mattress, an air mattress, and a maxi float mattress. The averages ofinterface pressures, maximum interface pressures and area supporting surfaces were measured by theuse of a pressure-sensitive sheet. Those averages with the different bed-backrest lifting angles and thefour types <b>of</b> <b>mattresses</b> were statistically examined by ANOVA. The three types of support surfacemattresses were compared with the standard mattress. The average values of interface pressures ofsupporting surface were significantly lower than those <b>of</b> the standard <b>mattress</b> (p < 0. 05), and also thearea of supporting surface <b>of</b> support surface <b>mattresses</b> were significantly wider than those <b>of</b> thestandard <b>mattress</b> (p < 0. 05).

Methods: this research is an observational analytic with cross sectional study. The objects are 15 kapok mattresses without any treatment, and the outcome are the population of HDM. Objects were selected by stratified random sampling technique. Data was analyzed by using simple linear regression. Results: coefficient correlation is 0. 905 (p= 0. 00). It shows that, there is positive strong relationship between the duration <b>of</b> kapok <b>mattress</b> using with the total population of HDM, which means, the longer kapok mattress in use will tend the population of HDM to increase. Conclusion: the longer kapok mattress in use will tend the population of HDM to increase in PJKA housing, Randusari Semarang. Key words: kapok mattress, HDM. ...|$|R
