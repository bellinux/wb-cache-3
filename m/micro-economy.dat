50|$|The beenz {{business}} model {{was based upon}} arbitrage. Companies purchased beenz from the company at a locally determined exchange rate. They could then award these to consumers for actions to which the issuer attached value, such as making on-line purchases. Beenz were collected by the user clicking on a Java Applet and entering their email address linked to a beenz account. Consumers were then able to use their beenz to purchase goods from on-line merchants. Each merchant was free to exchange beenz at any notional value they liked, the company assuming that the market would settle the exchange value of each beenz. Merchants were then able to sell beenz back to the company itself at a pre-defined exchange rate. The company made its margin on the spread between the sell and the buy price of beenz in the market. In the later stages, a professional economist was employed to model the behaviour of prices and flows of money in this <b>micro-economy,</b> and keep it healthy.|$|E
40|$|Securitization of immigration, {{the rise}} of {{interior}} immigration policing, and forces of carceral privatization have occasioned a remarkable expansion of immigrant detention throughout the United States. Previous studies have drawn attention {{to the importance of}} the daily rates paid by the federal government to individual facilities in driving the emphasis on detention. This paper, in contrast, argues that tracing the political and economic geography of money inside detention facilities is also critical for understanding detention expansion and its consequences. We define the processes, mechanisms, and practices of generating profit above and beyond the "per-bed" daily rate as "internal micro-economies" of migrant detention. Drawing on an ongoing examination of migrant detention facilities in the greater New York City metropolitan area, we identify four <b>micro-economies</b> evident in detention facilities: the commissary systems, phone and other forms of communication, detainee labor, and detainee excursions outside detention. These economies show how detained migrants' needs and daily routines are tailored in ways that produce migrants as both captive consumers and laborers. Recognition of multiple <b>micro-economies</b> also highlights the fact that the numbers of individuals and entities invested in the incarceration of immigrants proliferate in tandem with the objectification of detainees. The paper further suggests that attending to relationships embedded in the inner workings of detention exposes economic links across carceral boundaries, rendering visible the porosity between government, private companies, and publics...|$|R

30|$|However, thirdly, if {{through the}} lens of “financialization”, we look at certain <b>micro-economies</b> paying {{attention}} also to macroeconomic level data, we see profitability is high for what we refer to (after Rodrik, 2011) as “The Quaternary,” we see low profitability lies in manufacturing, services and – worst of all – agriculture. But productivity comes from selling Quaternaries to them. Thus it is innovation that enables restructuring and productivity growth, which are often constrained, to repeat, not on the supply side but on the demand side. So the developmental dilemma is that innovation is often undercut by lack of demand from its potential users in the real economy – the entrepreneurs. So, while government needs to evolve demand-inducing policies it may need to maintain its “embedded” autonomy from private interests. But it can elicit useful information from the “embedded” private sector by engagement with it. Such “embedded autonomy” (Evans, 1995) from the ground-up, may release demand impulses that help overcome developmental blockages, which is the aim of the following discussion.|$|R

The walnut planting pilot was initiated to assist the sustainability of the <b>micro-economy</b> of Gezhangla Village, Yunnan, by working with the community to evolve its agriculture and reduce its a dependency on tobacco. Jenny Chen, a student of Lingnan University, went to Yunnan for a preliminary study of the development of walnut planting program in Gezhangla Village from 30 December of 2012 to 5 January of 2013 and in the summer of 2013. Later, John Law, the Consultant of Strategy and Consulting of Deloitte China, also went to Yunnan with the service group from 15 to 18 September 2013 to follow up the project. During the trip, he also interviewed a number of farmers, school principals and teachers in the villages to collect more research data. This report was compiled in joint efforts by Deloitte China and Lingnan University, which combines the observations and findings of walnut trees planting obtained during the service trip, and summarizes the development and progress of walnut planting in Yunnan villages.

In {{order to make the}} university more efficient, concerned, adapt it to the use of new technologies incoming and make it more innovative Professor Shuo-Yan Chou among other professors came to the idea of creating a Smart Campus. This project involves interdepartmental efforts, ideas and new technologies to reach the main goal. Some of the projects concerning this Smart Campus are faced in developing apps to report maintenance problems; others want to use new technologies such as machine learning to facilitate the study of human flow; and other projects want to improve energy consumption by monitoring the usage of water dispensers. This particular project sought the objective of creating a rewarding system and a microeconomy sharing society to be implemented in the smart campus. According to that, applying the newest technologies is the key point. For the past few years, the technology of blockchain has been in upswing. This technology breaks with the centralized systems of nowadays to reach a decentralized network with peer-to-peer communication. Furthermore, blockchain enables users to create and use smart contracts that, among all of their characteristics, highlight the possibility of the creation of a token/cryptocurrency to be exchanged. After a deep research in blockchain, a first brief introduction to the main characteristics of it is given to the reader. When the basic concepts of this revolutionary technology have been achieved, it is time to apply blockchain to the rewarding system project. To do so, a private network based on the Ethereum Platform has been created. This network is sustained by a certain number of computers, working as nodes, that verify transactions happening across the network. Once the blockchain is created, the project goes through the creation of a token (named NTUSToken) that is given as a reward for making some good practices and is interchangeable by the students, giving them the sense of a <b>micro-economy</b> society based on the token. On this private blockchain, users can create accounts, transfer tokens and check their balances. Finally, the last key point of the project is to make this system handy and attractive to users. As blockchain is not a trivial technology to understand, users {{have to be able to}} register, log in to their accounts and share tokens without the necessity of knowing the technology behind it. For this purpose, a browser application connected to the private network has been created.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a hydrogen transport economy based on renewable energy sources is {{seen by many as}} the ultimate sustainable transport solution. However, dimensioning of hydrogen production systems is complex: renewable energy sources are stochastic in nature, requiring the collection of empirical datasets relating to weather patterns on a daily, seasonal and annual basis; and hydrogen production is characterised by sensitivity to operating conditions and diversity in the performance of the component parts. A probabilistic model is developed for dimensioning of hydrogen production systems that removes the reliance on the collection of empirical datasets and the requirement for detailed performance characterisation of component parts. The model utilises well known correlations and distribution modelling techniques to predict energy output from either a photovoltaic array or wind turbine and hence the number of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) that could be supported on an annual basis. The model was implemented in MatLab and simulation results were compared with existing empirical based studies. Through simulation, limitations of the model were investigated and discussed. It was shown that the model was able to predict the number of FCEVs supported to within 10 % (solar pathway) and 22 % (wind pathway) for those studies investigated. These results are in alignment with the intention of the model as a first stage tool for the dimensioning of renewable hydrogen energy transport <b>micro-economies...</b>|$|R

This thesis presents a specialized investigation, in context of Tanzania, of the primary paradigmatic approaches to electrification - centralized, large-scale grid systems conceived through least-cost-planning; and decentralized, small-scale off-grid systems administered through entrepreneurial pilots. My thesis offers a new paradigm, a mid-scale opportunistic and pluralistic planning paradigm, to address the dynamic economic, social, environmental and political issues that have constrained the efficacy of the extant approaches to electrification. The paradigm draws upon my investigative understanding of the critical theoretical threads that inform the complex fabric of electricity sector development - energy economics, social science, conceptualized and technical planning, and climate change theories. Additionally, the midscale opportunistic and pluralistic planning paradigm weaves in my practical understanding of the various resources that are currently available and can be leveraged to advance electrification, particularly for communities within isolated rural regions. Using Tanzania as a case study, the paradigm proposes a new way to think about and actualize a sustainable development path towards electrification in Sub-Saharan African countries that are experiencing rapid changes in macro and <b>micro-economies,</b> population demography and migration, and signs of climate change. by Sarah Dimson.

The study examines import statistics and coordinates with government leaders and business managers as stakeholders to eventually generate and recommend a business model to restructure supply chains to the advantage of islanders. Through the study, the research classifies Pohnpei as a “Goldilocks Island State”, where demand exists, but in quantities too small to effectively service through traditional resource strategies. The research suggests the recommended 3 D printing business model may have applications in other locations where long-distance replacement part sourcing can cause significant economic strains/drains for <b>micro-economies.</b> The study reviews available 3 D printing technologies, identifies the role of density in import substitution, and makes suggestions for the technology’s promise in Pohnpei for such industries as industrial components, automotive/marine and dental replacements.

40|$|The North Ethiopian Highlands, {{located at}} the northernmost limit of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, are a ‘hotspot’ of {{vulnerability}} to land degradation and climatic changes. The interplays between climatic vulnerability and forest cover changes in this region caused declining water availability and increased soil erosion, which strongly affects livelihood conditions. Therefore, integrated catchment management activities are implemented, such as the creation of exclosures, to mitigate ongoing land degradation. Exclosures are naturally regenerated areas from which livestock and uncontrolled wood cutting are excluded. Communal cost-benefit evaluation of exclosures shows highly positive outcomes, as they store green water, carbon, soil and nutrients. The aim of this project is to improve rural household income status for landless farmers in the Highlands of Dogua Tembien, by creating added value derived from woodland restoration and woodland ecosystem services development provided by exclosures. Forest restoration is key to support land and climate resilience, as above-ground biomass and forest soils represent a huge reservoir for carbon storage. Smart ecosystem management and enrichment planting of exclosures will deliver increased green water downstream for croplands, increased biomass for livestock feeding and high-value non-timber forest products that can stimulate <b>micro-economies.</b> Non-timber forest products are valuable commodities derived from forests {{that do not require}} logging of the trees.

40|$|Posters on Market Development, Financing Distribution - Using {{renewable}} energy in a sustainable and holistic manner {{as a tool}} to eradicate rural poverty in AfricaRural poverty in developing countries is a social problem that is well recognized and causes concern globally. The UN recently met to review the MDG's and acknowledge that there was limited progress to date; a looming target date have highlighted the difficulty in addressing development issues on the ground where people are trying to survive, often on as little as $ 2 per day or less. This paper demonstrates the model of rural village energy services centres by using solar energy to provide solution to most of the problems of a typical African rural village. This stand alone system provides energy services solution leveraging sustainable resources in a holistic, community-integrated fashion to improve health, information, communication, education and preserving the environment while it kick-starts <b>micro-economies</b> in rural villages. It intends to increase productivity and ultimately eradicate poverty. This solution is still in a prototype stage but has its special interest because it hopes to provide clean water and biogas apart from the solar generated electricity. Through the implementation of community energy services, stand alone decentralised solutions intend to divert rural current expenditure on kerosene, offering significant reductions in carbon emissions, environmental damage and respiratory-illness related deaths which were recently estimated at 1. 6 M per annum worldwide as per a World Bank report. This corresponding increase in energy efficiency drives an increase in productivity and thus a step closer to the realization of the MDGs as has been documented in various case studies (Annual Report 2008 (.

This paper covers the technology implementation starting from demand until it reaches the level of success which then makes it suitable for replication. Rural poverty in developing countries is a social problem that is well recognized and causes concern globally. The UN recently met to review the MDG's and acknowledge that there was limited progress to date; a looming target date have highlighted the difficulty in addressing development issues on the ground where people are trying to survive, often on as little as $ 2 per day or less. This paper demonstrates the model of rural village energy services centres by using solar energy to provide solution to most of the problems of a typical African rural village. This stand alone system provides energy services solution leveraging sustainable resources in a holistic, community-integrated fashion to improve health, information, communication, education and preserving the environment while it kick-starts <b>micro-economies</b> in rural villages. It intends to increase productivity and ultimately eradicate poverty. This solution is still in a prototype stage but has its special interest because it hopes to provide clean water and biogas apart from the solar generated electricity. Through the implementation of community energy services, stand alone decentralised solutions intend to divert rural current expenditure on kerosene, offering significant reductions in carbon emissions, environmental damage and respiratory-illness related deaths which were recently estimated at 1. 6 M per annum worldwide as per a World Bank report. This corresponding increase in energy efficiency drives an increase in productivity and thus a step closer to the realization of the MDGs as has been documented in various case studies (Annual Report 2008 (.

40|$|Master thesis {{development}} management- University of Agder, 2015 This modified, participatory {{action research}} study investigates {{the potential for}} 3 D printing for development (3 DP 4 D) on the remote Pacific island of Pohnpei (The Federated States of Micronesia), specifically {{in an attempt to}} visualize opportunities for the technology to affect the state and national trade imbalance. The study examines import statistics and coordinates with government leaders and business managers as stakeholders to eventually generate and recommend a business model to restructure supply chains to the advantage of islanders. Through the study, the research classifies Pohnpei as a “Goldilocks Island State”, where demand exists, but in quantities too small to effectively service through traditional resource strategies. The research suggests the recommended 3 D printing business model may have applications in other locations where long-distance replacement part sourcing can cause significant economic strains/drains for <b>micro-economies.</b> The study reviews available 3 D printing technologies, identifies the role of density in import substitution, and makes suggestions for the technology’s promise in Pohnpei for such industries as industrial components, automotive/marine and dental replacements. The study asserts that certain revolutionary new factors such as bioplastics and recycled materials are sustainable game-changers for remote locations, and recognizes great potential to positively affect the trade imbalance that lies in domestic agricultural policy. Finally, with 3 D printing comes the opportunity to bring limited manufacturing capabilities, which along with utilizing locally available resources, can permit a type of insurance buffer as a hedge against international traders, especially for outerislands where it has historically been impossible for government to provide a full range of services...|$|R
