25|$|Significant {{cross-cultural}} variation {{has been}} observed in strong reciprocity behavior. In 2001, dictator game experiments were run in a 15 small scale societies across the world. The results of the experiments showed dramatic variation, with some groups mean offer as little as 26% and some as great as 58%. The pattern of receiver results was also interesting, with some participants in some cultures rejecting offers above 50%. Henrich and colleagues determined that the best predictors of dictator game allocations were {{the size of the}} group (small groups giving less) and <b>market</b> <b>integration</b> (the more involved with markets, the more participants gave). This study was then repeated with a different 15 small scale societies and with better measures of <b>market</b> <b>integration,</b> finding a similar pattern of results.

25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} impact of <b>market</b> <b>integration</b> on union density or on workers themselves, {{organized}} labor has been engaged {{in a variety of}} strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.|$|E
25|$|Unions {{have made}} some {{attempts}} to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing {{is not a new}} phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change. Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread <b>market</b> <b>integration.</b> Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.|$|E
500|$|The early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, in {{the sense}} of using money as a way to express prices and debts. The sestertius (plural sestertii, English [...] "sesterces", symbolized as HS) was the basic unit of {{reckoning}} value into the 4th century, though the silver denarius, worth four sesterces, was used also for accounting beginning in the Severan dynasty. The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as (plural asses), one-fourth sestertius. Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia, [...] "money," [...] and were used only on the frontiers for transacting business or buying property. Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face, not for its metal content. This tendency towards fiat money led eventually to the debasement of Roman coinage, with consequences in the later Empire. The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and <b>market</b> <b>integration.</b> The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving.|$|E

It turns out that for both regimes, welfare is higher under high – than under low financial <b>markets</b> <b>integration,</b> yet the difference between high – and low integration is less pronounced for a monetary union. Thus, a monetary union has a comparative advantage under low financial <b>markets</b> <b>integration</b> whereas the opposite holds under high integration.

Moreover, under the benchmark parametrization, the degree of financial <b>markets</b> <b>integration</b> is pivotal for the absolute welfare ranking of the two regimes.
