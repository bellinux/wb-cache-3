Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans from the majority white American population. 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen.

5|$|Current {{official}} transit <b>maps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
5|$|During Western Han, the Chancellor was {{the chief}} civil official.

The Western Han Chancellor oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, <b>maps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire's territories, annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the government budget. The Chancellor could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-dan or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government. The Chancellor was {{held responsible for the}} actions of officials he recommended and appointed, yet he could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.|$|E

5|$|Following President John F.

The staffed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of unstaffed and staffed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar flight, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first staffed mission to lunar orbit. The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|From 21 June, the 2/12th Commando Squadron {{conducted}} patrols of {{the outlying}} areas of Labuan to clear them of any Japanese forces; {{up to this}} point the squadron had formed part of the 9th Division's reserve.

During these patrols the squadron killed 27 Japanese soldiers, mainly as part of repelling a raid on the BBCAU compound on 24 June, and captured a single prisoner. The 2/12th Commando Squadron was subsequently directed to undertake topographic work in order {{to improve the quality of}} <b>maps</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island.
