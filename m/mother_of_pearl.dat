5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl.</b>|$|E
5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes or writing cases.

25|$|The Manteños {{were the}} last of the pre-Columbian {{cultures}} in the coastal region and flourished between 600–1534. They were the first to witness the arrival of Spanish ships sailing in the surrounding Pacific Ocean. According to archaeological evidence and Spanish chronicles, the civilization extended from Bahia de Caraquez to Cerro de Hojas in the south. They were excellent weavers, produced textiles, articles of gold, silver spondylus shells and <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearls.</b> The manteños mastered the seas and forged extensive trade routes as far as present-day Chile to the south and western Mexico to the north.

5|$|Molluscs {{have been}} and still are an {{important}} food source for anatomically modern humans. However {{there is a risk}} of food poisoning from toxins which can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl,</b> Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl</b> inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E

5|$|After AD 700 {{the pyramid}} served an {{important}} funerary function. Three elite burials have been excavated from the pyramid, two males and a female, accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings. The offerings include polychrome ceramics and objects crafted from shell, conch and <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl</b> that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. These associated finds are of sufficient quality {{that it is}} possible that the deceased were members of the royal family. The burials have been dated to the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII, who ruled from AD 769 to 794. During the Terminal Classic some minor changes were made to the temple chambers and there may have been structural reinforcement of the front of the temple. Although it is poorly preserved, the inside of the temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl.</b> In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{in an attempt}} to clarify bacterial influence in producing cultured pearls. Judging from the infection tests of bacteria which were isolated from diseased mother shells with or without nuclei, it seems that bacteria play some role in the mortality <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> shells, the formation of waste, baroque or muddy pearls, and the falling out of the inserted nuclei. Presumably, these facts are considered as a sort of putrefactive phenomenon on caused by bacteria in abiotic environment, where bacteria are apt to develop around the nucleus inserted by operation. It is reasonably certain that the physical condition <b>of</b> <b>mother</b> shells {{is an important factor in}} connection with the bacterial injury in cultivating the <b>mother</b> shells <b>of</b> <b>pearls.</b> The description was made on the general characteristics of three types of bacteria, which seem responsible for the phenomena mentioned above, and also on the results of their inhibitory tests with antibiotics. 真珠漁場に見られる異常貝から分離した細菌を用い,創傷・経口・注射・汚染核による接種試験を行ない,斃死・泌み珠あるいは脱核などの一部の原因は疲労衰弱した母貝の,挿核周辺部にできやすい非生的環境内の一種の腐敗現象によるものと考えた. あわせて,これらに関係する細菌の性状と,抗生物質による発育阻止濃度について記載した...|$|R

25|$|In 1905 the {{congregation}} engaged Louis Comfort Tiffany to redecorate the sanctuary. Tiffany headed {{a group of}} artisans called the Associated Artists who worked largely in a style now described as the Aesthetic Movement. Tiffany {{was a part of}} an emerging American view of design in the United States, increasingly taking fewer cues from Europe. Tiffany had decorated Mark Twain's home in Hartford, Connecticut, the state rooms at the White House, and several Back Bay homes. In some ways Tiffany was an expected choice to redecorate Old South. He followed many of the ideas of John Ruskin; he believed in the dignity and importance of the human hand and eye in the decorative arts. Yet Tiffany arrived at Old South at a time when his gilded age style had begun a decline. A new wave of neoclassicism called Beaux-Arts, and the Colonial Revival style were replacing Victorian ornament with a simpler classicism. Theodore Roosevelt's 1902 White House renovation removed all of the Tiffany influence. In Tiffany's redecoration, Old South's stained glass windows were covered by insets of translucent tinted purple glass. The original polychrome stenciled plaster walls were painted purple, then stenciled in a series of geometric patterns with metallic silver paint intended to appear as <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>pearl</b> inlay. Similar to Tiffany's work at Mark Twain's Hartford, Connecticut home, or his design for the White House's Red Room. The resulting work at Old South was a highly ornamneted visual experience, unified by a limited color palette.|$|E
