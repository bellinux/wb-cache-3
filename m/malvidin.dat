25|$|Analysis of {{polyphenols}} in chokeberries {{has identified}} the following individual chemicals (among hundreds known {{to exist in}} the plant kingdom): cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside, quercetin-3-glycoside, epicatechin, caffeic acid, delphinidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and <b>malvidin.</b> All these except caffeic acid are members of the flavonoid category of phenolics.|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{occurring in}} nature are the glycosides of cyanidin, delphinidin, <b>malvidin,</b> pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin. Roughly 2% of all hydrocarbons fixed in photosynthesis are converted into flavonoids and their derivatives, {{such as the}} anthocyanins. Not all land plants contain anthocyanin; in the Caryophyllales (including cactus, beets, and amaranth), they are replaced by betalains.

40|$|Chronic low-grade {{inflammation}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the pathogenesis of obesity, due to its associated chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases and cancer. Thus, targeting inflammation is an attractive strategy to counter the burden of obesity-induced health problems. Recently, food-derived bioactive compounds have been spotlighted as a regulator against various chronic diseases due to their low toxicity, as opposed to drugs that induce severe side effects. Here we describe the beneficial effects of dietary anthocyanins on obesity-induced metabolic disorders and inflammation. Red cabbage microgreen, blueberry, blackcurrant, mulberry, cherry, black elderberry, black soybean, chokeberry and jaboticaba peel contain a variety of anthocyanins including cyanidins, delphinidins, <b>malvidins,</b> pelargonidins, peonidins and petunidins, and have been reported to alter both metabolic markers and inflammatory markers in cells, animals, and humans. This review discusses the interplay between inflammation and obesity, and their subsequent regulation via the use of dietary anthocyanins, suggesting an alternative dietary strategy to ameliorate obesity and obesity associated chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Overconsumption {{of energy}} dense foods and {{sedentary}} lifestyle are considered as major causes of obesity-associated insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. Results from both cohort studies and randomized trials suggested that anthocyanins from berries may lower metabolic risks, however these reports are equivocal. The {{present study was}} designed to examine effects of six berries with structurally diverse anthocyanin profiles (normalized to 400 µg/g total anthocyanin content) on development of metabolic risk factors in the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse model of polygenic obesity. Diets supplemented with blackberry (mono-glycosylated cyanidins), black raspberry (acylated mono-glycosylated cyanidins), blackcurrant (mono- and di-glycosylated cyanidins and delphinidins), maqui berry (di-glycosylated delphinidins), Concord grape (acylated mono-glycosylated delphinidins and petunidins), and blueberry (mono-glycosylated delphinidins, <b>malvidins,</b> and petunidins) showed a prominent discrepancy between biological activities of delphinidin/malvidin-versus cyanidin-type anthocyanins that could be explained by differences in their structure and metabolism in the gut. Consumption of berries also resulted in a strong shift in the gastrointestinal bacterial communities towards obligate anaerobes that correlated with decrease in the gastrointestinal luminal oxygen and oxidative stress. Further work is needed to understand mechanisms that lead to nearly anoxic conditions in the gut lumens, including the relative contributions of host, diet and/or microbial oxidative activity, and their implication to human health...|$|R

A red variant was also developed by breeding at the University of New Hampshire. The orange-coloured flowers have a higher concentration of pelargonidin pigment, while blue flowers have a higher concentration of <b>malvidin.</b> The red-coloured flowers are due to the relative concentrations of delphinidin and <b>malvidin</b> pigments.

Around 3, 3, and 2% of the anthocyanins or anthocyanidins are labeled as 3-desoxyanthocyanidins, rare methylatedanthocyanidins, and 6-hydroxyanthocyanidins, respectively.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{a team of}} Spanish {{scientists}} led by Maria Rosa Guasch-Jané {{developed a}} new method of identifying an acid left by compounds in red wine.

50|$|Color {{stabilization}} of <b>malvidin</b> 3-glucoside {{at a higher}} pH {{can be explained by}} self-aggregation of the flavylium cation and copigmentation with the Z-chalcone form. In the presence of procyanidin C2, the red color of oenin appears more stable. However, the HPLC chromatogram shows a decrease in the amplitude of the peaks of oenin and procyanidin C2. Concomitantly, a new peak appears with a maximal absorption in the red region. This newly formed pigment probably comes from the condensation of oenin and procyanidin C2.|$|E
50|$|Petunidin (Pt), like Europinidin and <b>Malvidin,</b> {{is derived}} from Delphinidin and is an O-methylated {{anthocyanidin}} of the 3-hydroxy type. It is a natural organic compound, a dark-red or purple water-soluble pigment found in many redberries including chokeberries (Aronia sp), Saskatoon berries (Amelanchier alnifolia) or different species of grape (for instance Vitis vinifera, or muscadine, Vitis rotundifolia), and {{also part of the}} pigments responsible for the petal colors in many flowers.
