5000|$|... (The <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> {{is visible}} in that shot because on the VHS, where the film's {{original}} 1.85:1 aspect ratio is compromised and cropped to a TV ratio of 1.33:1, the viewer sees more vertical information than the director intended.) ...|$|R
50|$|Lehr {{appeared}} in the first ad, in which the caveman is a worker holding a <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> {{on the set of}} a television commercial. He gets upset about the tenor of the commercial and its demeaning comments about cavemen, and storms off the set.|$|R
50|$|The set {{lighting}} {{was entirely}} incandescent and the audio was recorded on a <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> {{instead of the}} more modern body mikes or ADR. These decisions, combined with the limited coverage, allowed the rough cut to be produced in two days after wrapping up filming.|$|R
5000|$|Pete did {{not appear}} in the episode [...] "The Farm".

25|$|At Paramount, Arzner {{directed}} Clara Bow's first talkie, The Wild Party (1929). To allow Bow to {{move freely}} on the set, Arzner had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod, essentially creating the first <b>boom</b> <b>mike.</b> She did not, however, take out a patent. One year later one was filed for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the Fox Film Corporation. Although {{not the first to}} patent the boom microphone, Arzner is still credited with its invention.|$|R
25|$|No {{home video}} release has yet {{featured}} the film's original theatrical aspect ratio. Plan 9 was composed and shot for 1.85:1 aspect ratio theatrical projection, the predominant widescreen format. As unskilled a filmmaker as Ed Wood was, even he never intended for his film {{to be seen}} in a 1.33:1 open matte aspect ratio, as all home video editions have been. This has led to various <b>boom</b> <b>mikes</b> and edges of props, etc., being seen at {{the top and bottom of}} the image, which was always intended to be cropped, thus unfairly maligning the film yet further.|$|R
2500|$|She {{was largely}} unknown nationally until {{the eve of}} the U.S.-led Invasion of Iraq in 2003. On her way out of a meeting on February 26, 2003, in a media scrum Parrish was overheard on a <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> saying, [...] "Damn Americans, I hate those bastards!" [...] She later told the media that her {{comments}} were directed towards George W. Bush and his administration and not the American people as a whole. Members of the opposition Canadian Alliance party called for her to be punished by then Liberal leader and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, but no disciplinary action occurred.|$|R
2500|$|FOX's network {{television}} comedy, [...] "MADtv", has frequently spoofed the Rudy Ray Moore-created franchise Dolemite, {{with a series}} of sketches performed by comic actor Aries Spears, in the role of [...] "The Son of Dolemite". Other sketches include the characters [...] "Funkenstein", [...] "Dr. Funkenstein" [...] and more recently Condoleezza Rice as a blaxploitation superhero. A recurring theme in these sketches is the inexperience of the cast and crew in the blaxploitation era, with emphasis on ridiculous scripting and shoddy acting, sets, costumes, and editing. The sketches are testaments to the poor production quality of the films, with obvious <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> appearances and intentionally poor cuts and continuity.|$|R
60|$|Mike re-read {{this letter}} in the train that took him to London. By this time Psmith would know that his {{was not the only}} case in which Commerce was <b>booming.</b> <b>Mike</b> had written to him by return, telling him of the {{disaster}} which had befallen the house of Jackson. Mike wished he could have told him in person, for Psmith had a way of treating unpleasant situations as if he were merely playing at them for his own amusement. Psmith's attitude towards the slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune was to regard them with a bland smile, as if they were part of an entertainment got up for his express benefit.|$|R

Only then can the true range of human personality dynamics – the love and hope and sex and dreams side of life – come forth. ...|$|R

500|$|... "Vandalism" [...] {{was written}} by supervising {{producer}} Owen Ellickson, making it his third writing credit for the series. It was directed by Lee Kirk. This marks his first directorial entry for the series, although he had previously guest starred as the minor character Clark in the sixth season episode [...] "The Delivery". Kirk is also Fischer's husband. The episode guest stars Diamantopoulos as Brian the <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> operator, his third appearance after the preceding two episodes. Proksch returns as Nate, as does Kaplan as Val. This is the first episode to feature Henke as Frank. Daniels had teased {{in an interview that}} one character would be fired from the show [...] "in Episode 15". Although [...] "Vandalism" [...] was the fourteenth episode aired, it was actually the fifteenth produced, based on production numbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} screen {{ratio for}} television broadcasts was 4:3 (1.33:1). When preparing {{a film that}} was originally intended to be displayed in widescreen for television broadcast the material was often edited with the sides truncated, using techniques such as Center cut or pan and scan. Sometimes, {{in the case of}} Super 35, the full film negative was shown unmasked on TV (i.e., with the hard matte removed), however this causes the 4:3 image not to be what the director intended the audience to see - and sometimes <b>boom</b> <b>mikes,</b> edited out of the shot when the picture is matted, can be visible. Modern widescreen televisions feature a 16:9 (and occasionally 16:10) aspect ratio, allowing them to display a 16:9 widescreen picture without letterboxing (or with a minimal letterbox in the case of 16:10).|$|R
5000|$|... "Pour It Up" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Andy Kellman of AllMusic called it [...] "convincing", writing that [...] "she's at her best when she's flaunting". Kellman {{also noted that}} [...] "Pour It Up" [...] is [...] "a characteristically chilly and <b>booming</b> <b>Mike</b> Will collaboration", also praising [...] "Rihanna's trash talk", writing that [...] "it's something else". Jon Caramanica of New York Times commented that, [...] "it sounds like a track the ambient-goth outfit Salem might make for a strip club." [...] Alex Macpherson of Fact wrote that on 'Pour It Up', [...] "Rihanna goes through mere scornful contempt and terrifies with her blank, relentless focus." [...] Caryn Ganz of Spin called it [...] "moody and murky". Andrew Hampp of Billboard named it [...] "an irresistible, Mike WiLL-produced banger for the ladies." ...|$|R
5000|$|A.O. Scott of The New York Times {{considered}} Black Dynamite {{would be}} a better [...] "five-minute clip on YouTube" [...] than a feature film. Scott wrote, [...] "A <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> drifts down into the frame; an actor recites stage directions along with his lines. The camera zooms, pans and shifts focus as if it were being wielded by an optometrist on a cocaine binge. The acting is stiff, the dialogue painfully self-conscious, the action sequences choreographed and edited to look as cartoonish as possible. All of which is fun, for a while, in an academic kind of way." [...] In a 2012 interview, [...] "Black Dynamite" [...] responded to Scott, saying [...] "Well, obviously A.O. stands for 'asshole’s opinion,' ‘cause we here talking about it right now. Damn movie’s been tweeted about every two minutes since 2009." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 1988, he was arraigned on {{criminal}} charges for allegedly attacking a gay guest on his show, in a never-aired segment. In another lawsuit, {{he was accused}} of slandering a newscaster (a former colleague), and of indecently exposing himself to her and slapping her. Downey punched Stuttering John during an interview done for The Howard Stern Show, while also shouting verbal insults at John, referring to him as an [...] "uneducated slob". The situation then began to evolve into a brawl between the two until Downey had to be pulled off of John by security; the entire incident was caught on camera. When an Inside Edition camera crew approached Downey in 1989 to question him about his involvement in an alleged business scam, Downey grabbed the <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> and struck the soundman's head with it.|$|R
5000|$|Cincinnati {{scored on}} its first possession, when Andy Dalton threw to A. J. Green for an 82-yard touchdown. The Lions tied it later {{in the first quarter}} on a 3-yard TD pass from Matthew Stafford to Brandon Pettigrew. A 36-yard field goal by David Akers gave the Lions a 10-7 second quarter lead. But late in the quarter, Akers had a 34-yard field goal attempt blocked by Carlos Dunlap, which the Bengals {{returned}} {{all the way to the}} Lions 40 yard line despite fumbling during the return. That set up a 12-yard TD strike from Andy Dalton to Marvin Jones just before the first half closed, giving Cincinnati a 14-10 lead. The teams exchanged TD passes in the third quarter. First, Dalton hit Tyler Eifert for a 32-yard TD, and Stafford followed shortly after with a 27-yard TD toss to Calvin Johnson. Mike Nugent connected on a 48-yard field goal late in the third to put the Bengals up 24-17. The Lions tied the game at 24 in the fourth quarter, when Calvin Johnson leaped up and beat three Bengals defenders in the end zone on a 50-yard pass from Matthew Stafford. After the game, Stafford called Johnson's play [...] "one of the best catches I have ever seen." [...] Late in the fourth quarter, a punt by the Bengals Kevin Huber pinned the Lions at their own 6 yard line. Detroit attempted to kill enough clock to get the game to overtime, but could only gain one first down and 17 yards. Detroit punter Sam Martin then shanked a punt that netted only 28 yards before going out of bounds at the Cincinnati 49 with 26 seconds left in the game. Three plays and 15 yards later, <b>Mike</b> Nugent <b>boomed</b> a 54-yard field goal as time expired to give the Bengals a 27-24 victory.|$|R

Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one.

5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Longpigs, Hawley {{released}} two albums, The Sun Is Often Out and Mobile Home. After the demise of the band, he joined Pulp as a touring guitarist while also working as a session musician. During his time with both bands he was able to [...] "quietly hone" [...] his songwriting skills, citing that [...] "I was never really very good about bleating on about being a songwriter". Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Cocker and Mackey urged Hawley to record the material. He used some left-over studio time to demo material and to experiment. Pointing out that [...] "I just wanted to make something gentle for myself - I never expected it to be released". He recorded a song per day, recording most of the instruments himself [...] "with a <b>boom</b> <b>mike</b> in the middle so I could walk between instruments - I mixed it in my head". His eponymous debut was a mini-album that featured seven songs and released in April 2001 through Setanta Records. It was supported by the single [...] "Coming Home". While Hawley played [...] "90% of the stuff" [...] he was assisted by former Longpigs drummer Andy Cook and Colin Elliot, who became his long-term producer. He later commented that [...] "I think with anybody's early stuff you can batter it and take things apart. With doing those early records I was trying to get back to a way of being creative with recording rather than taking this dogmatic approach to it". He admitted that he didn't get [...] "it right every time but I got what I wanted to achieve. It was to try and find something in the song. And also, with those early records, there was no money". Clash Magazine described it as [...] "a rather brief burst of seven mid-paced, ’50s-flecked moments of jangle. Listening back now, it’s easy to spot the early signs of the grandeur that was to come, especially on standout [...] "Sunlight" [...] amongst these tentative 22 and a half minutes". The cover of the album was shot in front of a bingo hall in Cleethorpes.|$|R
