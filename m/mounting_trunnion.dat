50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} (also {{known as a}} wobbler in the US) is a simple steam-engine design that requires no valve gear. Instead the cylinder rocks, or oscillates, as the crank-shaft moves the piston, pivoting in the <b>mounting</b> <b>trunnion</b> so that ports in the cylinder line up with ports in a fixed port face alternately to direct steam into {{or out of the}} cylinder.|$|E
50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder {{steam engine}} is {{a variant of}} the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam {{into and out of the}} cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot <b>mounting</b> (<b>trunnion).</b> These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.|$|E
5000|$|The steam {{needs to}} be fed into {{the end of the}} {{cylinder}} {{at just the right time}} in the cycle to push the piston in the correct direction. In the other direction, the steam {{needs to be}} allowed to escape from the cylinder. As the crankshaft rotates, the piston rod moves up and down (or side to side in the case of a vertical cylinder) as well as in and out. Because the piston rod is rigid and the piston itself is long relative to its diameter, this causes the cylinder to rock, or [...] "oscillate" [...] on its special <b>mounting</b> (<b>trunnion).</b> In the design usually found in a toy or model engine, a hole in the side of the cylinder (one at each end for a double-acting cylinder) and a pair of holes in the port block are arranged so that this rocking motion lines up the holes at the correct times, allowing steam to enter the cylinder in one direction and to escape into the atmosphere or condenser in the other direction.|$|E
50|$|The thermally-insulated vessel is <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions,</b> and {{designed}} to endure extremely high temperatures, as well as keeping the metal in a molten state over extended periods of time. The vessel can be pivoted along its longitudinal axis to empty the pig iron into a ladle. The name {{is derived from the}} vessel's resemblance to a torpedo.|$|R
25|$|Despite the railroad's {{incomplete}} state, {{the first}} paying customers started riding on August 14, 1868, {{and the construction}} reached the summit in July 1869. The early locomotives all had vertical boilers, like many stationary steam engines of the time; the boilers were <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions</b> allowing them to be held vertically {{no matter what the}} gradient of the track. Later designs introduced horizontal boilers, slanted so that they remain close to horizontal on the steeply graded track.|$|R
2500|$|Opened in January 1891, {{the first}} Madison Street Bridge was a swing bridge which pivoted {{on a large}} central <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounted</b> on a piling {{structure}} in the river. [...] The bridge was poorly designed. [...] At {{the time of the}} accident, the bridge was owned by the City of Portland.|$|R
5000|$|In firearms, {{the barrel}} is {{sometimes}} <b>mounted</b> in a <b>trunnion,</b> {{which in turn}} is mounted in the receiver. This usage is common for tubular or pressed metal frame guns, such as the AK-47, G3, PPSh-41, Sten, Uzi and others, in which case the BATFE refers to the trunnion as a [...] "mounting block".|$|R

50|$|Pivot mounts —Absorb {{force on}} the {{cylinder}} centerline and let the cylinder change alignment in one plane. Common types include clevises, <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> and spherical bearings. Because these mounts allow a cylinder to pivot, they should be used with rod-end attachments that also pivot. Clevis mounts {{can be used in}} any orientation and are generally recommended for short strokes and small- to medium-bore cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} fitted with an {{autonomous}} navigation and gun laying dynamic reference unit (DRU) <b>mounted</b> on the <b>trunnion.</b> All main turret functions {{are controlled by}} a Turret Control Computer (TCC) with control and display units for the No 1 (Detachment Commander), No 2 (loader) and No 3 (layer). The combination of the DRU, TCC and powered laying controls provide autolaying. Every gun is fitted with a radar Muzzle Velocity Measuring Device. Reversionary mode laying uses deflection laying via the direct fire sight.|$|R
2500|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{examples}} {{were installed}} in Cornish mines {{by the end of}} the century, but these were usually of the single-rod type, which was perceived as safer in use. When cable operated winding gear became available the man engines continued in use, particularly in cases where the mineshaft was not truly vertical and winding engines drawing suspended cages could not be used; with the provision of a few well-placed rollers, and “fend offs” <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions,</b> the rods could reach the bottom of a shaft even at a substantial deviation from the vertical. Economics also played a part: the rods needed for pumping could be used for this extra function at little increased cost. Even when skips or kibbles were used in such shafts, (running on [...] "skipways") the tipping motion would make them impractical for carrying men.|$|R
50|$|Daniel French's {{steam engine}} and drive train were {{substantially}} different from Fulton's. By employing Oliver Evans' patented (1804) high pressure steam principle, French increased {{the power of}} his engine. By omitting the condensing of steam French reduced problems with construction and also reduced the weight of his engine. He also eliminated the flywheel. The resulting engine was more powerful, lighter, and more efficient and was easier to construct and repair than the Boulton and Watt engine. Another important improvement French made was to mount his steam cylinder horizontally, level with the axis of the paddle wheel, and with the piston rod connected directly to the paddle wheel crank. As the crank rotated by the application of steam, the cylinder, which was <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions,</b> oscillated above and below the horizontal. Over the years, French's steam engine and drive train proved to be a significant improvement compared to Fulton's.|$|R
50|$|The {{theodolite}} is {{an instrument}} for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate circles, protractors or alidades to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions</b> is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.|$|R
40|$|A {{subcritical}} {{liquid hydrogen}} orbital storage and transfer experiment {{was designed for}} flight in the Shuttle cargo bay. The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) includes a liquid hydrogen tank supported in a vacuum jacket by two fiberglass epoxy <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts.</b> This composite material was selected for the trunnions since it provides desirable strength, weight and thermal characteristics for supporting cryogenic tankage. An experimental program was conducted to provide material property and fatigue data for S-glass epoxy composite materials at ambient and liquid hydrogen temperatures and to verify structural integrity of the CFME trunnion supports...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and mechanical}} {{testing of the}} high-pressure-ratio compressor are reported. Mechanical testing was performed to demonstrate overspeed capability, adequate rotor dynamics, electrical isolation of the gas bearing <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounted</b> diffuser and shroud {{and the effect of}} operating parameters (speed and pressure ratio) on clearance of the compressor test rig. The speed range covered was 20 to 120 percent of rated speed (80, 000 rpm). Following these tests an acceptance test which consisted of a 5 hour run at 80, 000 rpm was made with approximately design impeller to shroud clearances. For Vol. 1, see N 73 - 26483...|$|R
50|$|The first {{weapon was}} {{completed}} in 1938 and delivered to the Army Heer in March 1939. It was successful, although the necessity to jack {{it up and down}} between shots was not well received by the Heer. Krupp discovered, on trying to rectify this problem, that hydro-pneumatic balancing-presses could work at much greater weights and pressures than previously believed. They redesigned the <b>mounting</b> with the <b>trunnions</b> as far forward as possible and increased the recoil stroke to 150 cm. The new design was delivered during the summer of 1940 and called the K 12 N (E). The first gun was retrospectively called the K 12 V (E).|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, MG were {{attempting}} to develop their M-type Midget for racing. The rear axle leaf springs were <b>mounted</b> in sliding <b>trunnions</b> at the rear end, rather than the more usual shackles. The improved axle location encouraged good handling, which compensated when racing for the 750cc engine's low power output. Captain George Eyston and Ernest Eldridge saw this chassis under development and decided that it could {{form the basis for}} a speed record breaker. Fitted with larger brakes from a Mark II, a four speed gearbox and streamlined bodywork, it became the EX120. On 30 December 1930 at Montlhéry, EX120 set its first records, beating the Austin Sevens.|$|R
40|$|An {{interface}} {{verification test}} (IFVT) in the free-free condition {{was conducted to}} verify that the constrained modes of a mass simulator had the same frequencies as the Hubble Space Telescope, {{for which it was}} designed. Landing tests were performed in which the mass simulator was <b>mounted</b> on its <b>trunnions</b> inside a container onboard an aircraft. Its acceleration response was adequately measured, and the anticipated constrained natural frequencies based on the IFVT were confirmed. The first test updated the model to predict the fixed based modes, and the second verified the test's capacity to characterize the structure. The IFVT is shown to generate information which permits accurate modeling of the constrained structure, without requiring the traditional fixed-based modal test...|$|R
50|$|Defensive {{tactics and}} fortifications {{had to be}} altered since these new weapons could be transported so speedily and aimed with much more {{accuracy}} at strategic locations. Two such changes were the additions of a ditch and low, sloping ramparts of packed earth that would surround the city and absorb {{the impact of the}} cannonballs (glacis), and the replacement of round watchtowers with angular bastions. These towers would be deemed trace Italienne. Whoever could afford these new weapons had the tactical advantage over their neighbors and smaller sovereignties, which could not incorporate them into their army. Smaller states, such as the principalities of Italy, began to conglomerate. Preexisting stronger entities, such as France or the Habsburg emperors, were able to expand their territories and maintain tighter control. With the threat of their land and castles being seized, the nobility began to pay their taxes and more closely follow their ruler’s mandates. With siege guns <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions,</b> stronger and larger states were formed, but because of this, struggles between neighboring governments with consolidated power began to ensue and would continue to plague Europe for the next few centuries.|$|R
2500|$|The Austro-Hungarian Army {{was very}} pleased with its large siege howitzers like the 42 cm Haubitze M. 14/16, {{but they were all}} short-ranged. The Army asked Škoda to design a gun able to destroy {{important}} targets deep in the enemy's rear in 1916. To save time and resources, it was designed in concert with the 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16 and used the same carriage and firing platform as the larger weapon. The gun used the forward <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> on the carriage, while the howitzer used the rear ones. Some sources claim that the gun was adapted from Škoda's 1901 naval gun of the same calibre and length, but this is wrong because the M. 16 gun weighed almost [...] less than the older naval gun.|$|R
40|$|A {{subcritical}} {{liquid hydrogen}} orbital storage and supply experiment is being designed for flight in the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) includes a liquid hydrogen tank supported {{in a vacuum}} jacket by two fiberglass epoxy composite <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts.</b> The ability of the CFME to last for the required seven missions depends primarily on the fatigue life of the composite trunnions at cryogenic temperatures. To verify the trunnion design and test {{the performance of the}} composite material, fatigue property data at 300 and 20 K were obtained for the specific E-glass fabric/S-glass unidirectional laminate that will be used for the CFME trunnions. The fatigue life of this laminate was greater at 20 K than at 300 K, and was satisfactory for the intended application...|$|R
500|$|Development {{of the new}} {{tank was}} offered to five {{separate}} manufacturers: Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX), Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée (FCM), Renault, Societe Lorraine de Dietrich (SLD-Lorraine) and Societé d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie (SOMUA). The new vehicle {{was based on the}} new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were {{similar to that of the}} German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach [...] engine, based on an earlier model, and the torsion bar sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, <b>mounted</b> on <b>trunnions,</b> which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was <b>mounted</b> on the <b>trunnions</b> of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a [...] cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger [...] gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger [...] tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.|$|R
50|$|In {{full-size}} engines, {{the steam}} and exhaust ports are usually {{built into the}} pivot (<b>trunnion)</b> <b>mounting.</b> However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the cutoff timing to be varied to enable expansive working, as in, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen. Alternatively, expansive working can also be provided by means of Woolf compounding, just as compactly if the two expansion stages are provided {{on either side of}} a single piston within a single cylinder, all arranged as a trunk engine (however, an oscillating cylinder engine does not benefit from the advantage of compactness that a trunk engine would otherwise provide, as it has that already from its own design features). Each approach to expansive working compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|R
50|$|The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M 94 {{was a heavy}} {{howitzer}} used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It had {{a bronze}} barrel and relied on wheel ramps to absorb its recoil. The barrel was modified in 1899 as the M 99 and can be identified by its octagonal shape. Both howitzers could be mounted {{on a wide variety}} of carriages to suit their mission, including a carriage only 1.13 m wide for mountain use. Around the start of the 20th century both the M 94 and M 99 were modified to increase their elevation up to 65°. The elevation arc had to be extended and the <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> and wheels had to be strengthened to withstand the greater recoil forces when firing at high elevation. They were known as the M 94/4 and the M 99/4 after modification.|$|R
50|$|A 52 {{cubic meter}} pit {{had to be}} {{excavated}} to hold the firing platform which took eight to twenty hours, depending on soil conditions. The bedding halves then were winched into position on rails and jacked down into the pit. The carriage was then mounted on the bedding and the barrel mated to it. All this took six to eight hours to prepare for firing. A small tilting crane was mounted {{on the left side}} of the turntable to move shells from their transport carts to the loading tray. It was also used to assemble the loading tray and to change the breech. The howitzer could only be loaded at 11° elevation because the shells had to be rammed by a hand-powered winch with pushrod. The eight later weapons used the same carriage as the 24 cm Kanone M. 16; it had <b>trunnion</b> <b>mounts</b> for both types and the gun used the forward mounts while the howitzer used the rear ones.|$|R
50|$|The Semovente da 149/40 was a {{completely}} unprotected weapon as the long gun barrel was placed on an open mounting carried on the turretless tank chassis. The gun crew stood in the open to serve the gun that had its <b>trunnions</b> <b>mounted</b> right to the rear to absorb some of the recoil forces produced on firing. It was late 1942 before the first prototype was ready for prolonged firing trials, but even before these were over unsuccessful attempts were being made to start production. Before the lines could start rolling the Italians surrendered to the Allies and the Germans took over {{what was left of}} the Italian economy. Thus the Semovente da 149/40 prototype remained the sole example of what seemed to be a promising design. The Cannone da 149/40 modello 35 could fire a 46 kg shell to a range of 23700 m, at which distance the lack of protection for the gun crew would have been of relatively little importance.|$|R
50|$|Greenamyer {{built the}} Starfighter by {{collecting}} and putting together myriad parts over a 13-year period.

The tail of the Red Baron, minus stabilizers, came from a junkyard in Ontario, California. The stabilizers and some nose wheel parts were from scrap piles in Tucson and Homestead, Florida.

5000|$|OTO Mod. 1924, Mod. 1927 and Mod. 1928 100/47 - These {{guns were}} virtual reproductions of the Škoda 10 cm K10, but with loose liners. The gun was built with A tube, jacket and loose liner with a breech ring that screwed {{to both the}} A tube and jacket. The breech block was a {{horizontal}} sliding type and it fired fixed ammunition. These AA guns were mounted in nearly all heavy and light cruisers of the Italian Navy during World War II. The most widely used model was the OTO Mod. 1928 gun in twin-gun Mod. 1928 mounts. These shielded twin mounts had both guns in a common cradle that allowed -5° to 85° elevation. The <b>mounts</b> had adjustable <b>trunnions</b> which were automatically raised by electric power as the guns elevated. The first mountings were hand loaded, but later ones had mechanized pneumatic rammers. The speed of movement for the mount {{was found to be}} too slow to follow fast moving aerial targets, particularly if the ship was rolling and was more suited to barrage fire. This mounting was designed by Comandante Minisini of the Regia Marina and were often referred to as Minisinis. The Soviet Union bought 10 of the Mod. 1928 mounts for their Admiral Nakhimov-class cruisers and their crews referred to them as Minizinis.|$|R
40|$|In the BOS {{process liquid}} slag {{together}} with dispersed metal droplets, solid particles and process gases form an expanding foam. Certain process conditions {{may lead to}} excessive foam growth, forcing foam out through the vessel mouth, an event commonly known as 'slopping'. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage and lost production time. In the early 1980 s a system for foam level and slopping control was installed at SSAB's steel plant in Lulea, a system based on the correlation between BOS vessel vibration in a narrow low frequency band and foam development. The technique, in this case with an accelerometer <b>mounted</b> on the <b>trunnion</b> bearing housing, soon showed its usefulness, for example when adapting existing lance patterns {{to a change in}} oxygen lance design from a 3 -hole to a 4 -hole nozzle. Estimating the actual foam height in the BOS vessel was of great importance in the recently completed RFCS funded research project "IMPHOS" (Improving Phosphorus Refining). Based on the earlier positive experiences, it was decided to further develop the vessel vibration measurement technique. Trials on an industrial size BOS vessel type LD/LBE have been carried out, this time with a tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the vessel trunnion. FFT spectrum analysis has been used in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to the foam level development.

An earlier attempt on October 2, 1976 yielded a higher time (1010 mph), but one timing camera didn't work on one run, meaning the record couldn't be certified.

5000|$|The Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 Saint-Chamond was a {{howitzer}} {{of relatively}} advanced design for its time. It used a hydro-spring recoil system mounted below the barrel {{and had a}} small gun shield. The box carriage had wooden wheels so {{it could only be}} towed as a single load at low speeds by vehicles or by a team of 8 horses The barrel was drawn back over the trail for towing. It had a semi-automatic vertical sliding block breech that ejected the cartridge case after firing. A loading tray was attached to the carriage on a swinging mount. It fired a 43.5 kg high-explosive (Obus FA Mle 1915) shell to a range of 9300 m. The ammunition was [...] "semi-fixed" [...] the propellent was packaged in small bags in a brass cartridge and the total propellent charge could be adjusted by changing the number of bags. The Saint-Chamond howitzer was unique among French guns in that it had rear-positioned trunnions. The advantage of rear-positionedtrunnions is that the breech doesn't [...] "disappear" [...] into a box trail {{as is the case with}} <b>trunnions</b> <b>mounted</b> at the centre of gravity of the barrel and receiver. This means that the howitzer can be loaded at high elevation angles since the breech position does not change significantly throughout the elevation range. The disadvantage of rear-positioned trunnions is that the elevation system must be more robustsince it must bear greater forces from the barrel weight. To reduce the forces on the elevation gearing an equilibrator is necessary, this is usually a spring, or in the case of the Saint-Chamond a pneumaticsystem. The Saint-Chamond elevation system also moved the gun shield along with the barrel which meant that the gun shield could be smaller than a fixed gun shield. The traverse system was similar to that of other French guns, a worm gear moved the carriage across the axle.|$|R
