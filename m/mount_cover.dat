Dissociate neural progenitor cells in 0. 1 M PBS + 2 mg/ml papain (Worthington) at 37 º C for 30 m. - Treat dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPC) with UV light for 15 - 20 minutes; NOTE: this {{should be done in}} a thin plastic petri dish; thick plastic (eg. 15 or 50 ml conical tube) will block a significant portion of UV light, leading to suboptimal apoptosis. - Wash NPC in 50 ml conical tube with 40 ml PBS (RT), spin at 1200 RPM, 7 m, RT, low brake. Decant supernatant. - Resuspend NPC in 5 ml RT 0. 1 M PBS - Add 5 ul sta 5 (6) -TAMRA, SE (Invitrogen) to NPC, vortex immediately and let incubate at 37 º C in dark for 15 m. - Wash 3 X (as in Step 3) with 40 ml ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS. - Resuspend in 1 ml DMEM/F 12 (Invitrogen) + Anti-anti (Invitrogen); count cells using a hemacytometer. Dilute or concentrate to 5 X 10 e 6 per ml. - Feed onto microglial cells (previously allowed to adhere to glass cover slips in 24 -well plates) in 900 ul DMEM/F 12 + 10 % fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) + Anti-anti at a ratio of 10 NPC: 1 microglial cell. NOTE: We typically perform experiments using 5 X 10 e 4 microglia per coverslip such that cells are spaced sufficiently to allow later quantification, thus 5 X 10 e 5 NPC would be fed on in 100 ul DMEM/F 12 + Anti-anti. - Place cells in incubator, at 37 º and 5 % CO 2 - At desired timepoints (eg. one, two and five h) remove plates from incubator - In a sterile hood, remove cover slips with forceps, dip 20 X briskly in warm 0. 1 M PBS (to remove non-phagocytosed NPC), then place cover slips in 1 ml 4 % PFA in a 24 -well plate. Replace remaining cover slips in incubator until next desired time-point. - Fix cells on cover slips in dark for 20 m. Wash 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, at RT. - Block cover slips in 10 % serum in PBS containing 0. 3 % Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % BSA, 1 h, RT in dark. - Incubate with anti-CD 11 b (eBioscience), 1 : 100) for 1 h at RT, in dark. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate with desired secondary antibody (1 : 1000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at RT. - Wash cover slips 1 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate in DAPI (1 : 20, 000) 5 m. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - <b>Mount</b> <b>cover</b> slips with Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories) on slides. Let dry O/N before imaging. - Typically, a “phagocytic index” can be calculated by dividing the total area of microglial cells (CD 11 b+) by the total area of labeled NPC. Alternatively, number of phagocytosed targets/cell may be used to quantify phagocytosis. - To check validity of phagocytosed (internal) vs. adhered targets, Z-stacks may be imaged on confocal microscope. ### Timing - NPC dissociation, 30 m - NPC labeling, 45 m - Incubations, variable (1 + h) - Immunohistochemistry, 3 h ### Troubleshooting - Problem: Little or no phagocytosis observed - Solution 1 : NPC were not adequately irradiated; use stronger UV source, extend irradiation time, confirm cell death by dye or antibody-based assay (eg. annexinV, PI). - Solution 2 : Insufficient incubation time; extend incubation. ### Anticipated Results Microglia are highly phagocytic cells. Even after a short period of time, high levels of phagocytosis may be seen, as in Figure 1. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Microglial Phagocytosis** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *At left is shown a representative Z-stack indicating that UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) have been phagocytosed and are situated inside of microglia. Immunolabeling for CD 11 b is shown in green and nuclei are indicated by DAPI (blue) *. *At right are shown representative images of microglia immunolabeled with CD 11 b (green) after having phagocytosed UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) for 2 h*. ### Associated Publications **Wild-type microglia arrest pathology in a mouse model of Rett syndrome**.
