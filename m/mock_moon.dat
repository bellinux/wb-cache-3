Nor putrefaction's breath Leave aught of this pure {{spectacle}} But loathsomeness and ruin?-- [...] 20 Spare aught but a dark theme, On which the lightest heart might moralize? Or is it but that downy-winged slumbers Have charmed their nurse coy Silence near her lids To watch their own repose? [...] 25 Will they, when morning's beam Flows through those wells of light, Seek far from noise and day some western cave, Where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds A lulling murmur weave?-- [...] 30 Ianthe doth not sleep The dreamless sleep of death: Nor in her moonlight chamber silently Doth Henry hear her regular pulses throb, Or mark her delicate cheek [...] 35 With interchange of hues <b>mock</b> the broad <b>moon,</b> Outwatching weary night, Without assured reward. Her dewy eyes are closed; On their translucent lids, whose texture fine [...] 40 Scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below With unapparent fire, The baby Sleep is pillowed: Her golden tresses shade The bosom's stainless pride, [...] 45 Twining like tendrils of the parasite Around a marble column.|$|R
