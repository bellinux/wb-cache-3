40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the hygienic milk handling practice and determine the safety and quality of raw milk collected from producers and consumers in Hawassa and Yirgalem areas. A total of 60 producers and 40 consumers were randomly selected and interviewed for the survey in the selected districts of Hawasa Zuria and Dale. A total of 120 raw milk samples were also aseptically collected and tested for microbial analysis and chemical composition (60 samples each from producers and consumers). General Linear Model (GLM) and other statistical tools were adopted to analyze the data and summarize the information. The result showed that clay pot is the major milk storing device for producers although it is inconvenient for hygienic cleaning, harbors bacteria which causes milk spoilage and consequently imposes risk of quality deterioration. The Cooling method of raw milk for 28 % of producers was using of refrigerator while for 33 % of the consumers; it was by boiling and then cooling system. Fumigation was a common traditional practice in the studied districts which is mainly used for flavoring and extending the shelf life, thereby reducing spoilage. It is one of the traditional hygienic measures used on <b>milking</b> <b>utensils.</b> In the raw milk samples, the mean total bacterial count for producers and consumers was 6. 73 cfu mL- 1 and 7. 15 cfu mL- 1, respectively. The higher total bacterial count of consumers was due to poor sanitary conditions practiced during milking and hygiene of <b>milking</b> <b>utensils.</b> Th...|$|E
40|$|Background. Animal-source {{foods are}} {{important}} causes of food-borne illness, and milk {{and dairy products}} can contain pathogenic microorganisms. Objective. We conducted a stochastic assessment {{of the risk of}} ingesting milk contaminated with specific microbial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp.) in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Methods. We carried out structured interviews and focus group discussions with farmers (n = 15), vendors (n = 17), and consumers (n = 188) to characterize dairy production systems and milk consumption behavior. Microbiological sampling was conducted at different points between milking and sale. A risk model was developed, and the risk of consuming contaminated raw milk was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. Results. The investigation into local raw milk consumption patterns showed that the proportion of raw milk consumption was 51. 6 % in people who consume milk. The probability of ingestion of marketed raw milk that failed to meet standards for this group of bacteria was 29. 9 % and about 652 consumers per day were estimated to ingest contaminated milk. Microbiological tests from the farm showed that 7. 2 % of samples taken from milkers' hands, 4. 4 % of water samples (water used to rinse milk containers or <b>milking</b> <b>utensils</b> (calabash, plastic bottle, filters, buckets), 4. 4 % of environmental samples (air pollution), 13. 2 % of samples from <b>milking</b> <b>utensils,</b> and 4. 9 % of samples from cows' udders were contaminated with {{one or more of these}} pathogens. About 624. 6 L of marketed raw milk would need to be discarded per day if discarding milk was chosen as the option of risk reduction. The destruction of this milk would result in a potential loss of € 623. 9 per day for all producers. Conclusions. The risk of human illness from consumption of raw milk could be mitigated by raising awareness about heat treatment of milk and good hygiene practices in the dairy chain...|$|E
30|$|Men had {{significantly}} higher BMI (close to normal), compared to the below normal BMI for wives, sons and daughters (Table  9). This could be because of the traditional difference in food intake where women eat the lower quality food after husbands and children (Balehegn and Kelemework 2013). In Afar tradition, women {{are not allowed to}} drink camel milk during their menstrual period and during delivery. In fact, Afar women are considered too unclean during their menstruation and birth that they are not allowed to touch <b>milking</b> <b>utensils,</b> or even looking a lactating camel in the eyes. Such kinds of factors definitely contributed to the lower intake of nutritious food by women compared to men, ultimately resulting in lower BMI for women. The difference could also be {{due to the fact that}} men have the freedom to travel to towns and purchase or consume better nutritious foods at restaurants, as is common in many African pastoral communities, making men better nourished than women (Mitchell et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess the hygienic handling practices, microbial as well as chemical composition of fluid milk in Adea Berga and Ejerie districts. A total of 180 smallholder producers, two dairy cooperatives, one dairy cooperative union, two milk processors and ten consumers were interviewed to collect the required information using a semi-structured questionnaire and focused group discussions. Survey works includes: Barn type and cleaning practices, hygienic condition of the milker and cows during milking, source of water used for cleaning purpose (udder, milker and <b>milk</b> <b>utensils),</b> type of <b>milking</b> container, fluid milk quality test methods, marketing system and major milk quality constraints. Preliminary quality tests and laboratory analysis were carried out to determine the PH level, Microbial quality and chemical composition. A total of 90 milk samples were collected and analyzed. About 32. 2 % of milk samples were checked with alcohol test positive; while 18. 8 % of the samples were positive to clot-on-boiling test. The specific gravity of milk samples were in the range of 1. 024 to 1. 032 in Ejerie district and 1. 022 to 1. 031 in Adea Berga district. The normal Specific gravity of milk ranges from 1. 026 to 1. 032. The overall mean value of fat, protein and Total solid (TS) were 3. 52, 3. 09 and 12. 19, respectively. Fat percent was significantly different (P< 0. 05) among different source of sampling points. The highest milk fat content value was recorded at Adea Berga district (3. 94). Overall mean total bacterial counts and coliform counts were 6. 98 ± 0. 17, 4. 84 ± 0. 10 log cfu/ml and significantly different b/n sites (P< 0. 05). The highest coliform (6. 64 cfu/ml) and total bacteria counts (10. 69 cfu/ml) were observed at consumers level. In general the result indicated that milk samples collected from smallholder milk producers, dairy cooperatives, dairy cooperative union, milk processor and consumers were subjected to microbial contamination and does not meet the international milk quality standard. Therefore, adequate sanitary measures should be taken at all stages from production to consumer level. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R

30|$|The {{water used}} during {{handling}} and processing of milk products can be {{potential sources of}} microbial contamination with possible negative consequences on food safety. Especially, the water used in keeping the hygiene of milking and <b>milk</b> storage <b>utensils</b> is crucial to keep the quality and safety of the products. Therefore, {{the current study was}} designed to assess the bacteriological quality of water used for cleaning milking and milk storage equipment in smallholder dairy production in Hawassa and its surroundings. A total of 79 water samples were collected: 26 from milk collecting houses in Hawassa and 53 from selected smallholder dairy farms (Hawassa =  14, Arsi Negele =  29 and Yirgalem =  10). Out of the total samples, 18 samples were collected directly from pipe and 61 from storage containers (46 from narrow opening and 15 from wide opening containers). The overall prevalence of E. coli exceeding zero CFU/ml was 39.2  %. From analyzed samples, high prevalence of positive samples for E. coli was found in water samples taken from wide opening containers (66.7  %). A number of bacteria were isolated and presumptively identified which include Bacillus sp. 6.3  % (n =  5), Citrobacter sp. 1.3  %(n =  1), E. coli 39.2  % (n =  31), Enterobacter sp. 2.5  % (n =  2), Klebisella sp. 7.6  % (n =  6), Micrococcus sp. 6.3  % (n =  5), Pseudomonas sp. 6.3  % (n =  5), Staphylococcus aureus 6.3  % (n =  5), Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.9  % (n =  11) and Streptococcus sp. 1.3  % (n =  1). The bacteriological quality of water especially, water stored in household storage containers in present study area was found to be contaminated with different bacteria indicating potential food safety problem and health risk to the society. In this respect, people handling water should be educated on its proper handling and the risk of contamination during storage. To minimize contamination, materials with narrow mouth and lid should be used. Further study is recommended on the relationship between the bacteriological quality of water and the behavior of water users.|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} {{region of}} Minas Gerais State is characterized {{as one of}} the regions of the country where milk has an important economic and social role for the family farming sector. Due to legal requirements, this sector must adjust so that the product will be marketed without bringing risk to the consumers, being, therefore, competitive on the commercial market. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the productive management generally adopted by the family farms in the municipalities of Bocaiuva, Capitão Enéas, Francisco Sá, and Montes Claros, in northern Minas Gerais, identifying the barriers to the production of milk within the parameters established by the legislation. The production system was evaluated by collecting data from questionnaires and checklists in the different environments involved with the production. The microbiological quality was assessed by enumeration of indicator microorganisms in aerobic mesophiles, psychrotrophic, Staphylococcus sp and coliforms in raw milk, raw refrigerated <b>milk,</b> water and <b>utensils</b> used in the production.

The Staph. aureus isolates were obtained from 849 samples collected on dairy farms, as follows: milk from individual cows with subclinical mastitis or history of the disease (n = 220); milk from bulk tank (n = 120); surfaces of <b>milking</b> machines and <b>utensils</b> (n = 389); and milk handlers (n = 120). Thirty-one Staph. aureus isolates were obtained and categorized as pulsotypes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and submitted to assays for biofilm formation on polystyrene, stainless steel, rubber, and silicone surfaces. Fourteen (45. 2 %) pulsotypes were considered producers of biofilm on the polystyrene microplate assay, whereas 13 (41. 9 %) and 12 (38. 7 %) pulsotypes were biofilm producers on stainless steel and rubber, respectively. None of the pulsotypes evaluated produced biofilms on silicone. Approximately 45 % of Staph. aureus pulsotypes isolated from different sources on dairy farms showed the ability to produce biofilms {{in at least one}} assay, indicating possible persistence of this pathogen in the milking environment.

Also, we checked for the presence of Salmonella sp. and Listeria monocytogenes in the ripened cheeses. The ultra structure of the biofilms was also assessed. Counts above legislation (> 2 log cfu/mL) for the pathogens evaluated were found in milk samples from both regions. Only one shelf and one form from Serro were above limits proposed (5 cfu/cm² for S. aureus and E. coli and 25 cfu/cm² for coliforms) in this study for contaminants evaluated. In Canastra, few utensils presented safe counting of pathogens. There was no Salmonella sp. and Listeria monocytogenes in the cheeses after ripening.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{monitoring}} of Staphylococcus aureus prevalence in raw milk and milk filters, its antibiotic resistance and detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Samples of raw cow´s milk and milk filters were collected in the period from 2012 till 2014, from 50 dairy farms in the Czech Republic. The total of 261 samples (164 samples of raw milk and 97 milk filters) were cultivated on Baird-Parker agar. Both the typical and atypical colonies were examined by plasmacoagulase test and PCR method was used for detection of species specific fragment SA 442 and mec A gene. Standard disk diffusion method was used to determinate resistance to antimicrobial agents. The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was detected on 25 farms (50 %). The antimicrobial resistance showed differences between the farms. Total of 58 samples were positive for Staphylococcus aureus, of which were 37 (14. 2 %) isolated from raw milk samples and 21 (8. 1 %) from milk filters. From these samples we isolated 62 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 41 isolates bacteria S. aureus from raw milk (66. 1 %) and 21 isolates S. aureus from milk filters (33. 9 %). The presence of antibiotic resistance in  Staphylococcus aureus isolates was low, most of them were resistant to amoxicilin. According to the results obtained by the PCR method for the methicillin - resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the mec A gene was present in 6 strains (9. 7 %), 4 isolates obtained from milk samples (6. 5 %) and 2 isolates from milk filters (3. 2 %).  These isolates can be considered as a possible source of resistance genes, which can be spread through the food chain. Nowadays, a globally unfavourable increasing trend of prevalence of methicillin resistant staphylococci strains especially Staphylococcus aureus is being observed worldwide. The improper hygiene and poor farm management practices contributed to the presence of S.  aureus in the milk. This {{may have contributed to the}} high level of S. aureus isolated.

40|$|Demand {{for milk}} {{products}} in Africa is rising faster than supply. In fact production {{of milk and}} milk products is almost stagnant and increased demand has been met by steadily rising imports. Yet milk is produced in abundance in sub-Saharan Africa at certain {{times of the year}} and failure to make optimum use of this production is a very great loss in nutritional and economic terms, both to rural families and nationally. The objective of the Dairy Technology Unit of the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) based at Debra Zeit, Ethiopia is, says DTU Head Dr Charles O'Connor, to improve the nutritional and economic status of the African smallholder, his family and the community at large. The valuable nutrients in milk must be preserved in a form that makes them available at periods of low milk availability,' says Dr O'Connor, and he explains that the main activity of the DTU is to research appropriate products and processes. 'We look at the process by which smallholders produce existing products and we try {{to improve the quality of}} the product and the efficiency of production, he says. The philosophy is to help farmers initially to improve on their current practice, not to introduce new concepts or technology. 'We try to show farmers how, by making really quite small changes or modifications to his or her tractional way of doing things, they can achieve meaningful improvements in the quality, quantity and consistency of their products,' he adds. Later, when these improvements have been implemented and the market expands we can then introduce new products. ILRl's Dairy Technology Unit concentrates on processes for making butter, ghee (clarified butter), yoghurt and soft and hard cheeses. Locally, farmers have used spices in an attempt to extend the shelf-life of butter and Dr O'Connor believes upto 20 spices may be used for this purpose. Most are known at present only by their local names but ginger is one of those commonly used. Unfortunately, it has yet to be proved that the addition of spices materially extends storage life, but it certainly adds variety. The safest way of storing butter is to convert it to ghee. Cheeses, particularly hard cheeses, have a longer shelf life and the DTU has many years of experience of processing milk into a variety of cheeses using processes appropriate to small-scale producers in East Africa. AYIB AND SCAMORZA CHEESES Ayib is a soft curd cheese made in many parts of Ethiopia. It can be prepared either from skimmed milk (after removal of fat) or from the buttermilk produced by churning sour whole milk. In Kenya and Tanzania many smallholders produce a soft Pasta filata type cheese called Scamorza. It is similar to Italian Mozarella. Scamorza is made from whole milk or milk from which some of the fat has been removed. Thus both cheeses can be made from milk which is also used as a source of fat to make butter. The processes for making these two cheeses differ. Whereas Ayib is made by heating the buttermilk or skimmed milk to about 50 'C until a distinct curd mass forms, milk for Scamorza is heated to only 36 C and a yoghurt-type culture must then be added. Heating should be gradual in both processes. With Ayib, heating up to 65 C will result in a cheese with a longer shelf-life, but too high temperatures during cheesemaking can result in cheeses having a 'cooked' flavour. While a thermometer is a useful aid to consistent cheesemaking, many experienced smallholders hay' learned to judge temperatures remarkably accurately. They have also learned that personal cleanliness and clean <b>milk</b> and <b>utensils</b> are essential to avoid bacterial contamination which introduces 'off' flavours and reduces the shelf-life of cheeses. The methods for making Ayib and Scamorza, as well as of her cheese types, are described in the Traditional cheesemaking manual by Charles O'Connor and published by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. There is also advice on converting some soft cheeses into harder cheeses; while this reduces the yield of cheese, it can considerably extend shelf-life. To convey this technology to smallholders the DTU conducts demonstrations and training courses but Dr O'Connor is sensitive to existing farmer knowledge. Smallholders are usually clever people and know their business very well, he says. So we do not dictate what products or processes they should use. The farmers and trainees from the national agricultural research systems who attend our training take back our ideas for modified processes and in their own time they apply those improvements or new technologies that they find most appropriate. There is no question that dairy processing has enormous potential for forming the basis of small agro-industries in rural and peri-urban areas in Africa. With encouragement African dairy producers and processors could contribute substantially to local economies and reduce the current level of imports and the outflow of foreign exchange. Demand for milk products in Africa is rising faster than supply. In fact production of milk and milk products is almost stagnant and increased demand has been met by steadily rising imports. Yet milk is produced in abundance in sub-Saharan Africa [...] ...|$|R
