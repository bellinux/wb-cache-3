What a change an additional regiment would make {{in this part of}} the Province! Most of the people have lost all confidence– I however speak loud and look big.|$|E

"For a {{long period}} of time I've been trying to get better and better, but clearly the longer you don't play, the {{likelihood}} of playing again gets smaller and smaller each day, especially at my age," [...] Öhlund told the Tampa Tribune in April 2013. [...] "I don't know long term what <b>my</b> <b>situation</b> will be, but I'm sure it will be figured out shortly." ...|$|E
500|$|Alkan's later {{correspondence}} {{contains many}} despairing comments. In {{a letter of}} about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: [...] "I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do... no one to devote myself to. <b>My</b> <b>situation</b> makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal." [...] This spirit of anomie may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions. However, {{it should not be}} ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.|$|E

500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} take them off. I see <b>my</b> <b>situation,</b> but I will die like a man".|$|E
500|$|At 12:30 pm, Bellerophon {{cut through}} the enemy line, {{slipping}} under {{the stern of the}} Spanish 74-gun Monarca and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, Bellerophon collided with the French 74-gun Aigle, hitting Aigles port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard Aigle sweeping Bellerophons decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply [...] "It is too late now to take them off. I see <b>my</b> <b>situation</b> but I will die like a man." [...] Bellerophon was now sustaining fire from Aigle and three other ships, the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno and Bahama, and the French Swiftsure. Bellerophons main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was [...] "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{his first}} parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz {{sent a letter}} to New York Governor George Pataki asking that it be canceled. He wrote, [...] "In all honesty, I believe that I deserve to be in prison {{for the rest of my}} life. I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with <b>my</b> <b>situation</b> and I have {{accepted}} my punishment." [...] Officials at the Sullivan facility duly rejected his case.|$|E

2500|$|The austere {{beauty of}} Euclidean {{geometry}} {{has been seen}} by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, [...] "You never can make a lawyer {{if you do not}} understand what demonstrate means; and I left <b>my</b> <b>situation</b> in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet [...] "", [...] "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". Einstein recalled a copy of the Elements and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the [...] "holy little geometry book".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the news}} broke {{at the end}} of the week tributes have poured in for the former Ajax and Netherlands legend, with all Eredivisie games {{featuring}} a round of applause on 14 minutes, Cruyff’s former shirt number. Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words 'Ànims Johan' (Catalan for 'Get well soon Johan'). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in <b>my</b> <b>situation,</b> was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, we have to wait. It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Jobs {{would later}} credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene 'Teddy' Hill, with turning him around: [...] "She taught an {{advanced}} fourth grade class {{and it took}} her about a month to get hip to <b>my</b> <b>situation.</b> She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip {{the next two years}} in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen." [...] Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a [...] "socially awkward loner." [...] Jobs [...] "was often bullied" [...] and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.|$|E

Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under {{me for a long time}} and he is very aware of <b>my</b> <b>situation.</b> He knows that the tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E

40|$|This {{scientific}} essay {{starts in}} a story where you get to follow me in my work by three situations with creative problem behavior at the special school where I work. The story culminates in a dilemma where I ask myself questions about how I look at my actions and my thoughts about the student. I break down and put these thoughts into three questions: What is my student's perspective and how will it affect my actions? How can I explain my actions and attitude of the student from ethical perspective? How do my practical knowledge look like in the narrative situations and why do I act like I do? My approach is to get {{answers to the questions}} by the reflection of the text itself, the reflection group and supervisors, as well as through literature that I find relevant to the issues. The process is like a pendulum motion between text, reflection and new understanding. I look at <b>my</b> <b>situations</b> based on psychological theories about the treatment of persons within the autism spectrum of problems creative behavior. My ethical issues, I see from the theoretical perspective which includes Aristotle, Levinas and Kant. I find that the answer to my questions can be paired with my practical actions. I notice that by putting words to them I get a new understanding of my actions. I see that most of the acts I do is based on the knowledge of my student's perspective and I find similarities to <b>my</b> <b>situations</b> and <b>my</b> acts to the literature. I approach it as my works practical wisdom...|$|R
