40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into the mechanics in machining ceramic materials. Extensive experimentation is done in an effort to understand the process of material removal. The theory of fracture mechanics is used to explain experimental findings. A five stage model of the machining of ceramics is proposed, and based on this understanding, guidelines are provided to adapt the traditional methods to machine ceramics. The possibility of developing a new submerged machining process is studied. The significant new findings in this research are: Cutting force has little change with increase in the cutting speed {{as a result of the}} combined effects of increase in loading rate and increase in temperature on the fracture toughness. The quality of the surface formed is better controlled by the variation in the <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> than by the mean of the <b>chip</b> <b>size.</b> Submerged machining create a unique environment which keeps the <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> variation under control. Variation of the <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> increases with increase in the depth of cut, consequently degrading the finish quality. Similar effect of feed has also been observed, however, feed is not as significant as depth of cut. The apparent coefficient of friction controls the tensile stress distribution in the vicinity of the cutting zone.

In the study, the <b>chip</b> <b>sizes</b> of AA 6061 that produced from high speed milling were used and the mechanical property of the recycled chip of AA 6061 was studied. Response surface methodology (RSM) {{was used as the}} appropriate approach for the experimental design and optimization of the response investigated. Central composite design (CCD) based on face centred cubic design was applied in designing the experiments to evaluate the effects of three main operating variables. Three main operating variables investigated i. e. <b>chip</b> <b>size,</b> pre-compaction, and holding time was used to determine the mechanical properties by measuring the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) as the response variable. The results of mechanical property of the recycled chips were compared with the original AA 6061 aluminium billet. Result of mechanical properties shows holding time has the most influential effect followed by pre-compaction, and <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> has the least effect on UTS. Hot pressed AA 6061 aluminium alloy at holding time 120 minutes, 4 times pre-compaction cycle, and large <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> shows the best UTS with reasonablePred R 2 of 0. 8866 and 98 % suggested solution for desirability.
