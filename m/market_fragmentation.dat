2500|$|In {{the first}} four years of the twenty-first century, Pakistan's KSE 100 Index was the best-performing stock market index in the world as {{declared}} by the international magazine [...] "Business Week". [...] The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Pakistan was valued at $5,937 million in 2005 by the World Bank. But in 2008, after the General Elections, uncertain political environment, rising militancy along western borders of the country, and mounting inflation and current account deficits resulted in the steep decline of the Karachi Stock Exchange. As a result, the corporate sector of Pakistan has declined dramatically in recent times. However, the market bounced back strongly in 2009 and the trend continues in 2011. By 2014 the stock market burst into uncharted territories as the benchmark KSE 100 Index rose 907 points (3.1%) and shot past the 30,000-point barrier to close at a new record high, this came days after Moody's announced that it was upgrading the outlook of 5 major Pakistani banks from Negative to Stable, resulting in heavy buying in the banking sector. The rally was supported by heavy buying in the oil and gas and cement sectors. On 11 January 2016, aimed to help reduce <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> and create a strong case for attracting strategic partnerships necessary for providing technological expertise all the three stock exchanges including Karachi Stock Exchange, Lahore Stock Exchange and Islamabad Stock Exchange were inducted into a unified Pakistan Stock Exchange.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to advance}} {{understanding}} of the dual function of judgment devices (Karpik 2010) in markets. First, these devices support the construction of markets and their segmentation into classes of products, each segment being associated with different procedures for judging the quality or value of goods. Second, they organize classifications and a ranking of the things traded in the same <b>market</b> segment. The <b>fragmentation</b> of <b>markets,</b> understood as the cohabitation of several types of judgment devices, each one associated with different configurations of actors and practices, can then {{be seen as a}} welcome source of diversity, preventing the standardizing effects that would result from over-similar judgment devices.

We also find that the transparent opening mechanisms of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) enable them to facilitate greater price discovery at the opening and to have more efficient opening prices. This result implies that the transparency effect dominates the market power effect. Further, we find that peripheral markets do not passively free ride on information revealed through the AMEX because their opening trades contribute significantly to the price discovery process.

Contrary to conventional wisdom in industrial organization theory, we show that unrestricted entry and competition of intermediaries can result in suboptimal outcomes. We discuss conditions under which the market might be improved if there is sufficient coordination to promote information sharing, such as establishing a dominant information clearinghouse that operates as a non-profit public service — a role EJM is trying to fulfill.|$|E

The Verge Adrianne Jeffries noted that mobile payment <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> was partially due to Apple's refusal to enter the market.

He predicted that the service's effect on the mobile payments industry would be similar to the iPhone's effect on the smartphone industry. Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times referred to the banks' level of coordination with Apple as [...] "elaborate" [...] and indicative of mutual [...] "preparation and investment". Some analysts added that the service could reduce the standard credit card transaction fees over time, since fees traditionally cover credit card fraud.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of database marketing by firms has increased rapidly in many industries. Indeed, with increasing costs of <b>marketing</b> and <b>fragmentation</b> of <b>markets,</b> database marketing is overtaking mass marketing. The {{aim of this}} paper is to develop a framework for database marketing strategies that will help marketers and marketing researchers to better understand this mode of marketing. This paper uses interview research to build a theory about types of marketing strategies that are most suitable for implementation using a customer database. The findings of the research show that while cross-selling is an important promotional strategy in database marketing, prospecting is not. Furthermore, only two of the product strategies identified in the mainstream marketing literature, that is, new product development for customers and product modifications for customers, are frequently used in database marketing. The other two strategies of new product development for prospects and product modifications for prospects are not used by most firms. Furthermore, while the promotional strategy of cross-selling was popular, prospecting was not. It was concluded that organisations use their database to implement certain strategies because the data is available to do so and because it is the most effective way to implement a strategy. Other strategies are not implemented because they are not appropriate for an organisation's operations, or because they believe that their existing non-database strategies are effective, rather than for reasons related to the database itself...|$|R

In both these dimensions, land holdings in Viet Nam are highly fragmented. Results show strong effects of both inter- and intra-farm fragmentation on labour input per hectare in agriculture.

Under Net Neutrality, a zero-price rule is enforced. By contrast, in the Unregulated Regime, ISPs make access to their subscribers for CPs conditional on payment of a termination fee. Multiple impressions of an ad on the same consumer are partially wasteful. Thus, equilibrium ad rates decrease when audiences overlap. We show that ISPs may strategically set termination fees to induce fragmentation. This takes place when advertising revenues are potentially large but strongly diminished by competition among CPs, and when consumers are not highly sensitive to content availability. We therefore identify an important link between termination fees, the online advertising <b>market</b> and Internet <b>fragmentation.</b> We extend the model to account for multi-homing consumers, vertically integrated ISPs, third-party advertising platforms and heterogeneous CPs...|$|R
