Nowadays, several nontraditional stabilizers (e. g., Polymer, Enzyme, Ionic stabilizer etc.) are available in market whose behavior is not fully understood for wide range of soil types. In the present study two types of soils i. e., Carbondale soil ‘clay with high plasticity (CH) ’ and Galatia soil ‘silt with low plasticity (ML) ’ has been used. A commercially available liquid polymer “Soiltac” was selected as a stabilizer and mixed with both the soils at various percentages i. e., 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 3. 0 % by dry weight of soil to study the effect of polymer on geotechnical properties of soil. Particle size distribution, liquid limit, plastic limit, specific gravity and standard Proctor tests were conducted to identify the basic index properties of the soil. Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests were conducted after 3 days, 7 days and 28 days of curing period for CH soil. For <b>ML</b> <b>soil,</b> UCS tests were carried out after 7 days and 28 days of curing period. In addition, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were conducted for CH soil at unsoaked and soaked (soaked for 96 hours) conditions.

The modification of Baermann funnel method was applied to collect nematodes. The status of phytonematodes were determined based on the absolute frequency (AF), relative frequency (RF), and absolute population (AP) of each genus. The results showed that 13 phytonematodes genera inhabited Cavendish banana crops.

40|$|Des {{concentrations}} en P excédant le seuil d'eutrophisation sont fréquemment mesurées dans l'eau des affluents du fleuve Saint-Laurent au Québec, Canada. Un enrichissement excessif en P des sols agricoles en serait la source. Une norme relative à la saturation en P des sols a été proposée comme critère de risque de contamination en P des eaux de surface. L'objectif de ce travail est d'étudier le lien entre la richesse en P du sol et la teneur en P de l'eau de drainage dans deux agro-écosystèmes du Québec. Le bassin versant de la rivière Boyer (BVB), dominé par des sols en pente, une forte densité animale et des productions fourragères et les Basses Terres de Montréal (BTM), dominées par des sols plats utilisés pour la production intensive de maïs et une faible densité animale sont étudiés. Le degré de saturation en P des sols du BVB est de 8 à 10 % {{alors que}} celui des BTM dépasse très souvent 15 %. Le pool du P organique est plus faible dans les sols des BTM que dans le BVB. La concentration moyenne en P de l'eau de drainage est plus élevée dans les sols du BVB (171 µg L- 1) que dans ceux des BTM (98 µg L- 1). Elle est corrélée à la teneur en P extrait à l'oxalate des sols argileux et à la teneur en P soluble dans l'eau ou à l'index de sorption en P des sols grossiers. Ces relations sont plus étroites pour la couche 0 - 5 cm de sol que pour les couches plus profondes. Les résultats de cette étude démontrent qu'il est difficile de prédire la concentration en P de l'eau de drainage de sols contrastants. Regrouper les sols selon leur texture améliore la précision de la prédiction de la teneur en P de l'eau de drainage à partir de leurs propriétés. Concentrations of P {{higher than the}} recognised threshold for eutrophication are often measured in the tributaries of the St. Lawrence river, Quebec, Canada. An excessive P enrichment of agricultural soils was identified as the potential cause of this phenomenon. This enrichment results in {{a decrease in the}} P sorption capacity of soils and an increased risk of P contamination of surface waters. A norm based on soil P saturation degree (DSPS) was proposed as an agro-environmental criterion to reduce this risk. Relationships between DSPS and other soil P attributes and surface runoff P concentration {{have been reported in the}} literature but not for tile-drainage water. The objective of this work is to study the relationship between soil P attributes and drainage water P in two agro-ecosystems of Quebec. The Boyer watershed (BW), which is dominated by soils with significant slopes, a high animal density and forage production, and the Montreal lowlands (ML), dominated by flat soils, low animal density and mostly used for corn (Zea mays L.), were studied. The A, B and C horizons from soils from the BW were sampled at three locations in tile-drained fields from farms in surplus or not of manure N in regards to crop needs. Soils were sampled in the ML according to a gradient in clay content with the same procedures. Soils were characterised for their pH, particle size distribution, Mehlich 3 -extractable P (Pm 3) and Al, water-soluble P (Pw), organic P (Po) and oxalate-extractable P (Pox), Al (Alox) and Fe (Feox) contents. Grab tile-drainage samples were taken in triplicate and characterised for total (TP), particulate (PP) and dissolved reactive P (RP) and unreactive P (UP). The soils of the BW are more acidic and have higher P retention capacities than <b>ML</b> <b>soils.</b> The Pw content of BW soils is lower than in ML ones in spite of comparable Pm 3 contents. The DSPS (Pox /Alox + Feox) of BW soils is moderate (8 to 10 %) whereas DSPS in <b>ML</b> <b>soils</b> is often > 15 %. The soil P organic pool is much smaller in the <b>ML</b> <b>soils</b> than in those from BW, probably because of more frequent tillage and lower manure C inputs. The average P concentration (TP) in drainage water was higher in soils from the BW (171 µg L- 1) than from <b>ML</b> <b>soils</b> (98 µg L- 1). The PP was the main P fraction in drainage water from the two ecosystems. The RP was on average 44 % of TP whereas UP was much less. The TP concentration in drainage waters was higher than 0. 03 mg L- 1 in most cases. The TP concentration was higher in tile-drainage waters from the BW than in the ML even though comparable Pm 3 and lower DSPS were found in the BW than in <b>ML</b> <b>soils.</b> These results suggest that other criteria should be included in the prediction of the risk of P contamination of drainage waters. The results of the present study indicate that agricultural practices (crop species, manure inputs, tillage type and frequency) could have a greater influence than soil P status on the TP concentration in tile-drainage waters. A linear correlation analysis between the logarithm of the TP (TP + 0. 5) and that of the different soil P attributes indicated that TP was related to the P extracted by oxalate from clay soils and by water in coarse-textured soils. These relationships were closer in the 0 - 5 cm soil layer than in deeper strata. Multiple regression analysis between the logarithms of drainage water P concentrations and soil attributes revealed that, when soils were grouped by texture, the prediction of TP was much more accurate than when all soils were considered. The present regulatory approach of assessing the risk of water P contamination by using the soil Pm 3 and DSPS only was inadequate in the two considered agroecosystems. The results of this study indicate that the prediction of the drainage water P concentration with P attributes from contrasting soils is difficult. Grouping soils by texture improves the prediction of Pt from soil P attributes...|$|R

In total, 957 landslides were mapped using LiDAR whereas previously, only 228 landslides were believed {{to exist in the}} study area based on SLIDO information. In Milo McIver State Park, 41 landslides were mapped using LiDAR. SLIDO indicated only three landslides present within the park. A sequence of seven terraces of the Clackamas River is mapped in Milo McIver State Park. Landslides in the park predominantly occur between these terraces. Soils studied from representative areas within landslide complexes and terrace surfaces help to formulate a soil chronosequence for the study area. The youngest soils, Entisols, develop in less than 1, 600 years, Inceptisols between 1, 600 - 10, 000 years, and the oldest soils, Alfisols, develop in at least 10, 000 years. Classifications of soil profiles netted ten Alfisols (mainly on upper terraces), 49 Inceptisols, and 20 Entisols (reactivated slides in the complexes). The <b>soils</b> are predominantly <b>ML</b> <b>soils</b> and have Loam and Silt Loam textures. Results of spectral analysis, carried out on the LiDAR DEMs, indicate that the spectral character of landslides changes with age. However, applying statistical tools such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) and cluster analysis suggest that {{it is not possible to}} use spectral analysis to determine the relative age of failed surfaces. The K-S test showed that the spectral character among landslides varies widely. Cluster analysis resulted groupings not based on age or terrain type. The result of the cluster analysis illustrates that it may not be realistic to use a single cutoff, which separates failed terrain from unfailed, in the spectral distributions to analyze an entire region. In all, the results of the spectral analysis were not conclusive. Individual landslides, not complexes, should be used in future studies, since complexes have slides that are continually reactivating. The landslides were also too young to display very much differentiation in age based on soils and spectral analysis.

The lowest soil and the second-lowest root populations of H. oryzae were observed in Shwethweyin which may indicate that this rice variety is less susceptible to H. oryzae. Among three cropping sequences, the highest frequency of occurrence (94 %) {{was found in the}} rice-rice cropping sequence. Based on the prominence value (a combination of the frequency of occurrence and abundance) of H. oryzae, Hlaingtharyar was the most infested region where susceptible rice varieties are grown and rice-rice cropping sequence is practiced.

After 119 h of incubation with toluene, 96 % of the incorporated 13 C was detected in only 16 of the total 59 PLFAs (27 %) extracted from the soil. Of the total 13 C-enriched PLFAs, 85 % were identical to the PLFAs contained in a toluene-metabolizing bacterium isolated from the same soil. In contrast, {{the majority of the}} soil PLFAs (91 %) became labeled when the same soil was incubated with [13 C]glucose. Our study showed that coupling 13 C tracer analysis with PLFA analysis is an effective technique for distinguishing a specific microbial population involved in metabolism of a labeled substrate in complex environments such as soil. Toluene is a widespread pollutant that biodegrades rapidly relative to many other organic pollutants in both oxic and anoxic environments.

The soil was a clay loam (45  % silt, 34  % clay and 21  % sand). Natural populations of M. graminicola and Pythium spp. had been observed in this field before (Banaay et al. 2010). The presence of M. graminicola was quantified to 0.35 juveniles per <b>mL</b> <b>soil.</b> Rice variety UPLRi- 5 was grown during the season prior to the collection of the soil, to maintain the pathogen populations in the field. Prior to the experiment, weeds were collected from field B 912 to verify the presence of both pathogens in the soil. Typical hook-shaped root galls were observed on the root tips of the weeds. The presence of P. arrhenomanes was confirmed by cutting discolored roots in 1 -cm-pieces and surface-sterilized in 5  % hypochlorite for 1  min. Afterwards they were blotted dry and plated on PDA supplemented with 200  mg/L streptomycin. Hyphae emerging from the roots were transferred to fresh plates and grown for identification. Identification was done by PCR according to Van Buyten & Höfte (2013) with P. arrhenomanes (PT 60) specific primers in the ITS region (Forward 5 ’-ATTCTGTACGCGTGGTCTTCCG- 3 ’; Reverse 5 ’-ACCTCACATCTGCCATCTCTCTCC- 3 ’).

Jaub. et Spach., Gagea sacculifera Regel., Plantago minuta Pall., Tragopogon kasahstanicus S. Nikit., and Trigonella arcuata C. A. Mey. were investigated in four typical desert plant communities in Junggar Basin, northwest China. All five ephemerals examined {{were found to be}} colonized and formed typical arbuscules or vesicles. The proportion of root length colonized ranged from 2 to 85 % with an average of 19 %. Spore density in soil near the roots of different ephemerals varied from I to 120 spores per 20 <b>ml</b> <b>soil,</b> with an average value of 33 spores. Species richness averaged 8. 8 AM fungal species in soil near the roots and ranged from 2 to 21. Fifty-four AM fungal taxa belonging to the genera Acaulospora, Archaeospora, Entrophospora, Glomus and Paraglomus were isolated and identified from soil around the roots. Glomus was the dominant AM fungal genus with a frequency of 100 % and relative abundance of 82. 6 %. The AM fungal species with the highest frequency of occurrence was Glomus aggregatum with a frequency of 75 %. G. microaggregatum was present in the highest relative abundance (16 %). G. sacculifera, P. minuta and T arcuata formed Arum-type mycorrhizas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous and Arum-type mycorrhizas are especially prevalent in these important desert communities used for grazing and traditional medicine. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|On-line {{thermally}} assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) in {{the presence}} of both unlabelled and 13 C-labelled tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was used to assess the relative contributions of phenolics (lignin, demethylated lignin and non-lignin phenolics) in a peaty gley soil profile beneath an unimproved grassland (LL), from a study site located at Harwood (Northumberland, northeast England, UK). This site also includes an unforested moorland (ML) and a second rotation Sitka spruce stand (SS). The common lignin proxies have been corrected for contributions of non-lignin phenols and demethylated lignin in the LL ecosystem and then compared with those from the ML and SS ecosystems. The phenolic compositions from the contributory vegetation inputs (i. e. grasses, heather and Sitka spruce) to all three soils (LL, ML and SS) were also analysed. By using 13 C-labelled TMAH it was possible to show that the chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM) reflected the different vegetation inputs in each of the L/F layers but these characteristics were lost from the deeper organic and mineral layers. Similar changes in the yield of lignin monomers (Λ) with increasing soil depth were displayed in the LL soil profile as reported previously in the <b>ML</b> <b>soil</b> in that no maxima were observed in these amount-depth profiles. The tannin input to the LL soil is low and as a consequence, unlike the ML and SS soils, there is no progressive decrease in the amounts of these non-lignin phenolics with increasing depth. Finally the methylated carbohydrate derivatives (MC) become more abundant relative to the phenolics with increasing soil depth in all three ecosystems (LL, ML and SS) ...|$|E

We evaluated the impact of ST on microbial communities as indicators of soil quality for two distinct tillage systems that have been applied to a Vertosol for 43 years (no-tillage - NT or conventional tillage - CT) and two stubble management practices (retention - SR or burning - SB). Soil samples were collected 15 weeks after ST and analysed for total enzymatic activity (fluorescein diacetate assay), metabolic diversity (Ecoplates Biolog) and bacterial community structure (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism). There was no significant effect of ST on the measured biological attributes. However, total enzymatic activity for treatments under CTSR and CTSR-ST were significantly higher compared with NTSR-ST (+ 0. 8 fluorescein μg <b>ml</b> g <b>soil</b> h, P < 0. 01). Differences {{may be attributed to}} a significant increase in bulk density for CTSR treatment (P < 0. 05) and an increment in bulk density on CTSR-ST plots. The lack of changes may be attributed to a high resistance and/or resilience of soil microbial communities after 15 weeks of tillage.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the spore density and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soil aggregates from fields of "murundus" (large mounds of soil) in areas converted and not converted to agriculture. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with five replicates, in a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement: five areas and three aggregate classes (macro-, meso-, and microaggregates). The evaluated variables were: spore density and diversity of AMF, total glomalin, total organic carbon (TOC), total extraradical mycelium (TEM), and geometric mean diameter (GMD) of soil aggregates. A total of 21 AMF species was identified. Spore density varied from 29 to 606 spores per 50 <b>mL</b> of <b>soil</b> and was higher in microaggregates and in the area with 6 years of conversion to agriculture. Total glomalin was higher between murundus in all studied aggregate classes.
