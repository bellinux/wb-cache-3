40|$|Intermetallic-based alloys (so called intermetallics) of the Fe-Al {{binary system}} are modern {{construction}} materials, which {{in recent decades}} have found application in many branches of the power, chemical and automotive industries. High resistance of FeAl based alloys to cavitational erosion results first of all from their high hardness in the as-cast state, large compressive stresses in the material, as well as homogeneous structure. In the present paper, the effect of aluminum content on the microstructure, texture and strain implemented upon cavitation wear of FeAl intermetallic alloys, have been analyzed by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis.

40|$|Cholesterol (Chol) is an {{important}} lipid in cellular membranes functioning both as a membrane fluidity regulator, permeability regulator and co-factor for some membrane proteins, e. g. G-protein coupled receptors. It also participates {{in the formation of}} signaling platforms and gives the membrane more <b>mechanical</b> <b>strenght</b> to prevent osmotic lysis of the cell. The sterol structure is very conserved and already minor structural modifications can completely abolish its membrane functions. The right interaction with adjacent lipids and the preference of certain lipid structures over others are also key factors in determining the membrane properties of cholesterol. Because of the many important properties of cholesterol it is of value to understand the forces and structural properties that govern the membrane behavior of this sterol. In this thesis we have used established fluorescence spectroscopy methods to study the membrane behavior of both cholesterol and some of its 3 β-modified analogs. Using several fluorescent probes we have established how the acyl chain order of the two main lipid species, sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) affect sterol partitioning as well as characterized the membrane properties of 3 β-aminocholesterol and cholesteryl phosphocholine. We concluded that cholesterol prefers SM over PC at equal acyl chain order, indicating that other structural properties besides the acyl chain order are important for sphingomyelin-sterol interactions. A positive charge at the 3 β position only caused minor changes in the sterol membrane behavior compared to cholesterol. A large phosphocholine head group caused a disruption in membrane packing together with other membrane lipids with large head groups, but was also able to form stable fluid bilayers together with ceramide and cholesterol. The Ability of the large head group sterol to form bilayers together with ceramide was further explored in the last paper where cholesteryl phosphocholine/ceramide (Chol-PC/Cer) complexes were successfully used to transfer ceramide into cultured cells...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of innovative and low environmental impact polymer composites with controlled structure and properties for potential applications in several advanced sectors (i. e.,food packaging, bio-engineering, electrical & electronics and automotive applications). In this thesis, the preparation, chemical modification and characterization of different types of thermoplastic polymers and their blends - such as poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), Mater-Bi (MB) and polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) composites – containing various natural fibres (hemp, micro- and nano-fibrillated cellulose) have been reported. Owing to the incompatibility of polymer matrices (hydrophobic) with cellulosic fibres (hydrophilic), either polymer or fibres have been functionalized, or a compatibilizer has been added during processing of composites. The functionalization was carried out by esterification or by grafting with bi-functional monomers - such as glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and maleic anhydride (MA) - able to react with both polymer and fibres during melt mixing. The composites were prepared by melt mixing in Brabeder Plasti-Corder and characterized by microscopic analyses (OM, SEM, TEM, AFM), diffractometry (WAXS), spectroscopy (FT-IR, NMR), calorimetry (DSC, TGA), tensile mechanical and rheological tests. Results demonstrated that morphology, phase behaviour, interfacial interactions, rheological and mechanical properties of composites were strictly affected by the component structure, composition and mixing processes. For binary PCL/CF and EVA/CF composites the effect of functional modification of matrix (with GMA and MA) and fibres (with butanoic acid) on the final properties of materials was examined. Results obtained for composites with polymer blend matrix (PLA/EVA-GMA/CF) demonstrated that phase morphology and mechanical properties were influenced by the polymer-polymer miscibility, and properties varied with blend composition. In the case of ternary composites of biodegradable MB, polyolefins and hemp fibres (H), the crystallization behaviour, morphology and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strenght</b> of the composites were found to be markedly affected by the phase dispersion and compatibilizer type. A significant improvement of tensile modulus and strength was recorded for ternary MB/PE/H and MB/PS/H composites as compared to binary composites (MB/H). The results indicated that incorporation of polyolefins in the biodegradable matrix may have significant advantages in terms of properties, processability and cost. Moreover, a novel approach to the preparation and functionalization of PLA bio-composites with nano-fibrillated cellulose (NC) has been reported. The effect of different processing strategies on the phase dispersion of NC, {{as well as on the}} thermal and mechanical properties of these systems has been analysed. To improve the dispersion of NC in PLA either functionalization of NC or PLA by GMA grafting, or inclusion of NC in poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) – which is miscible with PLA - were applied. Better dispersion of NC was observed for PLA nanocomposites containing functionalized components and/or NC included in PVAc. These systems – as compared to the unmodified PLA/NC composites - display a higher degree of fibre dispersion with improved tensile properties and thermal stability...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{water demand}} already exceeds supply and water {{scarcity}} {{is a global}} problem. So {{it is necessary to}} develop novel technologies {{to be able to use}} poorer quality source waters for drinking water production. Once considered as an expensive, ultimate solution for water supply, desalination is becoming affordable. The two most commonly used seawater desalination methods are Multi-stage Flash Distillation (MSF) and Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO). SWRO is less energy demanding compared to MSF, which makes it economically attractive. However there is no backpulsing of the expensive and delicate reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with air or water, so they are susceptible to fouling, causing the loss of their performance. Therefore cleaning the feed water to the highest level possible by nanofiltration, before it reaches the RO membranes would highly increase the efficiency of the process. Nanofiltration (NF) as a feed pre-treatment step is a pressure driven membrane separation process that takes place on a selective layer formed by a semipermeable membrane with properties between RO and ultrafiltration. The objective of this project is the developement of highly efficient thin-film composite (TFC) membranes for SWRO pre-treatment processes based on low-fouling cyanobacterial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). TFC membranes combine high flux and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strenght,</b> and they are expected to be the key components of any water purification technology in the future. Cyanobacterial EPS are complex heteropolysaccharides with putative antimicrobial and antiviral properties and a particular affinity to bind metal ions [1, 2]. Within this work, the unicellular N 2 -fixing marine cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. CCY 0110 was chosen for RPS production, since it is among the most efficient released polysaccharide (RPS) producers and the polymer has been previously extensively characterised [3]. RPS was produced by growing Cyanothece CCY 0110 in 10 L bioreactors, in conditions previously defined and the polymer was isolated following the standard methodology [3]. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) / cyanobacterial EPS blend nanofibrous membranes were fabricated by electrospinning using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a basal membrane, in order to obtain thin-layer composite nanofiltration membranes. The production of the nanofibers using EPS and PVA as plasticizer in different ratios was produced in a NF- 103 MECC Nanon electrospinning equipment with an applied electric field between 15 and 25 kV and a flow of 0, 2 mL/h. Morphological, mechanical, chemical and thermal characterization of the electrospun fibers deposited on the basal membranes, were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), dynamical and mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The AFM and SEM results show the presence of fibers with dimensions between 54 and 121 nm with low bead formation. In the EDS analysis presence of sulfur elements was observed confirming the inclusion of EPS in the nanofibers. The morphology and diameter of the nanofibers were mainly affected by the concentration of the blend solution and the weight ratio of the blend, respectively. The best PVA/EPS nanofibers were achieved in a ratio of 12 % PVA and 0. 4 % EPS. The solution conductivity was ranging 1500 to 3500 μS/cm with a viscosity of about 100 to 500 cP. The DMA results confirmed the miscibility of PVA/EPS blends. The elastic modulus of the nanocomposite mats increased significantly as a consequence of the reinforcing effect of EPS. Thermal and mechanical analysis demonstrated that there were strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the molecules EPS-PVA in the blends. The heat-treated electrospun blended membranes showed better tensile mechanical properties when compared with PVA alone, and resisted more against disintegration. A lab-scale nanofiltration was performed in a bench stainless steel Sterlitech tangential flow stirred cell (200 mL) connected to an air pressure system that allow pressure driven filtration up to 10 BAR. Bactericidal activity and biofilm formation were tested using Escherichia coli and Sthaphylococcus aureus as pathogenic microorganisms...|$|E
