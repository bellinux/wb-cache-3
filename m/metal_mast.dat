50|$|A mast {{radiator}} (or radiating tower) is a {{radio mast}} or tower {{in which the}} entire structure functions as an antenna. This design, developed around 1930, is commonly used for transmitting antennas operating at low frequencies, in the VLF, LF and MF ranges, in particular those used for AM broadcasting. The <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> is electrically connected to the transmitter. Its base is usually mounted on a nonconductive support to insulate it from the ground. A mast radiator {{is a form of}} monopole antenna.|$|E
50|$|There {{were four}} metal {{transmitter}} pylons which were 360 ft high and four wooden receiver pylons which were 240 ft high. The wooden masts were blown {{up in the}} summer of 1957, the <b>metal</b> <b>masts</b> were taken down in late 1957 and early 1958.|$|R
50|$|Although {{better known}} for his dinghy designs and <b>metal</b> <b>masts,</b> Ian Proctor was also {{responsible}} {{for the design of}} several small cruisers. His first cruiser was the Seagull for Bell Woodworking, followed shortly afterwards by the Seamew. Later on there was the Nimrod, Eclipse, Pirate, and the Prelude.|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} a 190-metre reinforced-concrete tower and a 124-metre <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> on top of it. Under the tower is a two-storey building with equipment rooms, entrance halls and a conference centre. The diameter of the tower at its base is 15.2 metres and the wall thickness is 50 cm. The diameter of the tower from 140 metres upwards is 8.2 metres. A total of 10,000 m3 of concrete and 1,900 tons of steel {{were used in the}} TV Tower construction.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 Ian Proctor's 'Cirrus' had an {{all-metal}} mast. Proctor quickly realised {{the potential}} of metal masts and in 1953 he designed the first all-metal tapered and extruded mast for sailing dinghies. Then in 1955 he established 'Ian Proctor Metal Masts Limited' as a commercial venture. Proctor Masts soon became the leading <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> producers {{for all types of}} sailing craft. Indeed by 1960, 13 different countries were using Proctor masts in the Olympics and the 1987 America's Cup featured 12 boats using Proctor masts.|$|E
50|$|Specialists of the Institute reached {{success in}} design of {{all-welded}} high-rise TV towers. These are realized projects of TV towers in Kiev, St. Petersburg, Yerevan, Tbilisi, Kharkov, <b>metal</b> antenna <b>masts</b> of height 260 m for broadcasting stations, unified towers for TV retransmitters and radio relay lines.|$|R
25|$|The {{external}} antenna for Orange Harvest was {{the distinctive}} white dielectric 'spark plug' {{carried on the}} upper surface of the Shackleton. This 'spark plug' has often been mis-identified as an insulator for a HF long-wire antenna running to the aircraft's tail. It is actually self-contained, and at a wavelength far shorter than would use long wires. The Shackleton did carry HF antennae, but these were supported by two small <b>metal</b> <b>masts,</b> just ahead of Orange Harvest. The structural fitment for Orange Harvest was a metal plinth built into the fuselage, at approximately the previous dorsal turret position. The large antenna was fastened to this. As the antenna causes significant drag, it was sometimes removed and only the plinth was evident. This was {{more common in the}} 1960s ASW era, rather than the later AEW period.|$|R
5000|$|Each array {{consists}} of a ring of 13 tall <b>metal</b> <b>masts</b> connected at the top by a network of horizontal cables. The cables form six diamond-shaped [...] "panels" [...] radiating from the central tower in a hexagonal pattern shaped like a snowflake. The two arrays normally operate together as one antenna, but each is designed to function independently to allow maintenance on the other array. The central tower of each antenna system is 304 m (997.5 ft) tall. It is surrounded by six 266.7 m (875 ft) tallmasts, placed on a ring with a radius of 556 m around the central tower. The remaining six towers of the array are 243.5 m (799 ft) tall and placed on a circle of 935.7 m (3070 ft) around the central tower.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diamond-shaped}} {{tower was}} patented by Nicholas Gerten and Ralph Jenner for Blaw-Knox July 29, 1930. [...] {{and was one}} of the first mast radiators. [...] Previous antennas for medium and long wave broadcasting usually consisted of wires strung between masts, but in the Blaw-Knox antenna, as in modern AM broadcasting mast radiators, the <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> structure itself functioned as the antenna. [...] To prevent the high frequency potential on the mast from short-circuiting to ground, the narrow lower end of the tower rested on a ceramic insulator about 3 feet wide, shaped like a ball and socket joint. [...] Thus the tower required guy lines to hold it upright.|$|E
5000|$|Gulvain is a 55 ft ocean-racing sloop {{named after}} the {{mountain}} Gaor Bheinn (or [...] "Gulvain"). Designed by Jack Laurent Giles for Jack Rawlings, she {{was based on the}} earlier boats Maid of Malham and Myth of Malham. She was built in Shoreham by Sussex Shipbuilding Company, owned by Rawlings, and launched on 27 June 1949. She was made from Birmabright, making her the first ocean racing yacht to be made from an aluminium alloy. Aluminium was used for strength, not weight: she displaces 16.5 LT and weighs 23 LT, including ballast. She {{was one of the first}} boats to have a <b>metal</b> <b>mast.</b> Her hull has a reverse sheer, and she has a Masthead rig.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{transmitting}} antenna, the quarter wave monopole, is physically large at these frequencies (25 to 250 m requiring a tall radio mast. Usually the <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> itself {{is used as}} the antenna, and is mounted on a large porcelain insulator to isolate it from the ground; {{this is called a}} mast radiator. The monopole antenna, particularly if electrically short requires a good, low resistance Earth ground connection for efficiency, since the ground resistance is in series with the antenna and consumes transmitter power. Commercial radio stations use a ground system consisting of many heavy copper cables, buried a few feet in the earth, radiating {{from the base of the}} antenna to a distance of about a quarter wavelength. In areas of rocky or sandy soil where the ground conductivity is poor, above ground counterpoises are used.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{application}} of plasma stealth {{is the use}} of plasma as an antenna: <b>metal</b> antenna <b>masts</b> often have large radar cross sections, but a hollow glass tube filled with low pressure plasma can also be used as an antenna, and is entirely transparent to radar when not in use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Abundance of <b>metal</b> <b>masts</b> and towers, their aging require to pay {{attention}} to corrosion phenomena and their after-affects. Special attention should be paid to the changes of structural elements strength and strain (induced by the environment aggressiveness) and to the phenomena of viability exhaustion of the whole system (dissipation). In these respects more premises for developing the second limit state formation are found first of all in separate mast elements and local chains, later in the whole structure. The article deals with the premises of developing chemical and electromagnetic contamination, its forecast and processes which could result from the above-mentioned pollution; it also analyses the destructive processes due to the pollution interaction with the material of structural elements as well as the consequences of aggressive contamination. Attention is also paid to the effect of the stress-strain concentrations around the corroded spots and their influence on the destruction evolution...|$|R
50|$|In September 1865, Congress {{was raised}} {{and taken to}} the Norfolk Navy Yard where she was later sold. She later was {{stripped}} for the valuable wood and <b>metal</b> near her <b>mast.</b> The sails later were {{used to make a}} flag in memory of the ship.|$|R
40|$|Installation of antenna masts {{and towers}} that have {{cellular}} signal transmission equipment mounted represents a relevant {{problem in the}} urban development. Given its density, {{as well as the}} multiplicity of multistory residential and offi ce buildings, masts can be mounted onto existing buildings and structures. For this purpose, the analysis of a <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> itself and a ceiling panel on which it is to rest should be performed in respect of different types of loading. This task is of utmost importance, since original designs of buildings fail to take account of any supplementary static or dynamic loads. Numerical and analytical methods are used for the purpose of the analysis. The analysis of cellular signal transmission masts is performed numerically {{with the help of a}} software programme, while the calculation of the ceiling panel is performed on the basis of a combined scheme. As a result, the authors demonstrate the safety of installation of high-altitude masts onto existing structures exposed to varying loads, including wind and ice loads...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{implementation}} of wind farms establishment in France is increasing. When wind farms are located close to radionavigation systems, it becomes important {{to evaluate their}} electromagnetic effects on existing radionavigation instalations. In this study, the radionavigation system is a VOR (VHF omnidirectional radio) operating at about 110 MHz. Because rotor blades are made of a balsa and dielectric multilayers composition, their electromagnetic behavior {{differs from that of}} metal blades at VHF frequences. In this study, we first obtain an electromagnetic CAD model from a real structural design; then we calculate the far field scattering matrix from an integral method (CESC code [1] method of moment) for a (30 m) dielectric blade and compare it with a metal one using RCS (radar cross section) calculation. The impact of (40 m long) dielectric blades is compared with the (65 m high) <b>metal</b> <b>mast</b> effect in terms of scattered field, and then the VOR error (bearing error) is evaluated. These results are analyzed for several geometrical configurations of a three-bladed rotor and compared with the mast. The study is extended on wind farms to discuss geometrical configuration effects with regard to a VOR location...|$|E
50|$|These antennas {{are usually}} {{constructed}} using a <b>metal</b> radio <b>mast,</b> which is fed both {{at its base}} and at an appropriate height. The radio mast is usually insulated from ground and is divided electrically by a separation insulator into two parts. For feeding of the upper part, either a cable inside the mast construction or the ladder, which must be mounted on insulators, is used. This design is employed in the Mühlacker, Wolfsheim and Hamburg medium-wave transmitters. Anti-fading antennas with two separation insulators are installed at Ismaning.|$|R
50|$|A fatal {{accident}} {{took place on}} 27 October 1997 when a train heading towards Bière collided with a tractor at a level crossing near Bussy-sur-Morges. The train derailed and crashed into a <b>metal</b> catenary support <b>mast</b> killing the train driver instantly. Four injured passengers were taken to hospital.|$|R
50|$|City's Institute for the {{protection}} of the cultural monuments drafted the reconstruction project for the building in 2009. Authored by Aleksandra Šević and Ljiljana Konta, the project was to include the complete rebuilding of the, today non-existing, two side domes. They were to be built of wood and steel and look the same as the small domes on the head façade. Deteriorated sculpture on the front dome was to be removed and replaced by the new one, made of <b>metal.</b> A <b>mast,</b> which once stood on the central dome, will also be rebuilt and also serve as the lightning rod. Due to the lack of funds, the project didn't went on.|$|R
50|$|The word brig is an 18th-century {{shortening}} of {{the word}} brigantine, but came to mean {{a different type of}} rigging. It is the gaff-rigged mainsail on a brigantine which distinguishes it from the brig, which is principally square rigged on both masts. In addition to the different sail configuration, the brigantine's main mast is made from two parts and equal to that of a schooner: a quite long mast and a top mast. The main mast of a brig is made from three parts and equal to that of a fully rigged ship: a mast, topmast and topgallant mast. With the advent of modern (<b>metal)</b> pole <b>masts,</b> this last difference typically no longer exists.|$|R
50|$|Twin lead {{can have}} {{significantly}} lower signal loss than miniature flexible coaxial cable at shortwave and VHF radio frequencies; for example, type RG-58 coaxial cable loses 6.6 dB per 100 m at 30 MHz, while 300 ohm twin-lead loses only 0.55 dB. However, twin-lead is {{more vulnerable to}} interference. Proximity to metal objects will inject signals into twin-lead that would be blocked out by coaxial cable. Twin lead therefore requires careful installation around rain gutters, and standoffs from <b>metal</b> support <b>masts.</b> Twin-lead is also susceptible to significant degradation when wet or ice covered, whereas coax is less or not affected in these conditions. For these reasons, coax has largely replaced twin-lead in most uses, except where maximum signal is required.|$|R
40|$|Upon {{contact with}} allergen, {{sensitized}} mast cells release highly active proinflammatory mediators. Allergen-mediated mast cell activation {{is an important}} mechanism in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma. Asthmatic patients are especially susceptible to air pollution. Epidemiologic studies found {{a positive correlation between}} severity of symptoms among asthmatic patients and the level of particulate matter (PM) in the air. Among the constituents of PM are metals and transition metals, which could mediate some of its adverse effects on human health. We sought to determine the effect of metal and transition metal ions on allergen-mediated mast cell activation. We observed that several metal and transition <b>metal</b> ions activated <b>mast</b> cells and enhanced allergen-mediated mast cell activation. Thus, Al 3 +, Cd 2 +, and Sr 2 + induced release of granule-associated N-acetyl-β-Dhexosaminidase, and Al 3 + and Ni 2 + enhanced antigen-mediated release. Metal and transition metal ions also induced significant secretion of interleukin (IL) - 4 and increased antigen-mediated IL- 4 secretion in mast cells. These effects of metal and transition <b>metal</b> ions on <b>mast</b> cells were observed at concentrations that do not result in direct cytotoxicity and might be relevant for environmental exposure. Thus, metals and transition metals could increase the level of allergen-mediated mast cell activation, which might be one of the mechanisms mediating exacerbation of allergen-driven asthma symptoms by air pollution.

5000|$|The folded unipole antenna {{was first}} devised for {{broadcast}} use by John H. Mullaney, an American radio broadcast pioneer, and consulting engineer. A variation of a monopole antenna, {{it consists of}} a vertical <b>metal</b> rod or <b>mast</b> mounted over a conductive surface called a ground plane. The mast {{is surrounded by a}} [...] "skirt" [...] of vertical wires electrically attached {{to the top of the}} mast. The wires are connected by a metal ring at the bottom and the feed line is connected between the bottom of the wires and ground. Designed to solve some difficult problems with existing medium wave (MW), frequency modulation (FM), and amplitude modulation (AM) broadcast antenna installations, it has seen much use, both in the United States and other countries as well.|$|R
50|$|Butting {{against the}} {{north-east}} {{side of the}} strongroom, the rectangular pill box air raid shelter has off-form concrete blast walls, a concrete slab floor and flat roof. It has entrances at the north-east and south-west ends, each with an open porch sheltered by the cantilevered roof. Only the north-east end retains its interior concrete blast wall, which forms an entrance corridor into the main space of the shelter. The floor and ceiling are coved and there are three openings to the north-west and south-east sides housing pairs of eight-light casement windows. Original toilet cubicles remain {{at each end of}} the building. The exterior and parts of the interior are painted. A <b>metal</b> framed communications <b>mast</b> sits on the roof of the shelter, but this is not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
5000|$|Besides these partner-specific vocalisations, {{aggressive}} noises can {{be heard}} from both sexes, but more often the male. Typical are individual, sharp kuek sounds that may, with increasing irritation, be placed in sequence and be continued as kek. A single kuek may be also be a predator warning, as begging nestlings will immediately fall silent if this call is made by either parent. Individual drumming activity by grey-headed woodpeckers can be quite varied, but they drum on more occasions than European green woodpeckers. Drumming frequence can be 20 Hertz, with a [...] "drum roll" [...] lasting up to 40 beats, or two seconds. Both sexes drum, but the female less often than the male, and usually more quietly and shorter. Grey-headed woodpeckers often continue {{to use the same}} well-resonating drum sites for years - these can even be at a considerable distance from the nest. Grey-headed woodpeckers often use <b>metal</b> covers on <b>masts</b> and roofs as drumming substrate due to their favourable resonance characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|The Kraken was {{difficult}} to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch King Kong vs. Godzilla which had a real octopus crawling over miniatures. During the filming of the attacks, Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) divulged that [...] "the Kraken, at the moment, is just Gore Verbinski running around, going, 'I'm a tentacle. I'm a tentacle. Be afraid.'" [...] Gore Verbinski worked with Industrial Light & Magic to create the scenes for the film involving the Kraken. When filming {{the attack on the}} Edinburgh Trader, they used the ship as a set in shallow waters. Many more sailors were digitally added on board the ship, and others were digitally replaced for complex shots. When the time came to film the Edinburgh Trader being broken in half, two massive pipes were filled with 30,000 pounds of cement for a total of 60,000 pounds and crushed down onto the set. To prepare for this event, most <b>metal</b> and the <b>masts</b> were removed, because the metal would prevent the ship from satisfyingly breaking in half while the masts would prevent better camera close-ups. Furthermore, the interior middle of the ship was lined with cables of explosives to blast the wood apart in the air. After the shot, other men were filmed on another blue tilting set and digitally added on deck. John Knoll, Visual Effects Supervisor, confessed that it was extremely complex to add the Kraken's tentacles between all the environmental effects of water and wood debris.|$|R
