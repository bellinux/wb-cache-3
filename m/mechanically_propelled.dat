5|$|The Irwell, sourced at Cliviger in Lancashire, {{flows from}} the north and for a {{distance}} forms the statutory boundary between Salford and Manchester. Flooding has historically been a problem and the Irwell has seen much modification along its course in Salford with some bends being removed, channelisation, and the construction of levees and bank reinforcements. Salford has expanded along the river valley to the north and south and on to higher ground on the valley sides at Irlams o' th' Height and Higher Broughton. Unconsolidated glacial deposits along the riverbank at Broughton have caused several landslides along the riverbank. The City Engineer's Department of the City of Salford recorded one such incident near Great Clowes Street in February 1882, and others in 1886, 1887 and 1888. In 1892 the road was propped with timber supports. The tram service along the road was discontinued in 1925, and the road closed to <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> vehicles in January 1926. Further slips saw the road closed completely in July 1933, and although no substantial movements have been recorded since 1948 slow subsidence around the Cliff continues to this day.|$|E
500|$|According to Haynes, he [...] began {{laying out}} [...] "plans for the {{construction}} of a <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> vehicle for use on highways" [...] in 1891. His first idea was for a steam-powered vehicle, but after careful consideration he decided the use of [...] a furnace on the device would be too dangerous. His second plan was to use electrical power, but after research he found that no practical means existed to store the electricity required for operation. He continued to develop his plans until the summer of 1893 when he attended the Chicago World's Fair, where he first witnessed a gasoline engine. The demonstration of the newly invented engine inspired him to decide that an internal combustion engine would be the most practical method to propel his vehicle. A gasoline-powered European automobile built by German inventor Karl Benz (who patented the first automobile in 1886) also was on display during the fair, although it is unknown if Haynes witnessed this vehicle during his visit.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>mechanically</b> <b>propelled</b> two-wheel {{vehicle is}} {{believed}} {{by some to}} have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839. A nephew later claimed that his uncle developed a rear-wheel drive design using mid-mounted treadles connected by rods to a rear crank, similar to the transmission of a steam locomotive. Proponents associate him with the first recorded instance of a bicycling traffic offence, when a Glasgow newspaper reported in 1842 an accident in which an anonymous [...] "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" [...] knocked over a pedestrian in the Gorbals and was fined five British shillings. However, the evidence connecting this with MacMillan is weak, since {{it is unlikely that}} the artisan MacMillan would have been termed a gentleman, nor is the report clear on how many wheels the vehicle had.

40|$|The human {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is a remarkable}} organ, with prodigious length, surface area, cellular diversity, signalling capacity, and metabolic activity. Adult humans contain an estimated 10 times fewer human cells than microbial symbionts, which {{communicate with each other}} and disperse their metabolic functions, thus behaving like a multi-cellular organism. The intestinal surface is an important host organism–environment boundary, and interactions of gut microbes in the {{gastrointestinal tract}} very likely influence the mammalian metabolic phenotype. The mammalian-microbiome symbiotic relationship lends extraordinary capacity to human gut to physically <b>propel,</b> <b>mechanically</b> manipulate, enzymatically digest, and actively absorb nutrients from even the most intractable biological matrices. Gut microbiota were recently shown to vary significantly in obese animals and humans, and their essential role in energy recovery may be crucial in several metabolic variations. Manipulation of the microbiome either by probiotics, prebiotics, and/or by diet shows promise in improvement of human health. Probiotics appeared to offer considerable promise in the treatment of post-infective irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by modulating host metabolism and host-microbiota interactions. In addition, microbial-induced modifications of the intestinal metabolic profile were shown to be region dependent and correlated with the intestinal functions, as manifested by the effects on digestion, absorption, amino acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and protection from oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} of the cranial neural crest {{is an essential}} part of cranio-facial development in every vertebrate embryo. The cranial neural crest (CNC) is a transient population of cells that forms the lateral border of the anterior neural plate. In the tailbud stage Xenopus embryo, the neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, and undergo a large-scale migration from the dorsal to ventral region of the embryo. The CNC travels along distinct pathways, and populates specific regions of the embryos face. Once the CNC ceases migrating, it differentiates into a variety of tissues that are essential for cranio-facial structure and function. Some of these tissues include bones, muscle, cartilage, and ganglia. The CNC receives a concert of signals from neighboring tissues during and after CNC migration as well as signals transmitted among CNC cells, which act together to determine the fate of each CNC cell. Therefore, the proper {{migration of}} the CNC {{is an essential part}} of cranio-facial development. ^ What molecules are important for the process of CNC migration? As one might imagine, a milieu of different molecules and interactions are essential for this complicated embryological process to occur. The work presented in this dissertation will focus on the role of a cell adhesion molecule that is important for Xenopus CNC migration. Typically, the amount of cell adhesion decreases within tissues undergoing migration. This behavior is essential to allow fluidity within the tissue as it moves. However, cell adhesions are fundamental for cell migration to occur because the moving cells need a platform on which to <b>mechanically</b> <b>propel</b> themselves. These interactions can occur between the migrating cell and extracellular matrix molecules (ECM), or can happen between cells. ^ The cranial neural crest utilizes both cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions during the process of migration. The amount of cell adhesion mediated by either of these mechanisms will depend on where the cell is located within the CNC. Cells located at the periphery of the CNC tissue, which is surrounded by a matrix of ECM, will have more cell-ECM interactions. Cells located deeper in the CNC tissue, where there is little ECM, will rely more on cell-cell interactions. ^ The work presented in this thesis focuses on a cell-cell adhesion molecule that is part of the cadherin superfamily of molecules. With this in mind, these studies should be descriptive of the environment within the CNC, and to a less degree the environment between the CNC and the surrounding tissues. The work presented in this dissertation will focus on cadherin- 11, which is a classical cadherin that is specifically expressed in the cranial neural crest during its migration. How does cadherin- 11 function in the CNC during this process? The work presented here suggests that the main role of cadherin- 11 in the CNC is to perform as a cell adhesion molecule. However, too much cell adhesion is inhibitory to migration. In this respect, many of the studies described in this work indicate that cadherin- 11 mediated cell adhesion is tightly regulated during CNC migration. Here I show that cadherin- 11 is extracellularly processed by ADAM metalloproteases, ADAM 9 and ADAM 13, which removes the adhesive domain of cadherin- 11. This extracellular cleavage event occurs throughout CNC migration, and is likely the main mechanism that regulates cadherin- 11 mediated cell adhesion. Cleavage of cadherin- 11 by ADAMs does not seem to affect its ability to interact with cytoplasmic binding partners, β-catenin and p 120 -catenin. This observation supports the idea that the “purpose” of cadherin- 11 cleavage is to regulate cell adhesion, and not to induce (cell autonomous) signaling events. ^ Additionally, the secreted extracellular domain of cadherin- 11 (EC 1 - 3) retains biological activity. This fragment can bind to a number of cell surface molecules in tissue culture including full-length cadherin- 11 and specific members of the ADAM family. This observation suggests that EC 1 - 3 may interact with full-length cadherin- 11 molecules in vivo, and inhibit cadherin- 11 mediated cell adhesion during CNC migration. EC 1 - 3 can rescue CNC migration in embryos that overexpress cadherin- 11, further supporting this hypothesis. Many of the above observations have been published in my first-author paper entitled “Extracellular processing of cadherin- 11 by ADAM metalloproteases is essential for Xenopus cranial neural crest migration” published in the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell in 2009. ^ Some of the unpublished work in this dissertation further focuses on how EC 1 - 3 effects CNC migration in an ex vivo environment. During these studies, the observation was made that overexpression of EC 1 - 3 in a cranial neural crest explant produces abnormal directional movement. In these experiments, it appeared as though certain regions of the CNC explant were “attracting” other regions of the explant. The preliminary studies described in chapter IV are aimed at answering the question; does EC 1 - 3 attract migrating CNC cells? Here, we generated a Matlab program in order to effectively quantify the amount of directional movement of CNC explants presented with a source of EC 1 - 3. In addition to quantifying cell directionality, this program can also decipher between cells moving with random or directed motion, and measure the velocity of cell migration within certain coordinates. Therefore, this program should be useful other ex vivo studies that require the observation of these features. ^ To conclude, the work presented in this dissertation suggests that the role of cadherin- 11 during cranial neural crest migration is predominately based on the adhesive function. In order for CNC migration to proceed, the amount of cadherin- 11 mediated cell-cell adhesion is tightly regulated throughout this process. These cell-cell interactions are likely important for “sheet” and “branch” migration where CNC cells maintain a lot of cell-cell cohesion. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of an add-on handcycle, a crank system that can be {{placed in front of}} a wheelchair, handcycling was made widely available for daily life. With it, people go into town more easily, e. g. to do groceries; meet up with friends, etc. They have more independency and can be socially active. Our aim is to explore some settings of the handcycle, {{so that it can be}} optimally used as a transportation device. Therefore, the effects of cadence and added resistance on gross mechanical efficiency and force application during sub-maximal synchronous handcycling were investigated. We hypothesized that a cadence of 52 rpm with a higher resistance (35 W) would lead to a higher gross mechanical efficiency and a more tangential force application than a higher cadence of 70 rpm and no extra resistance (15 W). Twelve able-bodied men rode in an instrumented add-on handcycle on a motorized level treadmill at 1. 94 m/s. They performed three sessions of three four-minute blocks of steady state exercise. Gear (70, 60 and 52 rpm) was changed in-between the blocks and resistance (rolling resistance + 0 W, + 10 W, + 20 W) was changed across sessions, both in a counterbalanced order. 3 D force production, oxygen uptake and heart rate were measured continuously. Gross mechanical efficiency (ME) and fraction of effective force (FEF) were calculated as main outcomes. The effects of cadence and resistance were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA (P< 0. 05) with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc pairwise comparisons. With a decrease in cadence a slight increase in ME (70 rpm: 5. 5 (0. 2) %, 60 rpm: 5. 7 (0. 2) %, 52 rpm: 5. 8 (0. 2) %, P = 0. 008, η 2 p = 0. 38), while an increase in FEF (70 rpm: 58. 0 (3. 2) %, 60 rpm: 66. 0 (2. 8) %, 52 rpm: 71. 3 (2. 3) %, P< 0. 001, η 2 p = 0. 79) is seen simultaneously. Also with an increase in resistance an increase in ME (+ 0 W: 4. 0 (0. 2) %, + 10 W: 6. 0 (0. 3) %, + 20 W: 7. 0 (0. 2) %, P< 0. 001, η 2 p = 0. 92) and FEF (+ 0 W: 59. 0 (2. 9) %, + 10 W: 66. 1 (3. 4) %, + 20 W: 70. 2 (2. 4) %, P< 0. 001, η 2 p = 0. 56) was found. A cadence of 52 rpm against a higher resistance of about 35 W leads to a more optimal direction of forces and is more <b>mechanically</b> efficient than <b>propelling</b> at a higher cadence or lower resistance. Therefore, changing gears on a handcycle is important, and it is advised to keep the linear hand velocity relatively low for locomotion purposes...|$|R
