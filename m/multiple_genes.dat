5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among <b>multiple</b> <b>genes,</b> the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of <b>multiple</b> <b>genes</b> and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, <b>multiple</b> <b>genes</b> are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Deciphering the {{location}} of <b>gene</b> duplications and <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> duplication episodes on the Tree of Life is fundamental to understanding the way gene families and genomes evolve. The <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> duplication problem provides a framework for placing gene duplication events onto nodes of a given species tree, and detecting episodes of <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> duplication. One version of the <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> duplication problem was defined by Guigó et al. in 1996. Several heuristic solutions have since been proposed for this problem, but no exact algorithms were known. Results: In this article we solve this longstanding open problem by providing the first exact and efficient solution. We also demonstrate the improvement offered by our algorithm over the best heuristic approaches, by applying it to several simulated as well as empirical datasets. Contact...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{fundamental}} problem arising in the evolutionary molecular biology is {{to discover the}} locations of <b>gene</b> duplications and <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> duplication episodes based on the phylogenetic information. The solutions to the <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>GENE</b> DUPLICATION problems can provide useful clues to place the gene duplication events onto the locations of a species tree and to expose the <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> duplication episodes. In this paper, we study two variations of the <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>GENE</b> DUPLICATION problems: the EPISODE-CLUSTERING (EC) problem and the MINIMUM EPISODES (ME) problem. For the EC problem, we improve the results of Burleigh et al. with an optimal linear-time algorithm. For the ME problem, {{on the basis of}} the algorithm presented by Bansal and Eulenstein, we propose an optimal linear-time algorithm.

5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of <b>multiple</b> <b>genes,</b> cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E
5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by <b>multiple</b> <b>genes.</b> It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E
5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity and the influence of <b>multiple</b> <b>genes,</b> may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed.

In addition, our analyses show that LexA regulation of this <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> cassette is persistent in all the Phyla in which it has been detected, and suggest that this regulation is prompted by the combined activity of two of its constituent genes: a polymerase V homolog and an Alpha subunit of the DNA polymerase III...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>gene</b> {{knockout}} systems {{developed in}} the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius are powerful genetic tools. However, plasmid construction typically requires several steps. Alternatively, PCR tailing for high-throughput gene disruption was also developed in S. acidocaldarius, but repeated gene knockout based on PCR tailing has been limited {{due to lack of}} a genetic marker system. In this study, we demonstrated efficient homologous recombination frequency (2. 8 [*]×[*] 104 [*]±[*] 6. 9 [*]×[*] 103 colonies/μg DNA) by optimizing the transformation conditions. This optimized protocol allowed to develop reliable gene knockout via double crossover using short homologous arms and to establish the <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> knockout system with one-step PCR (MONSTER). In the MONSTER, a <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> knockout cassette was simply and rapidly constructed by one-step PCR without plasmid construction, and the PCR product can be immediately used for target gene deletion. As an example of the applications of this strategy, we successfully made a DNA photolyase- (phr-) and arginine decarboxylase- (argD-) deficient strain of S. acidocaldarius. In addition, an agmatine selection system consisting of an agmatine-auxotrophic strain and argD marker was also established. The MONSTER provides an alternative strategy that enables the very simple construction of <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> knockout cassettes for genetic studies in S. acidocaldarius...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in computational biology is {{the determination of}} the correct species tree for a set of taxa given a set of (possibly contradictory) gene trees. In recent literature, the Duplication and Loss model has received considerable attention.

40|$|Inactivation or {{selective}} modification {{is essential to}} elucidate the putative function of a gene. The present study describes an improved Cre-loxP-based method for markerless <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> deletion in Streptococcus mutans, the principal etiological agent of dental caries. This modified method uses two mutant loxP sites, which after recombination creates a double-mutant loxP site that is poorly recognized by Cre recombinase, facilitating <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> deletions in a single genetic background. The effectiveness of this modified strategy was demonstrated by the construction of both single and double gene deletions at the htrA and clpP loci on the chromosome of Streptococcus mutans. HtrA and ClpP play key roles in the processing and maturation of several important proteins, including many virulence factors. Deletion of these genes resulted in reducing the organism's ability to withstand exposure to low pH and oxidative agents. The method described here is simple and efficient and can be easily implemented for <b>multiple</b> <b>gene</b> deletions with S. mutans and other streptococci...|$|R

Identification of aberrant gene expression associated with colon carcinogenesis has increased significantly with application of gene array technologies.

The GenomeLab Genetic Analysis System presents a novel technology platform for quantitative multiplexed gene expression analysis. This report describes the custom design of a GeXP multiplexed assay used to assess expression profiles of 14 inflammatory gene targets in normal, polyp, and tumor tissue.
