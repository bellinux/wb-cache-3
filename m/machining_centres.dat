40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{availability}} and productivity of manufacturing systems, process monitoring has become an important matter in modern automated plants. The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are insufficient, especially for manufacturing processes of highly complicated and automated systems. Instead, multi-sensor based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multi-sensor based process monitoring system for an existing <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The general structure of the monitoring system and {{the implementation of the}} main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail...|$|R

40|$|International audienceKey {{performances}} of industrial {{systems can be}} characterised by performances both related to the system itself but also the product/service it is delivering. It can be particularised in the manufacturing domain, by the performances related to the part manufactured (e. g. dimensional deviation, surface roughness) and to the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> (e. g. productivity, availability). The mastering of {{these two types of}} performances is nowadays mostly considerate separately, in the sense that current approaches lead to control product or machine performances mainly in an isolated way. Only few approaches try to take them into account jointly to permit to control {{performances of}} one thanks to the control of performances of the other and this all along the time. Thus a challenge in manufacturing {{is to be able to}} control part deviations from the mastering of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> degradation. In that way, this paper is first proposing a review on current approaches able to support these two performance considerations and then to investigate scientifically, in the frame of automotive sector, a specific approach able to control part performances directly from <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> performance...|$|R
