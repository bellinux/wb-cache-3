40|$|Here {{we present}} a low cost, 3 D printed optical reader which is {{compatible}} with a disposable, finger actuated chip {{which can be used}} for rapid CD 4 + enumeration. This portable and widely autonomous device provides the next step in a workflow which can meet the WHO ASSURED requirements for assessment of HIV status in resource-poor settings. The reader is composed of 3 D printed parts where the microfluidic chip can be moved along the optical axis of the objective lens for focusing using a screw adapted from a <b>masonry</b> <b>bolt.</b> Performance of the reader shows good agreement with measurements made using a conventional inverted microscope...|$|E
5000|$|The Socialist Hall {{building}} is a two-story building which [...] "is {{an excellent example of}} craftsmanship and design in a two-part commercial block style building." [...] It faces east onto Harrison Avenue with a chocolate colored and beige brick facade. When nominated, it had about fifty <b>masonry</b> anchor <b>bolts</b> stabilizing the front facade.|$|R
40|$|Memorandum of {{material}} furnished for superstructure {{on the line}} of the Port Dalhousie Thorold Railway by contract. This document includes: Bills of timber, memorandums of planking, fencing, ties, track laying, <b>masonry</b> and <b>bolts</b> and spikes. There are also diagrams of culverts. One of the pages is loose and the outer pages are somewhat discoloured (32 pages, handwritten and bound with ribbon, n. d...|$|R
5000|$|Both climber and belayer {{attach the}} rope to their {{climbing}} harnesses. The rope is tied into the climber's harness with a figure-of-eight loop or double bowline knot. The leader either places their own protection or clips into permanent protection already {{attached to the}} rock. In traditional climbing, the protection generally is removable. However, many significant first ascents in the U.S. done {{with a combination of}} crack gear and bolts placed on lead were termed [...] "traditional" [...] at the time (see below discussion). Usually nuts or spring-loaded camming devices (often referred to as [...] "cams" [...] or [...] "friends") are set in cracks in the rock (although pitons are sometimes used). In sport climbing the protection is metal loops called hangers. Hangers are secured to the rock with either expanding <b>masonry</b> <b>bolts</b> taken from the construction industry, or by placing glue-in bolt systems. In ice climbing the protection is made-up of ice screws or similar devices hammered or screwed into the ice by the leader, and removed by the second climber.|$|R
50|$|Prof. Ian Robertson at the University of Hawaiʻi -Mānoa(UHM) has {{developed}} and tested the steel plate {{connections between the}} masonry. The result was a design method of a fuse plate that yields along its entire length, {{with the aim of}} creating a ductile energy dissipating fuse. Bolt pullout tests were also performed at UHM to validate the strength of the <b>masonry</b> with through <b>bolts.</b> A research team at Rice University develops computational models for the study of hybrid masonry structural systems. Profs. Larry A. Fahnestock and Daniel P. Abrams are performing full scale experimental tests on hybrid masonry at the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation(NEES) site at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.|$|R
