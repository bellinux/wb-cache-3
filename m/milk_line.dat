25|$|Cadbury Dairy Milk is a {{brand of}} milk {{chocolate}} manufactured by Cadbury. It {{was introduced in the}} United Kingdom in 1905 and now consists of a number of products. Every product in the Dairy <b>Milk</b> <b>line</b> is made with exclusively milk chocolate. In 2014, Dairy Milk was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar in the UK. It is manufactured and distributed by the Hershey Company in the U.S. under license from Cadbury.|$|E
25|$|Somatic cells {{originate}} {{only from}} inside the animal's udder, while bacteria are usually from external contamination, such as insufficient cleaning of the milk transport equipment or insufficient external cleansing of the cow’s udder and teats prior to milking. Milking equipment can also be accidentally knocked or kicked off an animal onto the floor, and contaminants on the barn floor can be sucked into the <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> by the system vacuum. A filter sock or filter disk in the pipeline prevents large particulate contaminants from entering the milk bulk tank, but cannot remove bacterial contamination once it has occurred.|$|E

50|$|In human {{embryogenesis}} the mammary ridge usually {{appears as}} a narrow, microscopic ectodermal thickening during the first seven weeks of pregnancy and grows caudally as a narrow, linear ridge. In many mammals, these glands first appear as elevated ridges along the <b>milk</b> <b>lines,</b> which then separate into individual buds located in regions lateral to the ventral midline. The location of these buds varies according to species: they {{are located in the}} thoracic region in primates, in the inguinal area in ungulates, and along {{the entire length of the}} trunk in rodents and pigs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number and}} {{positioning}} of mammary glands and teats varies widely among mammals.

Clinical examination showed an approximately 6 cm large subcutaneous mass covered by apparently normal-looking skin. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was found. The mass was excised with the clinical diagnosis of fibroma. Histologically, the lesion was consistent with mammary-type myofibroblastoma of soft tissue, a very rare, benign mesenchymal neoplasm with myofibroblastic differentiation. After surgical excision she was free of recurrence {{over a period of}} 8 months.

50|$|In humans, milk lines form as thickenings of the {{epidermis}} of the mammary ridge, {{along the}} front surface of both sexes of mammals. Milk lines appear in the seventh week of embryonic development before human sexual differentiation, which explains why male humans have nipples. After initial development of the milk lines they go into remission. Most humans have two nipples, {{but in some cases}} more than two will develop. These additional nipples usually grow along the <b>milk</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A mammary ridge, or crest, usually stops {{growing at}} eight weeks and its length is regressed {{starting}} at the caudal end and extending cranially, [...] so that what remains is a round, ectodermic placode where the axilla develops. When shortening of the mammary crest is complete, the structure remains prominent in the areas where the mammary glands eventually form. The mammary lines begin to shorten and ectodermal cells begin to divide and grow into the mesenchymal cell layer. A basement membrane separating the expanding ectodermal crest structure and the underlying mesoderm usually remains. The mammary ridge then becomes recognizable in the thoracic region in the human embryo. Nipples develop on the <b>milk</b> <b>lines</b> of mammals.|$|R
5000|$|The breasts of {{the adult}} human female vary from most other mammals that tend to have less {{conspicuous}} mammary glands. The number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals.

50|$|Embryonic {{mammary gland}} {{development}} {{can be divided}} into a series of specific stages. Initially, the formation of the milk lines that run between the fore and hind limbs bilaterally {{on each side of the}} midline occurs around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). The second stage occurs at E11.5 when placode formation begins along the mammary <b>milk</b> <b>line.</b> This will eventually give rise to the nipple. Lastly, the third stage occurs at E12.5 and involves the invagination of cells within the placode into the mesenchyme, leading to a mammary anlage (biology).|$|E
50|$|An {{abnormal}} mass in a child's developing breast {{or early}} development of breast tissue may prompt concern. Neonates can have small breast buds at birth or white discharge (witches' milk), caused {{by exposure to}} transplacental hormones in utero. These phenomena are not pathological and typically disappear over the first weeks to months of life. Accessory nipples (polythelia) occur in 1% of children along the embryonic <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> and are benign in most cases. They may be removed surgically if they develop glandular tissue and cause pain, have discharge, or develop fibroadenomas.|$|E

5000|$|Lower {{milk quality}} - Somatic cell count (SCC) and Plate loop count (PLC) are, respectively, {{measurements}} of the quantity of white blood cells and total number of bacteria present in a milk sample. A high SCC indicates reduced udder health (as the immune system fights some infection) and implies lower milk quality. AMS herds consistently show higher SCCs than conventionally milked herds. A high PLC indicates bacterial contamination, usually through poor sanitation or cooling and similarly implies low milk quality. High PLC in AMS {{may be attributed to}} the continuous use of <b>milking</b> <b>lines</b> (rather than twice a day in conventional systems), which reduces the time window for cleaning, and the incremental addition of milk to the bulk milk tank which may not cool efficiently at low milk levels.|$|R

5000|$|The 1940s dairy is a {{rectangular}} timber building, partly {{open to the}} east. It has single-skin walls clad with weatherboards and a gabled roof clad with metal sheets which extends to cover a small verandah to the north-east.

50|$|An udder is {{an organ}} formed of the mammary glands of female four-legged mammals, {{particularly}} ruminants such as cattle, goats, sheep and deer. It {{is equivalent to}} the breast in primates. The udder is a single mass hanging beneath the animal, consisting of pairs of mammary glands. In cattle there are normally two pairs, in sheep, goats and deer there is one pair, and in some animals such as pigs there are many pairs. In animals with udders, the mammary glands develop on the <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> near the groin, and mammary glands that develop on the chest (such as in humans and apes) are generally referred to as breasts.|$|E

40|$|The {{project was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the time for harvesting maize ('Zea mays L) grain at its best physiological quality {{and the use of}} kernel <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> as an indicator of the harvest maturity. The study also assessed the methods used by small scale farmers to determine the harvest maturity for maize grain. The study {{was carried out}} in Ntabazinduna, uMguza District where the survey was conducted and the maize was grown in plots. Varieties SC 401, SC 403 and SC 513 were grown. Then sampling was done at four stages which were 40 days after female flowering, 47 days after female flowering, 55 days and 62 days after female flowering. Grain dry weight, moisture content, dryness of the stalk and the grain <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> development were analysed. The physiological quality of the grain was assessed using a combination of those four characteristics. The <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> at stage four proved to be the best indicator of the time to harvest maize grain for maximum physiological quality because different stages of kernel <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> development in maize grain could be easily identified in the field without any special equipment and it proved to be more accurate. The study showed that the kernel <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> development was due to a reduction in the grain moisture content as the endosperm was solidifying and during that process the dry weight was increasing. There was a significant dependence of the moisture content on the stage of maturity of the maize grain. The survey showed that most farmers in Ntabazinduna were using the black layer formation, the dryness of the stem and the leaves as indicators of harvest maturity. They had no idea on the relevance of kernel <b>milk</b> <b>line</b> so it was recommended that they get trained on its use...|$|E
