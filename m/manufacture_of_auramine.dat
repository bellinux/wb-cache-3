Evidence for {{carcinogenicity}} {{to humans}} (inadequate for auramine, technical-grade; sufficíent for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>auramine)</b> The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>auramine</b> (which also involves exposure to other chemicals) was {{judged to be}} causally {{associated with an increased}} incidence ofbladder cancer on the basis of one study dealing with experiences {{in the first half of}} the century in the UK 1. Data reported later, in two studies dealing with one group ofworkers in the Federal Republic of Germany involved in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>auramine,</b> were judged to show increased risks of both bladder cancer and prostatic cancer; however, these workers had also been exposed to other chemicals, inc 1 uding 2 -naphthylamine (see p. 261) 2, 3. ln a study of mortality and cancer incidence among hairdressers, the hypothesis was raised that the observed excess risk of bladder cancer was associated with exposure to colouring agents present in briliantines used on men's hair. Auramine was reported to be one of the most commonly used dyes in brilliantines, at least in the 1930 s; however, the occurrence of impurities, such as 2 -naphthylamine could not be ruled out 4.

40|$|A novel immunochromatographic membrane-based assay for the {{detection}} of specific IgG antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated in patients with active tuberculosis in a low-prevalence population. The sensitivity of the test for detecting active tuberculosis was 41. 5 % (17 / 41 patients positive); its specificity in a group of patients with other lung diseases was 91. 4 % (3 / 35 false positive), while in a group of 47 healthy controls it was 100 %. The sensitivity of the immunochromatographic test equaled that <b>of</b> <b>auramine</b> staining, but different subsets of tuberculosis patients were detected by the two tests.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{confinement}} on the ultrafast torsional reaction <b>of</b> <b>auramine</b> O {{in aqueous solution}} are investigated through ultrafast fluorescence up-conversion with 50 fs time resolution. The aqueous solution is confined in nanoscale water droplets by an ionic surfactant. The torsional motion is orders of magnitude slower in the confined droplets than in bulk aqueous solution. The dynamics become faster with increasing radius of the nanodroplet but never reach the bulk value, even when the radius is as large as 10 nm. Time-dependent fluorescence spectra were constructed and subsequently analyzed using a one-dimensional generalized Smoluchowski equation. An accurate description of the data was achieved using a time-dependent diffusion coefficient. This is suggested to arise because the medium friction reflects dynamics on {{a broad range of}} time scales spanning the reaction dynamics. The friction recovered suggests strongly hindered motion in the confined droplet and can be qualitatively related to solvation dynamics measured in AOT, consistent with auramine O torsional dynamics being accompanied by intramolecular charge redistribution...|$|R
