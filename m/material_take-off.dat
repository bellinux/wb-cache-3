40|$|Crude oil is {{becoming}} scarcer and more expensive, resulting in alternative biobased or partially biobased materials gaining {{importance in the}} field of plastic packaging and encouraging the development of naturally derived, protein-based plastics (Endres, 2009; Jones and McClements, Compreh. Rev. Food Sci. Food Safety 2010, 9, 374; Khwaldia et al., Compreh. Rev. Food Sci. Food Safety 2010, 9, 374). A strategy to improve extrusion processing behavior of proteins is the blending with other polymers. In this study ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) was used for such purpose. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the properties of blends of thermoplastic whey protein (TPP) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). Mechanical and barrier properties were tested. Blends of differing TPP/EVA ratio were produced and extruded into flat films. Morphological analysis of the blends shows immiscibility of the TPP and EVA, greatly influencing the mechanical properties. Young's modulus measurements shows the values approached that of pure EVA with increasing EVA ratios. At values of about 21 MPa, corresponding to EVA ratios of 30 % (w/w) and above, continuous extrusion including <b>material</b> <b>take-off</b> was possible. At higher whey protein ratios in the blends the water vapor transmission rate increased, i. e., the higher water vapor transmission rate of whey protein compared with EVA dominated this property. This study showed that whey proteins can be utilized for extrusion by blending with EVA...|$|E
40|$|Building {{information}} modelling (BIM) is an emerging {{technology in the}} construction industry, although the concept has existed {{for more than two}} decades. With more BIM pilot projects in place, the industry has an increasing interest in and body of BIM knowledge. The experience and findings using BIM in <b>materials</b> <b>take-off</b> in a Hong Kong project are presented in this chapter. A common current contention is that BIM could replace quantity surveyors in construction projects. To examine the possible veracity of such a statement a study has been made of the differences between model quantities and bills of quantities according to the stipulated standard methods of measurement. The examples and illustrations are taken from a project in which the authors are involved, together with an intensive literature review. The findings clearly show the limitations of BIM in <b>materials</b> <b>take-off</b> and the importance of quantity surveyors in that process. Quantity surveyors were observed to have a strong involvement with BIM in the project design process, stronger and more pertinent than those involved in the traditional two-dimensional drafting practice.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} overhead {{water tanks}} {{are used to}} store and supply safe drinking water. Design and cost estimation of overhead water tanks is a time consuming task, which requires {{a great deal of}} expertise. This study therefore examines the efficiency of Rectangular and Circular tanks. Tanks of 30 m 3, 90 m 3, 140 m 3 and 170 m 3 capacities were used in order to draw reasonable inferences on tank‟s shape design effectiveness, relative cost implications of tank types and structural capacities. Limit state design criteria were used for basic tank‟s construction materials- steel reinforcement, concrete and formwork were taken-off from the prepared structural drawings. Results of the <b>material</b> <b>take-offs</b> showed that, for each of the shapes, the amount of each structural materials increase as the tank capacity increases. Also Circular-shaped tank consumed lesser individual material as compared to Rectangular ones. Hence, this will give Circular-shaped tanks a more favoured selection over the rectangular shaped tanks...|$|R
40|$|An {{outline of}} {{relevant}} technical literature {{shows that there}} are only very few reference values available on machinability of flexible packaging <b>materials.</b> <b>Take-off</b> trials using 24 standard materials on a pouch making machine type Transwrap 125 H were expected to contribute to offering remedial measures for this shortcoming. Bending stiffness, coefficient of friction and tensile strength turned out to be determinant for runnability. Depending on the type of machine available, there is an upper limit of bending stiffness and coefficient of friction; values above these limits will considerably complicate processing. In the present case, bending stiffness was abt. 80 mNm²/m and the coefficient of friction was abt. 0, 2. An acute risk of break was indicated, when the tensile strength of packaging materials was less than the quintuple of the relevant take-off forces. Measures to improving runnability are being aimed at by manipulating the gliding qualities, though variations of bending stiffness would be more efficient. Practice today includes powdering of packaging materials and pasting Teflon strips on to machine parts. Machine-dependent aspects of machinability will further be dealt with...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of buildings require {{a high level of}} collaboration and coordination among the disciplines of architecture, engineering, and construction. Efficiencies can be gained through the sharing of data across disciplines; however, this prospect has not been fully realized. Traditionally, building energy models have been created separately from architectural building information models (BIMs), and energy analyses have relied on a single analysis tool. By leveraging existing data from the BIM, energy models can be generated more quickly and the use of multiple analysis tools is more practical. A set of three instructional modules is used to demonstrate BIM-based methods of building energy analysis and simulation. The workflow leverages existing data in the architectural model for energy analysis, as opposed to creating separate models within each analysis program. Autodesk Revit Architecture is used to create a building information model based on a residential dwelling designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Relevant data from the building information model is exported to two separate analysis tools - Autodesk Ecotect and DesignBuilder. Ecotect is used to provide early feedback on weather, heating and cooling loads, and heat loss information, and DesignBuilder is used to evaluate the effect of adding various energy conservation measures (ECMs). The two programs are used in conjunction to analyze the effects of solar orientation and passive solar design elements. The BIM data is able to successfully generate the two external energy analysis models. Some issues are encountered in the process of importing BIM data into the analysis tools; however, all issues are able to be resolved. The features of the BIM workflow found to add the most value are the ability to export building geometry and thermal zone information and the ability to use <b>material</b> <b>take-offs</b> for comparing the cost of design alternatives. Simulation results from Ecotect and DesignBuilder show a 15 % difference in annual heating and cooling energy between the best case and worst case passive solar design strategies. Results from the DesignBuilder ECM study indicate that a total energy savings of 21 % can be achieved cost-effectively compared to a baseline design, for a 10 -year time horizon...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of Slipforming operations is critical due to operation’s linearity {{that is considered}} a source of planning and proper cost management complications. This paper is presented to assist practitioners and researchers for automating the process of generation both time schedules and costs estimates simultaneously for Slipform projects by developing an Integrated BIM- based and DES software and framework. The BIM Schedule and Cost integrated (BSCI) framework reinforces both BIM and DES capabilities, enhanced by BIMs extracted information the quantities are used to generate DES input data in order to calculate the execution times for construction processes and exchange data through various software. Proposed research framework consists of: 1) Slipform BIM model that exports <b>material</b> quantity <b>take-offs,</b> schedules and required resources to an external database, 2) Discrete Event Simulation model encountering complete specification of the interdependencies between activities and resources and 3) Intelligent model that automatically collects, transfers and reserve data among various software programs. Furthermore, to illustrate the software’s functionality a preliminary prototype was developed for a Slipform case of study and validation of the software was conducted for evaluation purposes that showed robust results of 98 % for Schedule generation and 96...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry contributes the largest portion of waste to landfill, and it consumes {{a significant proportion}} of mineral resources excavated from nature. Due to adverse environmental impacts of waste generation, as well as financial gains associated with its minimization, waste intensiveness of the industry has remained a major concern across nations. This study investigates the design, procurement and construction strategies for waste minimization, using a dynamic approach. Apart from an investigation of the key and underlying measures for construction waste mitigation, the study considers the interrelationship between stages of projects' lifecycle. This is as activities carried out at an earlier stage are capable of engendering occurrences at later stages of the dynamic project delivery processes. Following the tenets of critical realism philosophy and exploratory sequential mixed method, the study combined qualitative and quantitative approaches at intensive and extensive stages respectively. At the early stage of the study, data were collected through literature review and focus group discussions with industry experts. Results of the qualitative study were used to develop a questionnaire, which was analysed using statistical approach and structural equation modelling. As a means of investigating the key drivers of waste minimization at a holistic level, a system dynamic model was developed to simulate the interplay and effects of different strategies that were confirmed through the previous process. The study suggests that design stage has the most decisive impacts on construction waste minimization. At this stage, the key dimensions for designing out waste include design for modern methods of construction, collaborative design process, design for standardisation and waste-efficient design documentation. Error-free design and involvement of contractors at early design stage are part of the critical success factors for designing out waste. With design being much important for waste minimization, competencies of design in terms of waste behavioural competency, design task proficiency, construction-related knowledge and inter-professional collaborative competency are essential for designing out waste. Materials procurement process could enhance waste minimization by considering its key dimensions for driving waste-efficient projects, which includes waste-efficient materials purchase management, suppliers' alliance and waste-efficient bill of quantity. Efficient <b>materials</b> <b>take-off</b> and take back scheme are confirmed as critical success factors for driving waste minimization through materials procurement processes. During construction activities, waste could be reduced through prefabrication and offsite technology, contractual requirements, maximisation of materials reuse and improved collaboration, among others. Prefabrication, supply chain alliance and collaborative procurement routes are confirmed as the critical success factors for reducing waste during construction process. Dynamic interplay among these sets of strategies suggests that notwithstanding the significance of the different measures during design, procurement and construction processes, prefabrication technology and collaborative procurement route are the holistic drivers of construction waste minimisation. The study implies that designers could effectively drive waste minimization through dimensional coordination and standardisation of design in line with standard materials supplies. In addition to the need for prefabrication and offsite technologies, increasing collaboration among project team is requisite to reducing waste generated by construction activities. By implementing the strategies suggested in the study, substantial proportion of construction waste would be diverted from landfill...|$|R
40|$|RONO: 00 Background: Factors {{affecting}} kinematic {{parameters of}} jump stride {{have not been}} quantitatively identified in horses jumping cross country fences. Aim: A field study determined whether endurance exercise affected jump stride kinematic parameters of the hind limb at <b>take-off.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Ten horses (age 7. 9 ? 2. 13 y; mixed breed and experience) were videoed using sagittal plane video (50 Hz) jumping {{the first and last}} fence of a cross country course (D 1). Two weeks later each horse performed an endurance exercise, followed by completing the same cross country course, again videoed at the first and last fence (D 2). The endurance exercise comprised of roads and tracks (2000 m), gallop (1300 m) and roads and tracks (4000 m) ridden in series, within a target time appropriate for each phase. Skin markers were placed to identify limb joint centres. Videos were automatically digitized using Equinalysis software. Kinematic variables analysed were: tarsal flexion at 0 % stance; tarsal flexion at the last point of contact; stance duration. Variables were compared between D 1 and D 2 and within day between first and last jump. Results: No significance difference occurred for any parameter between D 1 and D 2. Within day, no significant difference occurred between first and last jump for tarsal flexion at the last point of contact or stance duration. On D 2 a significant increase occurred in tarsal flexion at 0 % stance at the last compared to the first jump (143. 5 o first versus 148. 3 o last jump; P= 0. 019). Conclusion: Endurance exercise before commencing a cross country course may decrease hindquarter power generation resulting in a reduced crouching onto the hocks and a larger angle of tarsal flexion at take-off at the end of cross country performance. Research is needed to substantiate the effects of endurance exercise on tarsal flexion at take-off using a controlled population of horses. Non peer reviewe...|$|R
