It's such a rush to be performing. I like to see everybody's faces on stage, to see the reaction. Normally, you can only see the front row because of the lights. So you'll see a lot of (<b>my)</b> <b>energy...</b> but there are also going to be other moments that I hope are artistically energetic. I want people to feel things up close" ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, Corgan {{announced}} on the band's website that Chamberlin {{had left the}} group and would be replaced. Chamberlin subsequently stated that his departure from the band is [...] "a positive move forward for me. I can no longer commit all of <b>my</b> <b>energy</b> into something that I don't fully possess." [...] Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable, commenting, [...] "I am glad [...] has chosen to continue under the name. It is his right." [...] Chamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw, which has released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear. In July 2009, Billy Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky, initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of The Seeds, who had recently died. The following month Corgan confirmed on the band's website that 19-year-old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair was working on new Pumpkins recordings.|$|E
500|$|Fantastics {{circulation}} {{was about}} 37,000 when White took over; only about 4 {{percent of this}} was subscription sales. [...] Cohen's wife filled the subscriptions from their garage, and according to White, Cohen regarded this as a burden, and never tried to increase the subscription base. [...] Despite White's efforts, Fantastics circulation fell, from almost 37,000 {{when he took over}} as editor to less than 24,000 in the summer of 1975. [...] Cohen was rumored to be interested in selling both Fantastic and Amazing; among other possibilities, both Roger Elwood, at that time an active science fiction anthology editor, and Edward Ferman, the editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, approached Cohen with a view to acquiring the titles. [...] Nothing came of it, however, and White was not aware of the possible sales. [...] He was working at a low salary, with unpaid help from friends to read unsolicited submissions—at one point he introduced a 25-cent reading fee for manuscripts from unpublished writers; the fee would be refunded if White bought the story. [...] White sometimes found himself at odds with Cohen's business partner, Arthur Bernhard, due to their different political views. [...] White's unhappiness with his working conditions culminated in his resignation after Cohen refused his proposal to publish Fantastic as a slick magazine, with larger pages and higher quality paper. [...] White commented in an article in Science Fiction Review that he had brought to the magazines [...] "a lot of energy and enthusiasm and a great many ideas for their improvement ...Well, I have put into effect nearly every idea which I was allowed to follow through on ... and have spent most of <b>my</b> <b>energy</b> and enthusiasm." [...] Cohen was able to persuade him to stay for another year; in the event White stayed for another three.|$|E

500|$|The kiss {{generated}} strong {{reaction from}} {{the media and the}} celebrities alike. Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing <b>my</b> <b>energy</b> on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E
500|$|The medley track [...] "Like a Virgin/Hollywood" [...] was {{performed}} {{during the opening}} of the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 27, 2003, where Madonna was joined by Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott. The performance started with Spears appearing on stage on top of a giant wedding cake while wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] before Aguilera appeared from behind the cake and joined her. Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and a hat and started singing [...] "Hollywood" [...] before proceeding to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips. Missy Elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song [...] "Work It" [...] halfway through the performance. The kiss generated strong reaction from the media. Feminist author Camille Paglia described the moment as great; she noted that the kiss was like Madonna saying to Spears, [...] "I'm passing the torch to you." [...] However, according to her, Spears could not take advantage of the kiss as later her career and lifestyle came under immense media scrutiny and criticism. Paglia said that [...] "literally from that kiss, from that moment onward, Britney has spiraled out of control. It's like Madonna gave her the kiss of death!" [...] Madonna commented on the kiss; [...] "I am the mommy pop star and she is the baby pop star. And I am kissing her to pass <b>my</b> <b>energy</b> on to her." [...] This performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

I know I can do all of this a lot better'." [...] After a period of being angry, Delta felt she was healed and embraced herself and being in the public eye. Therefore, she started developing a new album, stating, [...] "For a while I was writing songs for this album I didn't want to talk about things, so I didn't want to write about them either. [...] "I had to get over a couple of things. My parents divorced, there was a lot going on. But now I truly am inspired again. I feel regenerated.

2500|$|Harrison's first {{assignment}} {{under her}} new Fox contract {{was as a}} [...] "Biker Chick" [...] in Men Against Evil, a TV pilot which became the TV series Felony Squad. [...] "I had three words, [...] "Go, man, go!" [...] I was all of 20, and dressed in this really racy motorcycle outfit. Those were my first words! This was still the era of stardom and premieres. When you were put under a studio contract, every minute of your life was so exciting, because you were doing something so unique and special." [...] (Three years later, Harrison co-starred as Felony Squad star Dennis Cole's love interest in the NBC TV series Bracken's World.) Harrison's next assignment was in the campy Batman TV series; she appeared briefly as one of three high school cheerleaders in the Batman episodes [...] "The Joker Goes to School" [...] and [...] "He Meets His Match, The Grisly Ghoul", which aired in early March 1966. To prepare Harrison for her few seconds onscreen, her Fox dance coach worked Harrison and her fellow cheerleaders {{early in the morning}} and on through the day. Linda, a former high school cheerleader, complained, [...] "You're going to use up all <b>my</b> <b>energy,</b> so when the shot comes, I won't have any."
