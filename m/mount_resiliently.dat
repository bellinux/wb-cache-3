40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematical}} model of static and dynamic {{calculation of the}} improved design of balancing device with the hydraulically unloaded <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> ring is represented in work. For the dynamic analysis of system {{it is necessary to}} consider the connected oscillations of <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> ring and disk of balancing device. For the improved design device rigidity of the disk is much more than rigidity of the <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> ring. Therefore at calculation of the balancing device special attention is to be paid to dynamic analysis of axially moving ring. The forced angular oscillations of ring, which are caused by a possible misalignment of the rotating disk, are also considered...|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} from conventional wire-brushing with an angle grinder lies {{first with the}} mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional rotary brush, the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are <b>mounted</b> <b>resiliently</b> in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed [...] 'accelerator bar' , which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact {{the surface of the}} workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple rotary brush at the same speed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonintrusive and electromagnetically self-powered embedded system with vibration sensor for condition monitoring of electromechanical machinery. This {{system can be}} installed inside the terminal block of a motor or generator and supports wireless communication for transferring data to a mobile device or computer for subsequent performance analysis. As an initial application, the sensor package is configured for automated condition monitoring of <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> machines. Upon detecting a spin-down event, e. g. a motor turnoff, the system collects and transmits vibration and residual backemf data as the rotor decreases in rotational speed. This data is then processed to generate an empirical vibrational transfer function (eVTF) rich in condition information for detecting and differentiating machinery and vibrational mount pathologies. The utility of this system is demonstrated via lab-based tests of a <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> 1. 1 kW three-phase induction motor, with results showcasing {{the usefulness of the}} embedded system for condition monitoring...|$|R

Like the exterior hull, these bulkheads were designed to withstand pressure up to depths of [...] The reactors were additionally encased in [...] of steel and <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> to absorb shocks in excess of 50G. The bulkheads of the fifth compartment withstood both explosions, allowing the two reactors to shut down automatically and prevent a nuclear meltdown and widespread contamination of the sea.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the local dynamic coupling between closely spaced actuator–sensor pairs {{mounted on a}} light honeycomb structure, with an accelerometer as a sensor and either force or piezoceramic actuator. This initial work is carried out on a <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> honeycomb beam structure and {{it is found that}} the compliance of the honeycomb core significantly affects the coupling if the actuator and sensor are closely located {{on opposite sides of the}} beam. The experimentally observed local dynamic coupling is modelled by a single-degree-of-freedom mass–spring–damper system. The effect of this coupling on the stability and performance of a direct velocity feedback control system is examined, and is shown to provide an inherently stabilising mechanism when using a piezoceramic actuator...|$|R
40|$|On board ships, {{to avoid}} {{high levels of}} {{structure-borne}} noise due to marine four strokes diesel engines, the latter are usually <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted.</b> In order to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} decoupling between the diesel engines and the ship structures, {{it is important to have}} available tools and numerical models that simulate the dynamic behaviour of the isolator system as well as of the receiving structures. In the paper, after an introduction to the basics for the characterization of passive resilient mounts in high frequency range, an FE non-linear dynamic model of the isolator is presented. Such model takes into account the dynamics of the cast-iron parts, the contact between the top and base casting with the rubber core and the non-linear behaviour of the constitutive law of rubber. A procedure to achieve the characteristics parameters of rubbers is presented. The simulations have been then validated by experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|Annular {{components}} are used widely in engineering systems and include bearing bushes and races, {{which may be}} exposed to extreme operating conditions. A method to establish the localized transient thermoelastic deformation of a homogeneous two-dimensional annular component is developed. The analysis is based on solving the thermoelasticity equations using a state space formulation for the Fourier components of the radial and tangential displacements. Two boundary conditions are considered, namely, rigid and <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> outer boundaries, both associated with stress free inner boundary conditions. The thermoelastic solution is then demonstrated for a transient temperature distribution induced by inner boundary frictional heating due to rotor contact, which is derived from a dynamic Hertzian pressure distribution. The application is. to a relatively short auxiliary bearing for which a state of plane stress is appropriate. However, the thermoelastic analysis is generalized to cover cases of plane strain and plane stress...|$|R
40|$|Auxiliary {{bearings}} {{are used}} to prevent rotor/stator contact in active magnetic bearing systems. They are sacrificial components providing a physical limit on the rotor displacement. During rotor/auxiliary bearing contact significant forces normal to the contact zone may occur. Furthermore, rotor slip and rub can lead to localized frictional heating. Linear control strategies may also become ineffective or induce instability due to changes in rotordynamic characteristics during contact periods. This work considers the concept of using actively controlled auxiliary bearings in magnetic bearing systems. Auxiliary bearing controller design is focused on attenuating bearing vibration resulting from contact and reducing the contact forces. Controller optimization {{is based on the}} H-infinity norm with appropriate weighting functions applied to the error and control signals. The controller is assessed using a simulated rotor/magnetic bearing system. Comparison of the performance of an actively controlled auxiliary bearing is made with that of a <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> auxiliary bearing. Rotor drop tests, repeated contact tests, and sudden rotor unbalance resulting in trapped contact modes are considered...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the use of triangularly shaped actuators for the implementation of direct velocity feedback (DVFB) control on a <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> beam. The effects on the stability is investigated of boundary conditions and the shape of the actuator. For practical boundary conditions, with a combination of the rotational and linear springs, it is found that the linear spring is the principal component affecting the stability and thus the control performance. The stiffness of this spring has to be high enough to approximate a simply supported boundary condition for good performance. The amplitude of the sensor-actuator frequency response function increases as the top angle and the height of the triangular actuator is increased so that control effort can be saved. However, as the height of the actuator is increased, the stability margin reduces. Therefore, for the given beam there is an actuator shape that gives the best compromise between the stability and control effort. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{theoretical and}} experimental {{work on the}} feedback control of sound radiation from honeycomb panels using piezoceramic actuators. It is motivated by the problem of sound transmission in aircraft, specifically the active control of trim panels. Trim panels are generally honeycomb structures {{designed to meet the}} design requirement of low weight and high stiffness. They are <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> to the fuselage for the passive reduction of noise transmission. Local coupling of the closely spaced sensor and actuator was observed experimentally and modeled using a single degree of freedom system. The effect of the local coupling was to roll off the response between the actuator and sensor at high frequencies, so that a feedback control system can have high gain margins. Unfortunately, only relatively poor global performance is then achieved because of localization of reduction around the actuator. This localization prompts the investigation of a multichannel active control system. Globalized reduction was predicted using a model of 12 -channel direct velocity feedback control. The multichannel system, however, does not appear to yield a significant improvement in the performance because of decreased gain margi...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a {{research}} project that examines flanking sound transmission involving lightweight gypsum board walls using SEA. There are multiple transmission paths between any two gypsum board surfaces coupled by the junction. This is because the gypsum board leaves of a wall are often <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> to the studs, which forms a cavity and transverse velocity {{is not the same}} {{on either side of the}} wall. Often the assumption is made that power flow occurs along every path independently and the power balance method is applied to estimate the flanking transmission along every path independently. This approach overestimates the power flow along each of the single paths, since their magnitude is a complex function of the wall structure. However, two different approaches of application of the power balance method to estimate the total flanking sound transmission between two rooms from measured surface velocity level differences between two leaves are presented in this paper. One is a common approach that was already applied in earlier work to identify the relative importance of the different paths that might contribute to the overall transmission at the regarded junction. The velocity level difference is measured between the surfaces of the flanking walls that are exposed two the source and receiving room respectively where the first is excited structurally. In the second, the modified measurement approach, the surface velocity of the wall that is not exposed to the source room is measured instead to get some benefit in predicting the structural response of this leaf to airborne excitation in the source room. The results of the methods are compared and the advantages as well as the disadvantages of both methods are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{our knowledge of the}} sound transmission and radiation processes of lightweight wall and floor structures, theoretical models are needed. Detailed models may form a valuable tool. In lightweight floor structures, impact sound insulation is perhaps the most important property to consider. This thesis presents an overview of various solution strategies that may be useful in finding a theoretical model for impact sound insulation. Expressions for the point mobility of infinite plates driven by a rigid indenter are derived. These expressions are needed when determining the deformation close to the excitation area, which is important when studying impact noise to properly describe the interaction between the source and the floor. A detailed three-dimensional thick-plate analysis is used. The excitating pressure is found by means of a variational formulation. The point mobility is calculated by means of numerical integration. The excitation force provided by the ISO tapping machine is examined, partly in relation to the three-dimensional deformation analysis. Results found in the literature are reviewed and reconsidered. Low-frequency asymptotes are derived. A more general impact force description is derived, suited for arbitrary frequency-dependent mobilities of the floor structure. The frequency-dependency of the mobility can be due to local effects, investigated by means of thick-plate theory, and/or global effects, investigated by means of a spatial Fourier transform method. A theoretical model for a point-excited simple lightweight floor is presented. The model is used for the prediction of impact noise level. A comparison between numerical computations and measurements found in the literature is performed. A relatively good correspondence between measurements and calculations can be achieved. Lightweight walls (and floors) are often designed as a framework of studs with plates on each side. The studs can be seen as walls in the cavity, thus introducing finiteness. A prediction model for airborne sound insulation including these effects is presented. Due to variabilities, no structure can be perfectly periodic. The effects of near-periodicity are studied by means of transform technique and the expectation operator. The near-periodicity leads to an increase of the damping (if material damping is present). Resilient devices are commonly used in lightweight structures to decrease the sound transmission in a broad frequency band. Applications of such devices may be found, for example, in <b>resiliently</b> <b>mounted</b> ceilings in aeroplanes, ships and buildings. A measurement method to characterise the two-port acoustic properties of resilient devices is presented...|$|R
