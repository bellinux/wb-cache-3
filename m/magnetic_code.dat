The following parameters are varied to minimize the energy of the system: relative amount of magnetization orientation within the bar code area in any orientation, width of the bars, and distribution of wider bars to the outside or {{to the inside of the}} code. It is found that durability of the code is favored for equal amount of magnetization in each direction, abundance of narrow bars trying to locate a few wider ones towards the center.

40|$|Abstract — Magnetic markers are {{provisioned}} on {{automated highway}} system for lateral control of vehicles within a lane. We propose a pseudo-noise (PN) code to be carried by the magnetic markers. The PN code will be used by vehicles for range measurement. Every vehicle is provided with the code layout {{on the road with}} respect to the physical location of every binary magnetic signal. A vehicle has a replica of the signal and measures the phase of the received signal with respect to the replica and infers its position on the road. The positioning accuracy is subject to design and depends on the magnetic markers layout on the road. The probability of error with short range magnetic signals is negligible compared with radio navigation systems. Unlike radio signals, <b>magnetic</b> <b>codes</b> do not interfere, and multi-path is not an issue. However, errors do exist and an attractive feature of the method is its error detection capability. Errors can be detected and corrected shortly after they occur and the error detection and correction delays are subject to design. Error bounds can also be specified with respect to the signal code design...|$|R
40|$|Bar code stores {{information}} {{in the form of}} series of bars and gaps with various widths, and therefore can be considered as an example of bilevel (square) signal. <b>Magnetic</b> bar <b>codes</b> are created by applying slightly ferromagnetic material to a substrate. Sensing is done by reading oscillator, whose frequency is modulated by presence of the mentioned ferromagnetic material. Signal from the oscillator is then subjected to frequency demodulation. Due to temperature drift of the reading oscillator, the demodulated signal is accompanied by DC drift. Method for removal of the drift is introduced. Also, drift-insensitive detection of presence of a bar code is described. Reading bar codes is complicated by convolutional distortion, which is result of spatially dispersed sensitivity of the sensor. Effect of the convolutional distortion is analogous to low-pass filtering, causing edges to be smoothed and overlapped, and making their detection difficult. Characteristics of convolutional distortion can be summarized into point-spread function (PSF). In case of <b>magnetic</b> bar <b>codes,</b> the shape of the PSF can be known in advance, but not its width of DC transfer. Methods for estimation of these parameters are discussed. The signal needs to be reconstructed (into original bilevel form) before decoding can take place. Variational methods provide effective way. Their core idea is to reformulate reconstruction as an optimization problem of functional minimization. The functional can be extended by other functionals (regularizations) in order to considerably improve results of reconstruction. Principle of variational methods will be shown, including examples of use of various regularizations. All algorithm and methods (including frequency demodulation of signal from reading oscillator) are digital. They are implemented as a program for a microcontroller from the PIC 32 family, which offers high computing power, so that even blind deconvolution (when the real PSF also needs to be found) can be finished in a few seconds.

40|$|In {{magnetic}} recording, {{a standard}} code architecture {{consists of an}} outer Reed–Solomon code in concatenation with an inner parity code. The inner parity code is used to detect and correct common error events. Generally, a parity code with short block length performs better, as multiple error events within one block and, consequently, miscorrection are less likely. In this paper, we study an inner code that offers the same system performance as a parity code with very short block length, even as short as the symbol length (in bits) of the outer Reed–Solomon code, but with higher code rate. This code is a tensor-product code, with a Bose–Chauduri–Hocquenghem (BCH) code and a short parity code as constituent codes.

40|$|Abstract—By {{examining}} the achievable rates of a multistage decoding system on stationary ergodic channels, we derive lower bounds on the mutual information rate corresponding to independent and uniformly distributed (i. u. d.) inputs, {{also referred to}} as the i. u. d. information rate. For binary intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, we show that these bounds become tight as the number of decoding stages increases. Our analysis, which focuses on the marginal conditional output densities at each stage of decoding, provides an information rate corresponding to each stage. These rates underlie the design of multilevel coding schemes, based upon low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and message passing, that in combination with multistage decoding approach the i. u. d. information rate for binary ISI channels. We give example constructions for channel models that have been commonly used in magnetic recording. These examples demonstrate that the technique is very effective even for a small number of decoding stages.
