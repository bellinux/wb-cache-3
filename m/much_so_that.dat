5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a priestly role in {{the cult of the}} emperor. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E

5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to be taken seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Cagney was {{the second}} of seven children, two of whom died within months of birth. He was sickly as a young child—so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized. He later {{attributed}} his sickness to the poverty his family had to endure. The family moved twice {{while he was still}} young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, where he would eventually have his funeral service.|$|E
5|$|Highbury {{could hold}} more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, {{and had a}} {{capacity}} of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.|$|E

He {{served as president}} of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the term John Hancock has become a synonym in the United States for one's signature.|$|E
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds {{was so great that}} The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the band members were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform in unison.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{featured}} improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 torpedo tubes, superimposed gun shelters, and generators {{for emergency}} use. Standard displacement increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class {{introduced a new}} steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with {{a new type of}} lightweight steam turbine, proving simpler and more efficient than the Mahans' predecessors—so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.|$|E

5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it delayed the start of construction. Another {{problem was that the}} Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.|$|E
5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E
5|$|Various musicians {{have cited}} Mercyful Fate as an influence. Kerry King, the guitarist for the thrash metal band Slayer, has stated, {{that he and}} Jeff Hanneman were big fans of Mercyful Fate when Slayer {{recorded}} the album Hell Awaits, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the album was very influenced by Mercyful Fate. Fellow thrash metal band Metallica recorded a medley of Mercyful Fate songs on their 1998 Garage Inc. cover album. Since then, the band has performed the song various times live with several members of Mercyful Fate.|$|E

The film's success encouraged many in Tamil cinema to make films based on freedom fighters and historical figures, notably Kappalottiya Thamizhan (1961) and Bharathi (2000). The film's Jallikattu sequence also attained popularity.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Zersenay {{returned}} to Eritrea and trained {{for one month}} {{to prepare for the}} 2008 World Half Marathon Championships in Rio de Janeiro.

His success caused much celebration in his home country, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the President of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm.

Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E
