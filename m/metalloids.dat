5|$|The {{focus of}} this section is on the {{recognised}} <b>metalloids.</b> Elements less often recognised as <b>metalloids</b> are ordinarily classified as either metals or nonmetals; {{some of these are}} included here for comparative purposes.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as <b>metalloids.</b> Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as <b>metalloids</b> also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} identities of <b>metalloids</b> {{depend on what}} {{classification}} criteria are used. Emsley recognised four <b>metalloids</b> (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.|$|E
40|$|Unlike organic contaminants, <b>metal(loid)</b> s do not undergo {{microbial}} {{or chemical}} degradation and persist {{for a long}} time after their introduction. Bioavailability of <b>metal(loid)</b> s plays a vital role in the remediation of contaminated soils. In this review, the remediation of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> contaminated soils through manipulating their bioavailability using a range of soil amendments will be presented. Mobilizing amendments such as chelating and desorbing agents increase the bioavailability and mobility of <b>metal(loid)</b> s. Immobilizing amendments such of precipitating agents and sorbent materials decrease the bioavailabilty and mobility of <b>metal(loid)</b> s. Mobilizing agents can be used to enhance the removal of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s though plant uptake and soil washing. Immobilizing agents can be used to reduce the transfer to <b>metal(loid)</b> s to food chain via plant uptake and leaching to groundwater. One of the major limitations of mobilizing technique is susceptibility to leaching of the mobilized heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in the absence of active plant uptake. Similarly, in the case of the immobilization technique the long-term stability of the immobilized heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s needs to be monitored...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil {{contamination}} with {{persistent and}} potentially (eco) toxic heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s is ubiquitous around the globe. Concentration of these heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in soil has increased drastically {{over the last}} three decades, thus posing risk to the environment and human health. Some technologies have long been in use to remediate the hazardous heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s. Conventional remediation methods for heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s are generally based on physical, chemical and biological approaches, which may be used in combination with one another to clean-up heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> contaminated soils to an acceptable and safe level. This review summarizes the soil contamination by heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s at a global scale, accumulation of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in vegetables to toxic levels and their regulatory guidelines in soil. In this review, we also elucidate and compare the pool of available technologies that are currently being applied for remediation of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> contaminated soils, as well as the economic aspect of soil remediation for different techniques. This review article includes an assessment of the contemporary status of technology deployment and recommendations for future remediation research. Finally, the molecular and genetic basis of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> (hyper) accumulation and tolerance in microbes and plants is also discussed. It is proposed that for effective and economic remediation of soil, a better understanding of remediation procedures and the various options available at the different stages of remediation is highly necessary...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of ArsAB, at the {{interface}} of these two halves are two nucleotide-binding domains and a metalloid-binding domain.

The crystal structure of ArsA shows two other bound <b>metalloid</b> atoms, one liganded to Cys-172 and His-453, and the other liganded to His-148 and Ser-420. There is only a single high-affinity <b>metalloid</b> binding site in ArsA. Cys-172 controls the affinity of this site for <b>metalloid</b> and hence the efficiency of metalloactivation of the ArsAB efflux pump.|$|R
5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, <b>metalloids</b> and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are <b>metalloids,</b> which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E

40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen the rise of {{alternative}} medical approaches {{including the use of}} herbal supplements, natural products, and traditional medicines, which are collectively known as ‘Complementary medicines’. However, there are increasing concerns on the safety and health benefits of these medicines. One of the main hazards with the use of complementary medicines is the presence of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). This review deals with the characteristics of complementary medicines in terms of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s sources, distribution, bioavailability, toxicity, and human risk assessment. The heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in these medicines are derived from uptake by medicinal plants, cross-contamination during processing, and therapeutic input of <b>metal(loid)</b> s. This paper discusses the distribution of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in these medicines, in terms of their nature, concentration, and speciation. The importance of determining bioavailability towards human health risk assessment was emphasized by the need to estimate daily intake of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in complementary medicines. The review ends with selected case studies of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> toxicity from complementary medicines with specific reference to As, Cd, Pb, and Hg. The future research opportunities mentioned in the conclusion of review will help researchers to explore new avenues, methodologies, and approaches to the issue of heavy <b>metal(loid)</b> s in complementary medicines, thereby generating new regulations and proposing fresh approach towards safe use of these medicines...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{discovery}} of anaerobic respiration on tellurate by bacteria isolated from deep ocean (1, 543 to 1, 791 m) hydrothermal vent worms. The first evidence for selenite- and vanadate-respiring bacteria from deep ocean hydrothermal vents is also presented. Enumeration of the anaerobic <b>metal(loid)</b> -resistant microbial community associated with hydrothermal vent animals indicates that {{a greater proportion of}} the bacterial community associated with certain vent fauna resists and reduces <b>metal(loid)</b> s anaerobically than aerobically, suggesting that anaerobic <b>metal(loid)</b> respiration might be an important process in bacteria that are symbiotic with vent fauna. Isolates from Axial Volcano and Explorer Ridge were tested for their ability to reduce tellurate, selenite, metavanadate, or orthovanadate in the absence of alternate electron acceptors. In the presence of <b>metal(loid)</b> s, strains showed an ability to grow and produce ATP, whereas in the absence of <b>metal(loid)</b> s, no growth or ATP production was observed. The protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophe-nylhydrazone depressed <b>metal(loid)</b> reduction. Anaerobic tellurate respiration will be a significant component in describing biogeochemical cycling of Te at hydrothermal vents.

50|$|Oxygen, sulfur, and {{selenium}} are nonmetals, and tellurium is a <b>metalloid,</b> {{meaning that}} its chemical properties are between {{those of a}} metal and those of a nonmetal.

Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium).

Site 1 had higher contamination than Site 3. Bacteria were isolated using <b>metal(loid)</b> -supplemented (Cd, Zn, and As) media. Isolates were grouped by random amplified polymorphic DNA and identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Strains were also examined for their <b>metal(loid)</b> tolerance. The counts of <b>metal(loid)</b> -tolerant bacteria were higher in Site 1 and ranged between log 7. 17 CFU g 1 soil in As-containing medium and log 7. 57 CFU g 1 soil in Zn-containing medium, while counts at Site 3 varied between log 5. 33 CFU g 1 soil in Cd-containing medium and log 6. 97 CFU g 1 soil in As-containing medium. The composition of bacterial populations varied between locations. In Site 1, the classes Actinobacteria (36 %) and Bacilli (24 %) were well represented, while in Site 3 strains were mainly affiliated to classes Actinobacteria (35 %), g-Proteobacteria (35 %), and b-Proteobacteria (12 %).

40|$|Formation of methyl and hydride <b>metal(loid)</b> {{compounds}} of {{the elements}} arsenic, selenium, antimony, tellurium and bismuth is widespread in the environment –especially under anaerobic conditions – and lead to a notable modulation of mobility and toxicity of these <b>metal(loid)</b> s (Bentley and Chasteen 2002; Chasteen and Bentley 2003). The capability to form volatile methyl <b>metal(loid)</b> s – {{and in some cases}} also volatile hydrides – was shown for numerous methanoarchaea (Meyer et al. 2008). This thesis aimed towards elucidating the cause of the exceptional versatility of methanoarchaea to form <b>metal(loid)</b> methyl and hydride derivatives. The comparison of inorganic <b>metal(loid)</b> reactants converted into volatile derivatives by cell-free crude extracts prepared from non-induced Methanosarcina mazei cultures and by growing cultures of the same strain indicated no inductively elevated expression of enzymes to enable the observed <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation reaction. The in vitro assays needed only amendment by two central cofactors of methanogenesis, methylcobalamin (CH 3 Cob(III)) and 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate (HS-CoM), to volatilize the same <b>metal(loid)</b> s by methylation as growing cultures upon <b>metal(loid)</b> addition. Surprisingly, not only formation of volatile permethylated species like in the case of M. mazei in vivo but also formation of volatile hydride derivatives of arsenic, selenium and antimony was found. As both, CH 3 Cob(III) and HS-CoM are required for the observed multi <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation and hydride generation by cell-free crude extract but no multi-metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation by these cofactors alone were observed, the additional requirement of an enzyme using both cofactors was indicated. The CH 3 Cob(III) /HS-CoM dependent methyltransferase MtaA {{as an integral part of}} the methylotrophic methanogenesis from methanol was thereupon tested whether it is capable to substitute for the cell-free crude extract. Substitution of cell-free crude extracts by MtaA results in the formation of the same volatile <b>metal(loid)</b> derivatives as formed in the presence of the cell-free crude extracts. This finding supports the assumed connection between <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation and methanogenesis and additionally demonstrates that multi <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation and hydride generation can arise from a key reaction of methanogenesis, the CH 3 Cob(III) dependent HS-CoM methylation. The discovered multi-metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation mechanism from M. mazei might thus represent a common principal for <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation and in some cases also for hydride generation in all methanoarchaea. The closer analyses of arsenic methylation and hydride generation by MtaA in the presence of CH 3 Cob(III) and HS-CoM revealed a decisive role of the CH 3 Cob(III) demethylation product Cob(I). Moreover, the data from the performed experiments points towards a non-oxidative methylation mechanism. The role of Cob(I) is probably to supply electrons to enable the methylation and hydride generation reactions. Analyses of the transcriptional response of M. mazei towards bismuth and arsenic were performed to investigate whether the discovered in vitro multi-metal(loid) methylation pathway is also feasible for the observed in vivo multi <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation. The analyses revealed no expression of genes that hint to an alternative pathway leading to multi-metal(loid) methylation. Even the arsR/arsM operon of M. mazei which was previously described as being capable to form volatile methyl arsenic derivatives from arsenite (Qin et al. 2006; Yuan et al. 2008) is not inductively more expressed at arsenite and arsenate concentrations at which notable methylation by M. mazei was demonstrated previously (Meyer et al. 2008). Instead, genes encoding enzymes participating in cob(I) alamin remethylation and HS-CoM recycling/de-novo syntheses were noticeably up-regulated in the presence of bismuth, thus supporting the assumption that multi-metal(loid) methylation also in vivo is directly coupled to methanogenesis. The transcriptional analyses also indicate some general stress responses towards exposure to elevated bismuth and arsenic concentrations and points towards imbalance of the iron metabolism in M. mazei. Open to question is whether Cob(I) is the only electron donor in vivo that enables the multi-metal(loid) methylation and hydride generation or whether other reduced cofactor are capable to trigger the observed in vivo multi <b>metal(loid)</b> methylation as well...|$|R
