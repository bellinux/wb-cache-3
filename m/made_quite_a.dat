25|$|Straight {{from his}} University years, Max {{was chosen to}} travel on the Corinthians tour of Brazil {{in the summer of}} 1913. Managing the tour's first goal, against Rio de Janeiro, he also scored against Paulistano and <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> name for himself. In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was {{cancelled}} when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that there was more to life than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC.|$|E
25|$|Sri Lanka {{continually}} improved, {{at least}} in Test cricket, but Dias' career went the other way. He made few big scores in Tests, but he <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few fifties in losing causes in ODIs. Then, in September 1985, India came to tour – a tour which was Sri Lanka's biggest success to date. In the first Test, Dias made 4 and 0, yet Sri Lanka dominated thanks to centuries from Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga – India, however, survived out the five days and the match ended in a draw. However, in the second Test, Dias came in with the score 109 for 2 and made a stroke-filled 95 to lift Sri Lanka to 385. Then, India were bowled out for 244, and trailing by 141, but Dias scored a quick unbeaten 60 as Sri Lanka declared on 206 for 3, setting India 348 in a day. Despite 78 from Kapil Dev, India were bowled out by 198, and Sri Lanka recorded their first Test victory. Dias then recorded his third and last Test century in the third Test, as Dias survived for five hours with Duleep Mendis to save a draw and a series victory.|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} day of the competition, March 7, 1952, Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match. They <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{contrast}} as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney, while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the San Francisco Examiner as [...] "so small and doll-like she looks like a figurine in her flowing, gold-satin gown." [...] Crane's main discipline was straight pool, at which he won numerous championships, including six world titles. The match was close, but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 [...] On March 10, Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings. Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead. On March 11, she lost to Chamaco, 50 to 35, but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50–43 in 63 innings, with runs of six, five and four. [...] "Spectators exclaimed 'brilliant' and 'sensational' at some of her shots." ...|$|E
500|$|Keable's {{developing}} {{attitudes and}} relationship with [...] "Betty" [...] disgusted his wife, Sybil, {{but as a}} devout Catholic she refused to divorce. This left Keable unable to marry Buck, and contributed to a growing sense on his part of alienation from English society. At last, in 1922, he managed legally to separate from his wife. He took up the suggestion of former college friend Arthur Grimble, by then a colonial administrator in the Ellice Islands, that he visit the South Pacific, a fashionable destination for 1920s Europeans. To Keable the South Seas appeared to offer escape from the hypocrisies of British society, as well as furnishing a climate better suited to his never-hearty constitution. In 1922 Keable and Buck sailed aboard the Bendigo for the South Pacific via Australia, where Keable undertook a book tour, giving lectures in which he broadcast his new sexual ethics: that unmarried couples in love could have deeply moral relationships, while loveless spouses who stayed together for convention's sake were committing acts of deep immorality. His views scandalised the contemporary press, but Frank Weston noted in correspondence that Keable as a [...] "shipwrecked priest" [...] <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> useful cautionary tale for novices.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{export market}} for the SM was the U.S. In the U.S., the market for {{personal}} luxury cars was much larger than in Europe, with competitors like the Cadillac Eldorado, Lincoln Mark IV and Ford Thunderbird alongside a large selection of Italian, British, and German imports. [...] Nevertheless, the unique design of the SM <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> splash and won the Motor Trend magazine Car of the Year award in 1972: unheard of for a non-US vehicle at the time.|$|E

2500|$|His first book, Three Inquisitive People, was not {{published}} when completed, but came out later, in 1940. However, his next novel <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> splash. Called The Forbidden Territory, {{it was an}} immediate success when issued by Hutchinson in 1933, being reprinted seven times in seven weeks. After finishing The Fabulous Valley, Wheatley {{decided to use the}} theme of black magic for his next book. He wrote: [...] "The fact that I had read extensively about ancient religions gave me some useful background, but I required up-to-date information about occult circles in this country. My friend, Tom Driberg, who then lived in a mews flat just behind us in Queen's Gate, proved most helpful. He introduced me to Aleister Crowley, the Reverend Montague Summers and Rollo Ahmed." [...] The release the next year of his occult story, The Devil Rides Out—hailed by James Hilton as [...] "the best thing of its kind since Dracula"—cemented his reputation as [...] "The Prince of Thriller Writers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Valdobrev <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few {{appearances}} on Bulgarian National Television, mainly {{as a participant}} in a students' show with a cult status named [...] "Coo-Coo". Despite this success he subsequently decided to turn to film for more challenging roles. While struggling to establish himself in cinema, he took small parts in international co-production B movies. His onscreen career began in 2000 with the supporting role of the tricky Communist activist Popadamchev in the Bulgarian-Macedonian production Warming Up Yesterday's Lunch. The TV comedy Encounter (2003) gave him his first leading role as a clumsy journalist {{who falls in love}} with his cousin's girlfriend. 2004 was the year of his big movie break when he took on the lead in Burning Out, a love drama by director Stanimir Trifonov, set in the immediate post World War II period. Valdobrev’s performance of the romantic Italian doctor Enrico Corsa, separated from his Bulgarian wife and sent to a Communist prison camp, from which he finally escapes, has been described as fine, deep and centered ...|$|E
2500|$|The next {{event was}} {{to be with the}} Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, one of the most {{outstanding}} orchestras worldwide. In 1997, the Orchestra invited George Dalaras to stage two concerts in the Tel Aviv Mann Auditorium. The orchestra was conducted by Ilias Voudouris. It was a collaboration which materialized, in the best possible way, George Dalaras’ long desire to interpret a number of the most brilliant Greek songs accompanied by a symphony orchestra. The internationally acknowledged interpretation skills of the Philharmonic Orchestra came together with the powerful and charismatic stage presence, the promptness and, lastly, the soulful interpretation of George Dalaras in an unfolding of the portrait of contemporary Greek music. A musical journey which began from the rebetiko songs to cross over to his big hits, to all-time classics by prominent Greek composers, to melodies from the Mediterranean as well as to medieval songs by the Jewish population in Spain (ladino). The live recordings of these performances were internationally released in April 1999 by EMI CLASSICS in a digital disc titled: [...] "GEORGE DALARAS AND THE ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA", a release which <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> stir.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the common}} trend, Biblioteka started its own section for humorous {{sketches}} and feuilletons, and in 1861 Pisemsky debuted there – first as [...] "State councilor Salatushka", then as Nikita Bezrylov. The latter's first feuilleton, {{published in the}} December issue and making fun of liberal trends and views, <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> stir. In May 1862 Iskra magazine {{came up with a}} scathing retort, calling the unknown author 'dumb and ignorant', 'having by nature a very limited mind' and accusing the editor of Biblioteka of providing space for 'reactionaries'. Pisemsky, in a rather reserved way, blamed Iskra for trying to [...] "soil his honest name", but then Nikita Bezrylov came up with a reply of his own which was quite a match for the Iskra article in terms of outright rudeness. Iskra editors Viktor Kurochkin and N.A. Stepanov {{went so far as to}} challenge Pisemsky to a duel, but the latter refused. The Russky Mir newspaper defended Pisemsky and published a letter of protest, signed by 30 authors. This, in its own turn, provoked Sovremennik to come up with a letter denouncing Pisemsky and signed, among others, by its leaders Nikolay Nekrasov, Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Ivan Panaev.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, a TV Week {{journalist}} {{placed the}} plot at number twenty-one on their [...] "100 Most Memorable TV Events of 2010" [...] list. The journalist commented that Paul proved {{he had more}} lives than a cat after he was pushed of the balcony and that Rebecca being his attacker was [...] "the greatest shock". In March 2012, MSN TV's Lorna Cooper included [...] "Who Pushed P.R.?" [...] in her list {{of the best and}} worst soap whodunits. Cooper gave the storyline seven out of ten and noted [...] "In a reveal that was always very likely, it was Rebecca who nearly killed Paul. After finding out about her husband's many indiscretions, she took her revenge." [...] Judy Johnson from Dollymix included the storyline in her feature on the top five soap mysteries in July 2012. She wrote [...] "We couldn't possibly forget Aussie soap Neighbours in the whodunits hall of fame. [...] Shoved off the balcony at Lassiters, Paul was left fighting for his life with very little sympathy given his naughty ways; the series' villain had <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few enemies in {{the weeks leading up to}} the anniversary episode thanks to his various affairs and deceit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleopatra is a {{difficult}} character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality that we occasionally get a glimpse of. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra's most dominant character traits and she uses it {{as a means of}} control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra's initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> calculated entrance in order to capture his attention. This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra's role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a [...] "grasping, licentious harlot". However, despite her [...] "insatiable sexual passion" [...] she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra's desire was for power. Due to Cleopatra's close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because there is something in her passion and intelligence that intrigues others. She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.|$|E
