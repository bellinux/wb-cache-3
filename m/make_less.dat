EPBT ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years. The cradle to gate of CO2-eq/kWh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams. Some studies have looked beyond EPBT and GWP to other environmental impacts. In one such study, conventional energy mix in Greece was compared to multi-si PV and found a 95% overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens, eco-toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and eleven others.|$|E
25|$|Village rugs {{are more}} apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as {{elaborate}} and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to <b>make</b> <b>less</b> use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Gann said that Final Fantasy fans have [...] "no excuse" [...] {{not to buy}} the album and noted that his only disappointments were {{that three of the}} tracks were the same as on the Piano Collections album, and that as a film score, some of the shifts in the pieces <b>make</b> <b>less</b> sense outside of the context of the visuals.

Jet Girl (Naomi Watts), a talented but introverted jet mechanic who has given up trying to escape W, urges Tank Girl to <b>make</b> <b>less</b> trouble for their captors, though Tank Girl refuses.

500|$|On 17 January 2012, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie {{signed into}} law a bill that legalized direct {{shipping}} from wineries to consumers, and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 offsite retail sales outlets in the state. The law allows wineries that <b>make</b> <b>less</b> than 250,000 gallons of wine annually, which includes all of New Jersey's wineries, to ship up to 12 cases of wine to per year to any person over 21 in New Jersey or any other state that allows wine shipments.

[...] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had struck down a similar limit in Massachusetts in 2008 in light of the United States Supreme Court decision addressing direct shipping laws a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Section 4 of the Act {{requires}} trustees {{to look at}} the [...] "standard investment criteria" [...] when investing. These {{criteria are}} defined in Section 4(3) as the need to check the suitability of investments for the trust, and the importance of diversification. Section 4(2) requires that, having exercised their power of investment, trustees must regularly refer back to the standard investment criteria to check that they are being fulfilled. This does little more than restate what is given in the Trustee Investments Act 1961, however, and this provision has been criticised for not defining [...] "suitable". In Cowan v Scargill [...] Ch 270 Megarry VC suggested that trustees have an overriding duty to invest solely in the financial interests of beneficiaries, unless the trust instrument laid down otherwise. So even though the National Union of Mineworkers' leader, Arthur Scargill, wanted the mineworkers' pensions to be reinvested in the British Coal industry and keep jobs, the court held that because this would <b>make</b> <b>less</b> money than other investments it would be a breach of trust. Subsequent case law has qualified this controversial principle, such as Harries v The Church Commissioners for England [...] 1 WLR 1241, and it is a point of ongoing debate. It is assumed by academics that, if a trust suffered a loss {{as a result of a}} trustee investing in unsuitable areas, the trustee would be liable for breach of trust.|$|E
