500|$|During his {{theatrical}} days, Davidson maintained {{high standards}} of personal morality, observed strict teetotalism and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour. He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the Thames Embankment in a thick fog, he said, he encountered a 16-year-old girl {{who was about to}} throw herself into the Thames. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near Cambridge, was penniless and without shelter. He paid her fare home: [...] "Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on me... I have ever since... kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> for opportunities to help that kind of girl." ...|$|E
500|$|In the borderlands {{south of}} Tombstone {{there was only}} one {{passable}} route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Old Man Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon. The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, [...] "I naturally kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to England, Heber {{prepared}} for Holy Orders at Oxford, where he found time for literary pursuits, was active in university politics and led a busy social life. He was ordained as deacon {{at the end of}} February 1807 and received full priest's orders from the Bishop of Oxford on 24 May 1807. He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet; he was later to describe his role as [...] "a half-way station between a parson and a squire". At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he continued working for his M.A. degree and fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: [...] "Pray for me, my dear friend, that I may have <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience". A High churchman by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.|$|E

60|$|I {{was awakened}} {{with a start}} by cries of alarm, and scarce were <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened,</b> nor had I yet {{sufficiently}} collected my wits to quite realize where I was, when a fusillade of shots rang out, reverberating through the subterranean corridors {{in a series of}} deafening echoes.|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} again <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> upon George. I {{was lying on}} the sofa, still in the same room; the lights we had read by in the evening were burning on the table; my son was {{kneeling}} at my pillow, and we two were alone.|$|R
60|$|When I awoke it {{was with}} a start, for a heavy body was upon me. My first thought was that the hyaenodon had at last {{attacked}} me, but as <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> and I struggled to rise, I saw that a man was astride me and three others bending close above him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will watch, uncle, if {{you will}} wake me in an hour. I shall be all right after a nap, but I can {{scarcely}} keep <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> now." ...|$|E

Out of the Hills I came--the high Hills {{and the strong}} winds. Oh, just is the Wheel!' He blessed them in detail--the great glaciers, the naked rocks, the piled moraines and tumbled shale; dry upland, hidden salt-lake, age-old timber and {{fruitful}} water-shot valley one after the other, as a dying man blesses his folk; and Kim marvelled at his passion.|$|R
5000|$|... "With <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> Wide <b>Open,</b> I'm Dreaming" [...] {{was also}} sung by Dean Martin in the 1952 film The Stooge.|$|R
60|$|When <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> I knew I {{had been}} awakened by something, but I {{could not tell}} what. I listened. Cubby was as quiet as a mouse, and his very quiet and the alert way he held his ears gave me a vague alarm. He had heard something.

6000|$|... "Who {{wants you}} to?" [...] I cried. And then <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> became <b>opened</b> to the inwardness {{of things and}} speeches the triviality {{of which had been}} so {{baffling}} and tiresome.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> shut. I sat shivering, {{empty of}} self, listening, as if {{lost in a}} fog in a place desperately strange to me; and only a distant sea {{breaking}} and chafing on its stones far below. Then once more I became conscious of the steady and resolute droning of the bees; felt the breathing of actuality on my hair, on <b>my</b> cheek. <b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> on a garden sucked dry of colour and reality, and sought her out. She had left me, was standing a few paces distant now, looking back, as if dazed, her lips pale, her eyes dark-ringed.|$|R
