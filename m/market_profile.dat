40|$|This report {{presents}} <b>marketing</b> <b>profiles</b> {{and loan}} deficiency payment/marketing loan gain profiles for the advisory services {{followed by the}} AgMAS Project for the 1995 through 2000 corn crops. <b>Marketing</b> <b>profiles</b> are constructed by plotting the cumulative net amount priced under each program's set of recommendations throughout a crop year. Loan deficiency payment/marketing loan gain (LDP/MLG) profiles are constructed by plotting the cumulative percentage of the crop on which the LDP/MLG was claimed during the crop year. <b>Marketing</b> <b>profiles</b> provide information to evaluate the style of advisory services in several ways. The percentage of crop priced {{is a measure of}} within-crop year price risk. The higher the proportion of a crop priced, the lower the sensitivity of the farmer's position value to crop price changes. For example, when 100 % of the crop is priced there is no price sensitivity, which means that changes in price do not affect the value of the farmer's position. On the other hand, when the amount priced is 0 %, the value of the farmer's position will vary in the same proportion as the change in price. <b>Marketing</b> <b>profiles,</b> therefore, allow investigating the evolution of price sensitivity under each service's set of recommendations along the <b>marketing</b> window. <b>Marketing</b> <b>profiles</b> also provide other useful information. The number of steps in the profile lines and the location of these steps in the marketing window provide information about timing, frequency and size of recommended transactions. It is also possible to determine from the <b>marketing</b> <b>profile</b> figures how intensely a program uses options markets, since when options positions are open the profile line is irregular. In the same way, LDP/MLG profiles provide information about the size and timing of LDP/MLG claims. Marketing,...|$|R

30|$|The {{key problem}} {{in this type of}} {{analysis}} is the lack of high quality data. We have gathered several sources to best summarize EaP migrants’ experiences in Germany. Various accounts on EaP flows and its characteristics are carried out using population registers. The regression analysis investigating the migrants’ labor <b>market</b> <b>profiles</b> is based on the 2009 German Microcensus. Lastly, to study the scope for future EaP migration we rely on a unique dataset of stayers, return migrants and potential migrants carried out in Ukraine–the key sending country from the region–and also in Moldova.|$|R
50|$|Yoram Wind and Richard Cardozo in 1974 {{advocate}} a two-stage approach to industrial segmentation {{that consists of}} macrosegments and microsegments.They explain that macrosegments consist of key organizational characteristics such as size of the buying firm, SIC category, geographic location, and usage factors, hence, mostly of firm demographics. In some cases, single-stage segmentation based primarily on business demographics is sufficient for identifying and targeting markets. More typical, however, is that a two-stage approach that will employ benefits and organizational psychographics and purchasing criteria {{will be needed to}} provide complete <b>market</b> <b>profiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the {{segments}} {{have been}} determined and separate offers developed {{for each of}} the core segments, the marketer's next task is to design a marketing program (also known as the marketing mix) that will resonate with the target market or markets. Developing the marketing program requires a deep knowledge of key market segment's purchasing habits, their preferred retail outlet, their media habits and their price sensitivity. The marketing program for each brand or product should be based on the understanding of the target market (or target markets) revealed in the <b>market</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E

In a second step, Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft was renamed UniCredit Bank AG on 15 December (amongst other reasons, due to the danger of confusion with Hypo Real Estate, which was spun off in 2003); the brand name HypoVereinsbank was, however, retained.|$|E
