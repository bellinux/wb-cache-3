5|$|<b>Mowrah</b> butter, {{from the}} seeds of the Madhuca latifolia and Madhuca longifolia, both native to India. Crude <b>Mowrah</b> butter is used as a fat for {{spinning}} wool, for making candles and soap. The refined fat is used as an edible fat and vegetable ghee in India.|$|E
2500|$|Oils can {{be removed}} via {{mechanical}} extraction, termed [...] "crushing" [...] or [...] "pressing." [...] This method is typically used to produce the more traditional oils (e.g., olive, coconut etc.), and it is preferred by most [...] "health-food" [...] customers in the United States and in Europe. There are several different types of mechanical extraction. Expeller-pressing extraction is common, though the screw press, ram press, and Ghani (powered mortar and pestle) are also used. Oilseed presses are commonly used in developing countries, among people for whom other extraction methods would be prohibitively expensive; the Ghani is primarily used in India. The amount of oil extracted using these methods varies widely, {{as shown in the}} following table for extracting <b>mowrah</b> butter in India: ...|$|E

5000|$|Illipe {{butter is}} a {{vegetable}} fat from the nut (known as the [...] "false illipe nut") of the Shorea stenoptera tree, sometimes {{used as a}} cocoa butter substitute. Borneo tallow nut oil is extracted from this species. The word Illipe {{is derived from the}} Tamil word for the tree Iluppai (இலுப்பை). The true illipe nut is from the species Madhuca latifolia, it is used for producing biodiesel and the <b>Mowrah</b> Butter is from Madhuca longifolia, Family Sapotaceae.|$|E

40|$|Palm oil and <b>mowrah</b> oil are semi solid at room {{temperature}} in tropical countries. The oils are blended separately with til oil and rice bran oil respectively in formulation of bread spreads. Moreover, the fatty acid profile of the experimental oil blends are more balanced {{compared to that of}} butter or margarine. The experiment shows that the margarines prepared from the blend of palm oil and til oil and <b>mowrah</b> oil and rice bran oil in different proportion like 85 : 15 and 80 : 20 respectively are comparable to butter in respect to all physical characteristics and the stability (% of oil separation) at 40 C...|$|E
