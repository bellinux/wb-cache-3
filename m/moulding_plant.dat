40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} between dissolved trace metals and plastic debris under controlled laboratory conditions by using polyethylene pellets as a model plastic particle. Specifically, the study compared virgin pellets sourced from a local <b>moulding</b> <b>plant</b> with those collected from local beaches and subjected to aging, attrition and deposition of extraneous material. Pellets collected from the coastline of Southwest England were mainly polyethylene according to Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), although occasional polypropylene pellets were present. Additionally, FTIR was used to identify the extent of degradation of pellets according to a photo-oxidation index derived from the relative magnitudes of specific absorbance peaks, and suggests pellet colour may give an indication of polymer degradation. Acid extractions of pellets collected from the coastline of Southwest England yielded metal concentrations ranging from low ng g- 1 for metals such as Cd, Ni and Cr, to 7. 7, 10. 3 and 290 g g- 1 for Cu Pb and Zn, respectively, while Al, Fe and Mn were present on beached pellets at concentrations of up to 171, 314 and 308 g g- 1, respectively. Metal concentrations exhibited {{a high degree of}} inter- and intra-site variability. Correlation of metal concentrations with the photo-oxidation index indicates that pellet age is not a reliable indicator of metal concentrations. Batch experiments where metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) were added to suspensions of pellets in seawater and estuarine water were performed {{in order to understand the}} extent and rates of trace metal adsorption to pellets. Langmuir modelling of adsorption isotherms in seawater indicated a range of maximum values for the accumulation of trace metals on beached pellets from 10 ng g- 1 to 720 ng g- 1 for Cd and Pb, respectively, in seawater spiked with 5 g L- 1 of each trace metal. Langmuir constants for these relationships ranged from 0. 140 (Cd) to 2. 67 (Ni) mL g- 1. Differences between trace metal affinities for pellets collected from the environment (beached) and those obtained directly from a plastics processing facility (virgin) were also identified. Adsorption maxima for virgin pellets ranged from < 1 ng g- 1 (Cd) to 300 ng g- 1 (Cr) with corresponding, respective Langmuir constants of 0. 413 and 0. 127 mL g- 1. Adsorption of trace metals to beached pellets exceeds that to virgin pellets owing to the development of viable surface sites by photo-oxidation, biofouling and deposition of fine sediment particles on the former during exposure to environmental conditions. Adsorption kinetics were modelled successfully using a pseudo first-order reversible model. Chemical response times derived from kinetic constants ranged from 1. 5 – 12 h for beached pellets and 0. 2 to 4. 5 h for virgin pellets, and were generally lower in seawater than in river water. Applying a similar batch approach to a system simulating an estuarine salinity gradient, the controlling effects of ionic strength and pH on the adsorption of trace metals to pellets were identified. Partitioning of Cd, Co and Ni exhibited inverse relationships with salinity, with partition coefficients (KD) decreasing from values of the order 101 to 10 - 1 or 10 - 2 mL g- 1 (for beached pellets) as salinity is increased from < 0. 05 to 33. Chromium exhibited contrasting behaviour within the estuarine gradient, with partitioning increasing with salinity, while Pb appears to be independent of salinity within this system. Chemical modelling was used to explain the results in context of changes in trace metal speciation which occur through the estuarine gradient. The bioaccessibility of metals on beached pellets to avian species was determined using an in vitro approach. Metal bioaccessibility in a simulated avian gastric environment comprising 10 g L- 1 pepsin, 0. 1 M NaCl and HCl at pH 2. 8 indicated metals on pellets are labile (bioaccessibility ranges from 80 % (Mn)) and may be released readily within the digestive tract. Dissolution kinetics were modelled using the Noyes-Whitney equation, from which rate constants were determined in the range 3. 1 x 10 - 4 (Cr) to 8. 7 x 10 - 1 %- 1 h- 1 (Mn). This study has shown, for the first time, that plastic pellets have the potential to accumulate and transport trace metals in the marine environment. Furthermore, metal accumulation on plastic pellets is controlled by estuarine master variables such that conditions which favour or limit adsorption can be defined. Pellets present a previously unreported vector for the transport of metals in the environment, and have the potential to convey metals to organisms upon ingestion.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the study of Ca 2 + {{homeostasis}} in living cells received a great impulse by the explosive development of genetically encoded Ca 2 +-indicators. The cloning of the Ca 2 +-sensitive photoprotein aequorin and of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has been enormously advantageous for the biologists. As polypeptides, aequorin and GFP allow their endogenous production in cell system as diverse as bacteria, yeast, slime <b>moulds,</b> <b>plants</b> and mammalian cells. Moreover, {{it is possible to}} specifically localize them within the cell by including defined targeting signals in the amino acid sequence. These two proteins have been extensively engineerized to obtain several recombinant probes for different biological parameters, among which Ca 2 + concentration reporters are probably the most relevant. In this review, we will not treat the GFP-based Ca 2 + probes, but we will present the applications offered by aequorin in the study of intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis, discussing also the new generation of bioluminescent probes that couple the Ca 2 + sensitivity of aequorin to GFP fluorescence emission. In these probes, aequorin Ca 2 +-dependent photon emission delivers energy to the GFP acceptor in a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) : this process enhances the stability and the high signal-to noise ratio of the probes and permits real-time measurements of subcellular Ca 2 + changes in single cell imaging experiments.

Terpenes are widespread in nature, mainly in plants as resent constituents of essential oils. Saponin as a group include compounds that are glycosylated steroids, triterpenoids and steroids alkaloids. Many saponin {{are known to be}} antimicrobial to inhibit <b>mould,</b> and protect <b>plant</b> from insect attacks. Saponins may be considered as a part of plants defence systems found in plants named phytoanticipins or phytoprotectants [43]. These structurally diverse compounds have also been observed to kill protozoans and helminths, to be antioxidants and also acts as antifungal and antiviral [44, 45]. Xanthorrhizol is a bisabolane type sesquiterpenoid compound posses variety of antimicrobial, antioxidant, anthelmintic activity [46]. Essential oils are formed by aromatic odor as secondary metabolites, composed of terpenes or terpenoids. The cytotoxic activity of essential oils is mostly due to the presence of phenols, aldehydes and alcohols [47] and are effective against a large variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa as well as metazoan parasites [48]. Flavonoids are potent secondary metabolites having high anthelmintic activity and the toxicity of most isolated flavonoids in animal cells is very low [49], several ubiquitous flavonoids genistein, kaemferol, rutin, quercetin etc., showed deleterious effects on selected species of parasitic helminths. Flavonoid kaempferol exerted a strong adulticidal activity on Schistosoma mansoni [50]. The anthelmintic activity of flavonoids, genistein, isoflavones found in the root extracts of Flamingia vestita [51] mediated its action on cellular/molecular targets in mammals. In flatworms they act on tegumental enzymes causing paralysis and death [52]. The approved anthelmintics for trematodes are Oxyclozanide, Praziquatel and Triclabendazole, however the rapid spread of triclabendazole resistance is an important motivation for drug discovery of novel trematodicidal drugs [53]. Dryopteris filix-mas (Dryopteridaceae), contains vermicidal phloroglucinols, such as aspidin, deaspidin and filixic acid are active against intestinal cestodes, paralyze the worm’s tegument [54]. Pelletierine an anthelmintic alkaloids from Punica granatum (Lythraceae) and arecoline from Areca catechu (Arecaceae) target acetylcholine receptors [20].|$|R
40|$|The Berrazales {{carbonate}} spring deposit {{is a small}} outcrop constituted {{mainly by}} cascade-like geometries. Four main facies have been identified: fibrous dense macrocrystalline formed by rapid degassing under high-flow conditions; framestones of coated <b>plant</b> <b>moulds</b> formed in moderate energy flow favoured {{by the presence of}} biogenic support; micrite/microsparite are primary precipitates in which crystalline aggregates nucleated on organic filaments and/or EPS; banded micrite-coarse crystalline were the result of alternating physically, chemically and biologically induced precipitation in areas of varying flow-velocities. Most facies underwent different degrees of micritization processes. Micrite is distributed as thin lines penetrating the crystals, as irregular patches or as micrite layers. In the first case organic filaments penetrate crystals, suggesting that micritization is mainly biogenically driven. In the latter cases micritization is caused mostly by partial dissolution. Microbe participation in micrite formation increased micrite MgCO 3 content in comparison with coarse crystalline facies. Isotopic analyses show positive δ 13 C values (+ 2. 63 and + 4. 29 ‰ VPDB) and negative δ 18 O (- 5. 65 and - 4. 48 ‰ VPDB) values. Positive δ 13 C values clearly indicate >deep-sourced> fluids. The Berrazales spring deposit studied here very probably is a small part of a larger carbonate building that was largely eroded by fluvial incision. Calculations of spring water temperature give a range from 20 °C to 35 °C, characteristic of a cold to warm spring favouring precipitation of calcite and important biogenic activity (framestones). Although the study deposit has textural characteristics of tufas, proving that the CO 2 sourced from deep fluids, it should be considered as thermogene travertine, being one more example of the difficulty of using those terms for ancient sedimentary deposits. Carbonate spring deposits, very rare in the Canary Islands, are good archives of recent volcanic activity, fluvial processes and vegetation regimes prevailing in the islands in recent times. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to study about the growth and diversity of moulds in the cucumber pickle and the influences of acetic acid concentration and long storage as well as additional of onion on the growth of moulds. Cucumber pickle was treated in different acetic acid concentrations (0, 8 %, 1, 4 %, 2, 0 %), long storage and with or without additional of onion. The used method to isolate of <b>mould</b> was dilution <b>planting.</b> For enumerating <b>moulds,</b> 0, 1 ml samples were blended and diluted after that inoculated on to potato sucrose agar (PSA) medium and then incubated at 270 C for 7 days. To identify the moulds, the colony was transferred on to CDA and PSA media, and then incubated at 270 C for 7 days. The moulds were identified according to their macroscopic and microscopic characters. To know the degrees of taste, the cucumber pickle was tested to 25 people with hedonic scale method. The results showed that, there was 12 different kinds of moulds {{can be found in}} cucumber pickle without additional of onion. There were Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. tamarii Kita, Cochliobolus sp, Botrytis, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. expansum, P. citrinum, Rhizopus oligosporus, Trichoderma sp, and Monilia. On the other hand, experiment with onion, P. expansum and A. niger could not be observed. The highest varieties of moulds can be found in cucumber pickle with acetic acid concentration 1, 4 %. In experiment without onion, on nil (0) day, with acetic acid concentration of 1, 4 %, the amount of moulds is lower than in the pickle with acetic acid concentration 0, 8 %. The diversity of moulds in the cucumber pickle with additional of onion is lower than that of without onion. The additional of onion showed decreasing the diversity and growth of moulds in cucumber pickle with acetic acid concentration of 0, 8 % on nil (0) day. In experiment with acetic acid concentration 2, 0 % in 10 - 1 dilution on nil (0) day until 6 th day, the moulds could not be observed...|$|R
