When National Semiconductor, which made their own microprocessor chips in '77 or '78, decided they needed a BASIC [...] they asked, 'What's the most popular BASIC?' And the answer was Microsoft BASIC because everybody had copied it and everybody was using it. So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way. This was the <b>marketing</b> <b>function</b> and the hobbyists did the marketing with a complete antipathy of the company in question. There were other BASICs and, you know, some of them might even have been better.

One frequently made argument against the provision by central banks of such guidance or forecasts is that it {{runs the risk of}} impairing <b>market</b> <b>functioning.</b> In this paper, we evaluate the behaviour of financial markets in the United States, the euro area and New Zealand in light of the communication strategies of central banks, in order to assess whether the provision of policy rate guidance by central banks impairs <b>market</b> <b>functioning.</b> While we find evidence that central bank policy rate forecasts influence market prices in New Zealand, we find no evidence that such guidance or forecasts impair <b>market</b> <b>functioning</b> in the United States, the euro area or New Zealand. The results suggest that the risk of impairing <b>market</b> <b>functioning</b> is not a strong argument against central banks' provision of policy rate guidance or forecasts.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} theoretical {{description of}} the evolution and <b>market</b> <b>functions</b> of interest rate futures. The paper contributes to the existing literature by documenting the evolution of interest rate futures and examining their <b>market</b> <b>functions.</b> Interest rate futures and their <b>market</b> <b>functions</b> have evolved {{on a number of}} exchanges over the last forty years as a result of worldwide dramatic fluctuations in interest rates. Most of these interest rate futures contracts are usually written on coupon bonds as the underlying assets and interest rate futures have had rapid growth with trading volumes larger than the futures on stock indexes and currencies. The reason behind this growth has been due to the severe impact of the interest rate risks as compared to risks arising from equity prices, exchange rates and commodity prices. The pioneer exchanges for trading financial futures were Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the International Monetary Market followed by others. The paper also discusses the <b>market</b> <b>functions</b> of interest rate futures such as risk reduction through the use of hedging strategies, speculation and arbitrage functions...|$|R

Results of an empirical study encompassing 821 respondents demonstrate strong support for improved performance on eight key outcomes for firms where {{sales and marketing}} were aligned.

40|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to define marketing, some of which have heen listed by Crosier [1]. The difficulty in doing so is compotmded by the evolution of marketing, which has seen it progress from adopting a purely managerial approach through systems, environmental, social and societal approaches [2]. Further complications in defining the nature and scope of marketing stem from the legitimately varied perceptions of the many contributors to the dehate (for example, Kotier smd Levy, [3, 4], Kotier [5] and Luck [6]). Thus there are many varied perceptions of what marketing is and is not. The approach adopted here is that marketing is a combination of the <b>marketing</b> concept, <b>marketing</b> <b>functions</b> and the operational implementation of these functions in the context of the concept. Figure 1 illustrates this. Thus to be truly marketing orientated, it is necessary for an organisation to adopt the marketing concept and to plan and implement <b>marketing</b> <b>functions.</b> Implementation of one, or indeed all, of tiie <b>marketing</b> <b>functions</b> without adoptio...|$|R
