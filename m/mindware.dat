5000|$|<b>Mindware</b> is the {{symbolic}} counterpart of mindmakers. The concept {{differs from that}} of memes {{in the way that the}} descriptive notion of a “bridge” {{differs from that of}} specified engineering types of bridges (suspension, cantilever, arch and so on). In the latter, what transmits is understood in terms of the specific engineering processes that support that transmission rather than the general idea of transmission. The use of a wedding ring is a meme when viewed from the perspective of transmitted culture, but it is <b>mindware</b> when viewed from the neurological changes it makes to the attachment processes in the brain that sustain the emotional bond of marriage. [...] The acquisition of social <b>mindware</b> is closely linked with rituals. [...] In <b>mindware</b> “the human ape found a brain programming language to bond across time and place—symbolic culture. This was to change forever what it meant to be a brain. Now the human mind could live in thousands of varieties of life. …with their <b>mindware</b> humans set themselves apart from other animals and the rest of nature”.|$|E

40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{gambling}} preventive initiatives have been realized with adolescents, {{many of them have}} been developed in absence of a clear and explicitly described theoretical model. The present work was aimed to analyze the adequacy of a model to explain gambling behavior referring to gambling-related cognitive distortions (Study 1), and to verify the effectiveness of a preventive intervention developed {{on the basis of this}} model (Study 2). Following dual-process theories on cognitive functioning, in Study 1 we tested a model in which <b>mindware</b> gap, i. e., susceptibility to the gambler’s fallacy, and contaminated <b>mindware,</b> i. e., superstitious thinking, were the antecedents of gambling-related cognitive distortions that, in turn, affect gambling frequency and problem gambling. Participants were 306 male adolescents (Mage = 17. 2 years). A path analysis indicated that cognitive distortions have a mediating role in the relationship that links probabilistic reasoning fallacy and superstitious thinking with problem gambling. Following these findings, in Study 2 we developed a school-based intervention aimed to reduce gambling-related cognitive distortions acting on the above cited <b>mindware</b> problems. A pre- and post-test design – with a 6 months follow-up – was performed with 34 male adolescents (Mage = 16. 8), randomly assigned to two groups (Training and No Training), and their baseline equivalence was verified. A Mixed 2 × 2 ANOVA attested a significant Time X Group interaction, indicating a significant reduction of the cognitive distortions from pre-test to post-test only in the Training group. The follow-up attested to the stability of the training effects and the reduction of gambling frequency over time. These findings suggest that prevention strategies should address <b>mindware</b> problems, which can be considered as predictors of gambling-related cognitive distortions...|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} European cities {{are confronted with}} {{population}} decline in a structural sense. This development of “urban shrinkage” has different causes, but similar effects: the city's hardware, software and <b>mindware</b> deteriorate. In this paper, we explore and assess policy strategies to respond to urban shrinkage in a European context. Four strategies are identified: (1) trivializing shrinkage, (2) countering shrinkage, (3) accepting shrinkage and (4) utilizing shrinkage. We suggest that accepting shrinkage by {{improving the quality of}} life for the city's existing residents is the most suitable and sustainable strategy. Dealing with shrinkage is a complex urban governance process that asks for a mental transformation from growth to shrinkage as well as regional rather than local thinking. Moreover, due to the fiscal burden of shrinkage, city governments will be increasingly dependent on the willingness of citizens to help. Civic engagement, however, is not something that can be simply dictated. Therefore we conclude that the authorities of Europe's shrinking cities should first enable their citizens to care for their community before asking them to do s...|$|E
