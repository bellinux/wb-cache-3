25|$|The Northrop X-21 was a {{modified}} WB-66D with an experimental wing, designed to conduct laminar flow control studies. Laminar-flow control {{was thought to}} potentially reduce drag {{by as much as}} 25%. Control would be by removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations. Northrop began flight research in April 1963 at Edwards Air Force Base, but with all of the problems encountered, and <b>money</b> <b>going</b> into the war, the X-21 would be the last experiment involving this concept.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time, {{large amounts of}} federal money went to public schools. In {{practice}} ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more <b>money</b> <b>going</b> to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities). For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 {{it was reported that}} {{less than half of the}} funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by Hugh Davis Graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.|$|E

The book Brodsky wrote, A Horse Named Special, is a story about a race horse who becomes a {{therapeutic}} horse and changes the lives of others after an injury. Diane Walters notes in a review, [...] "the relationship between rider and horse is an empowering one: bringing new skills in the mastery of horsemanship, which can be life changing when normal physical limitations or emotional issues are continually a challenge to manage on a daily basis." [...] A Horse Named Special has been showcased by the Children's Book Council. The story has been recommended by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in its featured booklist on therapy horses, and was cited as a real-life inspiration to children using service horses.|$|E
