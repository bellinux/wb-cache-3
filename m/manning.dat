5|$|As a freshman, <b>Manning</b> {{began the}} season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, <b>Manning</b> {{was one of three}} quarterbacks to come off the bench after starter Jerry Colquitt {{suffered}} a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, <b>Manning</b> was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and <b>Manning</b> took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but <b>Manning</b> was named the team's starter and remained so {{for the rest of his}} college career. In his first start, the following week against Washington State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|By then, <b>Manning</b> {{was living}} as an openly gay man. Her {{relationship}} with her father was apparently good, but there were problems between <b>Manning</b> and her stepmother. In March 2006, <b>Manning</b> reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning's failure to get another job; the stepmother called the police, and <b>Manning</b> was asked to leave the house. <b>Manning</b> drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her, at first slept in it, then moved in with a friend from school. The two got jobs at Incredible Pizza in April. <b>Manning</b> moved on to Chicago before {{running out of money}} and again having nowhere to stay. Her mother arranged for Brian's sister, Debra, a lawyer in Potomac, Maryland, to take <b>Manning</b> in. Nicks wrote that the 15 months <b>Manning</b> spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life. Chelsea had a boyfriend, took several low-paid jobs, and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College, but left after failing an exam.|$|E
5|$|Ernest <b>Manning</b> succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under <b>Manning,</b> Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. <b>Manning</b> lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, <b>Manning</b> resigned in 1967.|$|E

5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said <b>Manning</b> joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in <b>Manning</b> being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, <b>Manning</b> stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, <b>Manning</b> was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from <b>Manning,</b> or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. <b>Manning</b> told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify <b>Manning</b> as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between <b>Manning</b> and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering <b>Manning</b> any direction.|$|E
5|$|After Leaf threw four {{interceptions in}} the first half against the New York Giants in the Week 4 game (September 28), coach Kevin Gilbride benched Leaf in favor of Craig Whelihan. The {{following}} game on October 4 against the Indianapolis Colts matched Leaf against the number one 1998 draft pick Peyton <b>Manning.</b> Indianapolis won 17–12, as both quarterbacks completed 12 of 23 passes with an interception each, but Leaf threw for 160 yards (23 more than <b>Manning),</b> and only <b>Manning</b> threw a touchdown. <b>Manning</b> was never sacked; Leaf was sacked four times. Inside the final two minutes and San Diego down 14–6, Leaf's 56-yard pass to Charlie Jones set up a one-yard Natrone Means touchdown run, but Leaf's potential tying two-point conversion pass to Webster Slaughter was incomplete.|$|E

5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, <b>Manning</b> {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. <b>Manning</b> was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled <b>Manning</b> out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, <b>Manning</b> had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli <b>Manning</b> as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted <b>Manning,</b> and <b>Manning</b> wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on <b>Manning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Against the New England Patriots, <b>Manning</b> {{passed for}} 396 yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions, {{the second time}} <b>Manning</b> threw four touchdowns {{in a game that}} {{resulted}} in a loss. This broke a tie with Dan Marino for second-most all-time. The next week resulted in the largest margin of defeat at home in his NFL career, 36–14 to the San Diego Chargers. Against the Tennessee Titans, he went over 4,000 yards passing for the 11th time in a season, and tied Dan Marino with his 63rd regular season game with 300+ yards passing. <b>Manning</b> was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. The Colts ended up winning the AFC South for the seventh time in eight years, and <b>Manning</b> became the first quarterback in NFL history to lead his team to nine consecutive postseason berths (2002–2010). It was the 208th consecutive regular season start of his career, breaking Gene Upshaw's record. For the season, <b>Manning</b> finished with an NFL record 450 completions on 679 attempts (third most in history), and a career-high 4,700 yards passing. The season ended in a one-point defeat to the New York Jets in the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|At San Diego, <b>Manning</b> {{threw for}} 255 yards, two touchdowns, and one {{interception}} in a 23–20 victory.

After the Chargers rallied from a 10-point {{deficit in the}} fourth quarter to tie the game, <b>Manning</b> led the game-winning drive by completing a 14-yard pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th and inches at midfield. Adam Vinateri kicked the winning 51-yard field goal three plays later.
