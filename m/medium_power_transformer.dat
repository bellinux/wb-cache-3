The transformer’s rated apparent power is 63 MVA, itis connected between a wind farm at 22 kV and the grid, K¨orsb¨arsdalen, at 135 kV. Power systemanalysis are carried out on the grid, with the objective to test how DTR and increased wind poweraffects the grid performance with respect to reliability, voltage stability and active losses. Historical measurements of ambient temperature and transformer loading {{is used to calculate}}free transformer capacity based on unity life time loss. For the investigated transformer and giventime period the load can be increased without endanger transformer lifetime. The dynamicallyrated capacity exceeds the nominal capacity through the whole tested time period but DTR showsmost effective during winter when the ambient temperature is colder and therefore, has a coolingeffect on the transformer. DTR is used to calculate available transformer capacity but an increasedcapacity often comes with the expense of decreased lifetime and reliability. With the help of DTRthe current rate of transformer lifetime usage can be calculated and used as input to economicalanalysis where there is a trade of between reliability and profit from increased capacity. Through the power system analysis procedure presented in this report it is possible to sortout the faults that are most probable to cause severe violations, this information can be used forefficient reinforcement of the grid. The contingency and reliability analysis can work as base tofind the solutions that will decrease the probability for violations most efficiently. Furthermore,the developed procedure can also be used when expanding the grid and to determine which gridalternative that will be most reliable.

The reduced core size also benefits the winding size, the overall reduction in weight and volume is particularly appropriate for rail and air borne power supply equipment. Of the various amorphous metal alloys available in ribbon form, two were selected for evaluation for the frequency band 50 to 3000 Hz. Several cores were built suitable for use in a 3 kHz 20 kVA transformer using purpose built core winding facilities. The wound cores, after annealing, were subjected to a comprehensive series of tests using both sinusoidal and square wave supply voltages. The thesis contains a valuable analysis of the results obtained and related to the magnetic properties of amorphous metal. The effect of mechanical stresses has also been investigated. The wound amorphous ribbon cores were found to be slightly flexible and prone to flaking, as a consequence several methods of core protection were investigated.

Replacement of <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> always affined with costs and requires financial supply. The recalculation of energy systems nominal value, i. e. <b>power</b> of <b>transformers,</b> is following too. There are many affected nuances...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{permittivity}} of mineral-insulating oils {{employed for}} 150 -kV <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> was monitored {{as a function}} of frequency and temperature {{with the use of a}} high precision LCR meter. Monitoring was performed on both synthetic mixtures of brand-new oil samples with varying humidity content and as-received samples from field-operating <b>power</b> <b>transformers.</b> Overall, results provide insight on the state of the insulation within the components and the service life of <b>power</b> <b>transformers...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>transformers</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} and expensive equipment from the electricity transmission system, so {{it is very important to}} know the real state of health of such equipment in every moment. De-energizing the <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> accidentally due to internal defects can generate high costs. Annual maintenance proved to be ineffective in many cases to determine the internal condition of the equipment degradation due to faults rapidly evolving. An On-line Monitoring System for <b>Power</b> <b>Transformers</b> help real-time condition assessment and to detect errors early enough to take action to eliminate or minimize them. After abnormality detected, it is still important to perform full diagnostic tests to determine the exact condition of the equipment. On-line monitoring systems can help increase the level of availability and reliability of <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> and lower costs of accidental interruption. This paper presents cases studies on several <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> equipped with on-line monitoring systems from Transelectrica substation...|$|R
40|$|Major faults in <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> {{windings}} usually {{originate from}} small charges called partial discharges (PD). These discharges {{could lead to}} a breakdown in insulation and ultimate failure in the <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> if they are allowed to develop. Therefore, this thesis will present and develop a high-frequency model of <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> winding, which can detect the propagation of high-frequency partial discharges in a continuous disc type of high-voltage transformer winding. The lumped parameter model will be used to simulate the windings of the <b>power</b> <b>transformer.</b> This model represents the transformer winding with two discs of the winding represented by a single circuit. PD will be injected at different locations along the model. Using the knowledge of the frequency response of the winding within the faulty transformer, will help locating the partial discharges on the windings. Locating PDs in high-voltage <b>power</b> <b>transformers,</b> is useful for those who maintain the equipment...|$|R
