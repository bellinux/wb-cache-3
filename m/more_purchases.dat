The {{crash of the}} Wright Military Flyer, procured {{at the same time}} by the Army on its final test flight, September 17, 1908, claimed the first US military airplane fatality, 1st Lt. Thomas E.

After one year, Foulois had concluded through his experience, understanding of military dirigibles in Europe, and talks with Tom Baldwin, that there was no military future for lighter-than-air aircraft. In expressing this opinion to the Army General Staff, Foulois recommended no <b>more</b> <b>purchases</b> of dirigibles, the first of many disagreements with the military establishment.|$|E

2500|$|Matteo Pasquinelli reckons {{the basis}} for the belief that PageRank has a social {{component}} lies in the idea of attention economy. With attention economy, value is placed on products that receive a greater amount of human attention and the results {{at the top of the}} PageRank garner a larger amount of focus then those on subsequent pages. The outcomes with the higher PageRank will therefore enter the human consciousness to a larger extent. These ideas can influence decision-making and the actions of the viewer have a direct relation to the PageRank. They possess a higher potential to attract a user’s attention as their location increases the attention economy attached to the site. With this location they can receive more traffic and their online marketplace will have <b>more</b> <b>purchases.</b> The PageRank of these sites allow them to be trusted and they are able to parlay this trust into increased business.|$|E
500|$|Studies by Kotlikoff and David Rapson {{state that}} the FairTax would {{significantly}} reduce marginal taxes on work and saving, lowering overall average remaining lifetime tax burdens on current and future workers. [...] A study by Kotlikoff and Sabine Jokisch concluded that {{the long-term effects of}} the FairTax would reward low-income households with 26.3% <b>more</b> <b>purchasing</b> power, middle-income households with 12.4% <b>more</b> <b>purchasing</b> power, and high-income households with 5% <b>more</b> <b>purchasing</b> power. [...] The Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax would make the federal tax system more progressive and would benefit the average individual in almost all expenditures deciles. [...] In another study, they state the FairTax would offer the broadest tax base (an increase of over $2 trillion), which allows the FairTax to have a lower tax rate than current tax law.|$|R

2500|$|The Woodbridges {{had built}} a house, the first {{permanent}} residence in the township, by January 1737, and John Sergeant lodged with them at this time, to live among his congregation. On May 7, the town, then known only as [...] "Indian Town", was confirmed to the Mahicans, and funding was granted for a schoolhouse and meeting house to be constructed in August, with Timothy appointed to the supervising committee. In 1737, Timothy and Abigail served as witnesses to a land deal between Colonel John Stoddard and the Native Americans, comprising the modern town of Pittsfield. Timothy would be involved with many <b>more</b> <b>purchases</b> and land swaps in the coming years. During the winter of 1738-39, Sergeant and Woodbridge worked to create a passable road from New Glasgow, greatly increasing the accessibility of their town. Timothy was the senior deacon of the church, and identified as a New Light regarding the contemporary Great Awakening (he would later help recruit Jonathan Edwards, and become his greatest ally in Stockbridge).|$|E
2500|$|It {{took many}} years—and long after FitzRoy's {{departure}} from office—to resolve {{the question of}} European land titles to pre-Annexation purchases. A variety of methods were used, including new legislation (the 1849 Quieting Titles Ordinance, the 1856 Land Claims Settlement Act, the 1867 Land Claims Arbitration Act), another land commission running from 1857 to 1862 and headed by politician and former New Zealand Company agent Dillon Bell, land exchanges with Maori {{in order for them}} to abandon cultivations on Europeans' lands (the outcome of an investigation in 1847 by Lieutenant Colonel William Anson McCleverty, appointed by the Colonial Office), the issuing of land orders or [...] "scrip" [...] entitling settlers to select land near Auckland, and the issue of new Crown grants for Nelson and Port Nicholson (1848). FitzRoy's successor, Governor George Grey, believed FitzRoy had been wrong to set aside Spain's award at New Plymouth and threatened to survey the full 60,000 acres, with minimal compensation to be paid to Maori. He backed down under forceful Ati Awa opposition and instead bought 27,000 acres in the area from 1847 to 1848. Attempts to make <b>more</b> <b>purchases</b> were abandoned in 1849 when it became clear his actions were sparking inter-tribal disputes.|$|E

5000|$|FairTax {{supporters}} {{argue that}} the tax burden would shift {{to those who do}} not pay taxes under the current system and those with wealth. The FairTax would dramatically broaden the tax base to include all 300 million Americans and an estimated 30 million to 40 million foreign tourists and visitors. [...] In a study on tax base and rate, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would offer the broadest tax base and increase the federal government's net base to $9.355 trillion from $7.033 trillion of taxable income, which allows the FairTax to have a lower tax rate than current tax law. Proponents argue that if the rate appears too high, it brings to light the true cost of {{the federal government and the}} hidden taxes Congress has imposed on the American taxpayer. A study by Kotlikoff on marginal and average tax rates found that the FairTax would reduce most households’ average lifetime tax rates, although the study assumed an 18.3% cut in non-Social Security federal expenditure Economists at Boston University found that if their estimates of increased economic growth were correct the FairTax would reward low-income households with 26.3% <b>more</b> <b>purchasing</b> power, middle-income households with 12.4% <b>more</b> <b>purchasing</b> power, and high-income households with 5% <b>more</b> <b>purchasing</b> power.|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--Thank you, and God {{bless you}} for ever: {{this is a}} far better lot than the last; I have chosen four {{complete}} sets out of it for setting, quite admirable: the others are not quite one's taste; I find the colour far from always being agreeable, {{it is a great}} toss up. They have sent me duplicates of first a mad little scene with a white horse, a red monarch and a blue arm of the sea in it; and second of a night scene with water, flowers and a black and white umbrella and a wonderful grey distance and a wonderful general effect--one of my best in fact.

As it was his last day, and he was eager to go, and I had never been there, I gave my consent and we walked down to Westminster, where the court was then sitting. We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write to him and with a great many hopeful projects.

30|$|COO {{appears to}} affect {{pistachio}} purchase: 40 % {{of the respondents}} often purchase domestically produced pistachio only; 14 % prefer imported nuts only; 27 % purchase both; and 19 % {{do not know the}} COO of the pistachios. Thus, the statistics seem to indicate that domestically produced nuts are more popular than imported nuts. Most purchase was made for own consumption only (80 %). Only a few purchases were made for gift purpose (3 %) and <b>more</b> <b>purchase</b> was made for both occasions (15 %). Thus, pistachios are primary used for own consumption. This finding is out of our expectation as we expect <b>more</b> <b>purchase</b> would be made for gift purposes, especially during the holiday seasons. The result possibly indicates that pistachio is not any more a luxury item to entertain friends or relatives during major holidays. Rather it is considered as a daily snack to be consumed by respondents' own family.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine {{variables}} influencing purchase incidences at retail trade shows. To this end, retailer and consumer related antecedent variables are proposed. The retailer related variables are represented by store environmental cues of sales staff services, store atmosphere and product assortment. The consumer related variables are represented by impulse buying tendency and perceived time pressure. Drawing on relevant literature, hypotheses are developed to link each of these variables to purchase incidence. Data were collected using questionnaire from shoppers (N= 95) at a large retail trade show. The hypotheses were tested using partial least square path modeling. The findings indicate that consumers’ favorable evaluation of retailers’ sales staff services, store atmosphere and product assortment led to <b>more</b> <b>purchase</b> incidences. The findings about the consumer related variables indicate that impulse buying tendency led to <b>more</b> <b>purchase</b> incidences whereas perceived time pressure led to fewer purchase incidences.
