She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, everything, I have shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing <b>my</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E

500|$|Namuth befriended many German expatriates in Paris, {{including}} photographer George Reisner. [...] In 1935, Reisner invited Namuth {{to assist}} him with his studio in Port de Pollença, Spain, and introduced the 20-year-old Namuth to photography. [...] After several months, the two returned to Paris, supporting themselves with photojournalism and occasional portraits. [...] Namuth and Reisner were sent to cover the Workers' Olympiad in July 1936 by French magazine Vu, which put them in Barcelona during the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War. [...] Over the next nine months, the two photographed the war, providing photos to European publications. [...] Namuth and Reisner returned to Paris in 1937 and continued their careers as photographers until 1939. [...] While in Paris, Namuth studied with Joseph Breitenbach, who taught him {{the technical aspects of}} photography. [...] After increased tension and hostilities between France and Germany, Namuth and his fellow German expatriates were interned, though Namuth joined the French Foreign Legion to avoid his confinement. [...] After being discharged in 1940, Namuth fled to Marseilles and escaped to the United States with the help of journalist Varian Fry and his Emergency Rescue Committee. [...] He arrived in New York City in 1941 and planned to join the Office of Strategic Services in 1943 out of a desire [...] "to do something about everything". [...] However, he {{had fallen in love with}} French-born Guatemalan Carmen Herrera and delayed his enlistment until he was drafted for World War II in December 1943. [...] After completing basic training, Namuth joined the intelligence services and worked as an interrogator and interpreter in England, France, and Czechoslovakia. [...] Upon returning to Germany in 1945 to gather war criminals, Namuth realized, [...] "I really had cut my navel cord completely and totally, not just with <b>my</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> family but with the country as such. I was completely out of it." [...] Namuth did not return to Germany until 1970.|$|E

2500|$|Felicia Hemans (née Browne) {{was born}} in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, {{although}} she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia {{was born in}} Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), {{and it is clear}} that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as [...] "Land of my childhood, <b>my</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> my dead". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her.|$|E

She is a native English and German speaker (through her father and mother, respectively), and her fluency in German helped her pick up the Danish {{language}} quickly. Within a few months she spoke it nearly without accent, which further endeared her to the Danes. As {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I don't find the grammar especially difficult, but the pronunciation can be hard, since we swallow some of our words. It reminds me a little of Chinese, with the glottal stop … Saying something with an upswing or a downswing can give a word an entirely different meaning," [...] she explained. [...] "It was my decision to learn the language immediately. It would have been terrible to have to stand up and speak English at an engagement, or thank someone for something. It would have been utterly wrong. This is <b>my</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> so there was no other option".|$|E

2500|$|CNBC {{correspondent}} Jane Wells {{reported that}} the Occupy Wall Street movement sparked parodies which connect the movement to pop culture icons from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and others. An image of Luke Skywalker holding a protest sign was published: [...] "It wasn't glamorous but I had a steady living working on my uncle's moisture farm... my aunt and uncle were unjustly murdered and the farm destroyed. I {{was forced to leave}} <b>my</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> join an extinct cult just to survive. I am now a member of an upstart movement to take down a greedy corrupt establishment. I AM THE 99%." [...] Skywalker's enemies, the Imperial Storm Troopers, joined the protest on another image circulating on the Internet holding signs: [...] "End Galactic Corporate Greed", [...] "Get Our Troops Off Tatooine" [...] and [...] "Keep Your Empirical Hands Off My Healthcare". Parodies relating to Middle Earth include a woman who had written her complaint in Elvish, allegedly translated: [...] "I spend every waking hour fighting Orcs while Elrond and Galadriel eat lembas bread all day.

Anything can happen. So I love being in the Chili Peppers and it's <b>my</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. Like being in a family. I really can't predict. But I love being in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record." ...|$|E

[...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up.

[...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head.

2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in <b>my</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E
