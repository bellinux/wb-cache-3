40|$|A {{conservative}} overset <b>mesh</b> <b>scheme</b> {{has been}} developed for the simulation of unsteady time-accurate flows around multiple objects in relative motion based on an unstructured mesh methodology. To prevent spurious production of flow and to satisfy the conservation property across the overset mesh block boundary, a new intergrid boundary reconnection technique was developed. At each time step, blank region is created between mesh blocks after hole cutting, and this gap is refilled with new triangular elements generated by interconnecting the vertices distributed along the boundary of the mesh blocks. By executing this procedure, all mesh blocks are connected to each other instantaneously, and the complete flow domain can be calculated as a single-block mesh at each time step. Thus, the conservation property of flow over the global computational domain is automatically satisfied. This method was successfully implemented into a vertex-centered finite-volume flow solver. Several applications were made to validate the numerical behaviors of the present conservative overset <b>mesh</b> <b>scheme.</b> It {{was found that the}} present conservative overset <b>mesh</b> <b>scheme</b> coupled with the intergrid boundary reconnection technique is more accurate, efficient, and robust than the conventional non-conservative overset <b>mesh</b> <b>scheme.</b> Nomenclature sL,sR = left and right segment of cell edge ߱ = frequency of oscillation, 2 κM∞ κ = reduced frequency M ∞ = freestream Mach number Re = Reynolds number based on the airfoil chord length Cp = pressure coefficient CL = lift coefficient CD = drag coefficient CM = moment coefficient y+ = non-dimensional wall distance X,Y = x and y coordinates of computational domain t * = non-dimensional time α = angle of attack, deg.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} the first effort in designing a moving mesh algorithm {{to solve the}} incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the primitive variables formulation. The main difficulty in developing this moving <b>mesh</b> <b>scheme</b> is how to keep it divergence-free for the velocity field at each time level. The proposed numerical scheme extends a recent moving grid method based on harmonic mapping [R. Li, T. Tang, and P. W. Zhang, J. Comput. Phys., 170 (2001), pp. 562 – 588], which decouples the PDE solver and the mesh-moving algorithm. This approach requires interpolating the solution on the newly generated mesh. Designing a divergence-free-preserving interpolation algorithm is the first goal of this work. Selecting suitable monitor functions is important and is found challenging for the incompressible flow simulations, which is the second goal of this study. The performance of the moving <b>mesh</b> <b>scheme</b> is tested on the standard periodic double shear layer problem.
