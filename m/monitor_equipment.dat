50|$|The {{large number}} of alarms, {{especially}} of false alarms, has led to several unintended outcomes. Some consequences are disruption in patient care, desensitization to alarms, anxiety in hospital staff and patients, sleep deprivation and depressed immune systems, misuse of <b>monitor</b> <b>equipment,</b> and missed critical events. Some additional outcomes include workload increase, interference with communication, wasted time, patient dissatisfaction, and unnecessary investigations, referrals, or treatments.|$|E
50|$|It is {{necessary}} to develop an internal documentation system as well as multi-party communication standards and protocols to transfer or create a central repository or hub to track information across the supply chain. These systems would <b>monitor</b> <b>equipment</b> status, product temperature history, and custody chain, etc. These help ensure that a food, pharmaceutical, or vaccine is safe and effective when reaching its intended consumer. It {{is also important to}} have a complete chain of custody for the entire life cycle of a product, so there is documented evidence as to whom had control of the product throughout the lifecycle of the product, up to the final users consumption of the product.|$|E
50|$|However, {{this color}} space {{conversion}} is lossy, particularly obvious in crosstalk from the luma to the chroma-carrying wire, and vice versa, in analogue equipment (including RCA connectors to transfer a digital signal, as all they carry is analogue composite video, which is either YUV, YIQ, or even CVBS). Furthermore, NTSC and PAL encoded color signals {{in a manner}} that causes high bandwidth chroma and luma signals to mix with each other in a bid to maintain backward compatibility with black and white television equipment, which results in dot crawl and cross color artifacts. When the NTSC standard was created in the 1950s, this was not a real concern since the quality of the image was limited by the <b>monitor</b> <b>equipment,</b> not the limited-bandwidth signal being received. However today′s modern television is capable of displaying more information than is contained in these lossy signals. To keep pace with the abilities of new display technologies, attempts were made since the late 1970s to preserve more of the Y′UV signal while transferring images, such as SCART (1977) and S-Video (1987) connectors.|$|E

50|$|The term NIBP, for {{non-invasive}} blood pressure, {{is often}} used to describe oscillometric <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} clear that the traditional way of measuring blood pressure in the clinic or office frequently produces numbers that grossly overestimate a patient’s true blood pressure level. This effect is often caused by so called „white coat“ syndrome. Nowadays, for this reason it becomes more popular so called home monitoring of blood pressure, that attenuates this effect. In the paper, there is described specially telemedicine system for monitoring of blood pressure. The system consists of blood <b>monitor</b> <b>equipment</b> which automatically reports results of up-to-date patient’s measurements to the doctor’s monitoring and decision support (MDS) system using wireless communication.
