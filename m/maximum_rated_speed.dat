40|$|As {{semiconductor}} manufacturing technology scales to smaller device sizes, the power consumption of clocked digital ICs begins to increase. Dynamic {{voltage and frequency}} scaling (DVFS) is a wellknown technique for conserving energy. Recently, {{it has also been}} used to control the CPU temperature as part of Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. Most works in these areas assume that the optimum speed profile (for either minimizing energy or maximizing performance) is a constant profile. However, in the presence of thermal constraints, we show that the optimal profile is in general, a time-varying function. We formulate the problem of maximizing the average throughput of a processor over a given time period, subject to thermal and speed constraints, as a problem in the calculus of variations. The variational approach provides a powerful framework for precisely specifying and solving the speed control problem, and allows us to obtain an exact analytical solution. The solution methodology is very general, and works for any convex power model, and simple lumped RC thermal models. The resulting speed profiles were found to consist of up to three segments, of which {{one of them is a}} decreasing function of time, and the others are constant. We anialyze the effect of different parameters like the initial temperature, thermal capacitance and the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>speed</b> on the nature and the cost oftheoptimum solution. We also propose a two-speed solution that approximates the optimal speed curve. This solution was found to achieve a performance close to thatof the optimum, and is also easier to implement in real processors.

50|$|Peak {{power of}} a {{traction}} engine occurs at a rotational speed higher than the speed when torque is maximised and at or below the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> rotational <b>speed</b> - Max RPM. A rapidly falling torque curve would correspond with sharp torque and power curve peaks around their maxima at similar rotational speed, for example a small, lightweight engine with a large turbocharger. A slowly falling or near flat torque curve would correspond with a slowly rising power curve up to a maximum at a rotational speed close to Max RPM, for example a large, heavy multi-cylinder engine suitable for cargo/hauling. A falling torque curve could correspond with a near flat power curve across rotational speeds for smooth handling at different vehicle speeds.|$|R

Typical projected UAV operations such as surveillance, payload delivery, and search and rescue can be addressed by waypoint-based guidance. Automatic target recognition, for instance, requires that the aircraft approach the possible target from one or more desired directions. In a highly dynamic cooperative UAV environment, the management system, either centralized or decentralized, may switch the waypoint set rapidly to change an aircraft mission depending on external events, pop-up threats, etc.; the new waypoint set may be ill-formed in terms of flyability (<b>maximum</b> turn <b>rates,</b> descent <b>speed,</b> acceleration, etc.). ...|$|R

60|$|Most {{persons who}} have crossed from Dover to Calais, or vice versa, by the Calais-Douvre mail packet, will bear witness both to the comfort and speed of that vessel. Up to this she has proved the most perfect form of steam-ship yet {{constructed}} for the purpose required. The Calais-Douvre is built somewhat upon the same principle as the Castalia, but differs from that vessel in that whereas the latter was two half-ships joined together, each twin-portion of the Calais-Douvre is a perfect ship in itself. The result has been, that while the Castalia was a failure, the Calais-Douvre has proved a distinct success. She is three hundred feet in length and sixty feet in breadth; her tonnage is two thousand, and her water-draught only six feet, {{so that she can}} enter Calais Harbour at even a low tide. Two transverse iron girder bulk-heads unite the two hulls of the vessel; and her steering apparatus is so simple, {{and at the same time}} so effective in construction, that one wheel is usually sufficient to work it. She makes the passage from Dover to Calais usually in an hour and a half; but in very fine weather we ourselves have crossed in less than that time. With the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>speed,</b> the Calais-Douvre has attained the minimum amount of pitching and rolling yet secured by any Channel boat. Her saloons, cabins, and decks are spacious and handsomely appointed, so that the Channel passage in this vessel is made under as favourable conditions for bad sailors as any sea-passage can be.|$|R

The city of Almere has developed an evacuation plan in case of the emergency of a flooding, but assumes a normal driving behavior of the evacuees. In this paper a microscopic S-Paramics simulation framework in an evacuation condition is set up to assess the impact of variations in driving behavior on the evacuation clearance time. Different scenarios in terms of acceleration <b>rate,</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed,</b> mean headway and minimum gap distance have been developed. The results show that increases in acceleration <b>rate</b> and in <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> do not have a significant impact on the evacuation clearance time. It is also found that a reduction both in mean headway and in minimum gap significantly reduce the evacuation time. Therefore, it is very important to consider the driving behavior in an evacuation condition for an evacuation plan. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 54 - 61. The {{possibility}} of using methanol {{as an alternative}} fuel for petrol and diesel engines has been investigated at the University of Cape Town {{in recent years by}} the Energy Research Institute. Engines, taken from existing road vehicles, were converted to methanol operation and evaluated. During the planning phase of each conversion, it was apparent that there was a need for a method of estimating the probable performance of the converted engine. The objective of this thesis was therefore to develop a generally applicable formula for predicting the rated performance of a methanol-fuelled, spark-ignition engine given only the bore, stroke, number of cylinders and <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> engine <b>speed.</b> The prediction was based on an estimate of the indicated efficiency, the volumetric efficiency and the frictional losses of a methanol engine, from which the shaft power and overall efficiency could be determined. The performance of three engines, which were converted to methanol operation, was used to test the theory. The conversions were each of a very different nature: - a) An automotive petrol engine of which only the carburettor was modified. b) An automotive petrol engine that was modified {{to take advantage of the}} properties of methanol to improve the performance. c) A truck diesel engine that was converted to spark ignition for operation on methanol. The predicted results were found to compare favourably with the experimental results, with the exception of one spurious reading. An analysis of the range of error in the theoretical estimate was used as the basis for comparison: Range of error in predicted overall efficiency ± 6 %. Range of error in predicted shaft power ± 10 %. The work of this thesis would be applicable in situations where a quick answer was required and few details were available. With the aid of a programmable calculator, the anticipated performance map could be obtained in a few minutes...|$|R

This study incorporated six variables to assess the CVI for the study area. These six variables consist of geomorphology, shoreline change <b>rate,</b> <b>maximum</b> current <b>speed,</b> maximum tidal range, significant wave height and sea level rise. The ranking is on a linear scale from 1 to 5 in order of increasing vulnerability; value 1 represents the lowest risk ranking assigned to the coastline whereas value 5 ranks the coastline with the highest risk. A total of 1963 km of coastline was evaluated and of this, 3. 3 % of the mapped shoreline is classified as being extreme vulnerability, 11 % of Peninsular Malaysia shoreline is classified as very high vulnerability and 40 % as high vulnerability.
