Bees wax and cetyl alcohol were evaluated as hot melt coating materials for taste masking. Drug containing pellets were prepared and coated using hot <b>melt</b> <b>technique.</b> Threshold bitterness concentrations of drugs and taste evaluation of hot melt coated pellets were determined by panel method. The pellets of all the formulation batches were in the size range of 825 to 995 μ after hot melt coating. Pellets exhibited uniformity of content in the range of 97. 6 – 101. 1 %. Threshold bitterness concentration of both the drugs was found to be about 300 µg/ml.

Since these viruses produce similar clinical signs it is important for physicians and epidemiologists to differentiate them rapidly. A molecular method was developed for their detection and quantitation in plasma samples and a DENV typing technique were developed. The method consisted in performing two multiplex real-time one-step RT-PCR assays, to detect and quantify the three viruses. Both assays were conducted in a single run, from a single RNA extract containing a unique coextracted and coamplified composite internal control. The quantitation results were close to the best detection thresholds obtained with simplex RT-PCR techniques. The differentiation of DENV types was performed using a High Resolution <b>Melting</b> <b>technique.</b> The assays enable the early diagnosis of the three arboviruses during viremia, including cases of coinfection.
