40|$|This memo {{outlines}} how RTP {{sessions are}} synchronised, and discusses how rapidly such synchronisation can occur.

40|$|Abstract—Information-centric {{networking}} (ICN) {{constitutes an}} alternative to the conventional, IP-based, internetworking, with information itself being identified rather than the host where it resides. This approach introduces powerful tools and operations for content delivery, such as native support for multicast. Exploiting this native multicast capability is a very promising approach for multimedia applications such as Networked Music Performance (NMP), where a set of musicians located in different places wish to perform together in real time. While conferencing applications traditionally rely on a <b>Multipoint</b> <b>Conferencing</b> Unit (MCU) that receives media streams from each participant and then retransmits a mixed stream to each one, in NMP we would prefer direct communication between the participants, so as to reduce transmission delays and allow each participant to mix the incoming media streams in the desired manner. In this paper we introduce an ICN-based NMP application exploiting native multicast, and compare its performance with both MCU and non-MCU NMP variants, using both unicast and multicast.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to establishing application layer conference trees for multimedia multipoint conferences on the Internet using the Megaco/H. 248 protocol, a Voice over IP (VoIP) media gateway control protocol. In existing VoIP protocols (and also legacy telephone networks), a <b>multipoint</b> <b>conference</b> takes place through an MCU, and forms a star topology centered at the MCU. This paper suggests to establishing shared, cost effective conference trees for VoIP conferences. Each tree is rooted at the conference initiator, who initiates the conference, and spans over all the conference members. Tree branches grow or are trimmed dynamically and adaptively, in a way to avoid the growth of a skewed tree. We develop a simplified analytical model and conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that our approach enjoys the advantage of lower join latency and better bandwidth efficiency compared to the traditional MCU approach, and is cost effective compared to a near optimal Steiner tree. © 2005 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

In more practical terms, an MCU is a conference bridge not unlike the conference bridges used in the PSTN today. The most significant difference, however, is that H.323 MCUs might be capable of mixing or switching video, in addition to the normal audio mixing done by a traditional conference bridge. Some MCUs also provide multipoint data collaboration capabilities. What this means to the end user is that, by placing a video call into an H.323 MCU, the user might be able to see all of the other participants in the conference, not only hear their voices.|$|R

The main purpose was to optimise the integrationof groupware technologies and evaluate the suitability of desktop <b>conferencing</b> systems (including <b>multipoint</b> sessions) for supporting {{the work of the}} German Federal administration through a complete document management. On the one hand standard tools like <b>multipoint</b> audio/video <b>conferencing</b> and application sharing were integrated seamlessly, on the other hand specific features like conference reservation and group awareness fulfil requirements that could not be met otherwise. Therefore the exploration of current and potential application contexts for groupware technology had to be done as well as the evaluation of qualitative and quantitative benefits of groupware support in dislocated work processes and the limitations of the technology had to be analysed. The introduction of groupware technologies into the technical infrastructure, into work groups collaboration practices, and the coaching efforts necessary to support the use of telecooperation and document mangement technology is dislocated work processes were to be tested by the pilot users. BIFOA's main task was to work out - step by step - the hard- and software-systems provided by the industrial partners under consideration of the users view. The central results of these evaluations were suggestions for extension and improvement for the revision and detail of the functional specifications for the gradually improved solutions for application.

Furthermore the reactions upon the research and working process of the other partners as well as hints of the pilot users and the evaluation of the researchers should be demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a region of}} interest transcoding scheme for <b>multipoint</b> video <b>conferencing</b> to enhance visual quality. In a <b>multipoint</b> video <b>conference,</b> usually there are {{only one or two}} active conferees at one time, which are the regions of interest to the other conferees involved. We propose a dynamic sub-window skip-ping scheme to firstly identify the active participants from the mul-tiple incoming encoded video streams by calculating the motion ac-tivity of each sub-window and then dynamically reduce the frame rates of the motion inactive participants by skipping these less-im-portant sub-windows. The bits saved from the skipping operation are reallocated to the active sub-windows to enhance the regions of interest. We also propose a low-complexity scheme to compose, as well as trace, the unavailable motion vectors with a good accuracy in the dropped inactive sub-windows after performing sub-window skipping. Simulation results show that the proposed methods not only significantly improve the visual quality of the active sub-win-dows without introducing serious visual quality degradation in the inactive ones, but also reduce the computational complexity and avoid whole-frame skipping. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is fully compatible with the H. 263 video coding standard.
