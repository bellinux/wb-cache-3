40|$|Aims/Introduction: Low aerobic {{capacity}} {{is a strong}} and independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Here, we investigated the effects of pioglitazone treatment on whole-body aerobic capacity and skeletal <b>muscle</b> energy <b>metabolism</b> in MetS patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 male patients with MetS received oral pioglitazone 15 mg/day for 4 months. To assess whole-body aerobic capacity, exercise testing with a bicycle ergometer was carried out before and after pioglitazone treatment. To assess skeletal <b>muscle</b> energy <b>metabolism,</b> intramyocellular lipid in the resting leg and high-energy phosphates in the calf muscle during plantar-flexion exercise were measured using 1 proton- and 31 phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Results: Pioglitazone significantly increased peak oxygen uptake (25. 1 ± 4. 9 mL/kg/min pretreatment vs 27. 2 ± 3. 9 mL/kg/min post- treatment, P < 0. 05) and anaerobic threshold (12. 7 ± 1. 9 mL/kg/min pretreatment vs 13. 6 ± 1. 6 mL/kg/min post-treatment, P < 0. 05), although daily physical activity was comparable {{before and after the}} treatment. Intramyocellular lipid content was significantly reduced after pioglitazone treatment by 26 %, indicating improved skeletal <b>muscle</b> fatty acid <b>metabolism.</b> Pioglitazone also significantly decreased the muscle phosphocreatine loss during exercise by 13 %, indicating improved skeletal <b>muscle</b> high-energy phosphate <b>metabolism.</b> Notably, the increase in anaerobic threshold; that is, submaximal aerobic capacity, closely correlated with the decrease in intramyocellular lipid content after pioglitazone treatment. Conclusions: Pioglitazone significantly improved the MetS patients' whole-body aerobic capacity and skeletal <b>muscle</b> energy <b>metabolism.</b> The beneficial effect of pioglitazone on whole-body aerobic capacity might be at least in part through improved fatty acid metabolism in the skeletal muscle...|$|R

Muscle atrophy occurred more rapidly in old rats, and recovery of muscle mass was impaired when compared with adults. Muscle wasting resulted mainly from increased protein breakdown in adult rat but from depressed protein syn-thesis in the aged animal. Glucocorticoid treatment sig-nificantly decreased the stimulatory eVect of insulin and IGF-I on muscle protein synthesis in adult rats by 25 · 9 and 58 · 1 % respectively. In old rats, this eVect was even greater, being 49 · 3 and 100 % respectively. With regard to muscle proteolysis, glucocorticoids blunted the anti-proteolytic action of insulin and IGF-I in both age groups. During the recovery period, adult rats reversed the glucocorticoid-induced resistance of <b>muscle</b> protein <b>metabolism</b> within 3 days, at which time old rats still exhibited the decrease in insulin-regulated proteolysis. In conclusion, the higher sensitivity of old rat muscle to glucocorticoids may in part result from the greater modification of the eVects of insulin and IGF-I on <b>muscle</b> protein <b>metabolism.</b> These responses to glucocorticoids in old rats may be associated with the emergence of muscle atrophy with advancing age...|$|R
