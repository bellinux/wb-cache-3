5|$|In June 2012, Roy {{announced}} that he was planning to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> to the NBA. He said he had recovered enough to play after having the platelet-rich plasma procedure that Kobe Bryant has also had to keep his knees healthy. He could not play for Portland under the current NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement because of Portland's amnesty of him in 2011. Roy entered the free agent market on July 1, 2012. Roy reportedly had expressed interest in signing with the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, or Chicago Bulls.|$|E
5|$|Following {{indifferent}} form in 2004 {{and poor}} form in 2005, he was {{dropped from the}} team in October 2005. Having been nominated and rejected in 2000, when the game suffered a tarnished reputation due to match fixing scandals, the captaincy was passed to Dravid, his former deputy. Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> to the team. Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution {{in the field of}} sports. He was presented with the award on 30 June 2004, by then President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.|$|E

In 1964, O'Brien went to the Tokyo Olympics and came from third at the 150m mark to win the gold medal. He added a bronze in the medley relay. O'Brien {{successfully}} defended both his breaststroke titles at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica before retiring to support his family. Swimming officials persuaded him to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, as Australia did not have a breaststroker, and after a crash diet, he finished sixth in the 100m event but failed to reach the final in the 200m event. He then retired and went into the television industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, O'Brien {{skipped the}} Australian Championships {{because he had}} no {{sponsorship}} and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Fowler could miss the rest of the 2007–08 season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought. Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture in order for the hip to heal properly. Despite this, he attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> {{at the end of the}} season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad. He did not feature in the game in and thus did not receive a runners-up medal having not made an appearance in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, but his {{injuries}} limited him to only 26 games {{over the next}} three seasons. He sat out the entire 1977–78 season. By 1978, Orr had undergone over a dozen knee surgeries, was having trouble walking and barely skated anymore. However, in the summer of 1978, he decided to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback.</b> He played six games of the 1978–79 season and {{came to the conclusion that}} he could no longer play and informed the Black Hawks that he was retiring. He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford. He scored his last NHL goal and point against Detroit on October 28, 1978, at Detroit's Olympia Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Billed as {{the next}} Sandy Koufax, Clyde had a stellar high school career at Westchester High School. He was drafted with the first overall pick in the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. The Rangers planned to have Clyde pitch his first two {{professional}} games {{in the major leagues}} before moving him down to the minor leagues, but Rangers owner Bob Short decided to keep him in the roster for monetary purposes, where he had a 5.01 earned run average in 18 starts. Journalists criticized the Rangers for promoting Clyde too soon, and after an uneventful 1974 campaign, he developed shoulder trouble and was sent down to the minor leagues in 1975, where he pitched three seasons. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1978, and played two seasons before being demoted. Clyde attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> with the Houston Astros but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E

5|$|Owen Hart {{demanded a}} match against Bret Hart, which Bret {{repeatedly}} refused. This situation was complicated because of Bret co-winning the Royal Rumble. Jack Tunney decided that both Bret Hart and Lex Luger would get title shots at WrestleMania X, {{but that they}} would each wrestle two matches at the event. Lex Luger won a coin toss televised on Monday Night Raw and won the chance to face Yokozuna first. If he had lost the toss, he would have wrestled Crush before facing Yokozuna. Under the rules set forth by Tunney, Bret was required to wrestle Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania. Owen won the match, but Bret came out of WrestleMania with the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after Yokozuna dropped the title to him. This led to an extended feud between the two that saw Jim Neidhart return to the WWF to side with Owen and Davey Boy Smith to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> to take Bret's side.|$|E
5|$|An ankle injury, which Brandon {{picked up}} in a {{pre-season}} tour game against Scottish side Motherwell kept Brandon {{out of the side}} {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. This included a League Cup game against his old side Huddersfield Town on 12 August 2008, for which he was a spectator as Bradford lost 4–0. When he attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback,</b> he injured his other ankle in a reserve game with Scunthorpe United and was forced to undergo the first operation of his career which kept him out until January 2009. Once he returned to training in January, his first team debut was again delayed after a shoulder injury suffered at home. He returned to action for the reserves against Doncaster Rovers in February, before making his long-awaited debut on 7 March 2009 against Aldershot Town with City three goals ahead in a game which finally finished 5–0. He finished the season playing seven games. However, City missed out on promotion and Brandon's future was cast into doubt because of the size of his contract and budget cuts at the club.|$|E
5|$|Washington shared {{time at the}} Trail Blazers {{power forward}} spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the {{full-time}} starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned {{a spot in the}} 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comeback</b> with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.|$|E
