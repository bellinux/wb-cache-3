The raw data spectrum (red) is fitted with five components or chemical states, A through E. The more oxidized forms of Si (SiOx, x = 1-2) appear at higher binding energies in the broad feature centered at 103.67 eV. The so-called metallic form of silicon, which resides below an upper layer of oxidized silicon, exhibits a set of doublet peaks at 100.30 eV (Si 2p1/2) and 99.69 eV (Si 2p3/2). The fact that the <b>metallic</b> <b>silicon</b> signal can be seen [...] "through" [...] the overlayer of oxidized Si indicates that the silicon oxide layer is relatively thin (2-3 nm).

During the oxidation process, the CO 2 emission was progressively enhanced with increasing the oxidation temperature, and the exothermic oxidation primarily occurred above 700 A degrees C. The non-isothermal oxidation of silicon slag powder was a complicated process, involving the oxidation, crystal precipitation and disproportionation processes. The graphite phase was completely removed at 1000 A degrees C. The SiC and cristobalite phases greatly increased at 750 A degrees C and decreased with further increasing the oxidation temperature. For the isothermal oxidation, the Si and SiC phases generally reduced with increasing the soaking time. The cristobalite and tridymite phases increased with the oxidation time.

40|$|Particle {{emission}} observations during scratching {{of solid}} surfaces were undertaken by many researchers, and generally {{it was observed}} that the intensity of tribo-induced emission of the electrons, ions, and photons decrease in the order: insulator>semiconductor> conductor. Many experiments conducted to compare the emission of negatively-charged particles in case of the semiconductors Si and Ge with that from selected insulators have reported a clear decreasing trend of the tribo-emission intensity as contact progressed over the same wear track for diamond-on-Si and diamond-on-Ge. Despite that all of these experiments were performed in vacuum, the origin of the weak signals and the decrease of signal strength in the case of Si – and Ge- centered around the presence of dielectric silicon oxide films formed in air during surface preparation or because of the samples being of mono-crystalline nature. This paper offers an alternative explanation to the behaviour of tribo-emitted particles as observed by Molina and Nakayama. This is based on the documented pressure induced semi-conductor-to-metallic phase transformation that takes place in Si and Ge during sliding. It is shown that due to repeated sliding, the wear tracks experience a semiconductor-to-metal transformation that renders the bulk of material immediately under the diamond slider conducting.

40|$|Although steel {{production}} by molten oxide electrolysis offers potential {{economic and environmental}} advantages over classic extractive metallurgy, its feasibility {{is far from being}} convincingly demonstrated, mainly due to inherent experimental difficulties exerted by harsh conditions and lack of knowledge regarding relevant mechanisms and physico-chemical processes in the melts. The present work was intended to demonstrate the concept of pyroelectrolysis at very high temperature near the minimum liquidus point of magnesium aluminosilicate, being conducted under electron-blocking conditions using yttria-stabilized zirconia cells, and to provide a new insight into electrochemistry behind this process. Significant current yields are possible for pyroelectrolysis performed in electron-blocking mode using a solid electrolyte membrane to separate the anode and the molten electrolyte. Parasitic electrochemical processes rise gradually as the concentration of iron oxide dissolved in the molten electrolytes is depleted, impairing faradaic efficiency. Reduction of silica to <b>metallic</b> <b>silicon</b> was identified as a significant contribution to those parasitic currents, among other plausible processes. Direct pyroelectrolysis without electron blocking was found much less plausible, due to major limitations on faradaic efficiency imposed by electronic leakage and insufficient ionic conductivity of the aluminosilicate melt. Ohmic losses may consume an excessive fraction of the applied voltage, thus failing to sustain the Nernst potential required for reduction to metallic iron. The results suggest the need for further optimization of the molten electrolyte composition to promote ionic conductivity and to suppress electronic transport contribution, possibly, by tuning the Al/Si ratio and altering the network-forming/modifying behaviour of the iron cations...|$|E

The main emphasis of this work was the reduction of TiO₂ and FeTiO₃ in a hydrogen plasma. The plasma was maintained in a single resonant cavity using microwave energy (2. 45 GHz). The reaction was monitored for volatile species by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The extent of reaction during hydrogen reduction experiments was performed using an external standard X-ray diffraction technique. The effect of process variables (absorbed power, chamber pressure, time of plasma solid contact, applied voltages) {{on the extent of}} the reactions and the sample temperature were investigated. An investigation into the chlorination of TiO₂ in a chlorine plasma was also performed, however, the numerous side reactions that developed during these experiments made analysis difficult. Attempts were made to identify the volatile species from the mass spectra obtained during the chlorination experiments. The reduction of fused silica as a result of contact with the plasma is also investigated. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the reduction proceeds by the formation of silane in the plasma; <b>metallic</b> <b>silicon</b> is formed by the subsequent thermal decomposition of silane in a non-oxidizing environment.
