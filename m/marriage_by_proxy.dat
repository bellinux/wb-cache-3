5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her <b>marriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>proxy,</b> on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
25|$|Marie de' Medici {{became the}} second wife to King Henry IV of France in a <b>marriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> on 5 October 1600 {{by the power}} {{invested}} in her uncle, Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany. When Henry was assassinated in 1610, Louis XIII, his son and successor to the throne, was only eight years old. Louis' mother, Marie, acted as his regent as commanded by the Frankish Salic law {{in case of an}} infant ruler. However, even after Louis came of age at thirteen in 1614, the queen continued ruling in his stead. In 1617, Louis XIII finally decided to take governing matters in his own hands at the age of fifteen and the queen was exiled to Blois.|$|E
500|$|Henry VII {{planned to}} marry Arthur to a {{daughter}} of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, in order to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. It was suggested that the choice of marrying Arthur to Ferdinand and Isabella's youngest daughter, Catherine (b. 1485), would be appropriate. The Treaty of Medina del Campo (27 March 1489) provided that Arthur and Catherine would be married {{as soon as they}} reached canonical age; it also settled Catherine's dowry at 200,000 crowns (the equivalent of £5 million in 2007). Since Arthur, not yet 14, was below the age of consent, a papal dispensation (i.e., waiver) allowing the marriage was issued in February 1497, and the pair were betrothed by proxy on 25 August 1497. Two years later, a <b>marriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> took place at Arthur's Tickenhill Manor in Bewdley, near Worcester; Arthur said to Roderigo de Puebla, who had acted as proxy for Catherine, that [...] "he much rejoiced to contract the marriage because of his deep and sincere love for the Princess".|$|E

2500|$|However, in 1949 the Republic of China {{had been}} overthrown by {{communist}} guerillas led by Mao Zedong, and the people's republic of china {{was founded in}} the same year. In May 1950 the Peoples Republic of China enacted the New Marriage Law to tackle the sale of women into slavery. This outlawed <b>marriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> and made marriage legal so long as both partners consent. The New Marriage Law raised the {{legal age of marriage}} to 20 for men and 18 for women. This was an essential part of countryside land reform as women could no longer legally be sold to landlords. The official slogan was [...] "Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt".|$|E
2500|$|Isabella {{was born}} in Paris on an {{uncertain}} date– {{on the basis of}} the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between May and November 1295. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and Piers Langtoft agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chroniclers Guillaume de Nangis and Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate <b>marriage</b> <b>by</b> <b>proxy,</b> despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since she had to reach the canonical age of 7 before her betrothal in May 1303, and that of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between May and November 1295. Her parents were King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre; [...] her brothers Louis, Philip and Charles became kings of France.|$|E
50|$|The {{marriage}} {{was seen as}} a brilliant match by the House of Lorraine but was regarded by some as a rank not deserved for a petite-fille de France. Despite this, the House of Lorraine received a dowry of 900,000 Livres. So many honors excited the jealousy of {{the other members of the}} royal family, and, taking the pretext of the death of a child of the Duke of Maine, certain princesses claimed to attend the <b>marriage</b> ceremonies <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> in dress of mourning.|$|R

50|$|At that point, {{the rivalry}} between Balboa and Pedrarias ceased abruptly, {{due in large}} part to the intercession of Bishop de Quevedo and Isabel de Bobadilla, who {{arranged}} for Balboa's marriage to María de Peñalosa, one of Pedrarias' daughters, who was in Spain. Shortly thereafter, the bishop left for Spain and the <b>marriage</b> took place <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> (they would never meet because she was in Spain and Balboa would never return to his homeland). The friendship between Pedrarias and Balboa lasted barely two years, but in that time Balboa came to show great filial affection toward his father-in-law.|$|R

2500|$|Marie Jeanne of Savoy (Marie Jeanne Baptiste; 11 April 1644 [...] 15 March 1724) {{was born}} a Princess of Savoy and became the Duchess of Savoy <b>by</b> <b>marriage.</b> First married <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> to Charles of Lorraine in 1662, Lorraine soon refused to {{recognise}} the union and it was annulled. She married Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy in 1665 who was her kinsman.

Her regency officially ended in 1680, but she maintained power until her son banished her from further influence in the state in 1684.

50|$|In his printed {{collection}} of guitar music, Resumen de acompañar, Murcia {{describes himself as}} Master of Guitar to the Spanish Queen Maria Luisa of Savoy. She was the first wife of the first Bourbon king of Spain, Philip (Felipe) V, a grandson of Louis XIV of France who succeeded to the Spanish throne {{on the death of}} Carlos II in November 1700.

In April 1702, Felipe V left on a tour of his Italian possessions appointing Maria Luisa as regent in his absence. There is no reason to suppose that Murcia travelled with him to Naples, Italy, or met the composers Arcangelo Corelli and Alessandro Scarlatti. Maria Luisa arrived in Madrid on 30 June and Murcia is not likely to have been appointed as her Master of Guitar before this date. It is assumed that he held the post until her death in 1714.

40|$|I {{introduce}} voting <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> {{for constructing}} and operating legislatures, and then {{compare it to}} direct representation, plurality, and single transferable vote (STV), which voting <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> most closely resembles. When each voter uses voting <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> to select his proxy among given legislators and elections are costless, voting <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> maximizes the legislature's representation of the voting population. When each voter uses preferential voting <b>by</b> <b>proxy,</b> selecting a proxy during the vote count {{as well as a}} proxy in the legislature, and some ancillary rules are followed, I find that voting <b>by</b> <b>proxy</b> dominates STV and offers favorable tradeoffs against plurality. It improves representation and constituent service; eliminates gerrymandering; improves voter turnout; ranks the legislature's representatives <b>by</b> the <b>proxies</b> they hold rather than seniority; creates tighter representative-constituent links that lead to better informed voters, reducing the influence of special interests; and eliminates primary and runoff elections. Extra costs associated with its relative complexity or better representation can be made small. Copyright Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006...|$|R
