500|$|Like Kitana and Jade, Mileena was {{originally}} portrayed by Katalin Zamiar in Mortal Kombat II, who was using her own sai. A false rumor printed in Game Informer {{told of a}} Mileena-like secret character named Emerald supposedly hidden in the game. After MKII, Mileena was officially declared by Tobias and Boon to be [...] "gone" [...] and not returning, yet was brought back due to popular demand, with Becky Gable taking over the role in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Mileena's main color has been either a shade of purple or magenta in various installments (including when masquerading as Kitana in Deception) and their outfits {{did not differ in}} a significant way (more than just having different color patterns) until Mortal Kombat Gold. Since then, her costumes have been generally getting more skimpy with every new game, including always having an exposed midriff since Deception. Mileena's main costume in Deception and Armageddon is actually mostly black and features long flowing arm sleeves, a back-only loincloth and a partially transparent veil. Her motion capture actor in these games was Carlos Pesina. In Shaolin Monks, Mileena appears half-naked (her costume made largely of just belts of leather and scraps of fabric), barefoot (with a bandaged <b>midfoot),</b> and again wearing a veil in place of a mask (the veil also returns as part of her formal outfit in Mortal Kombat 2011). In the 2011 reboot game, her prime costume is based on her famous provocative alternate from Deception, but more detailed and again featuring a mask. In all, in this game she has the largest number of costumes out of all characters in the entire series. Her [...] "Flesh Pit" [...] alternate costume in the 2011 game is made of just some loose bandages put around her otherwise completely naked body, marking the first time that she has appeared unmasked by default. In this game, her motion capture actress was a woman. [...] "The Ultimate Horror Pack" [...] DLC for Mortal Kombat X included the Vampiress Mileena.|$|E
2500|$|Lower leg {{injuries}} are common while running or playing sports. About 10% of all total injuries involve the lower extremities in athletes. [...] The majority of athletes sprain their ankles, which are {{mainly caused by}} the increased loads onto the feet when they move into the foot down or in an outer ankle position. All areas of the foot, which are the forefoot, <b>midfoot,</b> and rearfoot, absorb various forces while running {{and can lead to}} injuries as well. Running and various activities can cause stress fractures, tendinitis, musculotendinous injuries, or any chronic pain to our lower extremities such as the tibia.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>midfoot</b> is the {{intermediate}} {{portion of the}} foot between the hindfoot and forefoot. The structures in this region are intermediate in size, and typically transmit loads from the hindfoot to the forefoot. The human transverse tarsal joint of the <b>midfoot</b> transmits forces from the subtalar joint in the hindfoot to the forefoot joints (metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal) and associated bones (metatarsals and phalanges). [...] The <b>midfoot</b> of the dog, horse and elephant contains similar intermediate structures having similar functions {{to those of the}} human <b>midfoot.</b>|$|E

50|$|Typically, barefoot walking {{features}} heel or <b>midfoot</b> strike, while barefoot running features <b>midfoot</b> or forefoot strike. Barefoot running rarely features {{heel strike}} because the impact can be painful, the human heel pad not absorbing {{much of the}} force of impact. By contrast, 75% of runners wearing modern running shoes heel strike, running shoes being characterized by a padded sole, stiff soles and arch support, and sloping down from a more padded heel to a less padded forefoot.|$|E

5000|$|Tototlmimus shows a {{foot with}} a typical {{constitution}} for ornithomimosaurs. The <b>midfoot</b> is an arctometatarsus, {{with a third}} metatarsal that becomes narrower at the top.

5000|$|The unique {{plantigrade}} {{alignment of}} the human foot results in a distal-limb structure that can adapt {{to a variety of}} conditions. The less mobile and more robust tarsal bones are shaped and aligned to accept and transmit large loads during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running). The tarsals of the <b>midfoot,</b> which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to transmit loads between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase. Conversely, the <b>midfoot</b> bones and joints also allow for the transmission of loads and inter-joint movement that unlocks the foot to create a loosely packed structure which renders the foot highly compliant over a variety of surfaces. In this configuration, the foot is able to absorb and damp the large loads encountered during heel strike and early weight acceptance. [...] The forefoot, with its long metatarsal and relatively long phalanges, transmits loads during the end-of-stance phase that facilitate the push-off and transfer of forward momentum. The forefoot also serves as a lever to allow balance during standing and jumping. In addition, the arches of the foot that span the hindfoot, <b>midfoot</b> and forefoot {{play a critical role in}} the nature of transformation of the foot from a rigid lever to a flexible weight-accepting structure.|$|E
50|$|The Lisfranc {{ligament}} is a ligament which {{connects the}} superior, lateral {{surface of the}} medial cuneiform to the superior, medial surface of {{the base of the}} second metatarsal. This connection maintains proper alignment between the metatarsal and the tarsal bones. In 20% of people there are two bands of this ligament (dorsal and plantar). It is injured or disrupted in the Lisfranc fracture. Trauma to the <b>midfoot</b> is caused by direct and indirect impact forces. Direct force involves an object landing on the surface on the foot while indirect force involves twisting of the foot, usually an impact to the heel while the foot in pointed down toward the ground. A mild form of this injury results in a widening of the gap {{between the first and second}} metatarsals. An extreme form of the a Lisfranc fracture causes a complete dislocation of the metatarsals from the tarsal bones. When the alignment of the <b>midfoot</b> is affected joint cartilage is quickly damaged.|$|E
50|$|The {{motions of}} the {{subtalar}} and transverse talar joints interact to make the foot either flexible or rigid. With the subtalar joint in eversion, the two joints of the transverse joint are parallel, which make movements in this joint possible. With the subtalar joint in inversion, the axes of the transverse joint are convergent, movements in this joint are thus locked and the <b>midfoot</b> rigid.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{high energy}} {{injury to the}} <b>midfoot,</b> such as a {{fall from a height}} or a motor vehicle accident, the {{diagnosis}} of a Lisfranc injury should, in theory at least, pose less of a challenge. There will be deformity of the <b>midfoot</b> and X-ray abnormalities should be obvious. Further, the nature of the injury will create heightened clinical suspicion and there may even be disruption of the overlying skin and compromise of the blood supply. Typical X-ray findings would include a gap between the base of the first and second toes. The diagnosis becomes more challenging in the case of low energy incidents, such as might occur with a twisting injury on the racquetball court, or when an American Football lineman is forced back upon a foot that is already in a fully plantar flexed position. Then, there may only be complaint of inability to bear weight and some mild swelling of the forefoot or <b>midfoot.</b> Bruising of the arch has been described as diagnostic in these circumstances but may well be absent. [...] Typically, conventional radiography of the foot is utilized with standard non-weight bearing views, supplemented by weight bearing views which may demonstrate widening of the interval {{between the first and second}} toes, if the initial views fail to show abnormality. Unfortunately, radiographs in such circumstances have a sensitivity of 50% when non-weight bearing and 85% when weight bearing, meaning that they will appear normal in 15% of cases where a Lisfranc injury actually exists. In the case of apparently normal x-rays, if clinical suspicion remains, advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a logical next step.|$|E
5000|$|Dreyer has {{outlined}} the technique to ChiRunning as follows: [...] "focus your mind", [...] "sense your body", [...] "breathe {{to tap into}} Chi", [...] "relax your muscles", [...] "practice good posture", and [...] "start slow". Runners are instructed to have a straight back with a slight forward lean and bent knees. Propulsion {{is said to be}} gained through momentum attained through the lean, with a <b>midfoot</b> landing directly under the body.|$|E

5000|$|... 5. Forcible {{correction}} of the equinus (and cavus) by dorsiflexion against a tight Achilles tendon {{results in a}} spurious correction through {{a break in the}} <b>midfoot,</b> resulting in a rocker-bottom foot. The cavus should be separately treated as outlined in step 2, and the equinus should be corrected without causing a <b>midfoot</b> break. It generally takes up to 4-7 casts to achieve maximum foot abduction. The casts are changed weekly. The foot abduction (correction) can be considered adequate when the thigh-foot axis is 60°. After maximal foot abduction is obtained, most cases require a percutaneous Achilles tenotomy. This is performed in the cast room under aseptic conditions. The local area is anesthetized with a combination of a topical lignocaine preparation (e.g. EMLA cream) and minimal local infiltration of lidocaine. The tenotomy is performed through a stab incision with a round tip (#6400) Beaver blade. The wound is closed with a single absorbable suture or with adhesive strips.The final cast is applied with the foot in maximum dorsiflexion, and the foot is held in the cast for 2-3 weeks.|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} Running Fast and Injury Free Pirie advocates running with {{initially}} making ground {{contact with the}} <b>midfoot</b> (as opposed to the usual style of long steps with landing on heels), 3-5 steps per second to reduce fatigue, damage to feet, and wasting of energy on vertical movement of body. He also describes his collaboration with Adolf Dassler on designing running shoes with stronger toes (instead of the usual design with stronger heels) for better durability with his advocated running style.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the wide}} variety in body types, scaling and {{morphology}} of the distal limbs of terrestrial vertebrates, there exists a degree of controversy concerning the nature and organization of foot structures. One organizational approach to understanding foot structures makes distinctions regarding their regional anatomy. The foot structures are divided into segments from proximal to distal and are grouped according to similarity in shape, dimension and function. In this approach, the foot may be described in three segments: as the hindfoot, <b>midfoot</b> and forefoot.|$|E

50|$|The holotype {{specimen}} MACN Pv 197, {{was found}} in a layer of the Snow Hill Island Formation (Cape Lambe, previously assigned to the Lopez de Bertodano Formation), dating to the Maastrichtian age. The remains consists in a right hind leg, including the top of the femur, {{the lower end of the}} femur, the upper part of the tibia, the underside of the tibia, the upper half of the foot, the bottom of the <b>midfoot</b> and the top of the first joint of the third toe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{non-human}} apes (the gibbons, {{mountain and}} lowland gorillas, orangutan, chimpanzee and bonobo) tend {{to walk on}} the lateral side of the foot, that is with an 'inverted' foot, which may reflect a basic adaptation to walking on branches. It is often held that their feet lack longitudinal arches, but footprints made by bipedally walking apes, which must directly or indirectly reflect the pressure they exert to support and propel themselves [...] do suggest that they exert lower foot pressure under the medial part of their <b>midfoot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Direct Lisfranc {{injuries}} are usually {{caused by a}} crush injury, such as a heavy object falling onto the <b>midfoot,</b> or the foot being {{run over by a}} car or truck, or someone landing on the foot after a fall from a significant height. Indirect Lisfranc {{injuries are}} caused by a sudden rotational force on a plantar flexed (downward pointing) forefoot. Examples of this type of trauma include a rider falling from a horse but the foot remaining trapped in the stirrup, or a person falling forward after stepping into a storm drain.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} this change in gait in shoe running is unknown, but Liebermann noted that there is {{correlation}} between the foot-landing style and exposure to shoes. In some individuals, the gait pattern is largely unchanged - the leg position and foot position are identical in barefoot and shoe running - but the wedge shape of the padding moving the point of impact back from the forefoot to the <b>midfoot.</b> In other cases, it is conjectured that the padding of the heel softens the impact and resulting in runner modifying their gait to contact further back in the foot.|$|E
5000|$|Lower leg {{injuries}} are common while running or playing sports. About 10% of all total injuries involve the lower extremities in athletes. [...] The majority of athletes sprain their ankles, which are {{mainly caused by}} the increased loads onto the feet when they move into the foot down or in an outer ankle position.

Running and various activities can cause stress fractures, tendinitis, musculotendinous injuries, or any chronic pain to our lower extremities such as the tibia.|$|E
5000|$|Barefoot runners run very {{differently}} from typical shod runners. Shod runners tend to heel strike {{due to the}} designs of the modern shoes, which have thick heels to reduce the impact force from the ground. When running barefoot, however, some runners tend to shift to a forefoot striking pattern to avoid such impact, which is equivalent to 2-3 times the body weight. [...] The forefoot strike is where the forefoot lands first, followed by the heels coming down. The <b>midfoot</b> strike {{is characterized by the}} heel and the ball of the foot landing at the same time, and heel strike is where the heel lands first followed by the forefoot.|$|E
5000|$|Foot {{and ankle}} {{surgeons}} {{are trained to}} treat all disorders of the foot and ankle, both surgical and non-surgical. Additionally, the surgeons are also trained to understand the complex connections between disorders and deformities of the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and the spine. Therefore, the surgeon will typically see cases that vary from trauma (such as malleolar fractures, tibial pilon fractures, calcaneus fractures, navicular and <b>midfoot</b> injuries and metatarsal and phalangeal fractures.) Arthritis care (primarily surgical) of the ankle joint and the joints of the hindfoot (tarsals), <b>midfoot</b> (metatarsals) and forefoot (phalanges) also plays a rather significant role. Congentital and acquired deformalities include adult acquired flatfoot, non-neuromuscular foot deformity, diabetic foot disorders, hallux valgus and several common pediatric foot and ankle conditions (such as clubfoot, flat feet, tarsal coalitions, etc.) Patients may also be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon for proper {{diagnosis and treatment of}} heel pain (such as a consequence from plantar heel fasciitis), nerve disorders (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome) and tumors of the foot and ankle. Amputation and ankle arthroscopy (the use of a laparoscope in foot and ankle surgical procedures) have emerged as prominent tools in foot and ankle care. In addition, more applications for laser surgery are being found in the treatment of foot and ankle disorders, including treatment for bunions and soft tissue lesions. A patient may also be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon for the surgical care of nail problems and phalangeal deformalities (such as bunions and buniettes.) ...|$|E
