40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} {{of aluminum}} (Al) on copper (Cu) substrate {{was investigated in}} [Bmim] Cl/AlCl 3 (33. 3 / 66. 7 mol%) ionic liquid using three pyridine derivatives, nicotinic acid, <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate,</b> and 3 -methyl pyridine as additives at 303 K, respectively. It was found that bright Al coatings could be electrodeposited with nicotinic acid and <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> as additives. SEM and XRD characterizations revealed that the bright coatings were very smooth, composed of nanocrystalline and with a strong (200) preferential orientation. By contrast, a matte and lusterless Al coating {{was obtained from the}} ionic liquid with 3 -methyl pyridine. Furthermore, the effect of the three additives was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and Raman spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that nicotinic acid and <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> could absorb on electrode surface more easily and thus served as very effective brighteners producing highly uniform and smooth Al coatings. However, 3 -methyl pyridine had no such effect. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All rights reserved. </p...|$|E

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that {{chemical}} markers in exhaled air/breath can provide a methodology for the detection of tuberculosis infection. These markers consist of methyl phenylacetate, methyl p-anisate, <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> and o-phenylanisole (2 -methoxybiphenyl). Current approaches utilise gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) which are useful for centralised testing of breath samples. The World Health Organization (WHO) require a portable, non-invasive diagnostic tool for the screening of tuberculosis infection. In order to meet this, we demonstrate proof-of-concept for the analytical sensing of the identified chemical markers in aqueous solutions using electrochemical based technology. We demonstrate that screen-printed electrochemical sensors can be used as the basis of a diagnostic tool for the electrochemical breathprinting of chemical markers (<b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> and 2 -methoxybiphenyl) useful for the screening of tuberculosis infection. It is hoped that further development will facilitate the potential for a portable, hand-held, non-invasive breath diagnostic tool to be realised...|$|E

Methods {{to optimize the}} low cost parahydrogen based approach signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) with studies {{on a series of}} biologically relevant nicotinamides and <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinates</b> are detailed. These procedures involve specific 2 H-labelling in both the agent and catalyst and achieve polarization lifetimes of ca. 2 minutes with 50 % polarization in the case of 4, 6 -d 2 -methylnicotinate. As a 1. 5 T hospital scanner has an effective 1 H polarization level of just 0. 0005 % this strategy should result in compressed detection times for chemically discerning measurements that probe disease.

40|$|To {{distinguish}} between thermodynamic, penetration-enhancing, and permeant depletion effects of solution-type transdermal preparations, {{two sets of}} human in vivo permeant penetration data obtained under finite-dose and infinite-dose conditions, respectively, were compared. The measurement of the pharmacodynamic response of a permeant or the determination of permeant penetration rates under finite-dose conditions includes all three types of vehicle effects, whereas under infinite-dose conditions permeant depletion does not play a significant role. Four lipophilic liquids (caprylic/capric triglyceride, isopropyl myristate, light mineral oil, and dimethicone 100) were used as vehicles. The reciprocal {{of the time of}} onset of an erythema (1 /LT) and the duration of the erythema D induced by the model compound <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> served as response parameters. Steady-state penetration rate measurements were made with a recently developed glass chamber system. Bioavailability factors f and enhancement factors EF were determined from both <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> penetration rates (infinite-dose conditions) and the horizontal distances between concentration-response curves (finite-dose conditions), with caprylic/capric triglyceride as the standard vehicle. Permeant depletion was quantified by dividing the enhancement factors determined under infinite-dose conditions by those under finite-dose conditions. These ratios were called depletion factors DF. Significant methyl nico-tinate depletion was observed with both response parameters. However, the most accurate bioavailability factors may be obtained with the response parameter 1 /LT, especially if they are determined from the horizontal distances between the curves in the high-response region where parallelism is given...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} novel kind of immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) on human skin penetration of model compounds in vitro to evaluate their potential as a delivery system, ultimately for transcutaneous vaccination. Special focus was on elucidating the mechanisms of penetration. Preparation of ISCOMs was done by dialysis and subsequent purification in a sucrose density gradient. The penetration pathways of acridine-labeled ISCOMs were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the skin after application of the ISCOMs with or without hydration. Transcutaneous permeation of the model compound, <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate,</b> was evaluated in diffusion cells. The prepared ISCOMs were 42 – 52  nm in diameter as evaluated by dynamic light scattering with zeta potentials of − 33 to − 26. 1  mV. TEM investigations verified the presence of ISCOM structures. Penetration of acridine into skin was greatly increased by incorporation into ISCOMs as visualized by CLSM. Permeation of <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> was enhanced in the presence of ISCOMs. Ultrastructural changes of the intercellular space in the stratum corneum after exposure of ISCOMs were observed on micrographs, especially for hydrated skin. In conclusion, cutaneous application of ISCOMs leads to increased penetration of hydrophobic model compounds through human stratum corneum and thus shows potential as a transcutaneous delivery system. The increased penetration seems to be reflected by a change in the intercellular space between the corneocytes, and the effect is most likely caused by the components of the ISCOMs rather than intact ISCOMs...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the design and}} preparation of lecithin gels containing <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (MN) and its permeability through the skin. To this aim, an "in vitro" model based on a Franz diffusion cell assembled with a multimembrane system, mimicking human skin, was utilized. Biocompatible solvents, isopropyl-palmitate and isopropyl-avocadate, were used to produce lecithin gels with different viscosities. When incorporated into lecithin gels, MN showed permeability coefficients depending on gel solvent and viscosity. Due to phospholipid presence (that can increase the skin moisture balance) and {{to the possibility of}} varying the MN permeability as function of gel viscosity, lecithin gels appear ideally suitable for the production of (trans) dermal vehicles for dermatological and cosmetic use...|$|E
40|$|The term {{sensitive}} skin {{has been used}} to describe a clinical phenomenon of hyperreactivity of the human skin, which develops exaggerated reactions when exposed to external factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine objective biophysical findings in patients with {{sensitive skin}} compared to those individuals with nonsensitive skin. Thirty-two patients with sensitive skin and 30 healthy volunteers with nonsensitive skin were studied. The testing methods included in vivo and in vitro tests: epicutaneous testing (Patch tests); measurement of sebum and hydration of the skin; alkali resistance test; stinging test with lactic acid; reaction to aqueous solution of <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> 0. 5 %, 1. 4 % and acetyl-b-methylcholine chloride 1 : 1000; pH measurement; dermographism; and measurement of total and specific IgE. Significant results were observed in the measurement of sebum (p < 0. 01) and hydration (p < 0. 05) of the skin, in the alkali resistance test (p < 0. 05), in the vascular reaction to <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (p < 0. 01) and to acetyl-b-methylcholine chloride (p < 0. 01) and in the skin response to allergens of the European standard (p < 0. 01) and cosmetic series (p < 0. 05). In addition, the subjective findings of stinging test produced significant results (p < 0. 001) as was anticipated. Patients with sensitive skin possess very dry skin with low fatness, which leads to a disturbance of the protective skin barrier function. They also present a hyperreaction of the skin blood vessels, increased transcutaneous penetration of water-soluble chemicals, enhanced immune responsiveness, significant decrease of alkali resistance and a heightened neurosensory stimulation...|$|E

At a modest potential, a mirror-bright Al coating could be obtained when the concentration of MN was no less than 4 mmolL(- 1). Furthermore, atomic force microscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to investigate the effect of MN on the electrodeposition of Al, which demonstrated that MN acted simultaneously as a brightener and a leveling agent by adsorbing on the electrode surface, producing Al coatings with a highly uniform and smooth surface...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{detection}} method for nicotinic acid, a specific metabolite marker of Mycobacterium tuberculosis present in cultures and patients' breath, is studied in complex solutions containing other metabolites and in biological media such as urine, saliva and breath condensate.

It is shown that other potential markers found in M. tuberculosis culture supernatant, such as methyl phenylacetate, p-methyl anisate, <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> and 2 -methoxy biphenyl, can interfere with nicotinic acid via a competitive absorption of the excitation photons. A new strategy to circumvent these interferences is proposed with an upstream trapping of volatile markers preceding the detection of nicotinic acid in the liquid phase via the luminescence of Tb 3 þ complexes.

Liposomes were prepared as aqueous suspension or viscous gels prepared using the acrylic polymer carbomer. The "in vitro" determination of MN permeability when released from the different liposomal formulations was performed by using a Franz cell assembled with a synthetic sylastic/cellulose/sylastic multimembrane system.

The liposomal suspensions were then processed to hydrogels and used to study in-vivo the MN permeation profile. MN {{was chosen as the}} model compound since it was capable of causing cutaneous erythema, the intensity and duration of which was proportional to the amount of entering the living epidermis over time. The extent of the erythema was monitored by reflectance spectrophotometry, a non-invasive technique.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{combined}} field {{observations and}} lab experiments {{to explore the}} ecological significance of floral signals in a North American wildflower, Penstemon digitalis. More specifically, to determine the potential mechanisms driving selection on floral scent, I studied how scent mediates interactions with pollinators and antagonists by (1) observing spatiotemporal variation in scent emission (2), floral volatile ability to suppress microbes (3) the honest advertisement of nectar, and (4) if scent could aid pollinator learning by reinforcing visual signals. Scent sampling of flower development, flower tissues, rewards and inflorescence day/night emission, revealed a complexity in floral scent composition and emission that could reflect several ecological functions. The floral bouquet of P. digitalis was strongest when flowers opened, primarily emitted from flower nectaries and was strongest during the day when pollinators are most active, suggesting a role in plant-pollinator interactions. Because linalool {{was one of the}} few floral compounds found in nectar where microbe growth can degrade the pollinator reward, I studied its role in plant-microbe interactions. Bacteria strains isolated from floral and vegetative tissues were exposed to varying concentrations of nectar volatiles: linalool and <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate.</b> Linalool inhibited bacteria growth rate from all tissue origins whereas <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> had little effect, suggesting that microbes could drive selection on linalool emission strength.     To determine the extent that linalool could honestly signal nectar availability, linalool-nectar associations were measured for inflorescences and flowers. Linalool predicted inflorescence nectar availability but not flower, exposing a limit to its honesty. Pollinator Bombus impatiens could use linalool as a foraging signal at varying concentrations, suggesting linalool could be learned and used to choose the most rewarding plants.     Measurement and comparison of signal-reward associations for both olfactory and visual signals/cues of P. digitalis displays found display size and linalool honest indicators of nectar. Lab behaviour experiments showed multiple signals correlated with reward could increase bumblebee foraging efficiency and promote learning, providing an explanation for why floral displays are complex and consist of multiple signals.     Together my results show that an integrated approach is required to understand the mechanisms driving the evolution of the floral phenotype. ...|$|E

The effects of additives on the electrodeposition of metals from aqueous solution have been extensively investigated. However, very few studies have considered the effects of additives on the electrodeposition of metals from ionic liquids (deep eutectic solvents). This work has shown that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (EDTA), sodium iodide (NaI), boric acid (BA) and 5, 5 -dimethylhydantoin (DMH) as additives can be used to modify the Cu deposit morphology obtained from a 1 : 2 ChCl: ethylene glycol-based liquid (Ethaline 200) on a mild steel substrate. It was found that NaI significantly influenced the morphology of the Cu deposit, achieving a bright and thick Cu deposition. The effects of nicotinic acid (NA), boric acid (BA) and benzoquinone (BQ) on Zn deposit morphology from Ethaline 200 were also shown, {{and for the first time}} a bright zinc coating has been achieved on a copper substrate when NA was used. The feasibility of Zn-Ni alloy deposition from Ethaline 200 -based deep eutectic solvents has been investigated in the absence and presence of boric acid and sodium bromide. It was found for the first time that a successful bright Zn-Ni alloy coating from Ethaline 200 can be produced in the presence of boric acid and NaBr as additives. Moreover, the effects of current density, temperature and concentration of Zn species on electrodeposition of Zn-Ni alloy from Ethaline 200 in the presence of both boric acid and NaBr have been studied.

LO are able to increase the solubility of poor water-soluble molecules {{probably due to the}} formation of a short-range hexagonal organization of the lecithin cylindrical reverse micelles.

LO exhibited similar viscosities and rheological behaviour both in the absence and in the presence of drug. The in vitro drug diffusion from LO studied by Franz cell showed that higher viscous vehicles result in lower diffusion coefficient. The microscopic investigation of human skin displayed no significant alterations after treatment with LO and with PBS. In vivo topical activity on erythema after cutaneous application of LO showed that LO-MN induce a strong erythema, while LO-CUR inhibit skin erythema due to CUR anti-inflammatory activity. Tape-stripping experiments performed on skin after topical administration of LO showed a decrease in the amount of CUR in the stratum corneum after 1 hour from the occlusion.

40|$|A simple, {{affordable}} {{diagnostic test}} for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is urgently {{needed to improve}} detection of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that animal behavior can be used as a biosensor to signal the presence of human disease. For example, the giant African pouched rats can detect tuberculosis by sniffing sputum specimens while trained honeybees respond to three of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the breath of TB positive patients by proboscis extension. However, both rats and honeybees require animal housing facilities and professional trainers, which are outside the scope of most disease testing facilities. Here, we report that the innate olfactory behavioral response of the roundworm nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can be used to detect the TB-specific VOCs methyl p-anisate, <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate,</b> methyl phenylacetate and o-phenylanisole, in chemotaxis assays. Dauer larvae, a long-lived stress resistant alternative development state of C. elegans in which the animals can survive for extended periods of time in dry conditions with no food, were also demonstrated to detect the VOCs.

We used K-means and hierarchical cluster analyses to identify clusters in stratum corneum partitioning and porcine skin permeability datasets that are distinct {{from each other}} based on mathematical indices of similarity and dissimilarity. Twenty four solvent systems consisting of combinations of water, ethanol, propylene glycol, <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> and sodium lauryl sulphate were used with 10 solutes, including phenol, pnitrophenol, pentachlorophenol, methyl parathion, ethyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, fenthion, simazine, atrazine and propazine. Identifying the relationships between solvent systems that have similar effects on dermal absorption formed the bases for hypotheses generation. The determining influence of solvent polarity on the partitioning data structure supported the hypothesis that solvent polarity drives the partitioning of non-polar solutes. Solvent polarity {{could not be used}} to predict permeability because solvent effects on diffusivity masked the effects of partitioning on permeability. The consistent influence of the inclusion of propylene glycol in the solvent system supports the hypothesis that over saturation due to solvent evaporation has a marked effect on permeability. These results demonstrated the potential of using cluster analysis of large datasets to identify consistent solvent and chemical mixture effects...|$|E
40|$|Attenuated total {{reflectance}} Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy {{has been}} used to simultaneously follow the diffusion of model drugs and solvent across polydimethylsiloxane (silicone) membrane. Three model drugs, cyanophenol (CNP), <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (MN) and butyl paraben (BP) were selected to cover a range of lipophilicities. Isostearyl isostearate (ISIS) was chosen as the solvent because its large molecular weight should facilitate observation of whether the drug molecules are able to diffuse through the membrane independently of the solvent. The diffusion of the three drugs and the solvent was successfully described by a Fickian model. The effects of parameters such as the absorption wavelength used to follow diffusion on the calculated diffusion coefficient were investigated. Absorption wavelength which affects the depth of penetration of the infrared radiation into the membrane did not significantly affect the calculated diffusion coefficient over the wavelength range tested. Each of the model drugs was observed to diffuse independently of the solvent across the membrane. The diffusion of a CNP-ISIS hydrogen bonded complex across the membrane was also monitored. The relative diffusion rates of the solute and solvent across the membrane can largely be accounted for by the molecular size of the permeant. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background/aims  Nanocarrier {{systems have}} been {{extensively}} studied for their suitability in personal care formulations. Theoretically, they could enhance skin delivery of active compounds, thereby improving in vivo efficacy of the products. As such {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of a lipid nanocarrier (LNC) system loaded with tocopheryl acetate (TA) on the hydration, biomechanical properties, and antioxidant capacity of human skin, when used in two different vehicles, and compare it with a non-LNC formulation. Methods  TA-loaded lipid nanocarriers (TA-LNCs) were produced by the phase inversion method, using physiological lipids and purified by ultra-centrifugation. They were incorporated into a hydrophilic gel and foam, and their performance compared with a saturated TA solution in silicon oil. Skin hydration and biomechanical properties were measured by means of a corneometer and a cutometer, respectively, while a high-resolution spectrophotometer was used to assess skin redness after stimulation by <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> in a micro-inflammatory test. Both short-term (3 h) and long-term trials (4 weeks) were performed. Results  The results confirmed that the LNCs enhanced skin hydration in both studies, while skin viscoelastic parameters remained practically unchanged during the 4 -week study.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{polyethylene}} glycol 400 (PEG) dissolved at various concentrations (0 - 40 % v/v) in water, on the interfacial transport of <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> across an aqueous-isopropyl myristate interface was investigated with a rotating diffusion cell. At four temperatures studied (20 - 37 degrees C), {{the presence of}} PEG decreased the rate of solute transfer both {{into and out of}} the organic phase in a concentration-dependent fashion. The bulk partition coefficient of the solute (organic/aqueous) increased with increasing PEG in the aqueous phase. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the interfacial transfer kinetics allowed thermodynamic activation energy parameters for the phase transport process to be determined. Although the free energy of activation (Delta G(not equal)) for transfer was not affected by PEG, the relative enthalpic and entropic contributions were dramatically altered. At PEG concentrations of 10 - 40 % v/v the enthalpic portion of Delta G(not equal) was decreased by about a factor of two, while the entropic contribution (which is large and positively favorable in the absence of PEG) was reduced considerable such that it was totally eliminated at higher PEG levels. These observations suggest novel and direct experimental evidence for the concept that high PEG concentrations substantially alter water structure at an aqueous solution-organic liquid biomembrane model interface. The results support the hypothesis that the critically important function of PEG in inducing cell-cell and liposome-liposome fusion is to remove the hydration layer that impedes the close apposition of converging phospholipid bilayers...|$|E

40|$|Trained African giant-pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) {{can detect}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} and show {{potential for the}} diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). However, rats' ability to discriminate between clinical sputum containing other Mycobacterium spp. and nonmycobacterial species of the respiratory tract is unknown. It is also unknown whether nonmycobacterial species produce odor similar to M. tuberculosis and thereby cause the detection of smear-negative sputum. Sputum samples from 289 subjects were analyzed by smear microscopy, culture, and rats. Mycobacterium spp. were isolated on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, and nonmycobacterial species were isolated on four different media. The odor from nonmycobacterial species from smear- and M. tuberculosis culture-negative sputa detected by ≥ 2 rats (“rat positive”) was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compared to the M. tuberculosis odor. Rats detected 45 of 56 confirmed cases of TB, 4 of 5 suspected cases of TB, and 63 of 228 TB-negative subjects (sensitivity, 80. 4 %; specificity, 72. 4 %; accuracy, 73. 9 %; positive predictive value, 41. 7 %; negative predictive value, 93. 8 %). A total of 37 (78. 7 %) of 47 mycobacterial isolates were M. tuberculosis complex, with 75. 7 % from rat-positive sputa. Ten isolates were nontuberculous mycobacteria, one was M. intracellulare, one was M. avium subsp. hominissuis, and eight were unidentified. Rat-positive sputa with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., and Enterococcus spp. were associated with TB. Rhodococcus, Nocardia, Streptomyces, Staphylococcus, and Candida spp. from rat-positive sputa did not produce M. tuberculosis-specific volatiles (<b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate,</b> methyl para-anisate, and ortho-phenylanisole). Prevalence of Mycobacterium-related Nocardia and Rhodococcus in smear-negative sputa did not equal that of smear-negative mycobacteria (44. 7 %), of which 28. 6 % were rat positive. These findings {{and the absence of}} M. tuberculosis-specific volatiles in nonmycobacterial species indicate that rats can be trained to specifically detect M. tuberculosis...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to estimate the formation and emptying of the diclofenac (DF) skin reservoir after passive, semiocclusive, and electrically assisted applications of DF. Subjects and methods: Five different groups of healthy volunteers (ntotal= 60, 23 male and 37 female), participated in this study. A 1 % DF (Voltaren Emulgel) formulation (12 mg) was applied on the volar forearms on randomized defined circular skin areas of 7 cm 2. DF was applied for 20 minutes under three different conditions at the same time. The presence of DF in the skin results in a reduction of the <b>methyl</b> <b>nicotinate</b> (MN) response. To estimate the bioavailability of DF in the skin, MN responses at different times following initial DF application (1. 5, 6, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours) were analyzed. Results: At 1. 5 hours after the initial DF application, a significant decrease in MN response was detected for the occluded and iontophoretic delivery. Passive application resulted in a decrease of the MN response from 6 hours post-DF application. The inhibition remained up to 32 hours post-DF application for the iontophoretic delivery, 48 hours for the occluded application, and 72 hours for the passive delivery. At 96 and 120 hours post-DF application none of the MN responses was inhibited. Conclusion: The formation and emptying of a DF skin reservoir was found to be dependent on the DF-application mode. Penetration-enhanced delivery resulted in a faster emptying of the reservoir. Keywords: transdermal drug delivery, passive diffusion, occlusion, iontophoresis, diclofena...|$|E
