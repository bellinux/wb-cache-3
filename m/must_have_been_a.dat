5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, a person {{must be at}} least 30 years old, and <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> citizen of West Virginia {{for at least five years}} at the time of inauguration. The Constitution of West Virginia, {{ratified}} in 1872, calls for a four-year term for the governor, commencing on the Monday after the second Wednesday in the January following an election. The original constitution of 1863 had only a two-year term for governor.|$|E

The candidate <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> U.S. citizen {{for a minimum of}} two years prior to his candidacy and must have been resident of the district that he seeks to represent for one year. Senators must be at least twenty-five years of age and representatives must be twenty-one when sworn into office. The candidate cannot hold any other public office in the state or federal government during their term. The candidate must also be a registered voter within the district they seek to represent. Candidates are required to file papers stating their economic interests.|$|E

One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker {{who was about to}} stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E

He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|The {{three primary}} {{branches}} of Crocodilia had diverged {{by the end}} of the Mesozoic. The earliest-known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the Campanian (around 83.6–72.1 million years ago). Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian (around 72.1–66.0 million years ago), that lineage must have been present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, which indicates that the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pre-Campanian event.|$|E

5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1).

5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E

5|$|Edward Augustus Freeman {{and other}} historians {{have thought that}} this Siward was Siward Barn, arguing that Siward <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{descendant}} of Uhtred the Bold, Earl of Northumbria, and Ælfgifu, daughter of King Æthelred the Unready, King Edward's father. Historian and translator of Orderic, Marjorie Chibnall, pointed out that this Siward is mentioned later in his Ecclesiastical History as a Shropshire landowner, {{in connection with the}} foundation of Shrewsbury Abbey. Ann Williams likewise rejected this identification, identifying this Siward firmly with the Shropshire thegn Siward Grossus. According to Williams' reconstruction, Siward Grossus and his brother Ealdred were the sons of Æthelgar by a daughter of Eadric Streona, Ealdorman of Mercia and Eadgyth, another daughter of King Æthelred, explaining the relationship Orderic believed they had with Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} June 342 BC, Philip {{set off on}} what <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> long-planned expedition into Thrace. The {{campaign was}} to last for two years, {{but other than that}} his forces were large, and that he fought several battles, the ancient sources contain very few details. Undoubtedly Philip's primary aim was to depose Kersebleptes, who according to Diodorus had been causing problems for the Greeks on the Chersonese, once and for all. Philip ended the campaign by marrying Meda of Odessos, daughter of a king of the Getae, which has been taken to suggest that Philip campaigned not just in Thrace, but in the valley of the Hebrus, and north of the Great Balkan range of mountains, near the Danube.|$|E

The cargo ship returned to Boston on 3 June and began her second voyage to Liverpool on 30 June. While in the UK she called at Loch Ewe, Methil, and Oban in July and August before her 6 September return to Boston. Her third journey was an extended one that began by sailing from Boston on 3 October. She arrived at Liverpool three weeks later. During the next seven weeks, she made her way to Milford Haven, from which she began her last westbound transatlantic crossing on 13 December. West Nohno arrived in Boston on 5 January 1944.|$|E

5|$|The Presidency was {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. The Presidency was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared between the President and the Prime Minister. The Presidency was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only {{so much of it}} that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} for election or appointment to the position, the attorney general candidate {{must be at least}} 25 years of age {{at the beginning of their}} term of service, and <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> citizen of West Virginia for at least five years prior to their election or appointment. In 1872, when the second (and current) Constitution of West Virginia was enacted, the constitution averred that citizens residing in the state at the time of its enactment were also authorized to be elected or appointed as attorney general, regardless of the length of the residency in West Virginia. Their election can be held at any time as prescribed by law. The attorney general's term of office is four years and commences on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of the month of January following their election. If the office of attorney general should become vacant on account of death, resignation, or otherwise, the governor is authorized to select an appointee to hold that office until a successor can be elected and qualified.|$|E
