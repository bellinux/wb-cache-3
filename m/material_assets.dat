25|$|A {{luxury tax}} applied to goods and {{services}} for conspicuous consumption {{is a type of}} progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the negative externality associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods. In Utility from Accumulation (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard <b>material</b> <b>assets,</b> because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.|$|E
25|$|Before the 19th century, the British {{upper classes}} enjoyed a life {{relatively}} free from taxation. Staff were plentiful and cheap, and estates not only provided a generous income from tenanted land but also political power. During the 19th century this began to change, until by the mid-20th century {{they had no}} power and were suffering heavy taxation. The staff had either been killed in two world wars or forsaken a life of servitude for better wages elsewhere. Thus the owners of large country houses dependent on staff and a large income began by necessity to dispose of their costly non-self sustaining <b>material</b> <b>assets.</b> Large houses had become redundant white elephants to be abandoned or demolished. It seemed that in particular regard to the country houses no one was prepared to save them.|$|E
25|$|All visit, business, transit, student, and {{exchange}} visitor visa applicants must pay a US$160 application fee (up from $140 as of April 2012) to a US Consulate {{in order to}} be interviewed by a Consular Officer who will determine if the applicant is qualified to receive a visa to travel to the U.S (additionally, the officer may also ask the United States Department of State for a Security Advisory Opinion, which can take several weeks to resolve). The application fee is increased to $190 for most work visas (up from $150 as of April 2012) and can be even higher for certain categories. If the applicant is rejected, the application fee is not refunded. Amongst the items included in the qualification decision are financial independence, adequate employment, <b>material</b> <b>assets</b> and a lack of a criminal record in the applicant's native country.|$|E

40|$|This thesis uses {{speculative}} {{fiction and}} memoir as sources for models that represent disability as a <b>material</b> <b>asset</b> to the community. This type of model combines a medical {{model with a}} social model in ways that demonstrate potential benefits that can come from seeing disability as a <b>material</b> <b>asset,</b> {{rather than as a}} deficit in need of a cure. Terry Tempest Williams' Refuge, as well as the two television series Battlestar Galactica (2004) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer all represent disability in terms of chronic illness, and all depict women negotiating the fluid boundaries between gender, disability and power relations. This thesis explores how these intersections ultimately depict ways in which disability materially benefits the community. Key words: activism, chronic illness, community healing, disability, disease, ecocriticism, feminism, gender, leadership, power relations, social justic...|$|R

50|$|German {{law allows}} self-defense against an {{unlawful}} attack. If {{there is no}} other possibility for defense, it is generally allowed to use even deadly force without a duty to retreat.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semantical {{basis of a}} graphical specification language, called real-time symbolic timing diagrams (RTSTD), to express real-time requirements of embedded systems. RTSTD allow a concise and unambigous formulation of real-time properties that are intuitively understandable by hardware designers.

Due to this interpretation RTSTD can be embedded into existing verification tools to check whether an implementation satiesfies the given specification expressed as RTSTD. 1 Introduction Nowadays embedded control systems {{can be found in}} varying areas such as automotive, production technique, plant control and avionics.

Qualitative data are then {{used to describe the}} productive activities of these groups, their respective processes of <b>material</b> <b>asset</b> accumulation or losses, and how their economic activities are affected by location. The paper concludes that, where measures of the distribution of income falls short, we require other tools that will help us reveal patterns: (1) of material wealth distribution; (2) of control over production; and (3) of the unaccounted value created within the household or derived from the natural environment...|$|R
