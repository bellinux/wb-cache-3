The effect of leptin on the production of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) by <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the presence or absence of}} high glucose was determined using in vitro culture model of human peritoneal <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and adipocytes. The signaling mechanism involved in leptin-induced TGF-β synthesis by <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> was studied. Both mRNA and protein of the full-length leptin receptor are constitutively expressed in <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> The leptin receptor expression in <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> was upregulated by glucose but not leptin. In adipocytes, glucose increased the mRNA expression and synthesis of leptin.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study reviews {{publications}} on {{the history}} of cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), the background of its use as a marker of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass, determination in peritoneal effluent, and its practical use in both the follow-up of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and as a marker of in vivo biocompatibility of dialysis solutions. DESIGN: Review article. RESULTS: CA 125 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein. Previous studies in ascites suggested its release by mesothelial cells. In vitro studies with cultured mesothelial cells showed constitutive production, the majority of which was dependent on <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass. Serum CA 125 is normal in PD patients, but its concentration in peritoneal dialysate suggests local release, probably from mesothelial cells. Effluent CA 125 can be considered a marker of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass in stable PD patients, but large amounts are found during peritonitis, due probably to necrosis of mesothelial cells. The majority of studies found no relationship between dialysate CA 125 and peritoneal transport parameters. Some cross-sectional studies reported a relationship with duration of PD, but others were unable to confirm this, due probably to the large interindividual variability. Longitudinal follow-up has shown a decrease in dialysate CA 125, indicating loss of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass. Application of theoretically more-biocompatible PD solutions causes an increase in dialysate CA 125. CONCLUSIONS: Dialysate CA 125 is a <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass marker. The concentration of CA 125 should be determined after a standardized dwell. A single low value is not informative. A decrease with time on PD suggests loss of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass.

In this study we evaluated <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation during the resolution phase of experimentally thioglycollate-induced peritonitis in rats. To this end 4 x 10 (6) DiO-labeled autologous mesothelial cells were transplanted 1 week after peritonitis induction.

Long-term functioning of these repopulated mesothelial cells leaded to peritoneal activation as evidenced by a approximately twofold increase in peritoneal lymphocytes (P < 0. 01) and omental mast cell counts (P < 0. 05), accompanied by the induction of inflammation markers monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) (P < 0. 01) and hyaluronan (P < 0. 01) in the transplanted peritonitis group, but not in rats with peritonitis without <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation or in control rats without <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation (all four parameters P < 0. 01). In addition, trapping of transplanted mesothelial cells in the milky spots of omental tissue and lymphatic stomata of the diaphragm both in control and thioglycollate rats seems to increase microvascular permeability, reflected by apparent increased diffusion rates of small solutes and proteins.

Cancer antigen (CA) 125 is expressed by mesothelial cells (as by other coelomic epithelium-derived cells) and might therefore be considered a marker of the mesothelium. The aim of this study was to determine whether CA 125 is a bulk or an activation stage <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> marker.

We investigated whether hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a scatter factor that induces detachment from substrate and fibroblastic transformation of several cell types, is produced during peritonitis and is active on mesothelial cells. We studied 18 patients on peritoneal dialysis, 9 uncomplicated, 9 with peritonitis. HGF was measured in serum, peritoneal fluid, and supernatant of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and peritoneal mononuclear cells. Primary culture of human peritoneal mesothelial cells and the human <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> line MeT- 5 A were conditioned with recombinant HGF, serum, and peritoneal fluid.

PMN adhesion to mesothelial cells was determined with radiolabeled PMNs. <b>Mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> injury was determined in five different cell lines by measuring ATP depletion and 51 chromium release. In each <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> line, PMN adhesion was significantly (P < 0. 001) increased when PMNs were activated; 64 ± 1. 0 to 92. 5 ± 7. 0 % of the activated PMNs were adherent to mesothelial cells compared to 6 ± 1. 8 to 27 ± 2. 4 % of resting PMNs. Mesothelial cells responded to PMN mediated injury with a fall in ATP levels and 51 chromium release that was significant (P < 0. 05) by three to four hours. At five hours, ATP levels were markedly depressed to 5 to 41 % of control values. Increasing concentrations of activated PMNs caused significantly (P < 0. 05) greater <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> injury as determined by ATP depletion and 51 chromium release. PMN adhesion, ATP depletion and 51 chromium release were significantly (P < 0. 01) prevented by an anti-CD 18 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the CD 11 /CD 18 adhesion molecule complex on PMNs. Similar injury and protection from injury was demonstrated when mesothelial cells were exposed to PMNs activated with FMLP/cytochalasin B. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the cultured mesothelial cells express intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) and FAB fragments of a monoclonal anti-ICAM- 1 antibody partially reduced adhesion of activated PMNs to mesothelial cells and slightly reduced <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> injury. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha streptococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 103 to 105 bacteria/ml caused little to no ATP depletion or 51 chromium release.

Cultured human <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> express appreciable levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), and these were increased by in vitro exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), or TNF and IFN-gamma.

Analysis of VCAM- 1 mRNA by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers revealed that <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> expressed both the seven- and the six-Ig domain transcripts, with predominance of the longer species. Monocytes bound appreciably to "resting" and, to a greater extent, to stimulated <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Monocytes exposed to IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide, used as prototypic activation signals, showed increased capacity to bind <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Anti-CD 18 monoclonal antibody significantly inhibited binding of monocytes to <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> and this blocking effect was amplified by anti-very late antigen 4. <b>Mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> were able to express the chemotactic cytokines IL- 8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 at the mRNA and protein levels.

Cross sectionally, the AR for CA 125 was negatively related to duration of PD (r = - 0. 47, p < 0. 0001) and weakly related to peritonitis incidence (r = - 0. 20, p < 0. 05). Patients treated with PD for more than 4 years had lower CA 125 appearance than patients treated less than 4 years (p < 0. 0004). HA was also related to the incidence of peritonitis, but positively (r = 0. 32, p < 0. 004). PHL were not related to either parameter. A significant negative trend with time of PD treatment was observed for CA 125 only [mean regression coefficient (t) - 3. 75, SD 1. 2]. No trend in time of PD treatment could be detected for HA and PHL. These data indicate a gradual loss of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass during PD by the decrease of CA 125 with time. The lack of a decrease in HA and its positive relation to incidence of peritonitis suggest an additional release of HA by cells other than the mesothelial cells, such as fibroblasts and leukocytes. Alternatively, an activation of (mesothelial) cells with duration of PD and possibly with increased peritonitis incidence cannot be excluded. The relation between PHL and duration of PD suggested by others was not confirmed in this study.

No correlation existed with peritonitis incidence (p = 0. 21). Also, no relationship was present with the mass transfer area coefficient of creatinine, or with net ultrafiltration. The intrinsic permeability to macromolecules, expressed as the restriction coefficient (rc) was also not related to dCA 125 (p = 0. 14). Data on fluid kinetics showed that neither transcapillary ultrafiltration rate, effective lymphatic absorption rate, the change in intraperitoneal volume (delta IPV) nor glucose absorption were related to dCA 125. A subgroup of patients (n = 20) had low CA 125 values (< 11 U/ml). They were treated with CAPD {{for a longer period of}} time (23 vs 16 months, p = 0. 02), and had a higher rc (2. 59 vs 2. 23, p < 0. 0001). The relationship between low dCA 125 and duration of CAPD can possibly be explained by vanishing of the mesothelial layer, as has been reported in patients on long-term CAPD. The higher rc of the low dCA 125 group is probably also related to duration of CAPD, and not directly to the <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass, as the mesothelium is no osmotic barrier and because no pathophysiological mechanism can explain the relationship between a low <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass and a low permeability to macromolecules. It can be concluded that <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> mass is negatively related to the duration of CAPD treatment, but mesothelial cells are unlikely to play an important role in transport kinetic...|$|E
40|$|Apparent {{successful}} <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation {{hampered by}} peritoneal activation. BackgroundMesothelial cell transplantation {{has been suggested}} to improve mesothelial repair after surgery, recurrent peritonitis and peritoneal dialysis. MethodsIn this study we evaluated <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation during the resolution phase of experimentally thioglycollate-induced peritonitis in rats. To this end 4 × 106 DiO-labeled autologous mesothelial cells were transplanted 1 week after peritonitis induction. Peritoneal inflammation and permeability characteristics were evaluated after another week. ResultsMesothelial cell transplantation after peritonitis resulted in incorporation of these cells in the parietal mesothelial lining, leading to an acute transient submesothelial thickening which was not seen in transplanted animals without prior peritonitis induction. Long-term functioning of these repopulated mesothelial cells leaded to peritoneal activation as evidenced by a ∼twofold increase in peritoneal lymphocytes (P < 0. 01) and omental mast cell counts (P < 0. 05), accompanied by the induction of inflammation markers monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) (P < 0. 01) and hyaluronan (P < 0. 01) in the transplanted peritonitis group, but not in rats with peritonitis without <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation or in control rats without <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation (all four parameters P < 0. 01). In addition, trapping of transplanted mesothelial cells in the milky spots of omental tissue and lymphatic stomata of the diaphragm both in control and thioglycollate rats seems to increase microvascular permeability, reflected by apparent increased diffusion rates of small solutes and proteins. ConclusionAltogether, our data underscore the importance of controlling peritoneal (patho) physiology and function in mesothelial transplantation protocols...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{key factor}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of endometriosis is the endometrial-peritoneal adhesion. To study the pathogenesis of endometriosis, a quantitative in vitro assay (QIVA) was developed to measure in vitro adhesion between human endometrial epithelial <b>cells</b> and <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> using commercially available cell lines. Using the QIVA, the hypothesis was tested that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) promote adhesion of endometrial epithelial <b>cells</b> to <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: <b>Mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> were pre-treated with TNF-alpha, IL- 6 or IL- 8 in various concentrations (ranging from 0 to 1000 IU/ml) for 24 h. Confluent endometrial epithelial cells were labelled with [35 S]methionine, added to the confluent <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and incubated for 1 h. After incubation, non-adhering cells were removed and adherent cells were solubilized and their [35 S]methionine radioactivity was counted to quantify the adherence of endometrial epithelial <b>cells</b> to <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> RESULTS: The in vitro adhesion of human endometrial epithelial <b>cells</b> to human <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TNF-alpha (P= 0. 0007), IL- 6 (P< 0. 0001) and IL- 8 (P= 0. 0004).

40|$|Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{recruitment}} of neutrophils into the pleural space. We identified for the first time the mechanisms by which LTB(4) interacts with <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and recruits neutrophils in the pleural compartment. Primary pleural <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> express both the proinflammatory receptor for LTB(4) BLT 2, and the anti-inflammatory receptor for LTB(4), PPARalpha. Parapneumonic pleural effusions highly increase BLT 2 expression and, via BLT 2 activation, increase the adhesion between <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> and neutrophils and the expression of ICAM- 1 on <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells.</b> The block of PPARalpha further increases both cell adhesion and ICAM- 1 expression. BLT 2 activation promotes the activation, on <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> of STAT- 1 but not the activation of NF-kappaB transcription factor. The increase of ICAM- 1 expression is achieved via increased tyrosine phosphorylation activity since herbimycin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduces and since Na orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, further increases ICAM- 1 expression. This study demonstrates that pleural <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells,</b> expressing both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory LTB(4) receptors, are able to mount an integrated response to LTB(4) with a prevalence of BLT 2 activities in the presence of an inflammatory milieu within the pleura...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} {{of cigarette smoke}} and high-level occupational asbestos exposure produces a synergistic increase {{in the incidence of}} lung cancer; however, smoking does not affect the incidence of mesothelioma. Here we present the results of tests of two theories that have been proposed to explain this phenomenon; namely, that pleural mesothelial cells are resistant to cigarette smoke-induced damage and that the pleural connective tissue acts as a barrier that prevents smoke from reaching the mesothelial cells. To test these hypotheses, excised whole rat lung preparations were exposed to either internal (intratracheal) or external (pleural surface) smoke. For comparison, additional excised lung preparations were exposed to solutions of hydrogen peroxide either externally or intratracheally. Mesothelial cells exposed to external smoke showed widespread, dose-dependent uptake of Trypan blue. Mesothelial cells did not take up Trypan blue after exposure to internal smoke. Bronchial epithelial cells exposed to internal smoke did show uptake, but to a lesser degree than externally exposed mesothelial cells. Examination by scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that internal smoke did not affect <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> ultrastructure, whereas external smoke produced obvious <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> damage and <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> detachment. Catalase and deferoxamine, scavengers of active oxygen species, provided protection against smoke-induced <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> injury, but inactivated catalase did not. External hydrogen peroxide produced a very similar, dose-dependent pattern of Trypan blue uptake and ultrastructural changes. Intratracheal hydrogen peroxide also damaged mesothelial cells, but the extent of damage was always less than with comparable concentrations of external hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|The major {{complication}} of peritoneal dialysis (PD) {{is the development}} of peritonitis, an infection within the abdominal cavity, primarily caused by bacteria. PD peritonitis is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most frequently isolated cause of PD-associated peritonitis. Mesothelial cells are integral to the host response to peritonitis, and subsequent clinical outcomes, yet the effects of infection on mesothelial cells are not well characterised. We systematically investigated the early <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> response to clinical and reference isolates of S. epidermidis using primary mesothelial cells and the <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> line Met- 5 A. Using an unbiased whole genome microarray, followed by a targeted panel of genes known {{to be involved in the}} human antibacterial response, we identified 38 differentially regulated genes (adj. p-value < 0. 05) representing 35 canonical pathways after 1 hour exposure to S. epidermidis. The top 3 canonical pathways were TNFR 2 signaling, IL- 17 A signaling, and TNFR 1 signaling (adj. p-values of 0. 0012, 0. 0012 and 0. 0019, respectively). Subsequent qPCR validation confirmed significant differences in gene expression in a number of genes not previously described in <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> responses to infection, with heterogeneity observed between clinical isolates of S. epidermidis, and between Met- 5 A and primary mesothelial cells. Heterogeneity between different S. epidermidis isolates suggests that specific virulence factors may play critical roles in influencing outcomes from peritonitis. This study provides new insights into early <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cell</b> responses to infection with S. epidermidis, and confirms the importance of validating findings in primary mesothelial cells...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> are {{fundamental}} {{to the maintenance of}} serosal integrity and homeostasis and {{play a critical role in}} normal serosal repair following injury. However, when normal repair mechanisms breakdown, <b>mesothelial</b> <b>cells</b> take on a profibrotic role, secreting inflammatory and profibrotic mediators, differentiating and migrating into the injured tissues where they contribute to fibrogenesis. The development of new molecular and cell tracking techniques has made it possible to examine the origin of fibrotic cells within damaged tissues and to elucidate the roles they play in inflammation and fibrosis.
