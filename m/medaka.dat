5|$|One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack! was {{produced}} by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi. Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, <b>Medaka,</b> from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps <b>Medaka.</b> A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more {{to prevent him from}} destroying the island.|$|E

2500|$|The cream locus is on exon 2 of the MATP gene; {{a single}} {{nucleotide}} polymorphism results in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine substitution (N153D). The DNA test offered by various laboratories detects this mutation. The MATP gene encodes a protein illustrated to have roles in melanogenesis in humans, mice, and <b>medaka.</b> Mice affected by a condition homologous to cream exhibit irregularly shaped melanosomes, which are the organelles within melanocytes that directly produce pigment.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoxetine {{has been}} {{detected}} in aquatic ecosystems, especially in North America. There {{is a growing}} body of research addressing the effects of fluoxetine (among other SSRIs) exposure on non-target aquatic species. [...] As of 2003 there was little research on environmental effects; the research showed little effects on aquatic plants at relevant exposure levels; toxicological studies had been done on the model fish, <b>Medaka</b> and found little effect on adult behavior or physiology, but developmental abnormalities were observed more frequently in spawn of fish that had been exposed to relevant doses. [...] Studies had also been conducted on mesocosms that included sunfish, that were exposed to three dose ranges of the combination of fluoxetine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin, with the highest dose range set well beyond environmental exposures; [...] almost all the fish died at the doses in the highest ranges and half the fish died in the middle dose ranges, while almost none died in the low range and in the controls. [...] The reason for this was studied but the investigators were not able to identify the cause. [...] Subsequent studies showed that fluoxetine may be an endocrine disruptor in some fish species.|$|E

50|$|Transgenic <b>medaka</b> are {{relatively}} easy to produce. They have been genetically modified to secrete various human hormones, express promoter sequences from other fish, and to make antimicrobial proteins and a protein that makes the <b>medaka</b> glow fluorescent green, yellow or red. There are also many mutations that show up in <b>medaka</b> at random, for example, a mutant strain that lacks scales, and one with extra-long fins. Haploid embryonic stem cell lines have been established.|$|E
50|$|Researcher Shosaku Kashiwada of the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan, in a {{more recent}} study, {{intended}} to further investigate the effects of nanoparticles on soft-bodied organisms. His study allowed him to explore the distribution of water-suspended fluorescent nanoparticles throughout the eggs and adult bodies of a species of fish, known as the see-through <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes). See-through <b>medaka</b> were used because of their small size, wide temperature and salinity tolerances, and short generation time. Moreover, small fish like the see-through <b>medaka</b> have been popular test subjects for human diseases and organogenesis for other reasons as well, including their transparent embryos, rapid embryo development, and the functional equivalence of their organs and tissue material to that of mammals. Because the see-through <b>medaka</b> have transparent bodies, analyzing the deposition of fluorescent nanoparticles throughout the body is quite simple. For his study, Dr. Kashiwada evaluated four aspects of nanoparticle accumulation. These included the overall accumulation and the size-dependent accumulation of nanoparticles by <b>medaka</b> eggs, the effects of salinity on the aggregation of nanoparticles in solution and on their accumulation by <b>medaka</b> eggs, {{and the distribution of}} nanoparticles in the blood and organs of adult <b>medaka.</b> It was also noted that nanoparticles were in fact taken up into the bloodstream and deposited throughout the body. In the <b>medaka</b> eggs, there was a high accumulation of nanoparticles in the yolk; most often bioavailibility was dependent on specific sizes of the particles. Adult samples of <b>medaka</b> had accumulated nanoparticles in the gills, intestine, brain, testis, liver, and bloodstream. One major result from this study was the fact that salinity may have a large influence on the bioavailibility and toxicity of nanoparticles to penetrate membranes and eventually kill the specimen.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{closely related}} lep paralogues in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). [...] A single lep gene has been {{documented}} for green-spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). In other species {{there are reports of}} two closely related lep paralogues, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Atlantic salmon. More distantly related lep genes have been found in <b>medaka</b> (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). At least 2 leptin genes (lepa and lepb) exist in the crown-clade (Fig. 1). Early findings have shown that lepa and lepb share low interspecies aa identity, and are argued to have arisen through whole genome duplication, which occurred early in the teleost lineage. The duplicity of genes has been described for Atlantic salmon, Japanese <b>medaka,</b> common carp and zebrafish. Both lep paralogues cluster with lepa, and therefore suggest that at least one or more form (lepb) may exist in this species, since it is tetraploid. [...] However, previous attempts using genomic synteny have only found the putative genomic duplicates in <b>medaka</b> and zebrafish paralogue. Currently it remains unclear, whether lepb exists in other teleosts due to the degenerative nature of this paralogue.|$|E
