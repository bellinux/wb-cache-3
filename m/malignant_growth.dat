500|$|Historically {{there has}} been a close {{correlation}} between economic growth and environmental degradation: as communities grow, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators. Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the <b>malignant</b> <b>growth</b> of a cancer because it eats away at the Earth's ecosystem services which are its life-support system. There is concern that, unless resource use is checked, modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base. While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources, ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale (rather than continual growth), fair distribution and efficient allocation, in that order. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that [...] "business cannot succeed in societies that fail".|$|E

50|$|Oral cancer often {{presents}} as a non-healing ulcer (shows no sign {{of healing}} after 2 weeks). In the US oral cancer accounts for about 8 percent of all <b>malignant</b> <b>growths.</b> Men are affected twice as often as women, particularly men older than 40/60.|$|R
60|$|A transgression, a crime, {{entering}} a man's existence, eats {{it up like}} a <b>malignant</b> <b>growth,</b> consumes it like a fever. Nostromo had lost his peace; the genuineness of all his qualities was destroyed. He felt it himself, and often cursed the silver of San Tome. His courage, his magnificence, his leisure, his work, everything was as before, only everything was a sham. But the treasure was real. He clung to it with a more tenacious, mental grip. But he hated {{the feel of the}} ingots. Sometimes, after putting away a couple of them in his cabin--the fruit of a secret night expedition to the Great Isabel--he would look fixedly at his fingers, as if surprised they had left no stain on his skin.|$|E

40|$|The {{cutaneous}} papillomas experimentally {{produced by}} the inoculation into domestic rabbits of a virus native to western cottontails (1) frequently become carcinomatous (2). The <b>malignant</b> <b>growths</b> arise directly from the virus-infected cells as result of changes which often appear to be slight, {{and many of them}} continue to exhibit the morphological characters distinctive of the virus action until anaplasia supervenes. Other facts also bespeak an intimate relation of the virus to the cancers (3), yet whether it is their essential cause remains uncertain. And since domestic rabbits are foreign hosts the growths it induces in them, both papillomas and carcinomas, must be looked upon as the outcome of artificial conditions. Several authors have noted (4) that cancers sometimes originate from the virus papillomas of cottontails, but thus far only one of the <b>malignant</b> <b>growths</b> has been described in detail, and the relation of the papilloma to this was not wholly clear (4 b). Obviously the phenomenon deserves careful study; and there is the more reason to undertake it because the condition...|$|R

The methods of treatment are considered and also the prognosis of <b>malignant</b> <b>growths,</b> which, although poor, compares favourably with that of cancer of the stomach.

Vaginoplasty is also used to correct congenital defects to the vagina, urethra and rectum. Vaginoplasty can correct uterine and vaginal prolapse. It will correct protrusion of the urinary bladder into the vagina and protrusion of the rectum into the vagina. Often, a vaginoplasty is performed to repair the vagina and its attached structures due to trauma.|$|R
