5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment</b> (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment</b> (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E

25|$|An audit {{released}} by the Victorian Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 (27.2%) of machines at railway stations did not work, and 11.9% of <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment</b> in buses and trams were non-operational. The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator OneLink Transit Systems to improve the service to commuters. Following these improvements, a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 92.1% at railway stations, and 98.3% on buses and trams. Usability was also improved, with tram machines able to sell daily tickets. Furthermore, vandalism across the network dropped by 62% between 2001 and 2002.|$|E
25|$|As the unbranded Chinese {{cell phones}} {{which do not}} have International <b>Mobile</b> <b>Equipment</b> Identity (IMEI) numbers pose a serious {{security}} risk to the country, Mobile network operators therefore suspended the usage of around 30 million mobile phones (about 8% of all mobiles in the country) by 30 April. Phones without valid IMEI cannot be connected to cellular operators. 5–6 years the average monthly subscribers additions were around 0.05 to 0.1 million only and the total mobile subscribers base in December 2002 stood at 10.5 millions. However, {{after a number of}} proactive initiatives taken by regulators and licensors, the total number of mobile subscribers has increased rapidly to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012.|$|E

25|$|Mobile {{search is}} an {{evolving}} branch of information retrieval services that {{is centered on}} the convergence of mobile platforms and mobile phones, or {{that it can be}} used to tell information about something and other mobile devices. Web search engine ability in a mobile form allows users to find mobile content on websites which are available to mobile devices on mobile networks. As this happens mobile content shows a media shift toward mobile multimedia. Simply put, mobile search is not just a spatial shift of PC web search to <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment,</b> but is witnessing more of treelike branching into specialized segments of mobile broadband and mobile content, both of which show a fast-paced evolution.|$|E
500|$|In June 1974, Genesis {{started work}} on their double concept album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. It marked the start of Gabriel's {{increasingly}} strained relationship {{on the rest of}} the group which contributed to his departure. The album was written at Headley Grange in East Hampshire where upon their arrival, the building was in a state left by the previous band with excrement on the floor and rat infestations. Gabriel objected to Rutherford's idea of an album based on The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, thinking the idea was [...] "too twee". He persuaded the band with a less fantastical and more complicated story involving Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City who embarks on a spiritual quest to establish his freedom and identity while meeting several bizarre characters on the way. Gabriel wrote the story with influences from West Side Story, [...] "a kind of punk" [...] twist to Pilgrim's Progress, author Carl Jung, and the film El Topo by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Most of the album's lyrics were written by Gabriel, leaving much of its music to the rest of the group. His absence from a considerable amount of writing sessions due to difficulties with his wife's first birth was something Rutherford and Banks [...] "were horribly unsupportive" [...] of. Gabriel also left the group when director William Friedkin asked him to write a screenplay, but returned after the project was shelved. In August 1974, production moved to Glaspant Manor in Carmarthenshire, Wales with Burns, as co-producer, operating Island Studios' <b>mobile</b> <b>equipment.</b> Further work and mixing took place at Island where Brian Eno contributed synthesizers and effects that the album's sleeve credits as [...] "Enossification". When Gabriel asked Eno how the band could repay him, Eno said he needed a drummer for his track [...] "Mother Whale Eyeless". Collins said, [...] "I got sent upstairs as payment". Gabriel was pleased with Eno's work but Banks was less enthusiastic.|$|E
