2500|$|For black women, {{achieving}} suffrage {{was a way}} {{to counter}} the disfranchisement of the men of their race. Despite this discouragement, black suffragists continued to insist on their equal political rights. Starting in the 1890s, African American women began to assert their political rights aggressively from within their own clubs and suffrage societies. [...] "If white American women, with all their natural and acquired advantages, need the ballot," [...] argued Adella Hunt Logan of Tuskegee, Alabama, [...] "how much <b>more</b> <b>do</b> black Americans, male and female, need the strong defense of a vote to help secure their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?" ...|$|E

[...] Rabbi Isaac compared it to a person fitting together two boards, joining them one to another.

2500|$|Video games {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Noctis' character. Once Final Fantasy XV was {{revealed to the}} audience, Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network said that Noctis was [...] "your standard-issue brash anime kid in demeanor." [...] Daniella Lucas from GamesRadar compared him with Final Fantasy VIII main character, Squall Leonhart, based on his rebellious attitude as he lives [...] "by his own rules" [...] {{in contrast to the}} strict code of conduct set by his royal overseers. Similarly, Michelle Nguyen from Geek initially noted physical and mental similarities between Noctis and Narutos anti-hero and antisocial character, Sasuke Uchiha. However, she found Noctis was nicer but had a heavy burden that made him look cold. Nguyen praised the way Noctis became friends with the other characters. Like Nguyen, David Roberts from GamesRadar enojyed Noctis' role in Brotherhood due to the way he develops to his relationships with his friends. Andrew Webster from The Verse noted while the characters appear to be cliche, the way Noctis became friends with them gave him a wish to play Final Fantasy XV and see how <b>more</b> <b>do</b> they develop.|$|E
2500|$|Posner usually placed {{himself as}} {{chairman}} of the board and president of each company that his [...] Security Management Company subsidiaries, DWG or NVF, a vulcanized fiber manufacturer that controls the other half of Posner's companies. [...] So while collecting reasonable compensation at each company, Posner's overall compensation surpassed major corporation executive pay like General Motors. [...] NVF controlled Sharon Steel Corporation, one of the country's largest specialty steel manufacturers, which led to legal trouble. [...] Posner sat on Sharon Steel's pension trustee board and directed the pension board to invest in Posner-owned properties. [...] In 1971 the SEC sued, after which Posner then agreed not to sit on any pension board for any of his companies. [...] Posner basically let those companies that could get by with minimum maintenance and nothing <b>more</b> <b>do</b> just that. [...] With the run of acquisitions from 1982 and 1985, DWG faced [...] heavy debt. [...] Posner approached one of his backers, Carl Lindner, Jr., for assistance. [...] Instead in 1986, Lindner's American Financial Corporation had acquired warrants for more than 30 percent of DWG's shares. [...] Linder backed down from exercising the warrants but forced Posner to reduce his pay from DWG. [...] Posner also started selling off DWG assets: [...] Foxcroft and Enro shirt groups and the citrus operation. [...] A deal for Royal Crown fell through.|$|E
2500|$|Coulter {{also cited}} the 2002 Senate {{testimony}} of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors {{for refusing to}} authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They {{knew that he was}} a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted [...] "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" [...] so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that [...] "'probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England." [...] Coulter says the poll was [...] "by the [...] "Daily Telegraph", actually it was by Sunrise, an [...] "Asian" [...] (i.e., Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because [...] "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling," [...] they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted.
