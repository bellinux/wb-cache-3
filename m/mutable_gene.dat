40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the analysis of essential genes in the hDf 6 region of chromosome I of Caenorhabditis elegans. Nineteen complementation groups have been identified which are required for the growth, survival or fertility of the organism (essential genes). Since ten of these genes were represented {{by more than one}} allele, a Poisson calculation predicts a minimum estimate of 25 essential genes in hDf 6. The most <b>mutable</b> <b>gene</b> in this region was let- 354 with seventeen alleles. An average mutation rate of 5 X 10 (- 5) mutations/gene/chromosome screened was calculated for an ethyl methanesulfonate dose of 15 mM. Mutations were recovered by screening for lethal mutations using the duplication sDp 2 for recovery. Our analysis shows that duplications are very effective for maintenance and mapping of large numbers of lethal mutations. Approximately 600 lethal mutations were mapped in order to identify the 54 that are in the deficiency hDf 6. The hDf 6 region appears to have a lower proportion of early arresting mutations than other comparably sized regions of the genome...|$|E
40|$|Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is a common, {{autosomal}} dominant genetic disorder {{with a variety}} of highly variable symptoms including cutaneous manifestations (such as café au lait spots), Lisch nodules, plexiform neurofibromas, skeletal abnormalities, an increased risk for malignancy, and the development of learning disabilities. The wide clinical variability of expression of the disease phenotype and high (spontaneous) mutation rate of the NF 1 gene indicate that careful clinical examination of patients and family members is necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis of the disease. Since very few NF 1 mutations have been identified, and with the apparent lack of a predominant mutation in this large, highly <b>mutable</b> <b>gene,</b> molecular diagnosis of NF 1 will continue to be based on haplotypes using linkage analysis. Here we report our experiences while providing a molecular diagnostic service for NF 1 in the ethnically diverse region of south-western Ontario. Molecular diagnoses with at least one informative probe/enzyme combination are reported for 19 families including two families requesting prenatal diagnosis for NF 1. We have augmented the classical Southern based approach to linkage analysis with the use of PCR based assays for molecular linkage. Furthermore, criteria have been established in our laboratory for executing molecular linkage based on heterozygosity values, recombination fractions, and the use of intragenic probes/markers...|$|E
40|$|Rose-alpha gene mutates {{frequently}} to its purple allelomorph. The {{results of measurements}} indicate that the gene mutated with approximately the same rate during twelve cell generations {{of the development of}} sepals. No difference in mutability was observed when the gene mutability in the lowest five flowers of racemes was compared with the mutability of the next five flowers of the same racemes. The mutability curves were practically horizontal lines in material differing widely in the frequency of mutability. The rate of mutability in garnetogenesis was probably not higher than the rate of mutability in somatic tissue. Lavender-alpha gene has a high rate of mutability early and late in ontogeny, and has a low rate of mutability or is constant in the intermediate stages of ontogeny. The evidence accumulated in studying <b>mutable</b> <b>genes</b> is opposed to the assumption that these genes are composed of two kinds of smaller hereditary units (gene elements), and that the frequent mutability of these genes is due to an assortment of gene elements.

40|$|Genetically {{modified}} Metarhizium spp {{represent a}} major new arsenal for combating insect pests and insect-borne diseases. However, for these tools to be used safely and effectively, we need a much better understanding of their evolutionary potential and invasion ecology. In order to model natural as well as anthropogenic dispersal scenarios, we investigated evolutionary processes in a green fluorescent protein tagged strain of Metarhizium robertsii following transfer from a semitropical to a temperate soil community. Adaptive changes occurred over four years despite recurrent genetic bottlenecks and lack of recombination with locally well adapted strains. By coupling microarray-based functional analysis with DNA hybridizations we determined that expression of cell wall and stress response genes evolved at an accelerated rate in multiple replicates, whereas virulence determinants, transposons, and chromosome structure were unaltered. The <b>mutable</b> <b>genes</b> were enriched for TATA boxes possibly because they are larger mutational targets. In further field trials, we showed that the new mutations increased the fitness of M. robertsii in the new range by enhancing saprophytic associations, and these benefits were maintained in subsequent years. Consistent with selection being habitat rather than host specific, populations of an avirulent mutant cycled with seasons similarly to the wild type, whereas a mutant unable to adhere to plant roots showed a linear decrease in population. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding postrelease adaptations, show that agents can be selected that lack gene flow and virulence evolution, and describe a means of genetically containing transgenic strains by disrupting the Mad 2 gene...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{experiment}} designed to reveal the genic composition of the short arm of chromosome 9, a phenomenon of rare occurrence (or recognition) in maize began to appear with remarkably high frequencies in the cultures. The terms <b>mutable</b> <b>genes,</b> unstable <b>genes,</b> variegation, mosaicism, <b>mutable</b> loci or “position-effect” have been applied to this phenomenon. Its occurrence {{in a wide variety of}} organisms has been recognized. The most extensive investigations of this phenomenon have been undertaken in Drosophila melanogaster. 1 In this organism, the conditions associated with the origin of genic instability have been well defined. The part played by the heterochromatic materials of the chromosomes, in inducing and controlling the type of variegation and its time and frequency of occurrence, has been established. It has not been generally recognized that the instability of genic expression in other organisms may be essentially the same as that occurring in Drosophila. As stated above, a large number of mutable loci have recently arisen in the maize cultures and are continuing to arise anew. The loci affect variegation for many different kinds of plant characters, each locus being concerned with a particular character or occasionally several characters. Some of these loci are c, yg 2, wx, a 2, y, pyd, which are well-investigated units in maize. 2 Others involve previously unknown genetic units. The same types of genic instability appearing in the maize cultures have been described in many other organisms. The behavior of these new mutable loci in maize cannot be considered peculiar to this organism. The author believes that the mechanism underlying the phenomenon of variegation is basically the same in all organisms. The reasons for this conclusion will be made apparent in the discussion...|$|R
40|$|In genetic screens, {{the number}} of mutagenized gametes {{examined}} is an important parameter for evaluating screen progress, {{the number of}} genes of a given <b>mutable</b> phenotype, <b>gene</b> size, cost, and labor. Since genetic screens often entail examination of thousands or {{tens of thousands of}} animals, strategies for optimizing genetics screens are important for minimizing effort while maximizing the number of mutagenized gametes examined. To date, such strategies have not been described for genetic screens in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we review general principles of genetic screens in C. elegans, and use a modified binomial strategy to obtain a general expression for the number of mutagenized gametes examined in a genetic screen. We use this expression to calculate optimal screening parameters for a large range of genetic screen types. In addition, we developed a simple online genetic-screen-optimization tool that can be used independently of this paper. Our results demonstrate that choosing the optimal F 2 -to-F 1 screening ratio can significantly improve screen efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Selection and {{adaptation}} {{of individuals to}} their underlying environments are highly dynamical processes, encompassing interactions {{between the individual and}} its seasonally changing environment, synergistic or antagonistic interactions between individuals and interactions amongst the regulatory genes within the individual. Plants are useful organisms to study within systems modeling because their sedentary nature simplifies interactions between individuals and the environment, and many important plant processes such as germination or flowering are dependent on annual cycles which can be disrupted by climate behavior. Sedentism makes plants relevant candidates for spatially explicit modeling that is tied in with dynamical environments. We propose that in order to fully understand the complexities behind plant adaptation, a system that couples aspects from systems biology with population and landscape genetics is required. A suitable system could be represented by spatially explicit individual-based models where the virtual individuals are located within time-variable heterogeneous environments and contain <b>mutable</b> regulatory <b>gene</b> networks. These networks could directly interact with the environment, and should provide a useful approach to studying plant adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Genetic and {{demographic}} {{studies suggest that}} ageing is an adaptive genetic program, but population genetic analysis indicates that the benefit of ageing to the group is too slow and too diffuse to offset its individual cost. Premise: Demographic homeostasis is a major target of natural selection at the group level, with a strength that can compete with the imperative to higher individual reproductive value. Hypothesis: Ageing has evolved based on its contribution to stabilizing population dynamics, helping prevent population growth overshoot, exhaustion of ecological resources, and local extinction. Model: Asexual individuals carrying a <b>mutable</b> ageing <b>gene</b> are tracked on a geographic grid with slow migration between neighbouring sites. Birth rate is constant; death probability for individuals {{is the sum of}} two terms: (1) a logistic crowding term proportional to the local site population and (2) a Gompertz ageing term, in which mortality increases exponentially with age at a rate that is governed by the individual’s gene. The logistic crowding term is computed with a time delay that simulates the momentum of population growth, and causes solutions to undergo chaotic population fluctuations if net growth rates are excessive. Results: Within each site, individual selection pushes life spans progressively longer. Once life spans have increased at a site, its population may fluctuate to extinction. Shorter-lived individuals re-seed it from neighbouring sites. The result is a dynamic steady state in which ageing is selected without pleiotropy...|$|R
40|$|In many {{microbes}} rapid mutation {{of highly}} <b>mutable</b> contingency <b>genes</b> continually replenishes {{a pool of}} variant alleles from which the most suitable are selected, assisting in rapid adaptation and evasion of the immune response. In some contingency genes mutability is achieved through DNA repeats within the coding region. The fungal human pathogen Candida albicans has 2600 repeat-containing ORFs. For those investigated (ALS genes, HYR 1, HYR 2, CEK 1, RLM 1) many protein variants with differing amino acid repeat regions exist, as expected for contingency genes. However, specific alleles dominate in different clades, which is unexpected if allele variation is used for short-term adaptation. Generation of new alleles of repeat-containing C. albicans ORFs has never been observed directly. Here we present evidence for restrictions on {{the emergence of new}} alleles in a highly mutable C. albicans repeat-containing ORF, PNG 2, encoding a putative secreted or cell surface glycoamidase. In laboratory cultures new PNG 2 alleles arose at a rate of 2. 8 × 10 − 5 (confidence interval 3. 3 × 10 − 6 − 9. 9 × 10 − 5) per cell per division, comparable to rates measured for contingency genes. Among 80 clinical isolates 17 alleles of different length and 23 allele combinations were distinguishable; sequence differences between repeat regions of identical size suggest the existence of 36 protein variants. Specific allele combinations predominated in different genetic backgrounds, as defined by DNA fingerprinting and multilocus sequence typing. Given the PNG 2 mutation rate, this is unexpected, unless in different genetic backgrounds selection favors different alleles. Specific alleles or allele combinations were not preferentially associated with C. albicans isolates from particular body sites or geographical regions. Our results suggest that the mutability of PNG 2 is not used for short-term adaptation or evasion of the immune system. Nevertheless the large number of alleles observed indicates that mutability of PNG 2 may assist C. albicans strains from different genetic backgrounds optimize their interaction with the host in the long term...|$|R
30|$|Leaf {{variegation}} mutants can {{be classified}} into two types depending on the genotypes of the green sectors and yellow (or white) sectors. First, in some mutants, the green and the yellow (or white) sectors in the leaves have different genotypes. That is, the green sectors contain the wild-type alleles, while the yellow (or white) sectors contain only mutant alleles. In many cases, this type of leaf variegation results from transposable element activity. For example, dcl (defective chloroplasts and leaves) in tomato (Keddie et al. 1996), dag (differentiation and greening) in Antirrhinum (Chatterjee et al. 1996), and pyl-v (pale-yellow-leaf variegated) in rice (Tsugane et al. 2006) are well-studied <b>mutable</b> alleles of <b>genes</b> for chloroplast biogenesis. In {{the second type of}} leaf variegation, all cells in the mutant leaves have the same genotype. That is, both green and yellow (or white) sectors contain the same mutant alleles, but the phenotype is differentially expressed between subsets of the cells, leading to the generation of green and yellow/white sectors. Because the leaves of the z 3 mutant have a uniform mutant genotype (data not shown), the leaf variegation of the z 3 mutant belongs to the second type. However, the leaf variegation mechanism of this type remains poorly understood.|$|R
40|$|Mutator {{lines of}} maize were {{originally}} defined by their high forward mutation rate, now {{known to be}} caused by the transposition of numerous Mu elements. A high frequency of somatic instability, seen as a fine purple spotting pattern on the aleurone tissue, is characteristic of Mu-induced <b>mutable</b> alleles of <b>genes</b> of the anthocyanin pathway. Loss of such somatic instability has been correlated with the de novo, specific modification of Mu element DNA. In this report the presence or loss of somatic instability at the bz 2 -mu 1 allele has been monitored to investigate the inheritance of the Mutator phenomenon. The active state is labile and may become weakly active (low fraction of spotted kernel progeny) or totally inactive (no spotted kernel progeny) during either outcrossing to non-Mutator lines or on self-pollination. In contrast, the inactive state is relatively permanent with rare reactivation in subsequent crosses to non-Mutator lines. Cryptic bz 2 -mu 1 alleles in weakly active lines can be efficiently reactivated to somatic instability when crossed with an active line. However, in reciprocal crosses of active and totally inactive individuals, strong maternal effects were observed on the inactivation of a somatically unstable bz 2 -mu 1 allele and on the reactivation of cryptic bz 2 -mu 1 alleles. In general, the activity state of the female parent determines the mutability of the progeny...|$|R

40|$|Mouse ENU {{mutagenesis}} programmes {{have yielded}} {{a series of}} independent mutations on proximal chromo-some 4 leading to dominant head-bobbing and circling behaviour due to truncations of the lateral semicircu-lar canal of the inner ear. Here, we report the identification of mutations in the Chd 7 gene in nine of these mutant alleles including six nonsense and three splice site mutations. The human CHD 7 gene {{is known to be}} involved in CHARGE syndrome, which also shows inner ear malformations {{and a variety of other}} features with varying penetrance and appears to be due to frequent de novo mutation. We found widespread expression of Chd 7 in early development of the mouse in organs affected in CHARGE syndrome including eye, olfactory epithelium, inner ear and vascular system. Closer inspection of heterozygous mutant mice revealed a range of defects with reduced penetrance, such as cleft palate, choanal atresia, septal defects of the heart, haemorrhages, prenatal death, vulva and clitoral defects and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Many of these defects mimic the features of CHARGE syndrome. There were no obvious features of the gene that might make it more <b>mutable</b> than other <b>genes.</b> We conclude that the large number of mouse mutants and human de novo mutations may be due to the combination of the Chd 7 gene being a large target and the fact that many heterozygous carriers of the mutations are viable individuals with a readily detectable phenotype...|$|R

However, {{the dynamics of}} such popula-tions as well as host plant and environment selection, gene flow and genetic drift have been analysed to a less-er extent. Insights into the sequential adaptation occur-ring between the crop and the micro-organism can also contribute to achieve a more effective control of the dis-ease in the long run. In this review the possible centre of origin, often {{in relation to the}} geographic history of the crop, is discussed for some phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. cassavae, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Erwinia amylovora and Xylella fastidiosa, The rapid ge-netic change of bacteria through lateral gene flow and the efficient exploration of new adaptive solutions by exploiting the “contingency genes ” of mutator clones, might also explain the occurrence of new diseases. Host selection, changes in environmental conditions and the introduction of new agronomic techniques, can {{play an important role in}} structuring the bacterial populations and in dramatically altering the equilibrium between the host plant and the pathogen.
