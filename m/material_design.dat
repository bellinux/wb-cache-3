They intricate detailing mainly using designs from traditional tribal designs including Turkmen, Kazakh, Baloch, and Uzbeks. The hand-made rugs come in many patterns and colors, but the traditional and most common example of an Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara) - The rugs with this print are commonly red in color. Many dyes such as vegetable dyes are used to give the rich colors.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{benefits}} of <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> in a product design process. We also compare the methods of material selection and <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> by demonstrating two examples—{{the design of a}} cantilever beam for minimum weight and the design of a fan blade for minimum weight. The design of the cantilever beam is carried out using Ashby’s material selection method as well as a proposed method for <b>materials</b> <b>design.</b> The design of the fan blade and its material is completed using computational tools. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate {{the benefits of}} <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> over <b>material</b> selection methods and to illustrate the flexibility inherent in <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> processes. We are more interested in revealing the possibilities of <b>materials</b> <b>design,</b> rather than the specific results from the example problems. The investigation of <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> presented in this paper moves us one step closer towards the realization of a systematic, inductive method for the concurrent design of products and materials...|$|R
40|$|Four {{elements}} of materials {{science and engineering}} (namely synthesis/processing, structure/composition, properties, and performance) should be systematically and holistically considered to give a unified view of a <b>material</b> being <b>designed,</b> but no effective mathematic methods have been derived to connect these four elements together to derive an integrated view so far. Multi-scale and closed-loop <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> cannot be described just only based on this unified view. A new <b>materials</b> <b>design</b> principle based on two basic elements, namely environment and microstructure, has been put forward to describe above two difficult problems, multi-scale and closed-loop <b>materials</b> <b>design.</b> A new concept of 'order' thereby has been deduced to quantitatively define the procedures of <b>materials</b> <b>design...</b>|$|R

Walter called the <b>Material</b> <b>Design</b> [...] "rather elegant and polished, with a focus on parceling off information for easy viewing, registering touches with a subtle splash on the screen, and using a lot of visuals cues", but noted that [...] "it’s not for everyone, especially if you prefer Apple’s design overhaul first introduced in iOS 7.

2500|$|Contact {{mechanics}} is part {{of mechanical}} engineering. [...] The physical and mathematical formulation of the subject is built upon the mechanics of materials and continuum mechanics and focuses on computations involving elastic, viscoelastic, and plastic bodies in static or dynamic contact. Contact mechanics provides necessary information for the safe and energy efficient design of technical systems and {{for the study of}} tribology, contact stiffness, electrical contact resistance and indentation hardness. Principles of contacts mechanics are implemented towards applications such as locomotive wheel-rail contact, coupling devices, braking systems, tires, bearings, combustion engines, mechanical linkages, gasket seals, metalworking, metal forming, ultrasonic welding, electrical contacts, and many others. Current challenges faced in the field may include stress analysis of contact and coupling members and the influence of lubrication and <b>material</b> <b>design</b> on friction and wear. Applications of contact mechanics further extend into the micro- and nanotechnological realm.|$|E

2500|$|Google has {{redesigned}} Google Play's interface {{on several}} occasions. In February 2011, Google introduced a website interface for then-named Android Market that provides access through a computer. Applications purchased are downloaded and installed on an Android device remotely, with a [...] "My Market Account" [...] section letting users give their devices a nickname for easy recognition. In May 2011, Google added new application lists to Android Market, including [...] "Top Paid", [...] "Top Free", [...] "Editor's Choice", [...] "Top Grossing", [...] "Top Developers", and [...] "Trending". In July, Google introduced an interface {{with a focus}} on featured content, more search filters, and (in the US) book sales and movie rentals. In May 2013, a redesign to the website interface matched the then-recently redesigned Android app. In July 2014, the Play Store Android app added new headers to the Books/Movies sections, a new Additional Information screen offering a list featuring the latest available app version, installed size, and content rating, and simplified the app permissions prompt into overview categories. A few days later, it got a redesign consistent with the then-new <b>Material</b> <b>Design</b> design language, [...] and the app was again updated in October 2015 to feature new animations, divide up the content into [...] "Apps and Games" [...] and [...] "Entertainment" [...] sections, as well as added support for languages read right-to-left. In April 2016, Google announced a redesign of all the icons used for its suite of Play apps, adding a similar style and consistent look. In May 2017, Google removed the shopping bag from the Google Play icon, with only the triangle and associated colors remaining.|$|E
