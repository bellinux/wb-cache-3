40|$|Land cover mapping {{relates to}} {{identifying}} {{the types of}} features present {{on the surface of}} the earth. It deals with discerning the extent of land cover features namely vegetation, geologic, urban infrastructure, water, bare soil or others. Variations in land cover and associated physical characteristics do influence weather and climate of our earth and hence, it is considered an essential element for modelling and understanding the earth as a system for many planning and management activities. Thus, understanding of land cover dynamics plays an important role at the local/regional as well as global level. Identifying, delineating and mapping land cover on temporal scale provides an opportunity to monitor the changes, which is important for planning activities and sustainable management of the natural resources. Land cover mapping can be done most effectively through space borne remote sensors of various spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. Due to the spectral resolution limitations of conventional <b>multispectral</b> <b>imageries,</b> hyperspectral sensors, which collect numerous bands in precisely defined spectral regions were developed.

40|$|Abstract [...] - In recent years, {{there has}} been greater {{interest}} {{in the field of}} remote sensing, especially in Hyperspectral sensing technology as the information that resides in the HS spectral domain provides significant advantages over the traditional Panchromatic and <b>Multispectral</b> <b>imageries.</b> The inherent tradeoff between the spectral and spatial resolutions has resulted in the development of newer remote sensing systems that include low resolution HS data coupled with high resolution Panchromatic or Multispectral imaging subsystems. In this paper, a novel method called Coupled Non negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) unmixing based fusion method is used for the fusion of low-spectral-resolution Multispectral data and a low-spatial-resolution Hyperspectral data inorder to produce a fused image data that will be enhanced in terms of its both spatial and spectral qualities which in turn contributes for the accurate identification and classification of various materials in the observed image scene.
