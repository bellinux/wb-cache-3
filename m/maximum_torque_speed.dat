The blends are 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 50 % by volume of n-butanol. The influences of CO, THC, NOx and PM emissions by the fraction are analyzed.

The period significantly affects the combustion speed, {{the rate of}} pressure and temperature increase, easy engine starting and other engine per-formance characteristics.

40|$|This Thesis {{study the}} {{parameters}} {{estimation of the}} induction machine with the single-cage and doublecage models, using the stator currents, voltages and mechanical speed from a starting transient. The dynamic equations of the induction machine are expressed in the synchronous reference frame because in this reference {{the values of the}} direct and quadrature currents have a slower variation than those in the other reference frames. This reference frame is important to facilitate the data filtering. The proposed method for the single-cage parameters estimation introduces an approximation of the rotor flux using the stator currents and voltages. It has been demonstrated in the thesis that this approximation improves the accuracy of the calculated parameters significantly. Two different methods to calculate the parameters have been developed. The first is based on the linear least-square method and the second on the resolving of a nonlinear system of equations. A detailed error study of the parameters and predicted behavior {{have been made in the}} thesis. An interesting result of the error study is that it is very important that the speed of the points be used in the calculations. It is very important to use the points with the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> and points near the synchronous speed. The thesis presents the two first methods developed for parameters estimation of the induction machine with double-cage model using data from a starting transient. The other methods known in the literature use steady state data. Both methods use data from the point of maximum torque to the synchronous speed to calculate the parameters of a single-cage model, because the torque- and current-speed curves of this single-cage fit very well with the torque- and current-speed curves of the double-cage. Later, the first method uses a point with a speed near to zero speed and a point in the synchronous speed and other single-cage is calculated. With these two singlecages the impedances of three points are calculated and they are used to estimate the six parameters of the double-cage model solving a nonlinear system of equations. The second method, called instantaneous power method, uses the fact that the averaged transient torque has similar values to the steady-state torque in the mechanical transient region. Then, several impedance values are calculated for points with different speeds in this region, where the effects of the double-cage are more important. Finally, with impedance values in the synchronous speed and the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> obtained with the regression method and impedance values obtained with the instantaneous power method, a set of non linear equations are defined. Their solution is the estimated parameters of the induction machine double-cage model. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on a four-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine with methanol or ethanol injected into the air intake of each cylinder, to compare their effect on the engine performance, gaseous emissions and particulate emissions of the engine under five engine loads at the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> of 1800 rev/min. The methanol or ethanol was injected to top up 10 % and 20 % of the engine loads under different engine operating conditions. The experimental results show that both fumigation methanol and fumigation ethanol decrease the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) at low engine load but improves it at high engine load; however the fumigation methanol has higher influence on the BTE. Compared with Euro V diesel fuel, fumigation methanol or ethanol could lead to reduction of both NOx and particulate mass and number emissions of the diesel engine, with fumigation methanol being more effective than fumigation ethanol in particulate reduction. The NOx and particulate reduction is more effective with increasing level of fumigation. However, in general, fumigation fuels increase the HC, CO and NO 2 emissions, with fumigation methanol leading to higher increase of these pollutants. Compared with ethanol, the fumigation methanol has stronger influence on the in-cylinder gas temperature, the air/fuel ratio, the combustion processes and hence the emissions of the engine.

40|$|The {{torque ripple}} of {{switched}} reluctance motors (SRMs) {{is the main}} disadvantage that limits the industrial application of these motors. Although several methods for smooth-toque operation (STO) have been proposed, STO works well only within a certain <b>torque</b> and <b>speed</b> range because of {{the constraints of the}} supply voltage and peak current. Based on previous work that sought to expand the STO range, a scheme is developed in this study to determine the <b>maximum</b> smooth <b>torque</b> range at each speed.

The crank angles of the peak values of CP, PRR and IHRR are larger than those of gasoline, whereas the crank angle of the total heat release is smaller than that of gasoline. The cyclic irregularity of n-butanol/gasoline bends is higher than that of gasoline. Therefore, the combustion of n-butanol/gasoline blends becomes mild, which further gives the benefit of reducing NOX emissions.

Changing the fuel characteristics could affect the performance of the fuel injection system. This study focuses on the evaluation of fuel spray characteristics of straight used cooking oil (SUCO) and its blends with petroleum diesel (PD) as a surrogate for pure PD. Used cooking oil blends have quite different physical properties from those of pure PD. Data for the lower heating value (LHV), density and viscosity were obtained from laboratory analysis.

40|$|Induction motors {{are used}} in a {{significant}} portion of industrial electric drive applications due to their reliability, relatively low cost and low maintenance required. The Squirrel Cage and Wound Rotor type machines are common examples of an induction machine. One of the important features of an induction motor is its <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> characteristic. The correct application, motor protection, speed control and efficiency of a machine can depend on correctly identifying this characteristic. The project objective involved the design of experiments to obtain the <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> characteristics for both the squirrel cage and wound rotor type induction motors available in the engineering laboratory. A further aim of the project involved the design and execution of suitable experiments with the Lab-Volt equipment to experimentally determine the electrical parameters of the machines. Determining the electrical parameters involves conducting standard tests such as the DC, No-Load and Locked Rotor test. Once these parameters are known the characteristic curve can be modeled by simulation software and a comparison can be made with the experimental curves. Further work included using 3 measured points within the stable operating region to extrapolate the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and <b>speed</b> for each machine. An investigation into the effect of increasing the rotor resistance in the wound rotor induction motor (WRIM) was also carried out. Determining the <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> characteristic experimentally was achieved relatively easily in the stable operating region with the use of an electrodynamometer as a loading device.

It {{can be seen from}} the obtained results that the engine speed are greatly influence on the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). It can be seen that the decreases of BMEP with increases of engine speed, however, increases the brake specific fuel consumption. For rich mixtures (low AFR), BMEP decreases almost linearly, then decreases it with a non-linear manner. It can be observed that the brake thermal efficiency increases nearby the richest condition and then decreases with increases of engine speed. The optimum minimum value of BSFC occurred within a range of AFR from 38. 144 (φ = 0. 9) to 49. 0428 (φ = 0. 7) for the selected range of speed. It can be seen that higher volumetric efficiency emphasizes that direct injection of hydrogen is a strong candidate solution to solve the problem of the low volumetric efficiencies of hydrogen engine. <b>Maximum</b> brake <b>torque</b> <b>speed</b> for hydrogen engine occurs at lower speed compared with gasoline. The present contribution suggests the direct injection fuel supply system as a strong candidate for solving the power and abnormal combustion problems...|$|R
40|$|Electrical drives {{are widely}} used in today’s society. They {{can be found in}} bothhousehold {{products}} and in the industry. One application where electrical drivesare used is in robots for mowing lawns. In the studied robots the motors in theelectrical drives used for propulsion are Brush Less Direct Current motors, BLDCmotors. The BLDC-motor has its <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> at high <b>speeds</b> and thereforea gearbox is needed. The gearbox is space consuming, add costs and consists ofmechanical parts that wear during use. Of interest is therefore to investigate ifthere are other electrical drives which can be used for propulsion. A motor who has its <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> at low <b>speeds</b> is the Stepper motor, andtherefore it is of interest to investigate if a stepper motor could replace the BLDCmotor. A drawback with the stepper motor is that it always consumes maximumcurrent and therefore a current controller is beneficial. Together with currentcontrol, speed control is needed to make the robot run at desired speed. To beable to perform an accurate current and speed control feedback from the motor isneeded. Information about the rotor angle and velocity can be used for the speedcontrol and the load angle can be used for the current control since the current isproportional to the load torque. To estimate the rotor angle and velocity a model has been developed. Themodel is based on fundamental electrical and mechanical equations and neglectsthe current and position dependence of the inductance and flux linkage. To completethe model three motor parameters, the <b>maximum</b> detent <b>torque</b> Tdm, themaximum flux linkage  m and the friction constant B was determined. Parameterdetermination was done by linear regression and by using an Extended KalmanFilter, EKF. The result of the parameter determination were Tdm = 0. 2152 Nm, m = - 0. 002854 Vs/rad and B = 0. 01186 Nms/rad. The model is used in an EKF to estimate the rotor angle and angular velocity. The result of the implemented EKF seems promising. When making the rotortake a step in velocity from 3. 927 rad/s to 7. 85 rad/s the EKF estimates the stateswith only a small bias: 0. 02 rad for the angle, 0. 3 rad/s for the velocity, 0. 005 Afor phase a current and 0. 0004 A for phase b current. To estimate the load angle the Sliding Discrete Fourier Transform is used. Theexpected relation between the load torque and load angle is sinusoidal. The loadangle is calculated from data where the external load is between 0 - 2. 5 Nm. Inthat area the load angle shows the expected sinusoidal appearance and the loadangle is in the area between 0. 1 and 0. 45 rad. At 3 Nm the rotor stalls and it isshown that the load angle varies between 0 and 2 rad when the rotor is stalled...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the speed}} of the {{auxiliary}} engines was held constant, the main engines had a power curve which was constant with rotational speed; since power is the product of <b>torque</b> and rotational <b>speed,</b> the main engines were endowed with a torque curve inversely proportional to <b>speed,</b> producing <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> at a low speed and reducing as the speed increased. Thus was provided the necessary increased low-speed torque output for starting and hill climbing.|$|R

40|$|In many applications, robots {{have to bear}} large loads while {{moving slowly}} and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load. These type of bi-modal tasks, with {{conflicting}} requirements in terms of operating speeds and desired impedances, often lead {{to the use of}} oversized and inefficient actuators which are inhibitory particularly for mobile robots. Multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speeds, by enabling significant changes to the reflected intrinsic actuator impedances and by making possible the leveraging or attenuation of the natural load dynamics. This thesis aims to develop the technological solutions needed to use variable gear ratio actuators and exploit the advantages of variable transmissions in a robotic context. First, by addressing the issue of how to make fast and seamless gearshifts between two very different reduction ratios under diverse load conditions, with a solution based on a dual-motor actuator architecture and a control scheme using the null space. Second, by developing control algorithms that select optimal gear ratios dynamically based on state feedback, to move with minimal motor torques and to adjust the output impedance appropriately given a task. The proposed approach exploit variable transmissions not merely for increasing <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and <b>speed,</b> but also to significantly alter the dynamic properties, including load sensitivity, robustness, and backdrivability. Simulations and experiments using a novel lightweight robotic arm using three custom-built dual-speed dual-motor actuators are presented. Results demonstrate very fast gear shifting in highly dynamic situations with dual-speed dual-motor actuators, and show that actively changing gear ratios using the proposed control algorithms can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction of necessary motor torque and power. by Alexandre Girard.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a mechanical clutch which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> from a first clutch plate to a second clutch plate. More specifically, the mechanical clutch includes at least one stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from a first clutch plate to a second clutch plate providing a desired <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is not exceeded. However, if the desired <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the clutch plates so that the torque to the second clutch plate does not exceed the desired <b>maximum</b> <b>torque.</b> The desired <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the clutch plates and when the applied torque to the first clutch plate exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the clutch plates rather than transmit that torque to the second clutch plate...|$|R
