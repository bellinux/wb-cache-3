The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord <b>mentality</b> <b>that</b> has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems that plague Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E
25|$|Mehmed the Conqueror {{consolidated}} {{power by}} building his imperial court, the divan, with officials {{who would be}} solely loyal to him and allow him greater autonomy and authority. Under previous sultans the divan had been filled with members of aristocratic families that sometimes had other interests and loyalties {{than that of the}} sultan. Mehmed the Conqueror transitioned the empire away from the Ghazi <b>mentality</b> <b>that</b> emphasizes ancient traditions and ceremonies in governance and moved the empire towards a centralized bureaucracy largely made of officials of devşirme background. Additionally, Mehmed the Conqueror took the step of converting the religious scholars who were part of the Ottoman madrasas into salaried employees of the Ottoman bureaucracy who were loyal to him. This centralization was possible and formalized through a kanunname, issued during 1477–1481, which for the first time listed the chief officials in the Ottoman government, their roles and responsibilities, salaries, protocol and punishments, as well as how they related to each other and the sultan.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 2000s {{a number}} of {{software-based}} virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, can create high quality music using {{little more than a}} single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation, and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as Max/Msp and Reaktor and freeware packages such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, and ChucK. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the DIY <b>mentality</b> <b>that</b> was once a core part of dance music culture is seeing a resurgence.|$|E

500|$|In a Game Developers Conference project postmortem, Yoshida {{reflected}} on the herculean task of maintaining and updating an MMORPG while simultaneously developing a new one {{over the course of}} just two years and eight months. He identified three main reasons why the original launch failed: an over-emphasis on graphical quality, a lack of modern MMORPG expertise in the development team, and a <b>mentality</b> <b>that</b> all problems could be fixed in future patches. These evolved from the team's prior experience on Final Fantasy XI, the previous MMORPG in the Final Fantasy series. As the series has been renowned for its state-of-the-art graphics, the original development team gained an unhealthy obsession with maximizing graphical quality at the cost of server performance, which was unsustainable for an online game {{with tens of thousands of}} high definition assets. In designing Final Fantasy XI, the team spent a year playing EverQuest, the most successful MMORPG of the early 2000s. However, they lacked experience with modern games in the genre; the Final Fantasy XIV team was instructed merely to make something [...] "different from Final Fantasy XI". Yoshida admonished that the team should [...] "go play World of Warcraft for a year [...] " [...] instead.|$|E

500|$|In his {{influential}} book From Caligari to Hitler, Kracauer argues the Dr. Caligari {{character is}} symptomatic of a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, which he calls the German [...] "collective soul". Kracauer argues Dr. Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of Adolf Hitler and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the <b>mentality</b> <b>that</b> allowed the Nazi Party to rise. He calls Dr. Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's [...] "manipulation of the soul". Kracauer described the film {{as an example of}} Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority, and reflects a [...] "general retreat" [...] into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany. Cesare symbolizes those who have no mind of their own and must follow the paths of others; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which [...] "self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder". Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority [...] "just because it has not made a preachy statement against it", and said the connection between Dr. Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{concept of}} McLuhan's {{argument}} (later elaborated upon in The Medium Is the Massage) {{is that new}} technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a <b>mentality</b> <b>that</b> gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the Modern period in the Western world: individualism, democracy, Protestantism, capitalism and nationalism.
