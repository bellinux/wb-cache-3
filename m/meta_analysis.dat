Hereby we present results of a meta-analysis of QTL on chicken chromosome 9, 14 and 18 using data from three separate experiments and joint QTL analysis for chromosome 14 and 18. <b>Meta</b> QTL <b>analysis</b> uses information from multiple QTLs studies. Joint QTL analysis is based on combining raw data from different QTL experimental populations. QTLs under the study were related to specific antibody response to keyhole lymphet hemocyanin (KLH), and natural antibodies to envi-ronmental antigens, lipopolisaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). <b>Meta</b> QTL <b>analysis</b> resulted in narrowing down the confidence interval for two QTLs on GGA 14.

Also, a confidence interval of a QTL for natural antibodies against LPS located onGGA 18 was narrowed down. CombinedQTL analysis was successful for two QTLs: for specific antibody response to-ward KLH on GGA 14, and for natural antibodies against LPS on GGA 18.

The goal {{in this study is}} to determine if the estimated coefficients vary by geographical location, time, type of data, and model specification. The results show that the estimated coefficients for some characteristics vary significantly by geographical location. These include square footage, lot size, age, bathrooms, swimming pool, and air conditioning. Controlling for time shows that the effects of these housing characteristics on house price have not changed over time. Controlling for type of data produces differences in coefficients for bathrooms. Controlling for wealth as measured by median household income has no significant impact on the coefficients for the housing characteristics. If the study controlled for square footage, the coefficients for lot size decrease. Controlling for the size of the hedonic model affects the coefficient for square footage.
