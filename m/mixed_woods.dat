5|$|Hydnellum fungi are mycorrhizal, and {{are usually}} found in {{coniferous}} and <b>mixed</b> <b>woods.</b> Favored tree hosts include members of the Fagaceae and the Pinaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Europe and North America, but some species are also found in tropical Asia. Harrison identified a dozen new species from North America in the 1960s. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus recognized 16 European species in his 1975 treatment of the genus, to which H. dianthifolium has been recently added by Loizides and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} B.curtisii grow singly, scattered, {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} {{coniferous}} or <b>mixed</b> <b>woods,</b> often with pines. Fruit bodies generally appear from August to November. The geographical distribution of the fungus is limited to eastern and southern North America. In the United States, it occurs from New England south to Florida, and west to Texas. The species was newly reported from Mexico in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows {{on the ground in}} {{deciduous}} or <b>mixed</b> <b>woods,</b> usually in association with pine trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common Albatrellus ovinus, from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the amyloid (staining bluish-black to black with Melzer's reagent) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of A.subrubescens contain scutigeral, a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity. A.subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous, and consuming them will result in a short-term gastrointestinal illness.|$|E

5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or <b>mixed</b> <b>woods</b> but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, there is often an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish flush in its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its red cap. The edible R.rugulosa—common in <b>mixed</b> <b>woods</b> in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with naphthol. The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E
