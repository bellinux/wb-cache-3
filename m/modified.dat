50|$|An {{adverbial}} is {{a construction}} which <b>modifies</b> or describes verbs. When an adverbial <b>modifies</b> a verb, {{it changes the}} meaning of that verb. Word groups, which are also considered to be adverbials, can also <b>modify</b> verbs: for example, a prepositional phrase, a noun phrase, a finite clause or a non-finite clause. Prepositional phrase in a sentence may be adverbial; that is, it <b>modifies</b> a verb.|$|R
