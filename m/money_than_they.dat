5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> did in their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E
5|$|The Godwins were {{constantly}} in debt, so Godwin returned to writing {{to support the}} family. He and his wife started a Juvenile Library for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's bookselling district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> could afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{decision}} to sell the two 767s, management also decided to sell the four remaining F-28s. This would allow Braathens to operate a fleet of pure 737-200, giving lower operating costs. One 737 {{was taken out of}} service in 1984, and the four F-28s sold in 1986. The same year, seven more 737-200s were delivered, along with two more in 1987 and 1988. By then, Braathens SAFEs entire fleet consisted of nineteen 737-200s. At the same time, Boeing had launched the 737-300, a slightly larger aircraft with new CFM-56 engines. Braathens SAFE considered the new aircraft, but where concerned that it used a traditional mechanical cockpit. The airline also needed larger aircraft for the charter traffic, and smaller aircraft for the domestic routes. The airline also considered the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and the Airbus A320, but settled on the 737 following the announcement of the stretched 737-400, with 156 seats, and the shortened 737-500, with 124 seats. These had glass cockpits, and Braathens SAFE would be among the first airlines to receive both models. To finance the purchase, the airline sold all but two of the 737-200s and leased them back. For some of the aircraft, they received more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had paid.|$|E

[...] Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. [...] He also supported Birmingham's Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore {{to put on a}} series of private concerts in 1799. [...] He maintained a pew at St Paul's Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical excellence. [...] When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the (incorrect) belief it was the centennial of Handel's birth and the (correct) belief that it was the 25thanniversary of his death, Boulton attended and wrote, [...] "I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the scene.

500|$|This vast sum {{of money}} was transported through Plymouth on 63 wagons, guarded by armed sailors and Royal Marines and {{accompanied}} by musical bands and cheering crowds {{to the security of}} the Royal Citadel. It remained in Plymouth until November when it was removed to London with considerable ceremony and placed at the Bank of England. The sums awarded as prize money, distributed in equal proscribed shares among the crews of Ethalion, Naiad, Alcmene and Triton were among the largest ever recorded. Each captain was given £40,730 (of which a third was due to the admiral in command), each lieutenant £5,091, each warrant officer £2,468, each midshipman £791 [...] and each sailor or marine £182. For the regular seamen, this total was 15 times their annual pay of £12. As historian James Henderson noted [...] "even the humblest seaman could set himself up with a cosy pub". For the captains, normally paid £150 a year, this was more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> could make in 270 years. On the only subsequent occasion when a Spanish treasure fleet was successfully intercepted, at the Battle of Cape Santa Maria in October 1804, an even greater haul was captured. On that occasion however the Admiralty used an obscure regulation to seize the bulk of the prize and the captains only received around £15,000 each.|$|E

2500|$|John II {{died as a}} {{prisoner}} in England and his son, Charles V was left {{to pick up the}} pieces. And so he did. Charles V pursued a policy of reform, including stable coinage. An edict dated 20 April 1365 established the centerpiece of this policy, a gold coin officially called the denier d’or aux fleurs de lis which had a standing figure of the king on its obverse. Its value in money of account was one livre tournois, just like the franc à cheval, and this coin is universally known as a franc à pied. In accordance with the theories of the mathematician, economist and royal advisor Nicolas Oresme, Charles struck fewer coins of better gold than his predecessors. In the accompanying deflation both prices and wages fell, but wages fell faster and debtors had to settle up in better <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had borrowed. The Mayor of Paris, Étienne Marcel, exploited their discontent to lead a revolt which forced Charles V out of the city. The franc fared better. It became associated with money stable at one livre tournois ...|$|E

2500|$|The IGT uses hot {{and cold}} {{processes}} in its concept of decision making. [...] Hot decision making involves emotional responses to the material presented based on motivation related to reward and punishment. [...] Cold processes occur when an individual uses rational cognitive determinations when making decisions. [...] Combined an individual should gain a positive emotional reaction when choices have beneficial consequences and will have negative emotional responses tied to choices that have greater negative consequences. [...] In general, healthy responders to the IGT will begin to drift to the lower gain decks as they {{realize that they are}} gaining more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> lose both through an ability to recognize that one is more consistently providing rewards as well as through the emotions related to winning consistently. [...] However, those who have emotional deficits will fail to recognize that they are losing money over time {{and will continue to be}} more influenced by the exhilaration of higher value rewards without being influenced by the negative emotions of the loses associated with them.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{returned}} to cinema screens in 2002 with Resident Evil, {{a science fiction}} action horror film, loosely based on the video game series {{of the same name}} by Capcom. Anderson {{came up with the idea}} of adapting the games, after playing the first couple of them for days in his apartment. Because Constantin Film, who had acquired the rights to the series, weren't willing to spend more <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> already had on failed attempts (including a script by George A. Romero), Anderson convinced them to write the script, titled The Undead, on spec. If they liked it, he would sell it to them as a Resident Evil film; if not, he would take it elsewhere and try to make it unrelated to the games. Anderson saw the film as a prequel of sorts to the first game in the series, and as such didn't put any characters from the games in it, a fact which was criticized by fans. Instead, the film stars Milla Jovovich as an original character named Alice. Jovovich, who is the only actor that reprised her role in all six films of the series, began dating with Anderson after the two met on this film, and they eventually had children and got married together. In comparison to Anderson's previous two films, Resident Evil was produced on a moderate budget of $33 million and became a commercial success of little over $100 million at the box office. The film also performed strongly on home video. Critically Resident Evil wasn't received well, although, similarly to Mortal Kombat, some reviews characterized it as one of the better attempts at adapting a video game. It received the fair rating of B by audiences on a Cinemascore poll. Its relative popularity made Capcom put homages to it in video games Resident Evil 4 and [...] Anderson did not direct, but he wrote, produced, and was otherwise heavily involved with the making of two sequels, [...] (2004) and [...] (2007), which completed the first of the eventual two trilogies of Resident Evil films. In these two sequels, Anderson began to introduce characters from the games, albeit in supporting roles compared to Alice. Both films received similarly negative reviews to the first, but were even bigger commercial successes.|$|E
