Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

It showcased a group of human soldiers patrolling a city at night that fell under ambush. The demo was noted for its overall realism, suspense, and visual clarity, helping to reinforce the argument advanced by Epic Games' founder Tim Sweeney for Microsoft to double the memory in the Xbox 360 from the planned 256 MB to 512 MB. This decision that would ultimately cost Microsoft tens of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> restrict the number of Xbox 360 consoles available at launch, but allowed Gears of War and many other Xbox 360 games to run at 720p resolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{next decade}} brought the United States Football League (USFL), which played its {{season in the}} spring instead of autumn. After three seasons of play during which it never had {{the same number of}} teams and many franchises moved, it also filed an {{antitrust}} suit it had brought against the NFL. Seeking hundreds of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> damages, USFL v. NFL centered around the NFL's television contracts, and in addition to the financial damages, it also sought to invalidate the league's contracts with {{at least one of the}} Big Three television networks that dominated U.S. TV at the time. The jury concluded that the NFL was indeed violating antitrust laws but refused to tear up the broadcast contracts (noting that a last-ditch effort to move the league's season to autumn forced out numerous major market teams that would have made a television package more appealing) and only awarded a token $3 judgment in the USFL's favor. The failure to secure either objective in the lawsuit, coupled with mounting debts, prompted the USFL to cease operations.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{container}} manufacture in {{the developed}} world is a mature market business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009. The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical glass furnace holds hundreds of tonnes of molten glass, and so it is simply not practical to shut it down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost tens of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>and</b> require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and {{the fact that there are}} usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4- to 12-week term and over the 24- to 48-month-long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1–2 million people. A typical factory will produce 1–3 million containers a day.|$|E

If you ain’t gettin money, then you ain't got nothin for me", and asks, [...] "Where yo Boss at?" [...] After singing the third verse and the chorus for the third time, Beyoncé adopts her initial chipmunked vocals to end the song, chanting, [...] "I'm a, I'm a, a diva".|$|E

I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you see yourself in the world…from a very hard time in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities."
