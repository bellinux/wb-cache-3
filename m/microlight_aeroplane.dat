40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method by which, {{without the use}} of external personnel or equipment, take-off and landing distances of an aeroplane may be estimated. An error analysis for the method, allowing determination of outcome accuracy, is also shown. The method is validated through use of flight test results from two certification programmes: one on a light aeroplane, and one on a <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplane...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{stall and}} {{immediately}} post-stall behaviour of a <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplane</b> are {{shown to be}} a function of the deceleration rate prior to the stall; therefore, it is necessary to use a representative deceleration rate when determining the acceptability of stall and post-stall handling qualities. This research has found means by which the range of deceleration rates likely to be seen in a particular type can be estimated, so that flight test programmes can ensure these rates are included, and thus aircraft are confirmed to have acceptable stalling characteristics. Recommendations are made towards the use of this research for all aircraft type, and of further work which might usefully be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Following a fatal {{accident}} in 1997 and identification of common patterns in several (usually fatal) previous accidents the AAIB (United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch) asked the BMAA (British Microlight Aircraft Association) {{to pursue a}} course of investigation into the tumble mode, which had been attributed as {{the primary cause of}} that {{fatal accident}}. The tumble mode is a peculiarity of weightshift controlled aircraft - that is flexwing microlights and hang-gliders. It is a departure from controlled flight leading to a nose-down pitch autorotation: pitch rates of 400 °/s are known. When a tumble occurs in a <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplane,</b> it is rare for the crew to survive and loss of the aircraft is universal...|$|E
5000|$|The BMAA administers all weightshift {{controlled}} <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> in the United Kingdom, all regulated powered parachute microlights, and a {{large proportion}} of 3-axis controlled <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> including all [...] "factory built" [...] microlights. The Light Aircraft Association is an equivalent organisation which administers a proportion of the amateur built <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cantilever low-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit, fixed {{conventional landing gear}} or optionally tricycle landing gear, a T-tail and a single engine in tractor configuration.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} four alternative sets {{of actions}} that a pilot may use to recover an aeroplane from the stall. These actions: those {{published by the}} UK CAA and the US FAA, {{as well as a}} power delayed sequence and a pitch delayed sequence, were evaluated on 14 single engine piston aeroplane types. In a limited number of types (five in cruise configuration, two in landing configuration) the pitch delayed recovery gave a safe response and least height loss, but in a greater number of types (six and eight in cruise and landing configurations respectively) it resulted in further post-stall uncommanded motion. The other sets of actions all gave a consistent recovery from the stall, but the least height loss in recovery was also consistently the CAA sequence of simultaneous full power and nose-down pitching input, which normally resulted in approximately two thirds the height loss of the FAA’s pitch first then power method, which in turn resulted in about 90 % of the height loss of the trialled power delayed recovery. Additionally the CAA recovery gave the least variation in height loss during stall recovery. It was also found that all of the aeroplane types evaluated except for one <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplane</b> of unusual design, displayed a pitch-up with increased power in the normal (pre-stall) flight regime. Reducing this to separate components it was therefore shown that pitch control is of primary importance and should be used to provide immediate stall recovery. The thrust control can additionally be used as early as possible to minimise height loss, but if the thrust control is used before the pitch control in the stall or post-stall flight regime, there is some risk of subsequent loss of control. Finally, from the discussion on stall recovery methods, questions for Regulatory Authorities are put forward that should address the current practices...|$|E
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{evaluation of}} the airworthiness of a manned aircraft is vitally important, regardless of the size or function of the aircraft. However, the methods used in light and particularly microlight aircraft certification were largely based upon rules of thumb or methods better suited to larger, higher energy, aircraft programmes. A programme of research {{has been carried out}} to develop means by which microlight aircraft certification could be carried out appropriately to this class of aircraft. The stall and immediately post-stall behaviour of an aircraft are shown to be a function of the deceleration rate prior to the stall; therefore it is necessary to use a representative deceleration rate when determining the acceptability of stall and post-stall handling qualities.

Weightshift controlled <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> using a Rogallo type wing, rarely show a conventional (square law) relationship between stalling speed and loading; the reason being identified as aeroelastic deformation of the wing with loading. A means by which stalling speed may be estimated for such aircraft at a variety of loadings has been developed. This will allow designers the maximum flexibility in determining operating limits and shows how the stall speed at various flight conditions may be predicted in aircraft operating documentation. The spin is a serious and potentially fatal mode of flight; a spinning evaluation, even for non-aerobatic aeroplanes, is therefore essential. A best practice has been developed and tested for the spin-resistance or spinning evaluation of <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> including equipment, aircraft and crew preparation, and reporting.

The tumble mode is a little known mode of departure from controlled flight experienced by weightshift controlled <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b> It has been a very significant factor in fatal accident records, being non-recoverable without the use of external safety devices. The mode consists of a nose-down autorotation at a rate of up to 400 °/s. The tumble entry mechanism is explained, and advice to operators developed which should prevent tumble entry. Evidence is shown {{of the nature of the}} developed tumble – both modelled and through wind tunnel results, which explain how the autorotation occurs. It is also shown how this theory may be applied during testing of an aircraft to develop a tumble resistant aircraft. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The tumble mode is a {{pitching}} departure from controlled flight {{which leads to}} a pitch autorotation that is generally unrecoverable – resulting in vertical ground impact, usually preceded by in-flight breakup (the mechanism for which, surprisingly, can sometimes prevent loss of life). This was identified in work led by the British Microlight Aircraft Association beginning in 1997 as a response to a number of fatal accidents in Rogallo winged <b>microlight</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> although the tumble is also known to occur to hang-gliders. This paper explains how this class of aeroplane is controlled, and how it has been found that they can enter the tumble mode. The mechanism by which the tumble can be entered is described. This has led to work showing how flight testing can be used to establish and demonstrate resistance to tumble entry – particularly important with increasing number of very high performance flexwings. These flight tests will be explained, together with the significance of the results. Recent accident investigation work has also shown a new mechanism of tumble entry, through partial failure of the A-frame structure and the pitch-trimmer mechanism. Also described is a possible relevance to well known historical accidents to flying wing aeroplanes – specifically the YB- 49 and dH- 108, and discovered data on the characteristics of the BKB- 1 flying wing glider; are also described...|$|R

50|$|The {{single most}} common class of {{aircraft}} is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, {{but the main}} area of growth over the last 20 years {{has been in the}} use of more affordable aircraft, such as <b>microlights,</b> amateur built <b>aeroplanes,</b> and smaller helicopters. The most important recent developments for small aircraft been the introduction of advanced avionics (including GPS) that were formerly found only in large airliners, and the introduction of composite materials to make small aircraft lighter and faster. Ultralight and homebuilt aircraft have also become increasingly popular for recreational use, since in most countries that allow private aviation they are much less expensive than certified aircraft.|$|R

There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes £1.4 billion to the UK economy.|$|R
