5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative <b>metal</b> <b>fittings.</b> Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
25|$|Providences {{last years}} were spent tied up at Briggs Wharf, Newport. In {{the autumn of}} 1901, the vessel was sold for scrap and towed to Boston for dismantling. After the removal of her {{furnishings}} and machinery, Providence suffered the typical fate of wooden steamers of her time by being hauled onto a beach and burned in order to recover the remaining brass, copper, and other <b>metal</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A grease fitting, grease nipple, Zerk fitting, or Alemite <b>fitting</b> is a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> used in {{mechanical}} systems to feed lubricants, usually lubricating grease, into a bearing under moderate to high pressure using a grease gun.|$|R
50|$|Stuntman Louis Tomei was {{doubling}} for Robinson {{in a fight}} {{scene on}} a motorboat that marked {{the climax of the}} movie. He was hurled against a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> on the boat and received a severe head injury. He died in hospital later that night.|$|R
40|$|Finite Element Analysis {{is carried}} out for the rear fitting {{assembly}} of the co-cured composite fin for LCA. The components of the assembly are the <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> and CFC root of the torsion box which are connected by bolted joints. The stress distribution around the bolt holes, which are of particular interest, are presented in detail and discussed...|$|R
25|$|Parchment is also {{extremely}} {{affected by}} its environment {{and changes in}} humidity, which can cause buckling. Books with parchment pages were bound with strong wooden boards and clamped tightly shut by metal (often brass) clasps or leather straps; this acted to keep the pages pressed flat despite humidity changes. Such <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> continued to be found on books as decorative features even after the use of paper made them unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|All {{the members}} of the crew survived the shipwreck, it being so close to the sandy beach and dry land, but the clipper herself was a total loss. Right after the incident, {{what was left of the}} wrecked clipper was offered up for auction. The {{remnants}} were bought for $1,050 by a San Francisco businessman named John Molloy, who was able to salvage <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> and sails from the destroyed clipper. The rest of the wreck was blown up and abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Running {{water was}} {{supplied}} in lead pipes, {{and where there}} were taps they were bronze, although in most cases in England <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> have been removed since {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. The monks' towels were kept nearby in cupboards called aumbries (derived from the Latin armarium or from Medieval Latin almarium). The Refectorian was responsible for keeping the lavatorium clean and ensuring it contained sand and a whetstone for the monks to sharpen their knives, and for changing the towels twice a week.|$|E
50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> {{where the}} blade enters the leather or metal {{scabbard}} {{is called the}} throat, which is often {{part of a larger}} scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which, on both leather and metal scabbards, is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.|$|R
40|$|Glass or ceramic tubes {{out-of-round}} sealed effectively {{by ordinary}} O-rings in caps of modified hydraulic fittings. In typical connection, O-ring squeezed between two surfaces having inward-opening slants of 5 degrees or 10 degrees. Slanted surfaces force ring inward, compressing it around tube. Connector <b>metal</b> <b>fitting,</b> tightened by hand around O-ring, seals O-ring against tube {{as much as}} 1 / 16 in. out of round. Modified connectors seal glass or ceramic tubes against gas or vacuum leakage in furnaces, vacuum systems, and tubes for glassblowing equipment...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vibration}} of the rod {{with greater}} amplitude and weaker pressure is transmitted into the <b>metal</b> <b>fitting.</b> This causes a {{transformation in the}} vibrations and {{the shape of the}} wave produced. The vibrations propagating through the metal have a high pressure and a weak amplitude. This amplification in pressure is the result of fiberglass cones that are fixed in a wood frame alongside a tall, cut-out metal part {{in the shape of a}} flame. [...] "Whiskers," [...] placed on the side of the instrument, amplify high-pitched sounds.|$|R
25|$|A second G.P. was built, {{which was}} {{structurally}} stronger {{through the use}} of heavier gauge <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> and a revised structure, with power supplied by two Rolls-Royce 190hp engines (later to be renamed Falcon) driving handed four-bladed propellers in similar fashion to the first aircraft. Other changes included four ailerons, one on each wing, instead of just the upper mainplanes, engine nacelles raised clear of the lower mainplanes and scalloped trailing edges {{through the use of}} steel wire trailing edge members, (a retrograde step as the wire corroded quickly causing damage to the fabric covering).|$|E
25|$|A {{main source}} for the {{construction}} of racing bigae is a number of bronze figurines found throughout the Roman Empire, a particularly detailed example of which is held by the British Museum. Other sources are reliefs and mosaics. These show a lightweight frame, to which a minimal shell of fabric or leather was lashed. The center of gravity was low, and the wheels were relatively small, around 65cm in diameter in proportion to a body 60cm wide and 55cm deep, with a breastwork of about 70cm in height. The wheels may have been rimmed with iron, but otherwise <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> are kept to a minimum. The design facilitated speed, maneuverability and stability.|$|E
500|$|Two secular small chests with carved {{whalebone}} {{panels and}} <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> illustrate {{some aspects of}} the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with [...] "simple decorations of fleurons and debased egg and dart" [...] while the whalebone panels are carved in relief with a late form of Insular interwoven strapwork characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.|$|E
25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed {{in the pocket}} of his topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, the object is found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|R

5000|$|The {{configuration}} of the typical opium pipe consists of a long stem, a ceramic pipe-bowl, and a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting,</b> known as the [...] "saddle", through which the pipe-bowl plugs into the pipe-stem. The pipe-bowl must be detachable from the stem due to the necessity to remove the bowl and scrape its insides clean of opium ash after several pipes have been smoked. The stems of opium pipes were usually made from bamboo, but other materials such as ivory and silver were used. Pipe-bowls were typically a type of ceramic, such as blue and white porcelain. Sometimes opium pipe-bowls were carved from more valuable materials such as jade.|$|R
2500|$|The use of coffins was {{practical}} when a {{body had}} to be transported some distance prior to its burial. Typically made of wood, {{in a number of}} excavated cases [...] for instance at York Minster [...] they also included <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> and locks.|$|E
2500|$|The Air Camper was {{designed}} to be built of spruce and plywood. One of Pietenpol's goals was to create a plane that was affordable and easy to construct for home builders. Building an Air Camper requires basic woodworking skills and tools. Builders also need to fabricate some <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> to attach the wooden parts together. Some welding is required. The plans for the Pietenpol Aircamper were originally published in a four-part serial in the [...] "Flying and Glider" [...] Manual of 1932-33.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was when}} John M. bought out Henry's {{share of the}} business. Henry was deeply {{religious}} and had qualms about building military equipment. The Studebakers were Dunkard Brethren, conservative German Baptists, a religion that viewed war as evil. Longstreet's official company history simply says [...] "Henry was tired of the business. He wanted to farm. The risks of expanding were not for him". Expansion continued from manufacture of wagons for westward migration, {{as well as for}} farming and general transportation. During the height of westward migration and wagon train pioneering, half of the wagons used were Studebakers. They made about a quarter of them, and manufactured the <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> for other builders in Missouri for another quarter-century.|$|E
50|$|In earlier times, {{the mill}} made tools and {{components}} for other mills, {{as well as}} hammers, wagon parts, <b>metal</b> tyres, <b>fittings,</b> anvils, surface plates, wagon axles and - usually in summer when the water level was low - horseshoe nails.|$|R
25|$|Scabbard: The scabbard, {{also known}} as the sheath, is a {{protective}} cover often provided for the sword blade. Over the millennia, scabbards have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which on both leather and metal scabbards is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.|$|R

2500|$|In late Roman Gaul and Britain cingula or belts {{decorated}} with <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> were worn {{as signs of}} rank by both soldiers and civilian officials. [...] One {{theory is that the}} style was produced by goldsmiths trained in late Roman provincial traditions working for Germanic clients, certainly after and perhaps also before the departure of the Roman legions and the end of Roman rule in Britain in 410 or thereabouts. [...] The style and forms are very different from contemporary continental Germanic ones, and the contexts of the various finds seem to allow for both the possibilities that Germanic owners were adopting some Romano-British cultural habits, and that Romano-British owners of objects were adopting partially Anglo-Saxon ones {{in the first years of}} the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The wing {{contained}} metal {{framed and}} skinned ailerons, but the flaps {{were made of}} wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts. Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction. The outer leading wing edge had to be brought [...] further forward to accommodate this design. The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder and elevator, were aluminium framed and fabric covered. The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Atlantic {{had some}} {{similarity}} {{to the earlier}} Boulton & Paul Bourges and indeed some structural commonality, for the Bourges Mk 1B was cannibalised to produce {{the first of two}} Atlantics. [...] Though Boulton & Paul were beginning to think about metal framed aircraft, the Atlantic was traditionally built from wood, albeit with many <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> and joints. [...] It was a three-bay twin-engined biplane with wings that were neither staggered nor swept and were of parallel chord, though the lower wing was narrower than the upper. [...] Ailerons were fitted on both wings and as on the Bourges their horn balances projected beyond the wingtips. [...] The two 450hp (336kW) Napier Lion water-cooled engines were mounted on top of the lower wings just inside the innermost interplane struts. [...] They were cooled with a retractable radiator mounted under the fuselage between the undercarriage legs. [...] The fin and horn balanced rudder had a near-circular profile, but the tailplane was quite rectangular, carrying unbalanced elevators. [...] The [...] tailplane incidence was adjustable from the cockpit for trim and there was a pair of ancillary fins mounted on the tailplane to hold the aircraft straight when flying on one engine. The fins could be rotated from the cockpit and locked to cope with the asymmetry.|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} impervious {{mechanical seal}} is formed between the outer {{surface of a}} tube and the inside surface of a mechanical fitting of a high pressure fluid or hydraulic system by applying a very thin soft metal layer onto the outer surface of the hard metal tube and/or inner surface of the hard <b>metal</b> <b>fitting,</b> prior to swaging the fitting onto the tube. The thickness of such thin metal layer is independent {{of the size of}} the tube and/or <b>fittings.</b> Many <b>metals</b> and alloys of those metals exhibit the requisite softness, including silver, gold, nickel, tin, platinum, indium, rhodium and cadmium. Suitably, the coating is about 0. 0025 millimeters (0. 10 mils) in thickness. After swaging, the tube and fitting combination exhibits very low leak rates on the order or 10. sup. - 8 cubic centimeters per second or less as meaured using the Helium leak test...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Military {{rotorcraft}} {{should be}} designed {{taking into account the}} condition of the fuel cell bullet impact. The internal fluid pressure, stress of <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> and fuel cell, bullet kinetic energy can be included as the design factor for the fuel cell. The best way to obtain the important design data is to conduct the verification test with actual product. But, the verification test requires huge cost and long-term effort. Moreover, there is high risk to fail because of the sever test condition. Thus, the numerical simulation is required {{to reduce the risk of}} trial-and-error together with prediction of the design data. In the present study, the bullet impact simulation based on SPH(smoothed particle hydrodynamics) is conducted with the commercial package, LS-DYNA. As the result of the numerical simulation, the internal pressure of fuel cell is calculated as 350 ∼ 360 MPa and the equivalent stress caused by hydro-ram effect i...|$|R
5000|$|Ball {{check valves}} are often very small, simple, and cheap. They are {{commonly}} used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some rubber bulbs for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High pressure HPLC pumps and similar applications commonly use small inlet and outlet ball check valves with both balls and seats made of artificial ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such check valves can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly-fitted inside a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head.|$|R

The sunset flush had faded, but the sky shone a transcendent green. The air was very clear; every wavy line of bluff was picked out in a {{wonderful}} deep blue. Muriel thought she had never seen such strength and vividness of color. Then she glanced round the long car. It was comfortable except for the jolting; the silvery gray of its cane-backed seats contrasted with the paneling of deep brown. The big lamps and <b>metal</b> <b>fittings</b> gleamed with nickel. All the girl saw connected her with luxurious civilization, and she wondered with a stirring of curiosity what awaited her in the wilds, where man still grappled with nature in primitive fashion.|$|E
