40|$|Two virus strains were {{isolated}} from the central nervous systems of two fatal human cases during an epidemic of encephalomyelitis in Austria. Monkeys, mice, and chick embryos proved susceptible; rabbits and guinea-pigs were refractory. The experimental disease in monkeys was characterized by acute <b>meningo-encephalomyelitis,</b> which was localized particularly in the grey matter of the brain stem, the cerebellum, the medulla, and the anterior horns of the spinal cord. The virus produced discrete lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo. In monkeys, viraemia was demonstrated {{for a period of}} at least 6 - 8 days before the development of the clinical illness...|$|E
40|$|In May 2013, {{the first}} cases of Australian bat {{lyssavirus}} infections in domestic animals {{were identified in}} Australia. Two horses (filly-H 1 and gelding-H 2) were infected with the Yellow-bellied sheathtail bat (YBST) variant of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV). The horses presented with neurological signs, pyrexia and progressing ataxia. Intra-cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Negri bodies) were detected in some Purkinje neurons in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections from the brain {{of one of the}} two infected horses (H 2) by histological examination. A morphological diagnosis of sub-acute moderate non-suppurative, predominantly angiocentric, <b>meningo-encephalomyelitis</b> of viral aetiology was made. The presumptive diagnosis of ABLV infection was confirmed by the positive testing of the affected brain tissue from (H 2) in a range of laboratory tests including fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and real-time PCR targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Retrospective testing of the oral swab from (H 1) in the real-time PCR also returned a positive result. The FAT and immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed an abundance of ABLV antigen throughout the examined brain sections. ABLV was isolated from the brain (H 2) and oral swab/saliva (H 1) in the neuroblastoma cell line (MNA). Alignment of the genome sequence revealed a 97. 7 % identity with the YBST ABLV strain...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{report the}} results of pathological, virological and PCR {{examinations}} carried out on 35 mute swans (Cygnus olor), which succumbed to a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H 5 N 1) infection during an outbreak in Southern Hungary. The most frequently observed macroscopic lesions included haemorrhages under the epicardium, in the proventricular and duodenal mucosa and pancreas; focal necrosis in the pancreas; myocardial degeneration; acute mucous enteritis; congestion of the spleen and lung and the accumulation of sero-mucinous exsudate in the body cavity. Histopathological lesions comprised lymphocytic <b>meningo-encephalomyelitis</b> accompanied by gliosis and occasional perivascular haemorrhages; multi-focal myocardial necrosis with lympho-histiocytic infiltration; pancreatitis with focal necrosis; acute desquamative mucous enteritis; lung congestion and oedema; oedema of the tracheal mucosa and in young birds, the atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius {{as a result of}} lymphocyte depletion and apoptosis. The observed lesions and the moderate to good body conditions were compatible with findings in acute HPAI infections of other bird species reported in the literature. Skin lesions and lesions typical for infections caused by strains of lower pathogenicity (LPAI) like emaciation or fibrinous changes in the reproductive and respiratory organs, sinuses and airsacs were not observed. The H 5 N 1 subtype avian influenza virus was isolated in embryonated fowl eggs from all cases and it was identified by classical and molecular virological methods. These results were confirmed by the analyses carried out at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency, Weybridge...|$|E
