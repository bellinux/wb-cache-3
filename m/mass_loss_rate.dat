40|$|We {{develop a}} model for the wind {{properties}} of cool main-sequence stars, which comprises their wind ram pressures, mass fluxes, and terminal wind velocities. The wind properties are determined through a polytropic magnetised wind model, assuming power laws for the dependence of the thermal and magnetic wind parameters on the stellar rotation rate. We use empirical data to constrain theoretical wind scenarios, which are characterised by different rates of increase of the wind temperature, wind density, and magnetic field strength. Scenarios based on moderate rates of increase yield wind ram pressures in agreement with most empirical constraints, but cannot account for some moderately rotating targets, whose high apparent <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> are inconsistent with observed coronal X-ray and magnetic properties. For fast magnetic rotators, the magneto-centrifugal driving of the outflow can produce terminal wind velocities far in excess of the surface escape velocity. Disregarding this aspect in the analyses of wind ram pressures leads to overestimations of stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rates.</b> The predicted <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> of cool main-sequence stars do not exceed about ten times the solar value. Our results are in contrast with previous investigations, which found a strong increase of the stellar <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> with the coronal X-ray flux.

We evaluate the steady-state structures of the photoevaporative winds by coupling temperature estimates obtained with a PDR code with 1 D radial hydrodynamical equations. We also consider the impact of dust dragging and grain growth on the final <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rates.</b> We find that these winds are much more significant than have been appreciated hitherto when grain growth is included in the modelling: in particular, <b>mass</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rates</b> > 1 e- 8 M_sun/yr are predicted even for modest background field strengths (~ 30 G_ 0) in the case of discs that extend to R > 150 AU.

The radial profiles of observable quantities (in particular surface density, temperature and velocity patterns) indicate that these winds have characteristic features that are now potentially observable with ALMA.
