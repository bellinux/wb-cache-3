A {{critical}} point for optimization of the inductive coil design {{that can be}} applied to the cleaner rheological forming (CRF) process is to verify the correct relationship between coil length and billet length. <b>Multi-power</b> induction heating (with rapid change of the power) inevitably involves the existence of a temperature gradient between the billet periphery (over-heated) and core. It is indispensable to adopt a power-time heating pattern for the complete melting of eutectic at the core with limited overheating at the periphery. Typically, high power is used for the rapid reheating of the billet to the eutectic temperature range (approximately 10 ℃ lower than eutectic temperature) and low power for the remelting of the desired liquid fraction and for the radial homogenization of the liquid fraction. So, in the present study, the optimal induction coil of the <b>multi-power</b> induction heating system (for cleaner rheological forming, 60 Hz) to achieve the globular microstructure for a variety of the cleaner rheological material was designed and manufactured.

In <b>multi-power</b> RSA, the modulus is chosen as N = prq, where r ≥ 2. Building on Coppersmith’s method of ﬁnding small roots of polynomials, Boneh and Durfee show a very crucial result (a small private exponent attack) for standard RSA. According to this study, N = pq can be factored in polynomial time in log N when d < N 0. 292. In 2014, Sarkar improve the existing small private exponent attacks on <b>multi-power</b> RSA for r ≤ 5. He shows that one can factor N in polynomial time in log N if d < N 0. 395 for r = 2. Extending the ideas in Sarkar’s work, we develop a new partial key exposure attack on <b>multi-power</b> RSA. Prior knowledge of least signiﬁcant bits (LSBs) of the private exponent d is required to realize this attack. Our result is a generalization of Sarkar’s result, and his result {{can be seen as a}} corollary of our result. Our attack has the following properties: the required known part of LSBs becomes smaller in the size of the public exponent e and it works for all exponents e (resp. d) when the exponent d (resp. e) has full-size bit length. For practical validation of our attack, we demonstrate several computer algebra experiments. In the experiments, we use the LLL algorithm and Gröbner basis computation. We achieve to obtain better experimental results than our theoretical result indicates for some cases.

To provide a high quality {{power delivery}} system with dynamically changing voltages and transient currents, the on-chip power needs to be regulated in real time, within each power domain.

This work presents a novel on-board solution for a robust, accurate and self-calibrating soil moisture and nutrient sensor with inbuilt wireless transmission and reception capability that makes it ideally suited {{to act as a}} node in a network spread over a large area. The sensor works on the principle of soil impedance measurement by comparing the amplitude and phase of signals incident on and reflected from the soil in proximity of the sensor. The permittivity of the soil dielectric mixture which is calculated from these impedance measurements is used as input parameter to the dielectric mixing models which are used to estimate the ionic concentration in soil. The inbuilt wireless transceiver system is connected to a specially designed metamaterial inspired small antenna {{in order to reduce the}} sensor size while keeping the path losses to a minimum by using a low frequency. This composite right-left handed (CRLH) antenna for wireless transmission at 433 MHz doubles up as an underground, sensing element (external capacitor) and integrates with the on-board sensor for soil moisture and nutrient determination. The input impedance of the CRLH sensor, surrounded by the soil containing moisture and nutrient and other ions, is measured at multiple frequencies.

40|$|Although many {{nondestructive}} {{techniques have}} been applied to detect disbonds in adhesive joints, no absolutely reliable nondestructive method has been developed to detect poor adhesion and evaluate the strength of bonded joints prior to the present work which used nonlinear ultrasonic methods to investigate adhesive bond cure conditions. Previously, a variety of linear and nonlinear ultrasonic methods with water coupling {{had been used to}} study aluminum-adhesive-aluminum laminates, prepared under different adhesive curing conditions, for possible bond strength determination. Therefore, {{in the course of this}} research effort, a variety of finite-amplitude experimental methods which could possibly differentiate various cure conditions were investigated, including normal and oblique incidence approaches based on nonlinear harmonic generation as well as several non-collinear two-wave interaction approaches. Test samples were mechanically scanned in various ways with respect to the focus of a transmitting transducer operated at several variable excitation frequencies and excitation levels. Even when powerful sample-related resonances were exploited by means of a frequency scanning approach, it was very difficult to isolate the nonlinear characteristics of adhesive bonds. However, a multi-frequency <b>multi-power</b> approach was quite successful and reliable. Ultrasonic tone burst signals at increasing power levels, over a wide frequency range, were transmitted through each bond specimen to determine its excitation dependent nonlinear harmonic resonance behavior. Relative amplitude changes were observed particularly in the higher harmonic spectral data and analyzed using a local displacement and strain analysis in the linear approximation. Two analysis approaches of the excitation-dependent data at specific resonances were found to be quite promising. One of these approaches may represent a very robust algorithm for classifying an adhesive bond as being properly cured or not. Another approach, in addition to differentiation between various cure conditions, may even provide information with respect to the bond strength.

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} a novel {{electricity demand}} response method {{and renewable energy}} management technique. It demonstrated the use of flow batteries and residential hot water heaters to balance wind power deviation from plan. The electricity supply-demand balancing problem becomes increasingly more difficult. A large portion of complexity to this problem {{comes from the fact}} that most renewable energy sources are inherently hard to control and intermittent. The increasing amount of renewable energy generation makes scientists research new supply-demand balancing possibilities to adapt for the changes. In this research wind power data was used in most cases to represent the supply side. The focus is on the actual generation deviation from plan, i. e. forecasting error. On the other hand, the methods developed in this thesis are not limited to wind power balancing. Two major approaches were analysed - heating ventilation and air conditioning system control (mainly focused on, but not limited to, residential hot water heaters) and hybrid power system comprising of thermal and hydro power plants together with utility scale flow batteries. These represent the consumption side or the demand response mechanism. The first approach focused on modelling the behaviour of residential end users. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques such as neural networks and Box-Jenkins methodology were used to learn and predict energy usage. Both joint and individual dwelling behaviour was considered. Model predictive control techniques were then used to send the exact real-time price and observe the change in electricity consumption. Also, novel individual hot water heater controllers were modelled with the ability to forecast and look ahead the required energy, while responding to electricity grid imbalance. It proved to be possible to balance the generation and increase system efficiency while maintaining user satisfaction. For the second approach, the hybrid <b>multi-power</b> plant system was exploited. Three different power sources were modelled, namely thermal power plant, hydro power pant and flow battery. These sources were ranked by the ability to rapidly change the output of electricity. The power that needs to be balanced was then routed to different power units according to their response times. The calculation of the best power dispatch is proposed using a cost function. The aim of this research was to accommodate for the wind power imbalance without sacrificing the health of the power plants (minimising load variations for sensitive units) ...|$|E
