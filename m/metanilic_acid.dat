40|$|For {{the first}} time, poly (o-anisidine-co-metanilic acid) (PASM) was {{deposited}} on mild steel substrate by electrochemical polymerization of o-anisidine and <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid</b> monomers {{in aqueous solution}} of 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4. The electrochemical polymerization of o-anisidine {{takes place in the}} presence of <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid</b> monomer and uniform, strongly adherent coating was obtained on the substrate. The electroactivity of copolymerwas studied by cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance techniques. There is an increasing anodic current due to oxidation of <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid</b> monomer at the surface of the electrode when the applied potential is cycled from − 0. 2 V to 0. 8 V. These deposits were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV–vis and TG/DTA techniques. The effect of various concentrations of PASM copolymer solution in acid rain corrosive media has been studied through potentiodynamic polarization, AC impedance and I–E curvemethods. The soluble form of polymeric solution provided better anti-corrosive behavior in artificial acid rain solution...|$|E

40|$|Several model {{azo dyes}} are reductively cleaved by growing {{cultures}} of an ascomycete yeast species, Issatchenkia occidentalis. In liquid media containing 0. 2 mM dye and 2 % glucose in a mineral salts base, more than 80 % of the dyes are removed in 15 h, essentially under microaerophilic conditions. Under anoxic conditions, decolorization does not occur, {{even in the}} presence of pregrown cells. Kinetic assays of azo reduction activities in quasi-resting cells demonstrated the following: (i) while the optimum pH depends on dye structure, the optimum pH range was observed in the acidic range; (ii) the maximum decolorizing activity occurs in the late exponential phase; and (iii) the temperature profile approaches the typical bell-shaped curve. These results indirectly suggest the involvement of an enzyme activity in azo dye reduction. The decolorizing activity of I. occidentalis is still observed, although at a lower level, when the cells switch to aerobic respiration at the expense of ethanol after glucose exhaustion in the culture medium. Decolorization ceased when all the ethanol was consumed; this observation, along with other lines of evidence, suggests that azo dye reduction depends on cell growth. Anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonate, a redox mediator, enhances the reduction rates of the N,N-dimethylaniline- based dyes and reduces those of the 2 -naphthol-based dyes, an effect which seems to be compatible with a thermodynamic factor. The dye reduction products were tested as carbon and nitrogen sources. 1 -Amino- 2 -naphthol was used as a carbon and nitrogen source, and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine was used only as a nitrogen source. Sulfanilic and <b>metanilic</b> <b>acids</b> did not support growth either as a carbon or nitrogen source. Bioefectex...|$|R

40|$|A poly(o-anisidine-co-metanilic acid) /activated carbon {{composite}} is evaluated {{as an active}} material for electrochemical supercapacitors. Poly(o-anisidine-co-metanilic acid) (PASM) is potentiodynamically deposited on an activated carbon (AC) -coated stainless-steel substrate, in a supporting electrolyte of 1. 0 M H 2 SO 4 containing dissolved o-anisidine and <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid,</b> at a sweep rate of 50 mVs− 1. Scanning electron micrographs show a uniformly deposited, thick PASM film on the activated carbon. Electrochemical techniques, such as impedance analysis, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic experiments, are carried out to investigate the suitability of the PASM/AC electrode for supercapacitor applications.

40|$|Abstract A {{bacterial}} consortium {{was constructed}} using five different bacterial strains {{isolated from the}} effluent {{with the ability to}} degrade Acid Blue, a diazo dye. These organisms were identified as Pseudomonas putida (2 strains-designated as A & B), Bacillus subtillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains) using 16 S rRNA analysis. The consortium was found to degrade 90 % of the dye by 22 h in 80 % diluted textile effluent supplemented with glucose and ammonium nitrate. Optimization studies using Response Surface Methodology have confirmed that the degradation process was predominantly influenced by agitation and pH where as glucose was found to have negative effect. TLC analyses indicated the presence of <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and peri acid in 24 h sample which disappeared by 48 h. The GC-MS analysis has confirmed the presence of methyl salicylic acid, catechol and β-ketoadipic acid with the RT values of 7. 71, 10. 88 and 15. 04 respectively confirming the complete degradation of Acid Blue...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{anaerobic}} and aerobic bacterial species {{are known to}} decolourise azo dyes through {{the reduction of the}} azo bonds, forming the corresponding amines. In this work, we describe improved decolourisation conditions for model azo dyes by the ascomycete yeast Candida zeylanoides. The dyes were derived from the diazonium salts of metanilic and sulfanilic acids and N,N-dimethylaniline or 2 -naphthol as coupling components. Total decolourisation times observed in culture media supplemented with 0. 2 mM dye ranged from 40 go 60 hours. The initial decolourisation rates were 14 - 52 µmol. (g dry cell) -¹. h-¹, depending on dye structure. In the course of decolourisation either <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid</b> or sulfanilic acid were detected in the supernatant fluid, showing that decolourization by this yeast strain is due to azo bond reduction. None of those aminobenzenesulphonates supported microorganism growth as carbon and energy source but both could be used, to a limited extent, as nitrogen sources. The azo reductase activity is not significantly affected by pre-adaptation of the microorganism to the dyes.

40|$|All {{chemicals}} were {{reagent grade}} and {{were used as}} received without further purification. Water was purified with an Auto-Still WG- 22 system (Yamato Co.) and used within a few hours. Aqueous electrolyte solutions were prepared from the distilled water. The PPTA films were electrodeposited using the method described by Yamasaki et al. 3 A conventional three-electrode system was employed for the oxidative electropolymerization of <b>metanilic</b> <b>acid</b> and electrochemi-cal measurements. The test electrode on which the PPTA film was electrodeposited was a transparent indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass plate 0. 8 cm wide and 5 cm long. The ITO plate was cut from a large ITO glass plate (1 mm thick) supplied by Nippon Sheet Glass Co. The surface electrical resistance was 30 W cm- 2. Prior to use, the ITO plate electrode was cleaned in water with ultrasonic waves. A silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl) {{was used as the}} reference electrode and a Pt plate with an electrode area of about 8 cm 2 was used as the counter electrode. Electrolyses were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (model HA- 301, Hokuto Denko Co.) with a potential scanner (model HB- 104, Hokuto Denko Co.).
