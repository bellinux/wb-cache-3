5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous <b>muscular</b> <b>effort.</b> S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E

25|$|When push-points are absent, {{but there}} is not enough space to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on {{concertina}} locomotion. In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens. The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of locomotion is slow and very demanding, up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance. This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active <b>muscular</b> <b>effort</b> to brace against the tunnel walls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Robot-aided gait {{training}} {{can increase the}} duration and number of training sessions while {{reducing the number of}} therapists required for each patient. However, current auto-mated gait trainers do not adapt their movement to the patient’s <b>muscular</b> <b>efforts</b> and passive musculoskeletal properties. Fur-thermore, robot-aided training without therapists lacks the feedback required for patient assessment. In this article, we present results from the literature and our research to provide an overview of novel human-centered strategies for robot behaviors that are patient-cooperative and support motor-function assessment. Combining robot-aided training with robot-aided assessment will likely make future gait therapy easier, more comfortable, and more efficient. Broad clinical testing is still required for proving this assumption.

2500|$|The force {{produced}} by a single motor unit is determined {{in part by the}} number of muscle fibers in the unit. Another important determinant of force is the frequency with which the muscle fibers are stimulated by their innervating axon. The rate at which the nerve impulses arrive is known as the motor unit firing rate and may vary from frequencies low enough to produce a series of single twitch contractions to frequencies high enough to produce a fused tetanic contraction. Generally, [...] this allows a 2 to 4-fold change in force. In general, the motor unit firing rate of each individual motor unit increases with increasing <b>muscular</b> <b>effort</b> until a maximum rate is reached. This smooths out the incremental force changes which would otherwise occur as each additional unit was recruited.|$|E

40|$|Spirometry is a {{technique}} to evaluate the pulmonary ventilatory function and {{is a reflection of}} several forces implied in lung volumes. The lung volume is dependent on the elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall and the <b>muscular</b> <b>efforts</b> of the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdomen. Contraction of the inspiratory muscles, such as the diaphragm, expands the thorax, creating an increased negative pressure. This pressure is lower than the atmospheric pressure, drawing air into the lungs. Expiration is mainly a passive process. When the muscles relax, due to elastic recoil of the lungs, air will flow out. This process can be assisted by contraction of intercostal and abdominal wall muscles, resulting in a positive pleural pressure. Using the spirogram, several different types of lung volume can be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Work-related Musculo Skeletal Disorders (WMSD) are {{considered}} the third main reason for disability and early retirement in the U. S. and are widespread in many occupations, involving both heavy and light biomechanical loads. In Italy, only {{taking into account the}} years 2009 - 2010, it is estimated an exponential increasing in the number of WMSD reports. In particular a 159. 7 % increment has been reported compared to the 2006 statistics. In this context, it is clear how important correctly diagnosing this kind of pathology is becoming. Traditional methods for WMDS assessment are based on observational techniques, in which experts manually segment, label and evaluate movements with the help of pro-forma sheets. Since these methods are currently based on visual inspection and subjective judgment, they could benefit from objective measurements in terms of both reliability and repeatability. Moreover an automatic tool for ergonomics assessment would vastly reduce the time that an expert needs to carry out the same assessment manually. In this context a novel wearable wireless system capable of assessing the <b>muscular</b> <b>efforts</b> and postures of the human upper limb for WMSDs diagnosis is proposed. The system, being non-obstructive, can be used to monitor workers in ecologic environment while they are carrying on their everyday tasks. A real-time assessment is obtained according to two of the most common indexes for the analysis of risk factors on workplaces: the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and the Strain Index (SI). The system exploits inertial measurement units (IMUs) to reconstruct the upper limb posture, modeled as a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) kinematic chain. As far as <b>muscular</b> <b>efforts</b> are concerned, surface EMG sensors are used to assess forearm flexor muscles strain. As an example of the proposed system application the results of a first data collection campaign regarding super-market cashiers during everyday real-life operations is reported. Relevance to industry: The presented system has a high potential impact on industry as a timely intervention on the WMSD factors may reduce pathologies and reduce the recovery of expert workers.

Powered bed movers exhibited significantly lower muscle activation levels than manual pushing for the majority of muscles. When using the SBM, users adopted a more upright posture which was maintained while performing different tasks (e. g. turning a corner, entering a lift), while trunk inclination varied considerably for manual pushing and the GBM.

40|$|Running is {{typically}} performed at faster speeds than walking, and requires more <b>muscular</b> <b>efforts.</b> Because muscle forces substantially influence joint forces, the tibiofemoral (TF) joint force {{developed during the}} stance phase of running {{is expected to be}} greater than the force during walking. However, little is known about how individual muscles affect the TF joint force. Such information could be valuable for developing preventive or rehabilitation guidelines for knee joint injuries/diseases including cartilage damage and osteoarthritis that may be associated with high joint loading. Therefore, this study was aimed at identifying individual muscle contributions to the TF joint force during running. Muscle contributions to the axial TF joint force (the force component parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tibia) were computed using a muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulation of running at 2. 4 m/s. Using a ground reaction force decomposition technique [1], individual muscle contributions to ground reaction forces were first obtained. Then, only the muscle force of interest and corresponding ground reaction forces were applied to the dynamic system, and resultant axial TF joint force was computed. The simulation showed that the primary contributor to the joint force from early to mid-stance was the quadriceps. From mid- to late stance, the gastrocnemius and the hamstrings contributed to the joint force. To a lesser extent, muscles that do not cross the knee joint (the gluteus maximus and the soleus) also contributed to the TF joint force through their contributions to ground reaction forces...|$|R

40|$|The sit-to-stand (STS) is a multi-articular {{movement}} {{of daily living}} that requires significantly higher knee extensor (KE) efforts compared to ankle and hip musculature, which approach near maximal levels in older adults populations. As well, fatigue may develop more readily with repetitive actions. Consequently, it is understandable how KE strength reserves have been previously correlated with both functional independence and STS strategy characteristics in older persons, and why STS capacity is {{a significant predictor of}} disability. However, it is still unclear why compensatory movement strategies manifest when rising from a seated position, and how this may be influenced by aging. The purpose of this thesis compilation was to evaluate alterations in muscular contributions at the ankle, knee, and hip, in relation to STS performance strategies in young and older adults either: a) with repetitive multi-joint STS exercise or b) before and after isolated fatigue of KE musculature. Results showed that aging caused a redistribution of joint torques when ascending from a seated position, and was associated with significantly higher quadriceps <b>muscular</b> <b>efforts</b> in older persons in comparison to their younger counterparts. In contrast, young and older adults exhibited similar compensatory movement and loading strategies during repetitive STS exercise, which appeared to be limited by the ability to sustain KE force output. In turn, lower KE strength reserves of older persons were responsible for their disproportionately higher quadriceps efforts and reduced STS capacities. Young and older persons also appeared to employ motor strategies to compensate for reduced KE force output via increased contribution of the biarticular rectus femoris within the quadriceps KE synergy, as well as through increases in the initially less active ankle plantar flexor and hip extensor musculature. Older adults may benefit from strengthening of thigh extensor musculature to maintain or improve their strength reserves to promote independent living...|$|R
