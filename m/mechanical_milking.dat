The study involved 35 women, 18 - 39 years of age, who had given birth at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine in Niš, with normal delivery, without any complications reported. The samples of colostrum and milk were collected by <b>mechanical</b> squeezing of <b>milk</b> during three intervals: the first sample of colostrum was obtained immediately after the appearance of the first drops of milk after childbirth; the second sample was obtained after 24 hours, and the third after one month. The samples were collected in the morning, and kept in sterile test tubes in the freezer until the performance of analysis. The activity of these enzymes was reduced (statistically significant for amylase) in the period after one month, which means that it corresponded to the amount of protein. The activity of transaminases (ALT and AST) and alkaline phosphatase activity showed a tendency to fall after a month, but statistically significant difference was obtained with AST. The dynamic of alkaline phosphatase activity showed statistically significant decrease after one month. Enzyme activity in human milk represents an important field of research, from the aspect of functional importance and benefits of human milk compared to the cow’s milk, in which enzymes are generally destroyed by pasteurization.

The level of the operating vacuum in machine milking is one of the principal factors which influence the integrity of the tissues and the milk quality. High vacuum levels (> 42 kPa) are often used to facilitate the opening of the teat canal by overcoming the biological closing forces whithin the teat sphincter, but can result in severe machine-induced teat tissue damage. In this study characteristics and performances of <b>mechanical</b> <b>milking</b> at low vacuum levels have been investigated in different dairy species.

The bulk raw milk was divided in two 45 -L vats: vat 1 was used as a control, whereas 0. 5 L of jenny milk was added to vat 2. Four semihard cheeses, weighing about 2 kg each, were made from each vat. Cheese making was replicated twice. After a ripening period of 60 d, the count of coliforms and of C. butyricum was determined. In the treated group, a significant inhibition of coliform bacteria was observed. The addition of jenny milk in cheese making may prove to be a useful and innovative approach for the inhibition of spore-forming clostridia strains...|$|E
40|$|Three {{treatments}} {{were initiated}} at approximately 15 days after calving and continued for 4 weeks: 1) cows were suckled ad libitum by their calves (calf present [CP]); 2) calves were present but nonsuckling 24 hr/day and cows were milked twice daily (CR+ 2 ×M); 3) or same as CR+ 2 ×M but cows were milked five times daily (CR+ 5 ×M). Interval {{to the first}} postpartum ovulation was similar between CR+ 2 ×M and CR+ 5 ×M cows but about 2 weeks less than that in cows suckled ad libitum by their own calves. Cows in the CR+ 5 ×M treatment produced more milk than cows in the CR+ 2 ×M treatment, whereas only slight differences occurred in the percentages of milk fat, protein, lactose, and solids-not-fat. Prior to initiation of treatments, CR+ 2 × cows yielded more milk than either CR+ 5 ×M or CP cows, {{but by the end}} of 4 weeks of treatment, milk yields were similar among treatments. We conclude that <b>mechanical</b> <b>milking</b> either two or five times daily in the presence of a cow’s own nonsuckling calf fails to prolong postpartum anovulation to the extent of ad libitum suckling. However, increasing milking frequency to 5 × daily enhanced milk yield...|$|E
