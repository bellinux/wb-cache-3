5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Andes. Traditionally, {{the animal was}} reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|Poultry is {{the second}} most widely eaten type of <b>meat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, {{accounting}} for about 30% of total meat production worldwide compared to pork at 38%. Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units. Global broiler meat production rose to 84.6 million tonnes in 2013. The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%). There are two distinct models of production; the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which {{can be traced back to}} the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs of implementing additional food safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations. In contrast, the United States model turns the product into a commodity.|$|E
