500|$|Criticism {{was also}} raised {{regarding}} the relatively few convictions. Despite several people's admissions to police that they physically attacked Leigh at the party, only Wilson {{was charged with}} assault, and the adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to the party was never charged. NC1 admitted to having sex with another under-age girl at the party, though he was not charged with that offence. With {{the exception of the}} charges against Webster that were dropped without explanation, nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting Leigh in spite of the presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries. During a report on Radio National, Leigh's mother said that when she asked Detective Chaffey why others were not being charged, he asked her if she knew [...] "how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to run an investigation".|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Supreme Court {{has treated}} {{campaign}} contributions {{as a free}} speech issue.

2500|$|During a {{conflict}} {{with one of the}} theater's directors, who was said to have been less than careful about his hygiene, the director questioned Henriette about her bills regarding such things and she replied: [...] "It is easy to say, Mr Count, for someone with no idea how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to keep oneself clean and fresh!" [...] She also writes that when she complained about men and boys trying {{to take a look at}} her when she had to change during performances, this director chased them all away, but guarded her from them by observing her himself—though, she adds, he was really quite harmless. She remained neutral during the great theater strikes of 1827 and 1834.|$|E
2500|$|For the X {{television}} series director Yoshiaki Kawajiri {{decided not to}} explore his backstory early in the series {{to focus more on}} his cold demeanor. He also labeled Kamui as weak person due to how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> him to express emotions. [...] In the animated film Kamui was voiced by Tomokazu Seki. Kenichi Suzumura replaced him for the original video animation and {{television series}}. He first voiced in the OVA that acted as a prologue to the X television series. Since Kamui did not have many lines in the OVA, Suzumura lacked a full impression about him before as more of his character would explored in the television series. However, he added he found his role complicated as he understands Kamui is neither the weakest or strongest character. Voicing Kamui also meant that Suzumura debuted as a singer for an X CD.|$|E

50|$|This {{is a sort}} of a Balanced Scorecard {{approach}} in which KPIs are defined and linkages are built between causes and effects in a tree-model on top of a budgeting system which should be integrated with the transactional system, in which financial, procurement, sales and similar types of transactions are tracked. Moreover, linking resources with results provides information on how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to provide a given level of outcome. Many public bodies fail to figure out how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> to deliver an output, primarily due to problems with indirect cost allocation. This puts the Activity-Based Costing framework into the picture.|$|E
