40|$|At present, {{very little}} is known about the fate and {{perseverance}} of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> and their resistance genes in natural aquatic environments. Treated, but partly also untreated sewage of the city of Lausanne, Switzerland is discharged into Vidy bay (Lake Geneva) resulting in high levels of contamination in this part of the lake. In the present work we have studied the prevalence of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> and resistance genes in the wastewater stream of Lausanne. Samples from hospital and municipal raw sewage, treated effluent from Lausanne’s wastewater treatment plant (WTP) as well as lake water and sediment samples obtained close to the WTP outlet pipe and a remote site close to a drinking water pump were evaluated for the prevalence of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Selected isolates were identified (16 S rRNA gene fragment sequencing) and characterized with regards to further resistances, resistance genes, and plasmids. Mostly, studies investigating this issue have relied on cultivation-based approaches. However, the limitations of these tools are well known, in particular for environmental microbial communities, and cultivation-independent molecular tools should be applied in parallel in order to take non-culturable organisms into account. Here we directly quantified the sulfonamide resistance genes sul 1 and sul 2 from environmental DNA extracts using TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR. Hospital sewage contained the highest load of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> and antibiotic resistance genes. Wastewater treatment reduced the total bacterial load but evidence for selection of extremely multiresistant strains and accumulation of resistance genes was observed. Our data clearly indicated pollution of sediments with antibiotic resistance genes in the vicinity of the WTP outlet.

This study reports about in vitro {{antibacterial}} activity against <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> and in vitro cytotoxicity of polymethylmetacrylate bone cement loaded with metallic silver particles with a size of 5 – 50 nm called NanoSilver. In vitro antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was studied by microplate proliferation tests. Quantitative elution testing and qualitative ongrowth of human osteoblasts was done to study in vitro cytotoxicity. Only NanoSilver cement showed high-antibacterial activity against all strains, including MRSE and MRSA. Gentamicin cement was not effective against MRSA and MRSE due to the high-level gentamicin resistance of the tested strains. Plain cement did not inhibit proliferation of any strains. There {{was no significant difference}} regarding in vitro cytotoxicty between NanoSilver and the non-toxic control. Cytotoxicity of cement loaded with silver salts made this kind of silver unsuitable for all day clinical use in the past.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the risk factors}} in patients who had a <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> during their staying in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and in a pediatric nursery of a tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: Chart review of the patients who stayed in the units from January, 1995 to July, 1997 and had a multiresistant microorganism isolated (both infection and colonization). A case-control study was done using McNemar test for group comparison and using stepwise logistic regression to select independent risk factors. The following risk factors were tested: prior hospital staying, underlying disease, intensive care unit admission, surgical procedure, urinary catheter, central venous line, ventilator, prior antibiotic therapy and skin lesion. RESULTS: Among 52 patients, 66 <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> were identified (among them, 33 were gram-negative bacilli and 33 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus). The logistic regression analysis of the case-control study identified 2 risk factors: prior antibiotic therapy and skin lesion. A single risk factor was indicated for patients with gram-negative bacilli. Nevertheless, for patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, central venous lines and skin lesion were significant. CONCLUSION: Prior antibiotic therapy and skin lesion were the factors associated with the acquisition of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Besides skin lesion, for oxacilin-resistant S. aureus colonized patients, central venous catheter use was a risk factor.

In Western countries, {{bacterial}} infection is the principal identifiable precipitating event of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) which is associated with high short-term mortality. Bacterial translocation due to increased gut permeability and intestinal bacterial overgrowth/dysbiosis contributes mainly to the susceptibility of cirrhotic patients to develop bacterial infections. The diagnosis of bacterial infection in cirrhosis is challenging {{due to the lack of}} sensitive and specific classical clinical and biological parameters. The early diagnosis of bacterial infections and the prompt initiation of adequate antibiotic treatment are the cornerstone of management. Due to the frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and increased invasiveness of procedures, nonclassical pathogen and <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> are increasingly reported.

40|$|Mutations conferring {{resistance}} to antibiotics are typically costly {{in the absence of}} the drug, but bacteria can reduce this cost by acquiring compensatory mutations. Thus, the rate of acquisition of compensatory mutations and their effects are key for the maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistances. While compensation for single resistances has been extensively studied, compensatory evolution of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> remains unexplored. Importantly, since resistance mutations often interact epistatically, compensation of <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> may significantly differ from that of single-resistant strains. We used experimental evolution, next-generation sequencing, in silico simulations, and genome editing to compare the compensatory process of a streptomycin and rifampicin double-resistant Escherichia coli with those of single-resistant clones. We demonstrate that low-fitness double-resistant bacteria compensate faster than single-resistant strains due to the acquisition of compensatory mutations with larger effects. Strikingly, we identified mutations that only compensate for double resistance, being neutral or deleterious in sensitive or single-resistant backgrounds. Moreover, we show that their beneficial effects strongly decrease or disappear in conditions where the epistatic interaction between resistance alleles is absent, demonstrating that these mutations compensate for the epistasis. In summary, our data indicate that epistatic interactions between antibiotic resistances, leading to large fitness costs, possibly open alternative paths for rapid compensatory evolution, thereby potentially stabilizing costly multiple resistances in bacterial populations.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the possible association between the risk of development of nosocomial infections and increased daily nurse workload due to understaffing in intensive care unit. MethodsWe included 168 patients. Intensity of workload and applied procedures to patients were scored with the Project de Recherché en Nursing and the Omega scores, respectively. The criteria used for infections were those defined by the Centers for Disease Control. ResultsOf the 168 patients, 91 (54. 2 %) were female and 77 (45. 8 %) were male patients. The mean age of female and male was 64. 9 ± 6. 2 years and 63. 1 ± 11. 9 years, respectively. The mean duration of hospitalization in intensive care unit was 18. 4 ± 6. 1 days. <b>Multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> were isolated from cultures of 39 (23. 2 %) patients. The development of MRB+ infection was correlated with length of stay, Omega 1, Omega 2, Omega 3, Total Omega, daily PRN, and Total PRN (p 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Severe infections with <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> (MRB) are {{a medical}} {{challenge}} and a financial burden for hospitals. The adequate antibiotic therapy {{is a key}} issue in <b>multiresistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> management. Several major cost drivers have been identified. Remarkably drug acquisition costs are not necessarily included. Most significant are the length of stay in hospital, the hours of mechanical ventilation and the time treated on an intensive care unit. In a systematic {{review of the literature}} the following aspects were investigated: - Do generic treatment strategies contribute in cost savings? - Are there specific results for recent antibiotics? Early adequate and effective antimicrobial treatment, switch from i. v. to oral therapy, adjusted duration of therapy and adherence to guidelines {{have been found to be}} successful strategies. Looking at specific antibiotics, the best evidence for cost-effectiveness is found for Linezolid in treatment of cSSTI as well as in HAP. Daptomycin shows good economic results in bloodstream infections, so possibly being a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin. Looking at tigecycline the published data show neither higher costs nor savings compared to imipeneme. Doripenem as one of the newest therapy options has proven to be highly cost-saving in HAP when compared with imipenem. However, most analyses are based on pharmacoeconomic modelling rather than on directly analysing trial data or real life clinical populations. Conclusion Using modern antibiotics in whole is not more expensive than using established therapies. Modern antibiotics are cost-effective and sometimes even cost-saving. This is especially true if an effective therapy is initiated as early as possible. </p...|$|R
