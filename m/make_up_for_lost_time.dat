25|$|The {{speed and}} {{punctuality}} of many LB passenger services {{was the subject}} of widespread criticism in the technical and popular press during the 1890s. This was in part {{due in part to the}} complexity of the system between London and Croydon, with a large number of signals and junctions, the sharing of stretches of line with the SER, and the relatively short routes, which gave little opportunity to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> <b>time.</b> The LB gradually began to rebuild its reputation during the twentieth century through improvements to main-line infrastructure and electrification of suburban services.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} {{self-treatment}} of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> by producing more glutamine than it needs.|$|E
