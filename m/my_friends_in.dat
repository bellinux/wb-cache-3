5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the battery}} is glued in and cannot be easily {{disassembled}} for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's {{ability to be}} recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple [...] "has pitted design against the environment—and chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue." [...] Wired also criticized Apple's recyclability claims, stating [...] "he design may well be [...] 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'—but <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> the electronics recycling industry tell me they {{have no way of}} recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut, although she personally disagrees. In 1995, she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> art school used to run around {{with this sort of}} what you call Beatles' haircut, and my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [...] liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] After suffering blackouts and intense headaches, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962—Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance—but died before the ambulance reached the hospital. Three days later Kirchherr met the Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage.|$|E

"Ha'n't you no relations, now," [...] asks Grandfather Smallweed with {{a twinkle}} in his eyes, [...] "who would pay off this little {{principal}} or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the city to make you a further advance upon? Two good names would be sufficient for <b>my</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the city. Ha'n't you no such relations, Mr. George?" ...|$|R

500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{has said}} that artists who have {{influenced}} her musical style include Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes, Lil Wayne, Smokey Robinson, Lauryn Hill, Jadakiss, Natasha Bedingfield, Remy Ma, Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Marilyn Monroe, Grace Jones, M.I.A., Cyndi Lauper and TLC. She cites Foxy Brown and Jay-Z as major influences: [...] "I really loved [...] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [...] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time." [...] She said: [...] "I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life, and you've gotta tell people that when they're alive to {{even be able to}} take the compliment, instead of paying tribute to them when they're no longer here", adding that Foxy Brown was [...] "the most influential female rapper" [...] for her, though she initially was compared to Lil Kim when she first debuted. Nicki and Lil Kim, often cited as Foxy's main rap rival, have reportedly exchanged words with each other, on social media and in their music.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was filmed in Santa Barbara, California, in July 2010, and was {{directed}} by Yoann Lemoine. Perry planned the concept along with the songwriters during the sessions. Pictures from the shoot feature Perry kneeling in the sand looking at a man (played by Josh Kloss) wearing speedos, while others show her kissing the man in a hotel pool. She commented about the filming on her Twitter, saying, [...] "That's a wrap for Teenage Dream! So gorgeous [...] In my hometown. I got to cast all <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> the new music vid for Teenage Dream = amazing insanity." [...] The video features images of Perry {{in a car with}} a boyfriend, then, Perry is shown in a Party with her friends, and the closing scene shows Perry kissing her boyfriend under the water. Perry was interviewed online via YouTube, where she talked about the music video. She said: [...] "It is gonna be completely different from 'California Gurls.' With 'Teenage Dream' you'll see a very raw, almost vulnerable ..... I had to wear so many less layers of makeup. I had to make out with a boy which was very traumatizing, I was kind of mean to him. I would be the one to call cut because I was like, 'oh I can't do this!' I feel so horrible. But I know it's a job. [...] understand what our work is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Riegel found {{humor in}} the {{situation}} and said, [...] "Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We're old pros." [...] When asked if they were intimidated by {{the challenge of the}} reveal scenes, Riegel asserted that she [...] "wasn't scared at all," [...] and clarified that it [...] "was a good challenge" [...] and [...] "one of those things where it's like, 'This is what I do. This is what I love.'" [...] She said, [...] "To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place." [...] She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — she had no idea what was coming.|$|E

2500|$|... "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} some music critics. Nick Levine, from Digital Spy, called it [...] "standout track". Chris True from AllMusic had reviewed the album, and highlighted the song as an album standout. But {{as a separate}} rating, they gave the single three stars out of five. In the review of The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012), Tim Sendra highlighted it as an album standout. Hunter Felt from PopMatters gave it a positive review, stating [...] "something about Kylie’s innocent yet forceful vocals and the sheer catchiness of the song itself [...] So the song became a beloved secret, and I never bothered to try to tune <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> on “I Could Be So Lucky”, or, crazier yet, proclaim that this “has-been” would be a critical and commercial darling {{in a few years}} time." [...] However, he did say the song was cliché. However, Mark Edwards from Stylus Magazine gave it a scathing remark by saying [...] "Listening to the first tracks on Ultimate Kylie, you want to skip straight through, because early songs like “I Should Be So Lucky” and “Locomotion” are unlistenable—horribly naff, squeaky songs" [...] and criticized Stock, Aitken and Waterman songs they produced in the 80's by stating [...] " [...] transport the listener back to a time when every single in the UK charts was either written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman or sung by an Aussie soap star, or both." [...] OK! called the song a [...] "classic".|$|E
