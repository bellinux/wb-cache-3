50|$|<b>Mannomustine</b> was, at {{the time}} of its {{creation}} as a drug, claimed to be considerably less toxic than mechlorethamine. For example, the LD50 in rats, for intravenous <b>mannomustine</b> administration route, is claimed to be about 56 mg/kg.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mannomustine</b> (INN), {{also known}} as {{mannitol}} nitrogen mustard, tradename Degranol is an old alkylating antineoplastic agent from the group of nitrogen mustards. It was first synthesized and characterized in 1957 by Vargha et al.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of antineoplastic activity of <b>mannomustine,</b> like {{for all other}} alkylating agents, lies {{in its ability to}} alkylate DNA guanine nucleobases and, thus, to prevent uncoupling of DNA strands, which is a required step for any cell to divide.|$|E
40|$|Mice were {{injected}} with T. A. B. vaccine and, 2 days later, with various doses of different compounds. The relation between dose of compound, mortality and antibody production was studied, and therapeutic indices {{were calculated for}} a number of compounds. The most effective agent in suppressing antibody production at relatively non-toxic doses was cyclophosphamide, with next amethopterin (the effect of which was, however, inexplicably erratic), 6 -thioguanine and 6 -mercaptopurine, in that order. Vincaleukoblastine, triethylene melamine, triethylenethiophosphoramide, <b>mannomustine</b> and 5 -fluorouracil were less effective. Compounds of a miscellaneous group (boric acid, caffeine, sodium nitrite, bacitracin, neomycin and polymyxin `B') were studied in the same way: they had no effect on antibody production, even in lethal doses...|$|E
