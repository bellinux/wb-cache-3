40|$|Men with BRCA 2 {{mutations}} {{have been}} found to be at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. There is a recent report that BRCA 2 carriers with prostate cancer have poorer survival than noncarrier prostate cancer patients. In this study, we compared survival of <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 2 mutation and prostate cancer <b>with</b> that of <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 1 mutation and prostate cancer. We obtained the age at diagnosis, age at death or current age from 182 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer from families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 2 mutation and from 119 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> prostate cancer from families <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 1 mutation. The median survival from diagnosis was 4. 0 years for <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 2 mutation vs 8. 0 years for <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> BRCA 1 mutation, and the difference was highly significant (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Association {{recommends}} that <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA>  10  ng ml− 1 undergo prostate biopsy to detect PCa. 7 However, <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA of higher than 10 ng ml− 1, {{in countries with}} low PCa incidence (such as China), may still have a very low probability of harboring PCa. 8 To investigate the usefulness of PSAD for detecting PCa in Chinese men, we analyzed two groups of Chinese men undergoing screening for PCa. The first group included <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA of 2. 5 – 10. 0  ng ml− 1, in the traditional PSA “gray zone, ” while the second group included <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA above this range (PSA 10. 1 – 20. 0  ng ml− 1)  - a hypothetical Chinese PSA “gray zone ” - using multicenter data. We hypothesized that using PSAD could improve the efficiency of PCa detection in Chinese <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> PSA above the traditional “gray zone ”  (PSA 10. 1 – 20. 0  ng ml− 1)   (i. e.  Chinese PSA “gray zone”) ...|$|R
