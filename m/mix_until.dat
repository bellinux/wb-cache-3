500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo <b>mix</b> <b>until</b> the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length to something more manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the song}} shifts from the verse to the chorus, Jonny Greenwood plays three blasts of guitar noise ("dead notes" [...] played by {{releasing}} fret-hand pressure and picking the strings). Greenwood {{said he did}} this {{because he did not}} like how quiet the song was; he explained: [...] "So I hit the guitar hard—really hard". Ed O'Brien said: [...] "That's the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn't like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song." [...] During the song's outro, Jonny Greenwood plays a piano figure. Kolderie forgot to add the piano part during the final <b>mix</b> <b>until</b> the end of the song, but the band approved of the final result.|$|E
