25|$|It was to {{be another}} ten years before {{reception}} improved. In 1939, the BBC investigated using Start Point transmitting station in Devon to improve their coverage of radio in the South West. However, due to the outbreak of World War II, transmissions of the BBC Home Service did not start here until 1945. Another <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> <b>transmitter,</b> Lanner/Redruth MF, in {{the west of the}} county, was built in 1943 by German POWs. This started transmissions of the BBC Home Service immediately, as unlike the transmitter at Start Point, it was felt that the signal could not be picked up by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The World Service {{employed}} a <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> at Orford Ness to provide English-language coverage to Europe, including on the frequency 648 kHz (which {{could be heard}} {{in parts of the}} south-east of England). Transmissions on this frequency were stopped on 27 March 2011, {{as a consequence of the}} budgetary constraints imposed on the BBC World Service in the 2010 budget review. A second channel (1296kHz) traditionally broadcast in various Central European languages, but in 2005 it began regular English-language transmissions via the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) format. This is a digital shortwave technology that VT expects to become the standard for cross-border transmissions in developed countries.|$|E

25|$|The Copenhagen Frequency Plan of 1948 {{resulted}} in Norway only being allocated one <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> and one long wave frequency. The audio quality diminished as Norwegian transmitters {{were forced to}} share frequencies with foreign channels. This could be overcome by installing a network of FM broadcasting transmitters. The Telegraphy Administration rejected FM, stating that this would require the entire country to buy new radios. A 1949 plan proposed a new long <b>wave</b> <b>transmitter</b> at Kløfta and a national network of <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> <b>transmitters.</b> NRK accepted the transmitter at Kløfta, but rejected the <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> <b>transmitters.</b> As {{twenty percent of the}} population lacked acceptable radio coverage, NRK decided in 1953 to build FM transmitters in Western Norway and Agder to reach these areas. An advantage of building FM transmitters was that they could be co-located with television transmitters, reducing the roll-out costs.|$|R
2500|$|In 1933, the BBC {{started their}} BBC West Regional Programme (station ident: [...] "5PY"). The main {{transmitter}} for this service was at Washford, near Minehead in Somerset.

5000|$|In July 1925 the BBC {{opened a}} much higher powered {{transmitter}} at Daventry which broadcast on 1562 metres longwave and was receivable across most of Britain. The station was called 5XX and it conducted its first experimental stereo broadcast from a concert in Manchester. (The 5XX longwave transmitter beamed the right hand channel and all the local BBC <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> <b>transmitters</b> including 2ZY broadcast the left hand channel). A central Control Room was opened in Piccadilly Gardens in 1929 from where many network radio programmes were produced or broadcast.

5000|$|The Burghead {{transmitting}} station is a broadcasting facility near Burghead (...) in Scotland for long <b>wave</b> and <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> radio transmission that started service on 12 October 1936.

50|$|The station {{played a}} part in the birth of {{commercial}} radio in the UK. When the first two radio stations, LBC and Capital Radio, opened in October 1973, the site for their <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> <b>transmitters</b> was not complete. As a result, a temporary 'Tee' antenna was strung up between the two chimneys (transmitting LBC on 417 m (719 kHz), and Capital Radio on 539 m (557 kHz)), until the permanent site at Saffron Green was ready in 1975. Some years later the site was used again, on 720 kHz (for a low power MW relay of BBC Radio 4's LW service) which was in use until 2001 when the radio transmitter was moved to Crystal Palace.|$|R
