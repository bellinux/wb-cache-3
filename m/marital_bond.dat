2500|$|This latter ordinance, {{known as}} a sealing ceremony, {{reflects}} a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be [...] "sealed" [...] to one another so that their <b>marital</b> <b>bond</b> continues into the eternities. Children may also be sealed to their biological or adoptive parents to form permanent familial bonds, thus allowing all immediate and extended family relations to endure past death. Children born to biological parents who have been sealed to each other are considered [...] "born in the covenant" [...] and need not be sealed to their parents. See [...] The most significant LDS ordinances may be performed via proxy in behalf {{of those who have}} died, such as baptism for the dead. The church teaches that all {{will have the opportunity to}} hear and accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings that come to those who faithfully adhere to it, in this life or the next. Ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, sealings, and endowments are performed in temples that are built and dedicated specifically for these purposes.|$|E

Shortly after, Vladislaus II determined that his unconsummated and only juridical marriage with the Brandenburg princess was useless and began to seek the legal separation. This enraged Elector Albert Achilles, who in 1481 obtained a compensation payment; however, with the mediation of the Bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg, he still wanted to continue the <b>marital</b> <b>bond,</b> and even offered his ten-year-old daughter Dorothea as a replacement of her older sister, if the King did not want Barbara any more.

It is a destructive evil and a deadly sin. Kam is heavily discouraged as it [...] "can build barriers against God in their lives".|$|E

Rather than scoring the content of their answers, interviewers used the Oral History Interview coding system, developed by Buehlman and Gottman in 1996, to measure spouses' perceptions about the marriage and about each other. Therefore, the couples’ perception was used to predict marital stability or divorce. The more positive their perceptions and attitudes were about their marriage and each other, the more stable the marriage.|$|E

5000|$|The Qur'an forbids all sexual {{intercourse}} outside the <b>marital</b> <b>bond</b> {{between a man}} and a woman as sinful, but makes no distinction between illegal sex outside marriage and illegal sex between an unmarried man and a woman. Verse 24:2 of the Quran declares that the punishment for consensual but illegal sex is flogging with 100 strokes, but it makes no mention of stoning. Many Muslim scholars including Yusuf Qaradawi suggest that stoning to death is not part of Islamic Sharia Law and points out that stoning is a Jewish traditions and laws written from the Torah. [...] In the Quran, four witnesses are required to prove the offense. Illegal {{sexual intercourse}} (zina) thus belong to the class of hadd (pl. hudud) crimes which have Quranically specified punishments.

50|$|Guildeluec {{is happy}} to see her husband but soon realizes that his mind is elsewhere. She has one of her {{servants}} follow Eliduc one day {{when he goes to}} the chapel to visit Guilliadon's body. Guildeluec soon follows to discover the source of her husband's sorrow. Seeing the young woman, Guildeluec understands immediately that this is her husband's lover; and she mourns the young woman. Two weasels run into the chapel. When the servant kills one of the weasels (both female, metaphorically representing the two women), the other one runs into the forest to find a magical flower that revives him. Seeing this, Guildeluec takes the flower from the weasel and uses it to heal Guilliadon. Not knowing that the woman she sees is Eliduc's wife, Guilliadon immediately explains her story, confessing that she did not know that Eliduc was married. Guildeluec reveals her identity and forgives Guilliadon. The two women return to Eliduc who is overwhelmed with joy at the sight of his lover. Noticing this, Guildeluec generously decides to become the abbess of Eliduc's proposed abbey in the forest and frees Eliduc of his <b>marital</b> <b>bond.</b> Eliduc goes on to marry Guilliadon and lives happily for many years.

The passage of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 gave the board their justification in censoring depictions of racial mixing. Members of the Board of Censors followed a mandate which, as stated in an annual report, “scrutinized with particular care all films which touch upon the relations existing between whites and blacks. Every scene or subtitle calculated to produce friction between the races is eliminated.” Although the board did not explicitly define what material might “produce friction between the races,” any film that did not depict segregation to the satisfaction of the board would be subject to major cuts, or rejection “in toto.” ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} 375 antenatal {{attendees}} to assess women's views {{and experience in}} sexual matters during pregnancy and following childbirth. Explanatory variables included the perception women had of sex during pregnancy and after childbirth. Outcome variables were frequency and satisfaction of sexual activity. The commonest reasons for having coitus in pregnancy were marital harmony and facilitation of delivery. Libido rose throughout pregnancy but orgasms were less often experienced. The man-on-top position became less practised. Vaginal intercourse remained the commonest type. Masturbation and anal intercourse increased, while oral sex declined throughout. Marriage (OR 9. 0, 95 % CI 1. 0 – 79. 5) and current cohabitation (OR 13. 6, 95 % CI 1. 6 – 113. 4) were predictors of sex in pregnancy. Dyspareunia and partners' extramarital affairs were deterrent.
