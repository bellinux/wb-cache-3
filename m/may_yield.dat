5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island <b>may</b> <b>yield</b> evidence of such early hominids.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture <b>may</b> <b>yield</b> the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E

Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable.

For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.|$|E

We demonstrate that such attitude observer <b>may</b> <b>yields</b> very slow initial convergence rates, and motivated by this, we propose a hybrid attitude observer that guarantees global asymptotic stability on the special orthogonal group.

25|$|If {{the cost}} of {{comparisons}} exceeds {{the cost of}} swaps, {{as is the case}} for example with string keys stored by reference or with human interaction (such as choosing one of a pair displayed side-by-side), then using binary insertion sort <b>may</b> <b>yield</b> better performance. Binary insertion sort employs a binary search to determine the correct location to insert new elements, and therefore performs ⌈log2(n)⌉ comparisons in the worst case, which is O(n log n). The algorithm as a whole still has a running time of O(n2) on average because of the series of swaps required for each insertion.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} can {{be understood}} in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics. On the one hand, it <b>may</b> <b>yield</b> new information about the group G: often, the group operation in G is abstractly given, but via ρ, it corresponds to the multiplication of matrices, which is very explicit. On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies {{the study of the}} object in question. For example, if G is finite, it is known that V above decomposes into irreducible parts. These parts in turn are much more easily manageable than the whole V (via Schur's lemma).|$|E
25|$|While {{the hazards}} of x-rays are now well-controlled in most medical contexts, MRI still {{may be seen as}} {{superior}} to CT in this regard. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging of disease and follow-up without exposing the body to ionizing radiation. MRI often <b>may</b> <b>yield</b> different diagnostic information compared with CT. There may be risks and discomfort associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT, MRI scans typically take greater time, are louder, and usually require that the subject go into a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely.|$|E
