40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} {{a series of}} novel dithiafulvenyl (DTF) compounds, and their characterization. This entails an investigation into their unique electronic properties, {{as well as their}} response to both chemical and electrochemical oxidation. This work expands upon previous work within the Zhao group to prepare bis-spiro compounds from DTFs, and works toward a mechanistic explanation for this process. Additionally, examination of DTF species unreactive to typical oxidative dimerization to tetrathiafulvalene (TTFV) using density-functional theory (DFT) optimization has elucidated the effect of resonance delocalization on the reactivity of the radical cation DTF toward TTFV formation. This thesis also reports the synthetic efforts toward a catechol-functionalized polysiloxane material for anticorrosion and antifouling <b>marine</b> <b>coating</b> additives. Several routes have been explored in attempts to obtain the target compound, including the Hiyama and Kumada coupling reactions.

40|$|Terahertz wave {{propagation}} in marine protective coatings and its non-destructive testing (NDT) capability were studied by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD model {{was used to}} calculate the propagation and reflection of THz radiation from marine protective coatings. The reflected terahertz waves could be employed in coating thickness analysis of the paint layers. In order to clearly identify the interface between antifouling and anticorrosive coatings, stationary wavelet transform (SWT) approach was applied to decompose the obtained terahertz impulse functions into approximation and detail coefficients; SWT detail coefficients were used for the feature extraction of the coating thickness. SWT provides a more accurate identification of salient features in a signal, such as the weak feature between antifouling and anticorrosive coatings. We found that the developed model and SWT-based algorithms could be used to evaluate the occurrence of defects beneath the coatings (e. g., paint-off and corrosion defects). The proposed method provides the solution for <b>coating</b> thickness of <b>marine</b> protective coatings and it would benefit the effective maintenance to avoid coating failure and facilitate <b>marine</b> protective <b>coating</b> design. Therefore, non-destructive testing and evaluation of <b>marine</b> protective <b>coating</b> system by terahertz waves with SWT could be recommended for engineering applications...|$|R

The coating exhibits high mechanical strength, strong adhesion to stainless steel (SS), and excellent anti-abrasion properties.

These works greatly extend the applicability of zwitterionic materials for long-term anti-fouling purposes...|$|E
40|$|Biofouling is {{a general}} problem in marine applications. Copper {{has been used as}} an anti-biofouling agent in marine {{coatings}} for decades; however, its widespread use has resulted in regulatory restrictions due to high copper concentrations in harbors and areas with limited water circulation. Here we present a new approach for anti-fouling coatings using microparticles of poly(tris[(benzyltriazol) methyl]amine) (poly(TBTA)) polymers to absorb and control the interaction between a surface coating and the copper naturally present in seawater with the intention of creating a flux of copper across the water/coating interface. The preparation and characterization of microparticles of poly(TBTA) as well as hybrid PMMA: poly(TBTA) has been described to study the feasibility of tuning the copper-coordination properties of a generic <b>marine</b> <b>coating</b> using these paint-compatible microparticles. The properties of microparticles of poly(TBTA), PMMA and the PMMA: poly(TBTA) hybrid were therefore studied using cyclic voltammetry and NMR spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the copper ions interact specifically with microparticles containing the coordinating polymer poly(TBTA) and that these microparticles have a high absorption capacity of more than 5 wt% for copper...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we found two agents, the 2 -agonist medetomidine ((Â±) - 4 -[1 -(2, 3 -dimethylphenyl) ethyl]- 1 H-imidazole) and the 2 -agonist clonidine (2 -(2, 6 -dichloroanilino) - 2 -imidazoline), that specifically and efficiently impede settlement of the barnacle Balanus improvisus, {{one of the most}} serious biofouling organisms in Swedish waters. Medetomidine, but not clonidine, is known to adsorb to solid polystyrene (PS) surfaces in the presence of salt, a feature that is of particular interest in attempts to develop an efficient antifouling surface. We show that medetomidine, but not clonidine, has a significant ability to adsorb to untreated (hydrophobic) PS in two different incubation media: filtered seawater (FSW) and deionized water (mQ). At negatively charged (hydrophilic) PS, medetomidine displays a strong interaction with the surface in both incubation media. At the hydrophilic PS, clonidine also displays a significant interaction with the surface when incubated in mQ and a weaker, but not significant, interaction when incubated in FSW. By studying the effects of time, incubation media, and pH on the adsorption of medetomidine and clonidine, we suggest that medetomidine is associated to hydrophobic PS by means of hydrophobic interactions, while the adsorption of medetomidine and clonidine to hydrophilic PS contains elements of electrostatic interaction. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) we detected only weak signals from medetomidine on the hydrophobic PS surfaces, while strong medetomidine signals were observed on hydrophilic PS. This suggests that the adsorbed medetomidine, to a greater extent, desorbed from the hydrophobic rather than from the hydrophilic PS surfaces during exposure to vacuum. The strong surface affinity of medetomidine on both types of surfaces and the preserved antifouling activity are valuable features in designing a <b>marine</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|E

40|$|Semprus Biosciences is {{developing}} environmentally benign and permanent modifications to prevent biofouling on Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) devices. Biofouling, including growth on external surfaces by bacteria, algae, barnacles, mussels, and other marine organisms, accumulate quickly on MHK devices, causing mechanical wear {{and changes in}} performance. Biofouling on crucial components of hydrokinetic devices, such as rotors, generators, and turbines, imposes substantial mass and hydrodynamic loading with associated efficiency loss and maintenance costs. Most antifouling coatings leach toxic ingredients, such as copper and tributyltin, through an eroding process, but increasingly stringent regulation of biocides has led to interest {{in the development of}} non-biocidal technologies to control fouling. Semprus Biosciences research team {{is developing}} modifications to prevent fouling from a broad spectrum of organisms on devices of all shapes, sizes, and materials {{for the life of the}} product. The research team designed and developed betaine-based polymers as novel underwater coatings to resist the attachment of marine organisms. Different betaine-based monomers and polymers were synthesized and incorporated within various coating formulations. The formulations and application methods were developed on aluminum panels with required adhesion strength and mechanical properties. The coating polymers were chemically stable under UV, hydrolytic and oxidative environments. The sulfobetaine formulations are applicable as nonleaching and stable underwater coatings. For the first time, coating formulations modified with highly packed sulfobetaine polymers were prepared and demonstrated resistance to a broad spectrum of marine organisms. Assays for comparing nonfouling performance were developed to evaluate protein adsorption and bacteria attachment. Barnacle settlement and removal were evaluated and a 60 -day field test was performed. Silicone substrates including a commercial fouling release coating were used for comparison. Compared with the unmodified silicone substrates, the sulfobetaine-modified formulations were able to exhibit a 98 % reduction in fibrinogen adsorption, 97. 0 % (E. coli), 99. 6 % (S. aureus), and 99. 5 % (C. lytica) reduction in bacteria attachment, and 100 % reduction in barnacles cyprid attachment. In addition to the significant improvement in fouling resistance of various organisms, the 60 -day field test also showed an evident efficacy from visual assessment, foul rating, and fouling removal test. The research confirmed that the novel antifouling mechanism of betaine polymers provides a new avenue for <b>marine</b> <b>coating</b> development. The developed coatings out-performed currently used nontoxic underwater coatings in a broad spectrum of fouling resistance. By further developing formulations and processing methods for specific devices, the technology is ready for the next stage of development with demonstration in MHK systems...|$|E
40|$|Marine fouling, or {{the growth}} of marine organisms on fully or partly {{submerged}} structures, is an unwanted phenomenon in the marine industry. Bio fouling will increase the hydrodynamic drag of ships, causing an increased fuel consumption, promote the corrosion of the metallic structures and trigger undesired transport of invasive species (IMO and the environment 2009, 2009). The impact is economic as well as environmental. More fuel consumption is synonym for more CO 2 and other detrimental emissions, corrosion entails coating {{and the introduction of}} toxic substances in the sea and air and the transport of hitch-hikers: non-indigenous species towards locations without natural enemies will harm the local delights of the marine environment. In 2001 the IMO adopted the "International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships". This convention entered into force 17 September 2008 and prohibited the use of harmful organotins in anti-fouling paints used on ships. A mechanism was established to prevent the future use of other potential harmful substances in anti-fouling systems. The ban on organotins confronted the marine industry with a major challenge. TBT's (TriButylTin) {{have a negative impact on}} the marine biotope but till today no equally efficient, harmless, substance has been found. The search for an efficient, economic and ecological friendly novel anti-fouling paint is high on the agenda of IMO, governments, paint producers, ship owners and environmental organizations. All major <b>marine</b> <b>coating</b> producers bring to the market very similar products. Broadly speaking, the present hull anti-fouling systems focus on the following three generic types of AF-coating: firstly, hard coatings, usually biocide-free vinyl esters, reinforced with glass platelets. In actual fact this is not a real anti-fouling coating since fouling will appear over time but it resists mechanical cleaning, even with hard brushes, exceptionally well. Secondly, we have a whole range of soft/smooth paints, often based on silicones or fluoropolymers, rendering the hull surface so slippery that latching onto becomes difficult. Basically this type of coating cleans itself by means of the speed of the ship, the organisms with little adhesion will flush of easily. Finally, the most popular type of fouling protection, have a toxic additive incorporated in the topcoat. Predominantly these additives are copper based products reinforced with booster biocides. Three different techniques are being used to release these toxins in a more or less controlled way. The most primitive system, dating from the 50 's, consist out of a soluble matrix, in general colophony mixed with copper, arsenic, zinc, mercury or iron oxides. A few years later, the binder became non-soluble, acrylic resins, vinyl resins or chlorinated rubber polymers were being used together with copper and zinc oxides with or without organometallic compounds. Presently mainly self-polishing copolymers are being used whereby biocides are leached under a controlled manner. While sailing the paint abrades and constantly a new layer of coating, mixed with zinc- or copper oxides emerges. Each of the above described AF-coatings has a very specific and limited field of application. Selecting the correct coating for a specific ship is far from self-evident. Important differences do exist within each coating type, dependent on the manufacturer. Unfortunately, no real objective means of comparing these products exists, neither on performance nor on ecological impact. The aim of this project is to establish an impartial test-protocol and build a platform for testing AF-coatings in a statically and dynamically manner. With knowledge of type, composition and performance of the anti-fouling paints tested we can advise the ship owners in an objective way and evaluate the ecological impact of a paint through a well-founded life cycle analysis...|$|E

Then, a second polyacrylamide (PAAM) network {{was incorporated into}} the pre-prepared hydrogel to form a double network (DN) hydrogel. The compositions of these DN hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Rheological and compressive measurements confirmed that the mechanical performances of the DN hydrogels were significantly improved by incorporation of a second PAAM network, compared with the according single network (SN) hydrogels. The amount of protein absorbed on the DN hydrogel surface {{was related to the}} ratio of TMA/SA and the ionic strength. The DN hydrogel with equal amount of TMA and SA exhibited better protein resistance. In addition, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chlorella were chosen for the anti-algae assay.

40|$|Novel {{nanocomposite}} (NC) hydrogels {{based on}} thiol/acetyl thioester groups chelating with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were designed and prepared. The AgNPs acted as both cross-linkers to produce stable NC hydrogels and antimicrobials {{to prevent the}} algal adhesion {{on the surface of}} hydrogels. The amount of AgNPs embedded in the NC hydrogels had a great influence on the mechanical properties of the NC hydrogels. When the feed molar ratio of the silver element to the sulfur element (Ag/S) approached 0. 9, the hydrogels showed the highest mechanical properties. The dynamic nature of the interactions between the AgNPs and thiol/acetyl thioester groups endowed these NC hydrogels with interesting rapid mechanical recovery properties. The NC hydrogels containing thiol groups showed better self-recovery performance than the hydrogels with acetyl thioester groups. In addition, the NC hydrogels with AgNPs exhibited good anti-algal performance for Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chlorella. When the Ag/S ratio exceeded 0. 9, there were almost no algae {{on the surface of the}} NC hydrogels.

40|$|Polymeric films {{constructed}} {{using the}} layer-by-layer (LbL) fabrication process were {{employed as a}} platform for metal ion immobilization and applied as a <b>marine</b> antifouling <b>coating.</b> The novel Cu 2 + ion imprinting process described {{is based on the}} use of metal ion templates and LbL multilayer covalent cross-linking. Custom synthesized, peptide mimicking polycations composed of histidine grafted poly(allylamine) (PAH) to bind metal ions, and methyl ester containing polyanions for convenient cross-linking were used in the fabrication process. Two methods of LbL film formation have been investigated using alternate polyelectrolyte deposition namely non-imprinted LbLA, and imprinted LbLB. Both LbL films were cross linked at mild temperature to yield covalent bridging of the layers for improved stability in a sea water environment. A comparative study of the non-imprinted LbLA films and imprinted LbLB films for Cu 2 + ion binding capacity, leaching rate and stability of the films was performed. The results reveal that the imprinted films possess enhanced affinity to retain metal ions due to the preorganization of imidazole bearing histidine receptors. As a result the binding capacity of the films for Cu 2 + could be improved by seven fold. Antifouling properties of the resulting materials in a marine environment have been demonstrated against the settlement of barnacle larvae, indicating that controlled release of Cu ions was achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of clay-sized particles and clay minerals in modern sands and ancient sandstones has long presented an interesting problem, because primary depositional processes tend {{to lead to}} physical separation of fine- and coarse-grained materials. Numerous processes have been invoked to explain the common {{presence of}} clay minerals in sandstones, including infiltration, the codeposition of flocculated muds, and bioturbation-induced sediment mixing. How and why clay minerals form as grain coats {{at the site of}} deposition remains uncertain, despite clay-coated sand grains being of paramount importance for subsequent diagenetic sandstone properties. We have identified a new biofilm mechanism that explains clay material attachment to sand grain surfaces that leads to the production of detrital clay coats. This study focuses on a modern estuary using a combination of field work, scanning electron microscopy, petrography, biomarker analysis, and Raman spectroscopy to provide evidence of the pivotal role that biofilms play in the formation of clay-coated sand grains. This study shows that within modern marginal <b>marine</b> systems, clay <b>coats</b> primarily result from adhesive biofilms.

40|$|External {{coatings}} {{used for}} corrosion protection {{often have to}} perform under severely corrosive environments. One major concern regarding coating performance is the negative effect of soluble salts on the steel substrate {{at the time of}} coating application, particularly for <b>marine</b> maintenance <b>coating</b> applications. These salts impact the ability of the applied coating systems to protect the steel in several ways including osmotic coating blistering, promotion of under-film metallic corrosion and coating disbondment. This paper focuses on removal of soluble salts contamination by commercially available decontamination processes in relation to external coating systems. We directly compare the effectiveness of four cleaning methods with the performance of ten coating systems. The methodology of surface contamination and preparation of test panels is discussed. After cleaning, sample evaluation for chloride ion contamination levels was carried out using Field method (commercial chloride ion test kit for surfaces) and Ion Chromatography method. Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and elemental surface mapping analysis were carried out. Laboratory testing of coating systems included Adhesion, Porosity, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and cyclic UV/Salt Fog exposure. The performance of the ten coatings on all the substrates was good, but there were differences in gloss retention and on the degree of checking of the different coatings. The only significant difference in performance of the coatings compared to the method used for cleaning the substrate was higher undercreep observed for most of the coatings applied to the ultra-high pressure water jetted system. This shows the importance of substrate preparation due to the sensitivity of the coatings to even low levels of salt. Two coatings did not show increased undercreep and these may be more applicable for offshore maintenance applications where dry abrasive blasting is sometimes not used. The chemical treatment cleaning method used prior to coating application did not show any significant positive or negative effect on the performance of the applied coatings. The fact that the only differences in performance for the coatings applied to the differently prepared substrates was seen for undercreep suggests that the difference may be exacerbated for immersion situations. A follow up study to this one will examine the performance of internal coatings using immersion tests, and {{it will be interesting to}} see if these show increased effect on coating performance...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{complexes}} 			generally and organotin(IV) compounds especially {{are used}} routinely 			in several biomedical and commercial applications like agricultural 			biocides, disinfectants, antitumor agents, wood preservatives, 			antioxidants, stabilizers for polyvinylchloride, <b>marine</b> antifouling 			<b>coating,</b> anti-herpes agents, flame retardants, smoke suppressants, 			anti-wear agents, homogenous catalysts and recycling agents. A 			number of organotin compounds {{have been shown}} to be toxic, and there 			is increasing concern regarding their widespread use in 			environmental and biological systems. Among organotin compounds, 			organotin carboxylates are highly important; these contain Sn 			bond formed through COOÂ¯ group and have a number of interesting 			structural features and biological applications. 			Three groups of novel organotin(IV) carboxylates including mono-, di- 			and triderivatives of ligands: 3, 4 -methylenedioxy 			 6 -nitrophenylpropenoic acid (L 1), 3, 4 - methylenedioxyphenylpropenoic 			acid (L 2) and 2, 3 -methylenedioxybenzoic acid (L 3) were examined for 			their different biological activities. 			In vitro antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined 			against six pathogenic bacterial strains (antibacterial assay) and 			six pathogenic fungal strains (antifungal assay). Determined by the 			antimicrobial studies organotin(IV) carboxylates demonstrated a 			higher level of activity towards all tested bacterial and fungal 			strains than the respective free ligands. As a whole, antibacterial 			activities decreased in order of; diorganotin carboxylates tri-organotin 			carboxylates mono-organotin carboxylates ligand acids. However, 			tri-organotin compounds were the best towards antifungal activities. 			Since the organotin(IV) carboxylates inhibited the growth of 			micro-organisms, it has been assumed that the production of an 			enzyme has been affected, hence the micro-organisms were less able 			to metabolize nutrients and consequently, growth ceased. 			All the compounds were also investigated for their antitumor 			activities and cytotoxicity by crown gall tumor inhibition (potato 			disc) assay and brine-shrimp lethality bioassay, respectively. As 			determined by crown gall tumor inhibition assay and brineshrimp 			lethality assay; the antitumor or cytotoxic activities of these 			compounds fall in the order of; tri-organotin carboxylates 			di-organotin carboxylates mono-organotin carboxylates, a similar 			pattern is reported in literature. Such compounds may yield new 			leads for the development of antitumor drugs, which can display a 			different spectrum of antitumor activity. 			A panel of different mono-, di- and tri-organotin(IV) carboxylates 			that have higher biological activities in previous assays were 			selected to investigate their effect on MCF- 7 cells. Determined by 			the clonogenic assay, organotin(IV) compounds (0. 1 Âµg/ml, 1. 0 Âµg/ml 			or 10. 0 Âµg/ml) were markedly cytotoxic following treatment of MCF- 7 			cells with 1. 0 Âµg/ml particularly tri-organotin carboxylates. 			Further investigation was aimed to determine genotoxic effect and 			biochemicalcell fingerprint of MCF- 7 cells following treatment with 			selected panel of mono-, di- and tri-organotin(IV) carboxylates 			(0. 01 Âµg/ml, 0. 1 Âµg/ml or 1. 0 Âµg/ml) that were used in clonogenic 			assay. Induction of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) were measured by 			using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay and 			their relative micronucleus-forming activities using the cytokinesis-block 			micronucleus (CBMN) assay as well as alterations in biochemical-cell 			signatures was ascertained using attenuated total reflection fourier 			transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. 			In comet analysis, although there were marked fluctuations in the 			background levels of DNA SSBs measurable in control MCF- 7 cell 			populations, a remarkable consistency in the ability of all the 			organotin(IV) carboxylates to be comet-forming was noted. However, 			with the alkaline comet assay it was more difficult to distinguish 			between the relative abilities of tri-organotin carboxylates, 			di-organotin carboxylates or mono-organotin carboxylates to induce 			elevations in DNA SSBs. Probably as a consequence of their lower 			relative cytotoxicities, higher levels of micronucleus-forming 			activities were observed following treatment with either mono- or 			di-organotins as compared to tri-organotins. Following interrogation 			of treated-cell populations compared to control using ATR-FTIR 			spectroscopy, infrared spectra (900 1800 cm- 1) derived from 			organotin-treated MCF- 7 cells exhibited clear alterations in their 			biochemical-cell fingerprint following exposures as low as 0. 0001 			Âµg/ml; this was especially evident in the DNA/RNA spectral region (			 1490 1000 cm- 1).
