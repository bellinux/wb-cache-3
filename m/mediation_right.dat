In the case of Hungary’s anti-migration politics between 2015 and 2017, the government is systematically dehumanizing and degrading migrants, from the so-called third countries, {{to the level of}} bare life, and therefore they are exposed to brutal violence and oppression from the authorities, without any <b>mediation</b> of <b>rights</b> and laws. According to G.

However, in the time of mass migratory movements through the Balkans in 2015 and 2016, it was the power of migrants which forced the creation of a non-legal, state-organized transit from the Greek islands to the north of Europe. I am arguing that the temporary and “progressive” suspension of border regimes and laws was used by European authorities to reestablish order and control.

40|$|Recent {{campaigns for}} {{recognition}} by ethnic religious and national minorities have highlighted {{the limitations of}} the dominant unitary conception of the nation state. While the model of 'differentiated citizenship' advocated by Taylor and Carens constitutes an innovative response to these challenges, the difficulties that surround this model underline the dilemma that confronts many modern states. Although a commitment to equal citizenship implies that the state should acknowledge the different histories, needs and goals of the various communities that constitute it, a multicultural society must at the same time develop a genuinely shared culture. These difficult questions surrounding political stability and the equality of citizens cannot be easily resolved. However, one potentially promising avenue is indicated by Parekh's emphasis upon intercultural dialogue. In cases concerned with the <b>mediation</b> of individual <b>rights</b> and certain intergroup and intragroup power relations, such dialogue can be fostered via imaginative institutional mechanisms such as Shachar's model of 'transformative accommodation'...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of rights {{restitution}} as {{an arrangement that}} establishes boundaries, and how those boundaries are translated, challenged, and exceeded. Following the guidelines of International Humanitarian Law and its version contained in the Law of Victims and Land Restitution (1448 / 2011), the Colombian government established a wide network of professionals in charge of registration and reparation for claimants registered as victims of the armed conflict (7, 999, 963 people in April 2016). In these procedures of recognition and reparation, technologies like forms and protocols become crucial for the <b>mediation</b> of <b>rights</b> restitution. As a starting point, I trace the trajectories of technologies of recognition and reparation across assistance centres, governmental offices and sessions of psychosocial assistance. I am interested in functionaries and applicants’ experiences of forms and protocols, the procedures of recognition and reparation, and the circulation of official numbers as narratives of rights restitution. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies, a central concern of this thesis is to ask what technologies of recognition and reparation assemble. I interrogate the translation of experiences of pain and mobility into numbers and the circulation of those numbers by state representatives. I also explore some of the material forms of organisation developed by registered and unregistered interlocutors, as arrangements {{beyond the boundaries of}} state interventions. I describe how some of those alternative orders translate state interventions and enact spaces of material justice. Instead of reproducing the notion of reparation as a cornerstone of rights restitution in transitional justice societies, I suggest that a different sort of Reparation might occur beyond the boundaries of post-conflict statehood and within its intersections with alternative arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Big data blacklisting” is {{the process}} of categorizing {{individuals}} as administratively “guilty until proven innocent” by virtue of suspicious digital data and database screening results. Database screening and digital watchlisting systems are increasingly used to determine who can work, vote, fly, etc. In a big data world, through the deployment of these big data tools, both substantive and procedural due process protections may be threatened in new and nearly invisible ways. Substantive due process rights safeguard fundamental liberty interests. Procedural due process rights prevent arbitrary deprivations by the government of constitutionally protected interests. This Article frames the increasing digital <b>mediation</b> of <b>rights</b> and privileges through government-led big data programs as a constitutional harm under substantive due process, and identifies the obstruction of core liberties with big data tools as rapidly evolving and systemic. To illustrate the mass scale and unprecedented nature of the big data blacklisting phenomenon, this Article undertakes a significant descriptive burden to introduce and contextualize big data blacklisting programs. Through this descriptive effort, this Article explores how a commonality of big data harms may be associated with nonclassified big data programs, such as the No Work List and No Vote List-programs that the government uses to establish or deny an individual 2 ̆ 7 s eligibility for certain benefits or rights through database screening. The big data blacklisting harms of big data tools to make eligibility decisions are not, of course, limited to nonclassified programs. This Article also suggests how the same consequences may be at play with classified and semi-classified big data programs such as the Terrorist Watchlist and No Fly List. This Article concludes that big data blacklisting harms interfere with and obstruct fundamental liberty interests in a way that now necessitates an evolution of the existing due process jurisprudence...|$|R

40|$|Few {{concepts}} {{have generated}} as much {{discussion in the}} post-war international legal system as that of “self-determination. ” Scholars debate the proper identity of the 2 ̆ 2 selves 2 ̆ 2 endowed with this right, its boundaries, and its normative relevance. When the focus turns to mediation, the discussion becomes murky because the concept of self-determination has both procedural and substantive components, and is noticeably different in {{the private and public}} sectors. The generic concept of self-determination relates to ideas of democratic governance and the Enlightenment belief that legitimate government depends upon the consent of the governed. As adapted to private <b>mediation</b> theory, the <b>right</b> of self-determination allows parties to participate in decision making and voluntarily decide the outcome of their disputes. This understanding of self-determination is rooted in the philosophical principle of personal autonomy and is expressed through the legal doctrine of informed consent.

40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{interface}} between human rights and Zimbabwean literature. It discusses the possibility of demystifying the notion of human rights by making human rights discourse accessible to ordinary people through literary works. The argument stems from the realization that human rights discourse is couched in unusual terms and expressions {{which makes it a}} privileged discourse from which various individuals are alienated. This is unfortunate in the sense that human rights are universal and they emerge within culturally specific contexts. An understanding of specific literary works is therefore crucial to an understanding of a societyâ€™s grasp and <b>mediation</b> of human <b>rights</b> issues. Through a re-reading of selected Zimbabwean literary works, the researchers argue for the need to make human rights discourse more accessible through literature. In this endeavor, literary works are seen to play a pivotal role in addressing human rights concerns by familiarizing the reader with those values sections of Zimbabwean society consider valuable and pointing out incidents of human rights abuses. The researchers note that human rights are values that are distinct to all societies and so is art in general. The relationship between the two needs to be explored for a better recognition of the rights of all people...|$|R
40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the distinction between global versus local processing styles exists across sensory modalities. Activation of one-way of processing in one modality should affect processing styles in a different modality. In 12 studies, auditory, haptic, gustatory or olfactory global versus local processing was induced, and participants were tested {{with a measure of}} their global versus local visual attention; the content of this measure was unrelated to the inductions. In a different set of 4 studies, the effect of local versus global visual processing on the way people listen to a poem or touch, taste, and smell objects was examined. In all experiments, global/local processing in 1 modality shifted to global/local processing in the other modality. A final study found more pronounced shifts when compatible processing styles were induced in 2 rather than 1 modality. Moreover, the study explored <b>mediation</b> by relative <b>right</b> versus left hemisphere activation as measured with the line bisection task and accessibility of semantic associations. It is concluded that the effects reflect procedural rather than semantic priming effects that occurred out of participants' awareness. Because global/local processing has been shown to affect higher order processing, future research may activate processing styles in other sensory modalities to produce similar effects. Furthermore, because global/local processing is triggered by a variety of real world variables, one may explore effects on other sensory modalities than vision. The results are consistent with the global versus local processing model, a systems account (GLOMOsys; Förster & Dannenberg, 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Education Law)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2013 The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{establish}} how effectively mediation was applied to advance learners‟ fundamental rights in English First Additional Language classrooms. The researcher did a literature study in Chapter Two to do research on the concept mediation. The researcher briefly looked at a variety of approaches to mediation before deciding to base her study on the twelve mediation principles of Feuerstein. The advantages gained by following a mediational approach while teaching learners could not be disputed. In Chapter Three, the researcher investigated which fundamental rights learners have at South African schools. A variety of legislation was studied before determining those Acts and the legislation applicable to learners‟ fundamental rights. The researcher then proceeded with her empirical design in which she discussed the quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection which were triangulated in order to make findings. The researcher ensured that both <b>mediation</b> and fundamental <b>rights</b> were tested in the questionnaires which were answered by educators and learners. Thereafter, three focus group interviews were held with the educators who had completed the questionnaires. Lastly, the researcher conducted six observations during English First Additional Language literature periods. In order to advance learners‟ fundamental <b>rights</b> while applying <b>mediation</b> during literature periods, the researcher developed a teaching and learning programme for poetry in Grade 11 English First Additional Language educators. Through the research it was found that educators neglect the application of mediation. This, unfortunately, results in detrimental effects concerning the advancement of learners‟ fundamental rights.

40|$|America 2 ̆ 7 s {{fantasy of}} a post-racial society was {{shattered}} on July 16, 2009, when a white police officer arrested Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, a well-respected African-American academic, {{in his own}} home. Our historical racial fissure was widened. Once again, our thoughts were plagued with tortured images of our system of racialized law enforcement: the torture of Abner Louima, the beating of Rodney King, the killing of Amadou Diallo. Predictably, Americans became further polarized, as they simultaneously blamed and defended responses to racism. In what was perceived {{by some as a}} dramatic and unanticipated turn of events, and perceived by others as a necessary political response, on July 30, 2009, President Obama convened the 2 ̆ 2 beer summit, 2 ̆ 2 a metaphorical mediation. President Obama invited Professor Gates and Police Sergeant James Crowley to the White House South Lawn to resolve the issues surrounding the arrest of Professor Gates by Sergeant Crowley. As Professor Gates and Sergeant Crowley sat around the table drinking beer with President Obama, their discussion about race shifted from a demonizing conversation to a humanizing conversation. The two men gained insight into what had happened and began exploring what might be done to prevent this from happening again. The beer summit 2 ̆ 7 s success challenges the long-held taboo proscribing the <b>mediation</b> of civil <b>rights</b> violations such as racial profiling. Civil rights activists, critical race scholars, and the benefactors of civil rights advancement have long considered the <b>mediation</b> of civil <b>rights</b> violations as a neutering of civil rights law and a muting of compelling injustice narratives. This commentary encourages civil rights purveyors to step back from such absolutes and reconsider the appropriateness of mediation in select instances of civil rights offenses. Nothing in this commentary should be misconstrued as a blanket endorsement of mediation in lieu of litigation to redress civil rights violations. Rather, this is an invitation to re-examine the possibilities and reconsider mediation as one forum of choice in addressing race-based civil rights conflicts with law enforcement. Understandably, you may react to this difficult discussion from your personal vantage point about race. After all, whether you consider racial profiling to be a ubiquitous societal problem or a societal ill of the past depends on who you are, your personal experience, your professional perspective, and your definition of the problem. In this commentary, racial profiling is broadly defined as “the practice of ‘police routinely [using] race as a negative signal that, along with an accumulation of other signals, causes an officer to react with suspicion. ’” For some, the definition will be too encompassing; for others, not broad enough. This commentary proceeds with this discussion in five parts. Part One reviews the facts surrounding Professor Gates 2 ̆ 7 arrest. Part Two analyzes the transformation in the participants 2 ̆ 7 conflict discourse that was used to narrate their experience before and after the beer summit. Part Three then hypothesizes why racial profiling remains so pernicious today despite rigorous legislative and judicial enforcement. Part Four offers how mediation might be used as a responsive complement to the existing legal framework. In conclusion, Part Five invites the reader to consider the possibilities that mediation offers as one forum to respond to the multi-dimensional elements of racial profiling, as it exists today...|$|R

The student data were collected via the Supervisor Evaluation Scale and interview guide consisting of open-ended questions. The instructor data were collected during semi-structured focus group interviews. The participants stressed the informative, supportive and instructional roles of the institute for improving the quality of graduate education. In addition, differences as well as commonalities between the expectations of the students and those of the instructors were detected. The students’ expectations from the institute were the protection of students’ <b>rights,</b> <b>mediation,</b> ensuring the diversity of elective courses, the proper teaching of the courses in accordance with the nature of graduate education, and provision of information about career, time and stress management.
