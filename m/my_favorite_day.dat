Not that I ever took instruction very easily. <b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>days</b> were when I had a cold and could stay {{home from school and}} draw all day long.... She was an enthusiastic painter of oils and watercolors. She was also very generous. I could mess with her paints and brushes all I wanted. On one condition: that I kept my brushes clean. The only art lesson my mother gave me was how to wash my brushes. Otherwise, she left me alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Skateboarder Magazine's {{photographer}} John Bradford quoted on skateboardermag.com [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth I was a little jealous of Jaime Owens when he told me he’d be shooting the Video Days guys for the article. He’s usually the one holding everything together down in the office while photographers like me and Mehring are out and about shooting what needs to be shot. Plus, I’m of an age where I grew up in the ’90′s (like Jaime), and can vividly remember the earth figuratively shaking when Video Days first dropped. I have a 2 decade old nervous tick of starting to whistle the John Coletrane song from Gonz’ part, which often reminds me of how many times I watched it before and after school, and on the weekends before I went skating… so I of course started drooling over the shoot when I first heard it was coming together. Anyway I digress. As the shoot happened I tagged along to be a fly on the wall (and to help out where I could) while these dudes all got {{together for the first time}} in many years to reminisce about how they innocently and unwhittingly (sic) changed skateboarding forever. My jealousy of Jaime instantly faded and the day became one of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>days</b> of <b>my</b> career to date, just given who was in the room and what they were all collectively there to celebrate." ...|$|R
40|$|About an {{hour and}} a half from nowhere in a. western woodland, a tiny cabin nestles among the trees. Nearby, a small brook runs clear and cold, {{babbling}} softly over the stones. Flowers flaunt their colors in a gay parade around the cabin. Inside, the odor of clean, bare pine is strong and refreshing. The furniture is simple and sturdy. Its unpainted finish matches the walls and floor perfectly. In one corner, a double-decked bunk bed stands invitingly. The stone-hewn fireplace at the far side of the one room cabin leads a double life; it warms the occupants and cooks their meals. In the evening, after the sun has gone down in all its radiant glory, comes <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> time of <b>day.</b> When I am well toasted on both sides from reading before the open fire, it is wonderful to creep in between sheets whipped sweet and clean by the wind, pull up the warm wooly blanket, and settle down to dream of the pleasant monotony of another day...|$|R
