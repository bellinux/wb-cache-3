50|$|Bread is an {{important}} feature in Ghanaian breakfast and baked foods. Ghanaian bread, which {{is known for its}} good quality, is baked with wheat flour and sometimes cassava flour is added for an improved texture. There are four major types of bread in Ghana. They are tea bread (similar to the baguette), sugar bread (which is a sweet bread), brown (whole wheat) bread, and butter bread. Rye bread, oat bread and <b>malt</b> <b>bread</b> are also quite common.|$|E

He had quick halts for food but, as he was riding, got through 2 lb of fruit cake, 11 packets of <b>malt</b> <b>bread</b> sandwiches, one gallon of rice and fruit salad, seven pints of Complan, 12 oranges, cans of fruit, eight pints of coffee, 13 pints of tea and eight pints of Ribena.|$|E
50|$|An {{acquired}} {{taste is}} {{an appreciation for}} something unlikely to be enjoyed by {{a person who has}} not had substantial exposure to it. In the case of food and drink, {{this may be due to}} a strong odor (such as stinky tofu, Gefilte fish, durian, hákarl, black salt, nattō, stinking toe, asafoetida, surströmming, or certain types of cheese), taste (alcoholic beverages, Vegemite or Marmite, bitter teas, salty liquorice, <b>malt</b> <b>bread,</b> unsweetened chocolate, sushi, garnatálg), or appearance. Acquired taste may also refer to aesthetic tastes, such as taste in music, other forms of art, or in beauty.|$|E
50|$|Veda <b>bread</b> is a <b>malted</b> <b>bread</b> sold in Northern Ireland. It is a small, caramel-coloured loaf with a {{very soft}} {{consistency}} when fresh. Since it is only available in Northern Ireland, many people rely on their relatives to send them veda {{to other parts of}} Ireland and the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent {{application}} titled Making <b>Malted</b> <b>Bread</b> which was granted in 1890. This patent asserted a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. Montgomerie claimed a novel saccharification process which involved warming {{a portion of}} dough mixed with diastatic malt extract to an appropriate mash temperature and holding it for a time so the extract's enzymes would pre-digest some of the starch.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of partially replacing wheat flour with malted rice flour in bread making was evaluated in several formulations, aiming {{to find a}} formulation {{for the production of}} <b>malted</b> rice-wheat <b>bread</b> with better nutritional quality and consumer acceptance. The whole grains of a local rice variety (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica var. Mottaikaruppan) were steeped in distilled water (12 h, 30 °C) and germinated for 3 days to obtain high content of soluble materials and amylase activity in bread making. The quality of bread was evaluated by considering the physical and sensorial parameters. When the wheat flour was substituted with malted rice flour, 35 % substitution level and the malted rice flour from 3 days of germination was the best according to the physical and sensory qualities of bread. The quality of bread was improved by the addition of 20 g of margarine, 20 g of baking powder and 20 g of yeast in 1 kg of flour. Among different ratios of yeast and baking powder, 2 : 1 was the best. Bread improver containing amylases and oxidizing agents at the concentration of 40 g/kg was selected as the best concentration. When comparing the final formulation made in the bakery with wheat <b>bread,</b> <b>malted</b> rice-wheat <b>bread</b> contains more soluble dietary fiber (0. 62 %), insoluble dietary fiber (3. 95 %), total dietary fiber (4. 57 %) and free amino acid content (0. 64 g/kg) than those in wheat bread (0. 5 %, 2. 73 %, 3. 23 % and 0. 36 g/kg, respectively) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{water mill}} {{was used for}} {{grinding}} grain, producing flour for <b>bread,</b> <b>malt</b> for beer, or coarse meal for porridge. Hammermills used the wheel to operate hammers. One type was fulling mill, which was used for cloth making. The trip hammer was also used for making wrought iron and for working iron into useful shapes, an activity that was otherwise labour-intensive. The water wheel was also used in papermaking, beating material to a pulp. In the 13th century water mills used for hammering throughout Europe improved the productivity of early steel manufacturing. Along with the mastery of gunpowder, waterpower provided European countries worldwide military leadership from the 15th century.|$|R
25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of <b>malted</b> barley) into <b>bread</b> improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|R
40|$|Starch is {{the major}} {{component}} of cereal grains and starchy foods, and changes in its biophysical and biochemical properties (e. g., amylose, amylopectin, pasting, gelatinization, viscosity) will have a direct effect on its end use properties (e. g., <b>bread,</b> <b>malt,</b> polymers). The use of rapid and non-destructive methods to study and monitor starch properties, such as gelatinization, retrogradation, water absorption in cereals and starchy foods, is of great interest {{in order to improve}} and assess their quality. In recent years, near infrared reflectance (NIR) and mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy have been explored to predict several quality parameters, such as those generated by instrumental methods commonly used in routine analysis like the rapid visco analyser (RVA) or viscometers. In this review, applications of both NIR and MIR spectroscopy to measure and monitor starch biochemical (amylose, amylopectin, starch) and biophysical properties (e. g., pasting properties) will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Malting and {{fermentation}} {{were applied}} to modify endogenously the sorghum grain components, {{with the aim of}} alleviating grittiness, dryness and crumb firmness normally associated with inclusion of sorghum flour in composite <b>bread.</b> <b>Malt</b> amylases were effectively inactivated by boiling, before drying at high temperatures. A fractionation and reconstitution process revealed that malting and boiling dextrinized and gelatinized starch, increased water-soluble pentosans and crude fiber. Dextrinization and gelatinization of starch decreased gelatinization temperature and the rate of starch retrogradation, thus decreasing crumb grittiness and firmness. The increase in crude fiber and water-soluble pentosans caused by the germinating grain root and shoot growth and the hydrolysis of non-starch polysaccharides, respectively, during malting, increased water-holding capacity and dough viscosity, thus decreasing dryness and the crumb-firming rate. Malting and boiling also decreased the total protein and the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) of sorghum flour and sorghum and wheat composite bread. Fermentation of sorghum flour, followed by drying at 60 °C, decreased the pH of sorghum flour and slightly increased gelatinized starch and pasting viscosity. Apparently, the low pH of fermented sorghum flour caused higher loaf volume and softer crumb by suppressing the malt amylases and increasing starch water-holding capacity, henc...|$|R
40|$|The possibililty {{of using}} the simple {{technologies}} of malting and fermentation to modify endogenously the sorghum grain components, to alleviate the grittiness, dryness and high crumb firmness caused by the inclusion of sorghum flour in composite bread, was investigated. The most suitable grain and the optimal malting time for sorghum for bread¬making, were selected by malting five sorghum cultivars, up to 8 days, and evaluating them for the highest protein modification and lowest dry matter losses. On that basis, a 6 ¬days malt of Local White, a relatively high protein sorghum (10. 7 %), was selected. Sorghum malt flour potentially suitable for bread-making was produced by boiling the selected malt, rather than drying it at high temperatures, stewing or steaming. Boiling was most effective in inactivating the amylases and in increasing the pasting viscosity of sorghum <b>malt.</b> The <b>bread</b> made with boiled malt flour (30 %) had an improved crumb structure and water-holding capacity, a softer crumb and increased resistance to staling, compared to bread made with sorghum grain flour (30 %). Bread-making with reconstituted flours from flour and bran fractions of whole sorghum grain and whole boiled sorghum malt indicated that the bread improving effect of malting and boiling was due to dextrinization and gelatinization of starch, and to the increase of total and water-soluble pentosans, and crude fiber. Dextrinization and gelatinization of starch decreased the gelatinization temperature {{and the rate of}} starch retrogradation, thus decreasing the crumb firmness and firming rate of sorghum and wheat composite bread. However, high levels of gelatinized starch decreased dough strength and bread volume. The increase of total pentosans and crude fiber of sorghum malts, caused by germinating grains roots and shoots growth, and the increase of water-soluble pentosans, due to hydrolysis of the non-starch polyssacharides during malting, significantly increased flour and dough water-holding capacity. Thus, crumb structure was improved and crumb firmness and crumb-firming rate decreased. Treatment of sorghum flour with endo-(l- 4) -β-xylanase to determine whether endoxylanases could solubilize sorghum pentosans, increased the water-soluble pentosans slightly, indicating the potential of endoxylanases to improve the bread-making quality of sorghum flour. However, heating the endoxylanase treated flour to inactivate the enzyme, so as to determine its specific effect, gelatinized the starch and decreased the bread volume. A natural lactic acid fermentation of sorghum flour, followed by drying at 60 °C, decreased the pH of sorghum flour from 6. 2 to 3. 4 and slightly increased the gelatinized starch and the pasting viscosity of sorghum flour. Apparently, the low pH caused higher loaf volume and improved crumb structure and softness by suppressing the amylases and by increasing the viscosity of dough, and hence increasing its gas-holding capacity. Adding wet fermented sorghum flour directly to wheat flour (sourdough process), as an alternative to drying, further increased the volume and decreased the crumb firmness. Fermentation and drying also improved the protein digestibility of sorghum composite bread. Consumer panel members liked the bread made with boiled sorghum malt flour most, apparently because it was softer, more moist and had a fine malt flavor. They liked the bread made with fern 1 ented and dried sorghum flour less, apparently because it had a pronounced sour taste. Malting and fermentation can be successfully used to produce acceptable sorghum and wheat composite bread. Fermentation is probably the most suitable technology for poor developing countries because it is simple and effective. Steaming the malt and adding the endoxylanases directly when mixing the dough, to eliminate the flour drying step and to reduce starch gelatinization, should be looked at further.

40|$|The Maillard {{reaction}} is {{a network of}} different non-enzymatic reactions between carbonyl groups of reducing sugars and amino groups from amino acids, peptides, or proteins, which progresses in three major stages and originates a very heterogeneous mixture of reaction products. It {{is also known as}} non-enzymatic browning, due to the brown macromolecular pigments formed in the final stage of the reaction. The chemistry underlying the Maillard {{reaction is}} complex. It encloses not only one reaction pathway, but a whole network of various transformations. As virtually all foods contain both proteins and carbohydrates, Maillard reaction products are present in the daily diet in considerable amounts. The endogenous formation of Maillard reaction products, especially related to ageing and diabetes, aroused intense discussions about the health consequences of the “glycation”, the term that describes the in vivo reaction corresponding to the Maillard reaction in foods. Melanoidins are the final brown products of the Maillard reaction. They are responsible for the color formed during the heat processing of foods like coffee, <b>bread,</b> <b>malt,</b> and beef. Melanoidins are high molecular weight polydisperse polymers containing nitrogen. Their structure is largely unknown. Coffee melanoidins, which are object of the present study, contain thermally transformed polysaccharides, proteins, and phenolic compounds. Since the mechanisms involved on the formation of these macromolecules, and the chemical transformations which take place during the heat treatment are not completely elucidated, key structural features were analyzed. Especially the incorporation of chlorogenic acids in the melanoidin skeleton was object of attention of the present work. Another major aim of this work was to investigate the influence of the Maillard reaction on the inhibitory potential of food components against zinc metalloproteases. The studied enzymes were three human matrix metalloproteases (MMP- 1, - 2 and - 9), which are able to degrade matrix proteins and participate in many physiological processes, including tissue turnover and repair, but also constitute important targets in malignant and degenerative diseases. A microbial collagenase from Chlostridium histolyticum was chosen due to its subtract similarity to MMPs. Furthermore, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), which plays a central role in cardiovascular pathologies such as hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, was investigated. As a prototypical Maillard reaction product, coffee melanoidin was adopted. Due to the roast dependent inhibitory activity of the coffee melanoidin fractions against matrix metalloproteases, the functionalization caused by the non-enzymatic browning was closer investigated. Na-carboxyalkylated derivatives of a sequence of relevant peptides were synthesized, in a variation of the process-induced formation of Nε-carboxymethyllysine, a major advanced glycation end-product (AGE). The inhibitory activity against zinc metalloproteases of the sequence of selected peptides and their Na-carboxymethyl- (CM-) and Na-carboxyethyl- (CE-) derivates was investigated...|$|R
