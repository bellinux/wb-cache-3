It sounds easy, but it 2 ̆ 7 s not. Finding the right site requires patience, effort and a Sherlock Holmes-like ability to draw conclusions from many facts and observation.

Sites that are vacant are usually vacant for a reason: high rents, low traffic counts, building problems, difficult landlords.

To further complicate matters, the numbering system is not consistently applied to the Univers font family.

For example, Univers 55 Roman Oblique has both Windows <b>menu</b> <b>names</b> and PostScript full names as Univers LT 55 Oblique and Univers 56 Oblique, but only for the Windows PostScript version of the font; however, in Univers 85 Extra Black Oblique, there is no font named Univers 86 in any format.

The ITDA's unique features directly affect the application of an SRD. It is an interactive, menu driven program designed to be operated from the keyboard only. The SRD must be connected to the host computer, the HP 9020, through a remote user port. The ITDA is multi-leveled with several <b>menu</b> <b>names</b> being assigned to different levels.

Fast food and chain restaurants often give the <b>menu</b> items descriptive <b>names</b> related to the production processes (e. g., baked, fried, grilled, glazed). Do these descriptions in a food’s name provide a useful indication of its calorie content? This study analyzed 342 different words that form the names of 18, 614 menu items across 66 high-traffic, affordable American restaurant chains (e. g., Starbucks, Applebee’s, Panera Bread, Bojangles). Of the 342 words, 31 were related to production processes. A statistical analysis involving the calorie levels associated with the 31 words revealed that words related to batter and cheese – such as melt (+ 59 %), topped (99 %), or fried (38 %) – were significantly higher in calories than the average. Interestingly, entries that were reliably lower in calories than average were either related to cutting techniques – such as sliced (− 72 %) or diced (− 96 %) – or how it was cooked – steamed (− 43 %), smoked (− 30 %), roasted (− 27 %), or baked (− 26 %). The findings suggest {{that it is possible to}} infer caloric levels from the preparation methods noted in the <b>name</b> of a <b>menu</b> item at a restaurant. Health conscious consumers would be well served to choose menu items described with cutting techniques (e. g., sliced, diced) and should be extra cautious when uttering <b>menu</b> <b>names</b> related to batter and cheese...|$|R
