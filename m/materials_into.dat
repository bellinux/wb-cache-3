5|$|During the Cold War, {{the project}} {{expanded}} to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium {{for most of the}} more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of radioactive <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> the air and the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget for}} the works was £420,000, with initial work focused on {{stabilising}} the foundations and lower masonry. Much of this was achieved through the injection of stabilising <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> the foundations, which needed time to cure and solidify. Works then progressed to the walls and roof, and finally the decorative embellishments. Today, while part of the Orangery is a dedicated café, the rest is an international education centre of excellence for the Trust, training new craftsmen and restoration specialists.|$|E

5|$|The organisms {{responsible}} for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs. Nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun. Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via {{a process known as}} photosynthesis to convert raw <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> organic molecules, such as ATP, whose bonds can be broken to release energy. A few ecosystems, however, depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane, sulfides, or other non-luminal energy sources.|$|E
5|$|Young Macedonian {{men were}} {{typically}} expected {{to engage in}} hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their transhumance lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, land reclamation, and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle {{during the course of}} the 5thcenturyBC.|$|E

5|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Colonel Robin Olds (AFSN: 0-26046), United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force {{while serving as}} Strike Mission Commander in the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, Ubon Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand, against the Paul Doumer Bridge, a major north-south transportation link on Hanoi's Red River in North Vietnam, on 11 August 1967. On that date, Colonel Olds led his strike force of eight F-4C aircraft against a key railroad and highway bridge in North Vietnam. Despite intense, accurately directed fire, multiple surface-to-air missile attacks on his force, and continuous harassment by MiG fighters defending the target, Colonel Olds, with undaunted determination, indomitable courage, and professional skill, led his force through to help destroy this significant bridge. As a result the flow of war <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> this area was appreciably reduced. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness {{in the face of}} hostile forces, Colonel Olds reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.|$|E

25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} non-recyclable waste <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste <b>materials</b> <b>into</b> electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E
