5|$|The {{inner and}} outer Belpaire firebox was also smaller than the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class also {{constructed}} using welded steel.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Worsley found {{a command}} in the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy,</b> and, giving his age as 64 (he was {{actually}} 69), was appointed {{master of the}} Dalriada in August 1941. He worked to keep the harbour entrance at Sheerness clear of wrecked shipping and also carried out salvage work. His command was {{only for a few}} months for when the company that owned his vessel found out his true age, he was replaced. Unhappy at being put into the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> Reserve Pool, he continued to advocate for a useful posting.|$|E
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5000|$|The British Cemetery of Funchal {{contains}} three Commonwealth burials of the First World War {{and three}} from the Second World War, all seamen of the Royal or <b>Merchant</b> <b>navies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hanway now {{formulated}} {{plans for}} transferring boys to the merchant service on their discharge from naval ships {{and from then}} on, the Society was equally involved with both Royal and <b>Merchant</b> <b>navies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Merchant Seamen aboard British {{registered}} vessels during World War II {{were both}} male and female and might be registered with the British, Indian, Canadian, Australian or New Zealand <b>Merchant</b> <b>navies,</b> or the Fishing Fleet.|$|R
5|$|After the {{expedition}} {{he returned to}} work in the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> and eventually emigrated to New Zealand, where he worked on the docks in Wellington until poor health forced his retirement. He died destitute in the Ohiro Benevolent Home in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|Bulleid {{employed}} the same idiosyncratic numbering scheme {{that he had}} used for the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class, beginning at No. 21C101 and reaching No. 21C170 {{at the time of}} nationalisation. His scheme was abolished by British Railways, which renumbered existing these 34001-34070 and new locomotives 34071-34110.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War he {{initially}} {{served with the}} International Red Cross in France and Norway. In 1941, he falsified his age so he could rejoin the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy.</b> When officials discovered his actual age, {{he was released from}} duty. He died from lung cancer in 1943 in England.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s saw rising unemployment amongst <b>merchant</b> <b>navies</b> around the world. However, the BTC undertook a series of strategic mergers, and coupled with the continued support of the Shah of Iran, the APOC succeeded in strengthening its position within the industry.|$|R
50|$|Writing in {{the heyday}} of the British Empire, Conrad drew on his Polish {{heritage}} and on his personal experiences in the French and British <b>merchant</b> <b>navies,</b> to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world, while plumbing the depths of the human soul.|$|R
50|$|A Royal Hospital School {{opened on}} the site in 1712 to provide {{assistance}} and education to the orphans of seafarers in the Royal and <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navies.</b> In 1933 it moved to Holbrook, Suffolk (where it remains today); the old school buildings were reopened the following year as the National Maritime Museum.|$|R
5|$|EParslow and Smith were Masters in the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> and as civilians, {{they were}} not {{eligible}} for the VC. They were both posthumously promoted to Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) to facilitate the awarding of the VC.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the major deployments, Australian military units and service men and women served in other theatres of the war, typically as part of British-led Commonwealth forces. About 14,000Australians also served in the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> and crewed ships {{in many areas of}} the world.|$|E
5|$|John Benbow (10 March 16534 November 1702) was an English {{officer in}} the Royal Navy. He joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the <b>merchant</b> <b>navy</b> where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he {{returned}} to the Royal Navy and was commissioned.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938 {{the company}} {{worked with the}} Canadian <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy’s</b> Park Ships {{assembled}} at the West Coast Shipbuilders Ltd. (Allied Shipbuilders) Shipyard. In 1943 Fred Done became the sole owner of the company. In 1955, Done's sons, Brian and Barry, began working at Reliance Foundry, eventually succeeding Fred in 1963.|$|R
25|$|Writing in {{the heyday}} of the British Empire, Conrad drew on, among other things, his native Poland's {{national}} experiences and his own experiences in the French and British <b>merchant</b> <b>navies,</b> to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world—including imperialism and colonialism—and that profoundly explore the human psyche.|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom of Castile, {{united with}} the Kingdom of Aragon, had <b>merchant</b> <b>navies</b> that rivaled {{that of the}} Hanseatic League and Venice. Like the rest of late medieval Europe, {{restrictive}} gilds closely regulated {{all aspects of the}} economy-production, trade, and even transport. The most powerful of these corporations, the mesta, controlled the production of wool, Castile's chief export.|$|R
5|$|Steve Gerald James Wright {{was born}} in the Norfolk village of Erpingham in April 1958. Wright joined the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> after leaving school. In 1978, he married and had a son soon afterwards; the couple later divorced. In 1987 he married another woman; they {{separated}} in 1988, and later divorced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> {{class has}} been the subject of several models by {{different}} manufacturers, including Hornby Railways, Graham Farish and Minitrix. The first OO gauge model of an as-built locomotive was produced by Graham Farish in 1950 followed by Hornby/Wrenn in 1962 and by the modified version.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept was}} {{developed}} and tested by the five fighter catapult ships, commissioned as warships and commanded and crewed by the Royal Navy - but the CAM ships were merchant vessels, commanded and crewed by the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy.</b>|$|E
50|$|In some {{merchant}} marines or <b>merchant</b> <b>navies</b> of the world, some captains or shipmasters, {{with particular}} and recognized seniority {{in terms of}} true and effective ocean-going ships' command, they are named senior captain, senior shipmaster, master mariner senior grade or master mariner highest rank. The most senior, among others senior captain, is named first senior captain or, conforming to British tradition, commodore.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main deployments, Southern Rhodesian servicemen served in other theatres of the war. Rhodesian sailors in the Royal, South African and <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navies</b> crewed ships {{in many parts of}} the world, including the Indian Ocean, the Arctic and the Pacific. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron operated in Iran and Iraq in 1942–43, guarding oil wells and pipelines and supporting the British Tenth Army.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} {{originally}} located at Greenwich Hospital, and {{was based in}} what is now the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. The Hospital was founded in 1694, and the school in 1712, both by Royal Charter. The original purpose of the school was to provide assistance and education to the orphans of seafarers in the Royal and <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navies,</b> and it was once the largest school for navigation and seamanship in the country.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{struggled}} to find work {{in the era of}} the Great Depression. He considered moving abroad to join the Colonial Police in the British Overseas Territories and briefly entertained training as a sailor in the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy.</b> To gain experience he worked as a clerk in Wigan for the Greater Manchester Police. By 1937, tiring of life as an administrative clerk, Braham turned to the British armed forces for a more fulfilling career.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's chosen {{life as an}} explorer, his {{unreliable}} {{sources of}} income and his frequent extended absences, all placed severe strains on the marriage, and the couple became estranged around 1916. However, they continued {{to live in the}} same house until Bruce's death. Eillium became a <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> officer, eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which, by chance, bore the name Scotia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus, Bob, thus. There is {{a splendid}} {{apparatus}} invented by somebody which holds fast the two blocks. By {{means of an}} iron lever worked by one man, the rod is disengaged from both blocks at the same instant. You cannot work it wrong {{if you tried to}} do so. Now, the Government has only to compel the adoption of that apparatus in the Royal and <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navies,</b> and the thing is done." ...|$|R
50|$|The prime occupations of {{the people}} were pearl, conch, sea trade and {{transport}}. The mid-20th century saw {{a decline in the}} occupations {{of the people}} of Devipattinam. With the advent of the surface transport the <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navies</b> faded away and Devipattinam ceased to be a harbour and port. The cultured pearl industry and the mindless dragnet fishing that destroyed the coral reefs, choked the once robust pearl trade or Muthu Salabam. The conch and coral industries declined due to new regulations and restrictions.|$|R
50|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, {{entry to}} the school {{was limited to the}} children or grandchildren of seafarers. Until the 1950s, boys of the school were also required to join the Royal or <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navies,</b> and as such the education was focused on maritime matters. Although this requirement has not been in force for some decades, the school has retained certain naval traditions such as Naval uniform, divisions (a formal parade and march past as practised in the armed forces) and an element of marching.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. The <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the class has survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{detailed}} {{design for the}} <b>Merchant</b> <b>Navy</b> class was undertaken by the drawing office at Brighton works, but some work was also undertaken by Ashford and Eastleigh. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to {{a limited number of}} personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in Great Britain.|$|E
5000|$|King George V {{bestowed}} {{the title}} of the [...] "Merchant Navy" [...] on the British merchant shipping fleets following their service in the First World War; since then a number of other nations have also adopted use of that title or the similar [...] "Merchant Marine." [...] The following is a partial list of the <b>merchant</b> <b>navies</b> or <b>merchant</b> marines of various countries. In many countries the fleet's proper name is simply the capitalized version of the common noun ("Merchant Navy").|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Aldershot, Hampshire, England. He was a {{merchant}} marine officer, sailing the world in everything from tramp steamers to troop ships. In 1956, he emigrated to Australia and became an Australian citizen. He commanded various ships in the Australian and New Zealand <b>merchant</b> <b>navies,</b> and was the last master of the Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne as the law required that it have an officer on board while it was laid up waiting to be towed to China to be broken up.|$|R
50|$|The Bhadala {{is still}} a {{seafaring}} community, and almost all the Dhow captains on the Dubai to India route are Bhadala. Many are also employed by the <b>merchant</b> <b>navies</b> of India and Pakistan. Generally each dhow crew {{is made up of}} close kinsmen. In Pakistan, the Bhadala owns a significant part of that countries fishing fleet. In India, the Bhadala often employ Muslim Machiyar or Hindu Kharwa on their fishing boats, while in Pakistan most of the crew is made up of ethnic Bengali Muslims.|$|R
