500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|It {{was partly}} due to her urging that her husband entered {{politics}} and ran in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts against incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy. [...] The race constituted her first prolonged public exposure as she campaigned for him on a nightly basis. [...] She was seen as superficial and too deferential to him and some columnists labelled her a [...] "Stepford wife". [...] Late in that campaign, she gave a long interview to The Boston Globe. [...] Her statement in it {{that she and her}} husband had never had a serious argument during their married years came in for ridicule, and her portrayal of the couple's student years as financially impoverished, while they lived off of sales of George Romney's stock and loans, made her seem privileged and naïve and brought a harsh public reaction. [...] Boston University political science professor later said, [...] "She definitely hurt him in that race." [...] Asked following her husband's loss if she would be involved in future campaigns, Ann said, [...] "Never. You couldn't pay <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> again." [...] She later termed the experience [...] "a real education".|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2008, Gasol {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Lakers along with a 2010 second round draft pick for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the rights to Marc Gasol (Pau's younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first round draft picks. There has been some {{controversy}} surrounding the trade. Chris Wallace denied in an ESPN article that he had been ordered by owner Michael Heisley to make the Grizzlies more attractive to a potential buyer. Wallace said, [...] "No one put pressure on <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and Michael Heisley has actually been reluctant to move Pau." [...] He also said that they had been [...] "trolling" [...] the waters for a while and dealt with a number of teams. He selected the Lakers deal because [...] "it didn't get any better than this." [...] When Gasol departed the Grizzlies, he held twelve franchise records, including games played, minutes played, field goals made, free throws made and attempted, offensive, defensive, and total rebounds, blocked shots, turnovers, and points. Per game statistics, he leads Memphis in defensive and total rebounds along with blocked shots. On February 5, he made his first Lakers appearance in a game against the New Jersey Nets, during which he scored 24 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105–90 win over the Nets. On March 14, Gasol sprained his ankle in a game against the New Orleans Hornets, stepping on the foot of teammate Vladimir Radmanović in the first quarter. Gasol was expected to miss the remaining three games of the Lakers' road trip after x-rays came up negative. Gasol returned to the starting lineup on April 2 against the Portland Trail Blazers and played nearly thirty-two minutes, registering 10 points, six rebounds and seven assists. He admitted to feeling limited with the swelling in his ankle still present. Gasol helped the Lakers finish the regular season with {{the best record in the}} Western Conference (57–25), with him in the starting lineup the Lakers went 22–5. Kobe Bryant has also stated that playing with Gasol clicked from the start.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{wrote the}} role of Earl Partridge for Jason Robards, but Robards was {{initially}} unable {{to do it because}} of a serious staph infection. Anderson approached George C. Scott, who turned him down. Eventually, Robards was able to do the film. Robards said of his character, [...] "It was sort of prophetic that I be asked to play a guy going out in life. It was just so right for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> and bring what I know to it". According to Hall, much of the material with Partridge was based on Anderson watching his father die of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the New York Times Schwarz said that [...] "He hasn't asked me to change my political convictions," [...] speaking of President de Klerk. [...] "He knows that I'm implacably opposed to apartheid. Otherwise, there's no logic in asking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> job." [...] Nor, Mr. Schwarz added, was he bound for Washington to represent South Africa's five million whites. [...] "I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people." [...] A comment in the Boston Herald, typified the reaction among much of the US press: [...] "When a man who has devoted most of his life to the struggle for a new South Africa tells you that apartheid is dead and that sanctions are holding up its burial, he speaks with a moral authority that is difficult to assail." [...] The fact that Schwarz, a well known and respected anti-apartheid leader was willing to accept the post was widely acknowledged in South Africa as a further demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system.|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. It was hard for me sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

60|$|Intellectually {{there is}} hardly {{anything}} more than a certain will to believe, to divide the religious man who knows God to be utterly real, from the man who says that God is merely a formula to satisfy moral and spiritual phenomena. The former has encountered him, the other has as yet felt only unassigned impulses. One says God's will is so; the other that Right is so. One says God moves <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> or that; the other the Good Will in me which I share with you and all well-disposed men, moves <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> or that. But the former makes an exterior reference and escapes a risk of self-righteousness.|$|E
