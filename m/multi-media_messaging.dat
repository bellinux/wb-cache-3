40|$|Cellular {{networks}} are gradually shifting from voice only to voice and data {{due to increased}} demand for WWW, FTP and <b>multi-media</b> <b>messaging.</b> This has substantially increased the volume of cellular data traffic. Schemes have been proposed for co-existence and fair sharing of the available bandwidth between circuit switched voice and packetized data traffic. One popular scheme is based on delaying the last incoming acceptable voice call for a random {{amount of time and}} utilizing this time to service the accumulated data traffic to prevent excessive queuing delay in delivering the data traffic. However, this delay time has been usually modeled as being exponentially distributed. In this paper, this delay is modeled as a uniformly distributed random variable instead. This scheme is extended by delaying more than one call. Performance measures like voice and data blocking probability is plotted as function of last call delay. ...|$|E

With a sociometric survey, they empirically assess how consumers integrate and connect through mobile social networks, {{as well as}} how their network position influences knowledge creation and intentions to use four innovative mobile services: <b>multi-media</b> <b>messaging,</b> gaming, information, and transactions. Both personal (i. e., opinion leadership and experience with the communication mode) and similarity attributes of social network members {{have a significant impact on}} network position, that is, their level of individual connectedness and integration. In addition, the impact of this network position on knowledge creation is contingent upon the type of innovative service. In three out of four mobile service categories, integration exhib-its a negative effect on knowledge creation, whereas connectedness has a positive effect. Knowledge creation significantly influences intentions to use mobile services. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that carryover effects occur across the four service categories. Finally, the network’s perceived ability to adopt innovative mobile services has a different impact on usage intentions across the four service categories...|$|E
40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of cellular}} network {{performance and the}} maximization of its efficiency {{has long been an}} objective of wireless network providers. Since the introduction of GSM in the late 1980 s, the growth of traffic (and revenue per user) over wireless networks as the first 2 G and 3 G networks were deployed remained positive and relatively predictable. For those net-works, voice and messaging services such as Short Message Service (SMS) and <b>Multi-media</b> <b>Messaging</b> Service (MMS) were dominating traffic. However, {{in the first decade of}} the twenty-first century, the deployment of high-performance wide-area wireless packet data networks, such as 3 GPP HSPA and 3 GPP 2 HRPD, has combined with advances in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) capability, multi-media source coding, streaming protocols and low-power high-resolution displays to deliver the so-called smartphone. This device has fundamentally changed the trajectory of traffic growth over broadband wireless networks. In June 2010, The Nielsen Company reported ([1], Figure 1. 1) an annual increase between Q 1 - 2009 and Q 1 - 2010 of 230 % in average smartphone data consumption. Nielsen further reported that some users were approaching 2 GB per month in total data usage, and that the top 6 % of smartphone users were consuming nearly 50 % of total data bandwidth.

40|$|Spatial {{messaging}} is {{a direct}} extension to text and other <b>multi-media</b> <b>messaging</b> services that have become highly popular with the current pervasiveness of mobile communication. It offers benefits especially to mobile computing, providing localised and therefore potentially more appropriate delivery of nearly arbitrary content. Location {{is one of the}} most interesting attributes that can be added to messages in current applications, including gaming, social networking, or advertising services. However, location is also highly critical in terms of privacy. If a spatial messaging platform could collect the location traces of all its users, detailed profiling would be possible – and, considering commercial value of such profiles, likely. In this paper, we present Air-Writing, an approach to spatial messaging that fully preserves user privacy while offering global scalability, different client interface options, and flexibility in terms of application areas. We contribute both an architecture and a specific implementation of an attribute based messaging platform with special support for spatial messaging and rich clients for J 2 ME, Google Android, and Apple iPhone. The centralised client/server approach utilises groups for anonymous message retrieval and client caching and filtering as well as randomised queries for obscuring traces. An initial user study with 20 users shows that the overall concept is easily understandable and that it seems useful to end-users. An analysis of real-world and simulated location traces shows that user privacy can be ensured, but with a trade-off between privacy protection and consumed network resources...|$|E

40|$|Mobility in {{conjunction}} with communication facilities {{in the form of}} mobile telephony seems {{to be one of the}} major technology trends observed throughout the last decade. Many experts and analysts expect that the arrival of mobile services such as mobile commerce, location-based services, <b>multi-media</b> <b>messaging,</b> and mobile gaming in the third generation of mobile networks will be the next step in this success story. However, protecting service providers from fraud and mobile users from new threats such as identity theft or other attacks on privacy and security matters is equally challenging. Historically, cryptography has been used to protect information in the digital world from eavesdropping or tampering. In future person-to-person and person-to-service interaction scenarios cryptography will be of at least equal importance. However, the situation today is not people-centric but more application-centric, i. e. for each application new security measures are defined and implemented. As an example one may just consider that almost any access control in the Internet is managed through simple account/password schemes different for each application. But passwords are known to be a generally weak security measure in many practical settings. From the user perspective the account/password approach additionally leads to numerous login accounts an individual has to manage - something which is inconvenient and as a consequence often error-prone. Cryptographic measures can be applied but shifting towards such mechanisms especially in mobile settings is often hard to implement since people cannot easily carry around their personal cryptographic keys, let alone memorize them or input them when needed. Therefore, we believe that some kind of personal security assistant or device is needed that safely keeps a user's security-sensitive data and enforces the user's security-related interests. Otherwise, people will be forced to use traditional weak protection mechanisms that are applicable without strong cryptographic measures - a situation we do not think is desirable in the digital age of tomorrow. Smartcards are devices that could be used to solve at least some of the problems mentioned. They are tamper-resistant, can safely store information, are able to perform unobserved (cryptographic) operations, and can be conveniently carried around. As such they seem to be ideal candidates for personal security modules. However, it is yet unclear how smartcards can be empowered to actually play the role of true personal and ubiquitous security modules. Furthermore, the smartcard alone is not sufficient to act as a security module since it lacks reasonable user interfaces such as a display and input facilities. Thus, suitable terminals are needed that allow users to communicate with their smartcards, i. e. personal security modules are comprised of suitable terminals and personalized smartcards that work together in order to fulfill the users' needs. Henceforth, this thesis will contribute approaches, architectures, protocols, and systems how smartcards can be put in place to become true security modules for people in the digital age. The most visible contributions of this thesis are as follows: The JiniCard framework for the integration of off-the-shelf smartcards into local environments. It enables smartcards that have traditionally played the role of passive servers to become truely active entities after they are inserted into suitably configured card terminals. Users could carry around their smartcard, insert them into available readers and make immediate use of their security services. The approach is centered around the idea to dynamically instantiate ``software substitutes'' for resource-limited devices such as smartcards. The so-called Personal Card Assistant approach solving the problem of smartcard usage in a ``hostile'' environment. It is comprised of an off-the-shelf personalized user terminal - such as a PDA - that cooperates with a personal smartcard. The personal terminal is used instead of terminals considered to be public, i. e. it acts as a ``trust amplifier'' for its user. The advantage is that mobile users communicate with their smartcard through their own mobile terminal which they possibly consider much more trustworthy than other unknown components. The personal terminal and the smartcard are linked together using cryptographic measures such that no device is usable without the other. The WebSIM system that integrates into the Internet the SIM smartcards found in all GSM mobile phones. In this approach people now can use mobile phones as ``wireless smartcard readers'' which are reachable from the Internet by means of a small HTTP Web server implemented in the SIM. This approach allows among others to perform security-critical operations such as authentication to be initiated from a remote context, e. g. from an Internet shop. Hence, smartcards become Internet nodes that encapsulate security services a mobile user offers to peers. The SIMspeak platform allowing for the execution of mobile code within a smartcard. This approach was motivated by the need for end-to-end secure communication between a service provider and its customer and the ability to easily create electronic signatures on small devices. It allows a service provider to ``rent'' persistent storage on a user's personal smartcard, e. g. to store cryptographic keys used to send end-to-end encrypted mobile code from the provider to the user's smartcard. The smartcard then becomes the most active component in a personal security module and uses available terminals to communicate with its user. This approach essentially shifts as much security-critical components and computations as possible from less trustworthy components into the secure context of the smartcard. This approach leads to new trust models for smartcard issuers which can be particularly well applied in the context of electronic signature creation in mobile scenarios. These results can be used independently from each other but equally well composed into more general security solutions. As such they can be considered as building blocks enabling the composition of suitable personal security modules meeting the personal security demands of the future. Summing up, this thesis provides solutions to the question how smartcards can become true personal security modules. It does this by proposing concrete architectures and protocols all of which have been prototypically implemented to yield meaningful proofs-of-concepts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 - Image-based data services, like {{wireless}} {{photos with}} camera phones and <b>multi-media</b> <b>message</b> services, are gaining in popularity and wireless data market share. Dynamic image adaptation techniques {{have been shown}} to be effective to provide required tradeoffs between image quality, network bandwidth availability, and wireless transmission latency, enabling low-cost, best-effort wireless image data transmission [1, 2]. This paper investigates the effect of image adaptation techniques on image servers, including server latency and server capacity, and end-to-end service latency using a proposed performance evaluation and exploration framework. We first motivate the need for dynamic adaptation techniques by demonstrating the greatly reduced end-toend service latency using the proposed dynamic adaptation technique over the existing methods. We next investigate the impact of image adaptation techniques under overloaded server conditions. While the proposed dynamic adaptation technique can provide server performance improvement (8 x lower maximum server latency and 6 x server capacity increase), even more significant server performance increases can be achieved through the use of a novel configurable hardware/software (HW/SW) architecture for the image adaptation technique. The proposed HW/SW architecture is capable of achieving significantly higher server performance (server capacity increase of 18 x and server latency decrease of 34 x), while accommodating several different types of image adaptation techniques. Experimental results show that customized image-based data services can be enabled at significantly reduced server costs, and thereby reducing overall wireless service cost...|$|R

Information is transmitted in form of packets of bits over a lossy media, such that transmitted packets may get lost. In order to solve the packet lossy problem over heterogeneous networks we analyze a model in which the messages are encoded into a set of packets that are sent to the receiver. The encoding is such that the receiver is able to recover the messages without receiving the entire encoding, that is, each message can be recovered from a particular subset of packets, with cardinality {{greater than or equal to}} a threshold. In particular we prove a lower bound on the encoding length in such model when two messages are transmitted.

In cc-pi calculus, policies are expressed as soft constraints and the parties involved in the negotiation as communicating processes.
