40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} ground penetrating radar rough ground surface clutter by numerical modeling of wave scattering, and establish a strategy to suppress the clutter for given test signals. The goal {{is to improve the}} GPR detection statistics for small, buried, low-contrast nonmetallic antipersonnel mines. Using a model of an experimentally measured impulse GPR signal, we simulate the ground surface and buried low-contrast <b>mine</b> <b>target</b> scattered re-sponses. We employ a 2 D finite difference time domain (FDTD) method to analyze the pulse shape, delay, and amplitude characteristics of the scattered waves—with and without buried nonmetallic mine targets—as a function of roughness parameters. Five hundred Monte Carlo simulations of various test cases of specified ground root mean square height and correlation length were run to generate statistics for the clutter and target signal variations. In addition, the effectiveness of identifying and removing the ground surface clutter signal for detecting subsurface targets is presented. Results indicate that even with moderate roughness, statistics can be generated to enhance the detection of small, shallow, low-contrast targets. Key Words.

Moreover, the binding site of oridonin on the chaperone was identified by a mass-based approach combined with Molecular Dynamics simulations. Biological significance: Although natural products showed high efficiency and several of these agents have now entered in clinical trials, information concerning the mechanisms of action at a molecular level of many of them is very poor or completely missed. Nevertheless, the identification of the molecular target of a drug candidate has several advantages. The most significant is the ability to set up target-based assays and to allow structure-activity relationship studies to guide medicinal chemistry efforts towards lead optimization. The knowledge of drug targets can also facilitate the identification of potential toxicities or side effects, if there is any precedent of toxicities for the identified target. Achieving this in an effective, unbiased and efficient manner subsists as a significant challenge for the new era in drug discovery and optimization. In the present study, we used a chemical proteomic approach aimed to define the possible protein target of the ent-kaurane diterpene oridonin. This natural compound has drawn a rising attention for cancer biologists due to its remarkable anti-tumor activities: accumulating evidence has suggested that oridonin is able to hamper the progression of tumor, mitigate tumor burden and alleviate cancer syndrome, which may improve greatly the survival rates of cancer patients; however molecular mechanisms by which this compound exerts its anti-tumor activities still remained to be discovered. We identified the molecular chaperone HSP 70 1 A as an oridonin target in Jurkat cells, thus suggesting a mechanism of action for the diterpene consistent with the multiple biological activities described for it. HSP 70 inhibition by oridonin might indeed simultaneously result in the impairment of some of client proteins, thus in turn affecting several molecular pathways. Shedding light on the molecular basis of the biological activity of oridonin, our findings may be relevant for possible therapeutic applications of oridonin, such as its use in combination and the design of new therapeutic approaches. In addition, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of chemical proteomic approaches in drug discovery studies and in orphan drug molecular target identification...|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{frequent}} subgraphs {{have been}} an important sort of targeted patterns in the pattern mining literatures, where most works deal with databases holding a number of graph transactions, e. g., chemical structures of compounds. These methods rely heavily on the downward-closure property (DCP) of the support measure to ensure an efficient pruning of the candidate patterns. When switching to the emerging scenario of single-graph databases such as Google Knowledge Graph and Facebook social graph, the traditional support measure {{turns out to be}} trivial (either 0 or 1). However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, all attempts to redefine a single-graph support resulted in measures that either lose DCP, or are no longer semantically intuitive. This paper <b>targets</b> <b>mining</b> patterns in the single-graph setting. We resolve the "DCP-intuitiveness" dilemma by shifting the <b>mining</b> <b>target</b> from frequent subgraphs to frequent neighborhoods. A neighborhood is a specific topological pattern where a vertex is embedded, and the pattern is frequent if it is shared by a large portion (above a given threshold) of vertices. We show that the new patterns not only maintain DCP, but also have equally significant semantics as subgraph patterns. Experiments on real-life datasets display the feasibility of our algorithms on relatively large graphs, as well as the capability of mining interesting knowledge that is not discovered in prior works.
