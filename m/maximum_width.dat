5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the <b>maximum</b> <b>width</b> of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their <b>maximum</b> <b>width</b> is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the tip. In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E

25|$|The 1771 English cricket {{season is}} notable for the infamous wide bat affair which {{resulted}} in a rule being established within the Laws of Cricket whereby the <b>maximum</b> <b>width</b> of the bat has ever since been four and a quarter inches.|$|E
25|$|In 1771, an {{incident}} {{on the field}} of play {{led to the creation of}} a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and so all the Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the <b>maximum</b> <b>width</b> of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the <b>maximum</b> <b>width.</b>|$|E

It also usually contains external connectors, so it attaches in a window in the computer case so any connectors are accessible from outside.

SH (Short Handle) is the most common adult size, whilst long handle and long blade options are also available. Children's sizes increase in length and width as the size increase. Although most adult bats will be the <b>maximum</b> <b>width</b> permitted (4.25 inches), no generally available cricket bat is the maximum length of 38 inches, indeed very few exceed 35 inches.|$|E

25|$|On December 10, 2004, the governor's office {{announced}} that the signature span concept had been scrapped, with the bridge to be the simple viaduct originally proposed. The design, having gone full circle, remained expensive due to the continued high cost of materials. Many argued {{that there would be}} little difference in final cost with this lesser proposal since that concept required obtaining new permits, perhaps adding another two or three years; furthermore, a viaduct may not even be able to obtain Coast Guard approval, since the <b>maximum</b> <b>width</b> of the ship channel would be reduced by almost half. Local reaction to this announcement was intense, with most suggesting that the bridge be built to appear as proposed— either in the steel material as bid or using a reinforced concrete tower of similar appearance but of lower cost.|$|E
