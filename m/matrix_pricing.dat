40|$|Are {{cash flows}} {{informative}} and predictive in valuing thinly traded assets? We investigate {{the extent to}} which cash-flow and discount-factor information plays a role in pricing thinly traded assets. We focus on pricing the various traded tranches in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) by developing an adaptation of the Campbell-Shiller dynamic Gordon growth model, which we term a Self-Propagating Rolling-Window VAR. We apply this to cash flows and actual bond prices. In contrast to stocks, we find that cash flows are informative in valuing thinly traded assets. Our predicted cash flow yields closely resemble ex-post realized transaction yields, and these predicted yields even outperform yields based on <b>matrix</b> <b>prices</b> especially for subordinated tranches. We also find that discount-factor information, while important is not as informative as cash flows in this setting, except after the financial crisis where the impact of discount-factor information increases somewhat. Our results provide a good representation of CMBS yields; investors can readily apply this algorithm to infer values of other types of thinly traded assets where cash flows are observable...|$|R
40|$|Consider a ®rm {{that markets}} {{multiple}} products, each manufactured using several resources representing {{various types of}} capital and labor, and a linear production technology. The ®rm faces uncertain product demand and has the option to dynamically readjust its resource investment levels, thereby changing the capacities of its linear manufacturing process. The cost to adjust a resource level either up or down {{is assumed to be}} linear. The model developed here explicitly incorporates both capacity investment decisions and production decisions, and is general enough to include reversible and irreversible investment. The product demand vectors for successive periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. The optimal investment strategy is determined with a multi-dimensional newsvendor model using demand distributions, a technology <b>matrix,</b> <b>prices</b> (product contribution margins), and marginal investment costs. Our analysis highlights an important conceptual distinction between deterministic and stochastic environments: the optimal investment strategy in our stochastic model typically involves some degree of capacity imbalance which can never be optimal when demand is known.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the collect impact and the effects on some {{fundamental}} variables of the new indirect tax on retailer sales of some fuels that has been implemented by the regional governments (Impuesto sobre las Ventas Minoristas de Determinados Hidrocarburos (IVMH)). The methodology we use is based on a price model applied to a regional social accounting matrix (SAM) where we introduce the new tax. The reason why the SAM model is used is because the new tax is contributing to the regional tax collection and so a model with a regional perspective was needed. The database used in the analysis is the SAMAND 95 (Social Accounting Matrix of Andalusia, Spain, for 1995). The main results of the paper show that the IVMH has lightly inflationary effects on the consumer prices and lightly deflationary effects on the production prices.

Using a panel of rural Ethiopian households, we test whether the restrictions implied by the theory hold empirically, as well as whether distinct patterns of price risk aversion emerge.

40|$|Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) are {{normally}} used to analyse the income generation process. They are also useful, however, for analysing the cost transmission and price formation mechanisms. For price contributions, Roland-Holst and Sancho (1995) used the SAM structure to analyse {{the price and}} cost linkages through {{a representation of the}} interdependence between activities, households and factors. This paper is a further analysis of the cost transmission mechanisms, in which I add the capital account to the endogenous components of the Roland-Holst and Sancho approach. By doing this I reflect the responses of prices to the exogenous shocks in savings and investment. I also present an additive decomposition of the global price effects into categories of interdependence that isolates the impact on price levels of shocks in the capital account.

Such a method for the estimation of breadth relies critically on the appropriate estimation of the covariance <b>matrix</b> of <b>price</b> fluctuations (returns). In a emerging market such as South African it is not surprising to find that the breadth is low because of market concentration, exposure to the global commodity cycle and currency volatility.

40|$|Recent {{reforms in}} the Turkish {{electricity}} sector since 2001 aim to introduce a tariff system that reflects costs. This is expected to affect the production and consumer prices of electricity. The changes in electricity prices are then reflected in production costs in other segments of the economy. Subsequently, producer and consumer prices will be affected. The potential impact {{of the changes in}} electricity prices that the ongoing electricity reforms in Turkey will bring about may have important implications on the price formation in economic activities and the cost of living for households. This paper evaluates the potential impacts of changes in electricity prices from a social accounting <b>matrix</b> (SAM) <b>price</b> modeling perspective.

In this paper, we examine whether this information in cap and swaption prices {{is consistent with}} realized movements of the interest rate term structure. To extract an option-implied interest rate covariance matrix from cap and swaption prices, we use Libor market models and discrete-tenor string models as a modelling framework. We propose a flexible parameterization of the interest rate covariance matrix, which cannot be generated by standard low-factor term structure models.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} tools from the random matrix theory (RMT) to {{estimates}} of correlations across volatility of various {{assets in the}} S&P 500. The volatility inputs are estimated by modeling price fluctuations as GARCH(1, 1) process. The corresponding correlation matrix is constructed. It is found that the distribution of {{a significant number of}} eigenvalues of the volatility correlation matrix matches with the analytical result from the RMT. Furthermore, the empirical estimates of short and long-range correlations among eigenvalues, which are within the RMT bounds, match with the analytical results for Gaussian Orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of the RMT. To understand the information content of the largest eigenvectors, we estimate the contribution of GICS industry groups in each eigenvector. In comparison with eigenvectors of correlation <b>matrix</b> for <b>price</b> fluctuations, only few of the largest eigenvectors of volatility correlation matrix are dominated by a single industry group.

50|$|Diamonds {{in larger}} sizes are rare, and their price is {{dependent}} on the individual features of the diamond. Fashion and marketing aspects can also cause fluctuations in price. This makes it difficult to establish a uniform and readily understood pricing system. Martin Rapaport produces the Rapaport Diamond Report, which lists prices for polished diamonds. The Rapaport Diamond Report is relatively expensive to subscribe to and, as such, is not readily available to consumers and investors. Each week, there are <b>matrices</b> of diamond <b>prices</b> for various shapes of brilliant cut diamonds, by colour and clarity within size bands. The <b>price</b> <b>matrix</b> for brilliant cuts alone exceeds 1,400 entries, and even this is achieved only by grouping some grades together. There are considerable price shifts near the edges of the size bands, so a 0.49 carat mg stone may list at $5,500 per carat = $2,695, while a 0.50 carat mg stone of similar quality lists at $7,500 per carat = $3,750. This difference seems surprising, but in reality stones near the top of a size band (or rarer fancy coloured varieties) tend to be uprated slightly. Some of the price jumps are related to marketing and consumer expectations. For example, a buyer expecting a 1 carat mg diamond solitaire engagement ring may be unwilling to accept a 0.99 carat mg diamond.|$|R

These methods drastically reduce the ambiguities while finding stock groups using the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{artificial}} stock market characterized by heterogeneous and informed agents is presented. The heterogeneous agents {{are seen as}} nodes of sparsely connected graphs. The agents trade risky assets and are characterized by sentiments, amount of cash and stocks owned. Agents share information and sentiments by means of interactions determined by graphs. A central market maker (clearing house mechanism) determines the price processes for each stock {{at the intersection of}} the demand and supply curves. In this framework, the statistical properties of the univariate and multivariate process of prices and returns are studied. Importantly, concerning univariate price processes, the proposed model is able to reproduce unit root, volatility cluster and fat tails of returns. The multivariate price process exhibits both static and dynamic stylized facts, in particular the presence of static factors and common trends. Static factors are studied making reference to the cross-correlation between returns of different stocks, whereas the common trends are investigated considering the variance-covariance <b>matrix</b> of <b>prices.</b> The proposed approach allows to endogenously reproduce the multivariate stylized facts...|$|R
