The base, , was the sixth largest employer {{in the state of}} Utah and is the third largest employer which is neither the state government nor a state-funded higher education institution. SR-103 is one of four Utah state highways that connect to Hill Air Force Base, the others being SR-97, SR-168 and SR-232, Only SR-168 has a lower average daily traffic count, with roughly 1,000vehicles-per-day traveling along the highway compared to SR-103's approximately 16,000vehicles-per-day. This is a decline from previous years (in 2007 the average on SR-103 was 22,525; in 2006, the average was 22,215; in 2005, 21,275). Four percent of this traffic was composed of trucks. The <b>measurement</b> <b>point</b> for the traffic counts is at the eastern terminus of SR-103, the entrance to the Falcon Hill National Aerospace Research Park. The highway is codified as Utah Code §72-4-116, and is designated as a minor arterial, which the Federal Highway Administration defines as linking major arterials at a lower volume than a primary arterial.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{technology}} of thermal error compensation in positioning platform with large trip and high precision, selecting the temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> rationally is particular important for successfully establishing the model of compensation. The method uses simulation to track platform heat distribution and thermal deformation under various thermal conditions. Temperature variables are grouped by different surfaces of the platform. Then a degree of grey incidence from grey system theory is introduced to identify the key temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> of each surface. Through the experiment data of thermal stress coupling analysis on the platform, the degree of correlation between all temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> and thermal displacement can be solved. The key temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> are confirmed by the largest value {{of the degree of}} correlation of each surface...|$|R

After measurement {{data are}} {{collected in the}} form of position vectors, the data analysis software must derive the necessary information from the set of points. Uncertainty is an important issue in this data analysis. When extreme fit approaches are employed for form error evaluation, the uncertainty is closely related to the sampling of <b>measurement</b> <b>points.</b> Those <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> are a subset of the true surface and, consequently, the extreme fit result differs from the true value. In this paper, we investigate the functional relationship between such an extreme fit uncertainty and the sampling of <b>measurement</b> <b>points.</b> The important questions to be answered are: what parameters affect the functional relationship, and how can this scheme be applied to sampling of <b>measurement</b> <b>points.</b> An analytic and experimental approach are presented for a flatness example...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel feature-based sensor distribution approach for {{root cause analysis}} and diagnosis of product 6 -sigma variation faults in multi-station assembly processes. Traditional approaches in sensor distribution {{are based on the}} assumption that <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> can be selected at arbitrary locations on the part or subassembly. This causes challenges such as difficult calibration of measurement system, increased errors of measured features, and lack of explicit relations between measured features and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD 2 ̆ 6 T). In the proposed approach, we develop methodology to maximize the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> that are placed at critical design features called Key Characteristics (KCs) which are classified into: Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) and Key Control Characteristics (KCCs) and represent critical product and process design features, respectively. In particular, KCs have dimensional and geometric tolerances which provides necessary design reference model for process control and diagnosis of product 6 -sigma variation fault. The proposed approach integrates state-of-the-art approaches with GA-based procedure for optimal sensor distribution. In addition to maximizing the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> that are placed at KCs, the proposed approach allow to obtain minimum required production system diagnosability by integrating state-of-the-art approaches (unrestricted location of <b>measurement</b> <b>points)</b> with the developed GA-based procedure (restricted location of <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> to the pre-defined KCs).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for optimal key characteristics-based sensor distribution in a multi-station assembly process, {{for the purpose of}} diagnosing variation sources responsible for product quality defects in a timely manner. Current approaches for sensor distribution are {{based on the assumption that}} <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> can be allocated at arbitrary locations on the part or subassembly. This not only presents challenges in the implementation of these approaches but additionally does not allow required product assurance and quality control standards to be integrated with them, due to lack of explicit relations between measured features and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD 2 ̆ 6 T). Furthermore, it causes difficulty in calibration of measurement system and increases the likelihood of measurement error due to the introduction of <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> not defined in GD 2 ̆ 6 T. In the proposed approach, we develop methodology for optimal sensor allocation for 6 -sigma root cause analysis that maximizes the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> placed at critical design features called Key Characteristics (KCs) which are classified into: Key Product Characteristics and Key Control Characteristics and represent critical product and process design features, respectively. In particular, KCs have defined dimensional and geometric tolerances which provides necessary design reference model for process control and diagnosis of product 6 -sigma variation faults. The proposed approach allows obtaining minimum required production system 6 -sigma diagnosability. A feature-based procedure is proposed which includes Genetic Algorithm-based approach (allowing pre-defined KCs as the <b>measurement</b> <b>points)</b> and state-of-the-art approaches (unrestricted location of <b>measurement</b> <b>points)</b> to iteratively include arbitrary <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> together with KCs in the final sensor layout.

40|$|Structural damage {{detection}} methods using vibration measurements {{have been developed}} for decades. Measurement selections may affect {{damage detection}} results, because inevitable uncertainties are involved in vibration testing. A new sensor placement index is defined as the ratio of two parameters, namely, the contribution of <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> to a Fisher information matrix, and the damage sensitivity to the measurement noise. A large value of the contribution vector represents that the corresponding <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> are sensitive to the damage and <b>measurements</b> at these <b>points</b> are more prominent for structural damage identification, whereas a small noise sensitivity value indicates <b>measurement</b> <b>points</b> that are less influenced by noises. Consequently, the points with large index values are chosen as the measurement subset. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified using a laboratory-tested steel frame.
