50|$|Establishing a <b>moisture</b> <b>balance</b> {{beneficial}} to the wound bed is another prerequisite of care. The natural response to injury is inflammation typified by the local expression of histamine and bradykinin and leading to vasodilation of the vessels that are in relative {{close proximity to the}} site of injury. As serum based fluid moves out of the vessels into the interstitial spaces the resultant soft tissue oedema manifests on the wound surface as exudate. In the chronic wound this exudate contains a surfeit of proteolytic enzymes and other components not seen in acute wounds and these compounds have a corrosive effect on the wound bed and surrounding peri-wound skin. The application of dressings, topical negative pressure, compression garments and leg elevation/exercise have been identified as methods for management of wound exudate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{temperature}} of the conche is controlled and varies for different types of chocolate. Generally higher temperature leads to a shorter required processing time. Temperature varies from around 49 C for milk chocolate to up to 82 C for dark chocolate. The elevated temperature leads to a partially caramelized flavor and in milk chocolate promotes the Maillard reaction. [...] The chocolate passes through three phases during conching. In the dry phase the material is in powdery form, and the mixing coats the particles with fat. Air movement through the conche removes some moisture and volatile substances, which may give an acidic note to the flavor. <b>Moisture</b> <b>balance</b> affects the flavor and texture of the finished product because, after the particles are coated with fat, moisture and volatile chemicals {{are less likely to}} escape.|$|E

Results from coupled simulations - coupled soil heat and moisture transfer equations and complete surface heat and <b>moisture</b> <b>balances</b> - are compared to results from linear simulations. It is shown that the coupled calculations give notably higher heat losses. Surface temperature, the driving force for heat loss via the ground, is identified as a first important source for these deviations: it is shown that while the averages of the surface temperature are almost equal in coupled and linear calculations, the amplitude in the coupled simulation is considerably higher.

Also, MESMO 2 is coupled to an existing terrestrial model, which allows for the exchange of carbon, water and energy between land and the atmosphere.

50|$|As soon as steam enters, the yarns {{quantity}} of moisture rises at once, {{caused by the}} heating of the yarn and by steam condensation. According to Speakmann the following phenomena {{can be seen in}} the stretched woolen fiber: The cystine side chains are subjected to a hydrolysis at the sulphur bridge, where cystine is dissolved into cysteine and a not yet isolated sulphonic acid.An ionization can be seen at the bridges that were produced from salt liberation. Due to the increase of temperature in the fibers during steaming an oscillation of the molecules is produced which leads to the bursting of the hydrogen bridges; now residual valencies are set free which are able to saturate with the dipole water. The water then acts like a lubrication between the individual molecules. Thus the bonds of the main chains between each other are dissolved by the side chains, the individual polypeptide chains can shift against each other and the tensions find their equilibrium (see illustration 4). When the steaming of the yarn is continued, new side chains are formed between the individual components of the main chains. When finally the yarn is dried, i.e. the <b>moisture</b> <b>balance</b> occurring within the yarn, salt is liberated again and hydrogen bridges are formed. Now the individual polypeptide chains can no longer be shifted against each other and the fibers regained their former closeness, however without having remarkable tensions inside.|$|E

The growth environment of Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii kom.) on the mountains in the eastern Qaidam Basin was first determined by comparing precipitation and temperature estimates from two spatial datasets (PRISM and World Climate). <b>Moisture</b> <b>balance</b> was calculated as the sum of simulated moisture deficit (negative) and surplus using a modified Thornthwaite water balance model, and used as a proxy of biological drought conditions. Using data during 1956 - 2005, we established the transfer function to reconstruct a 2847 -year series of January-June <b>moisture</b> <b>balance</b> (843 BCE- 2004 CE). With an adjusted R- 2 value of 0. 654 of the transfer function and strong performance in validation, the reconstructed January June <b>moisture</b> <b>balance</b> can be considered an excellent indicator of biological drought conditions for the study region. The reconstructed series showed strong correlations with reconstructed PDSI in the monsoon Asian region, representing a region of 10 degrees latitudes by 20 degrees longitudes. Using the reconstructed series, we identified centennial scale dry periods since 843 BCE: 381 - 277 BCE, 425 - 520 CE, 1108 - 1212 CE, 1428 - 1516 CE, and 1634 - 1743 CE. Additionally it had statistically significant negative correlations with a monsoon intensity proxy based on oxygen stable isotope from southwestern China (Dongge Cave).

40|$|The water {{chemistry}} of lake systems {{on the edge}} of the Antarctic continent responds quickly to changes in the <b>moisture</b> <b>balance.</b> This is expressed as increasing salinity and decreasing lake water level during dry periods, and the opposite during wet periods. The diatom composition of the lakes also changes with these fluctuations in salinity and lake water depth. This is important, as their siliceous remains become incorporated into lake sediments and can provide long-term records of past salinity using transfer functions. In order to develop transfer functions, diatoms and {{water chemistry}} data were inter-calibrated from five different East Antarctic oases, namely the Larsemann Hills, the Bolingen Islands, the Vestfold Hills, the Rauer Islands and the Windmill Islands. Results indicate that salinity is the most important environmental variable explaining the variance in the diatom flora in East Antarctic lakes. In oligo- saline lakes the variance is mainly explained by lake water depth. This dataset was used to construct a weighted averaging transfer function for salinity in order to infer historical changes in the <b>moisture</b> <b>balance.</b> This model has a jack-knifed r(2) of 0. 83 and a RMSEP of 0. 31. The disadvantage of this transfer function is that salinity changes in oligo- saline lakes are reconstructed inaccurately due to the 'edge effect' and due to the low species turnover along the salinity gradient at its lower end. In order to infer changes in the <b>moisture</b> <b>balance</b> in these lakes, a second transfer function using weighted averaging partial least squares (with two components) for depth was constructed. This model has a jack-knifed r(2) of 0. 76 and a RMSEP of 0. 22. Both transfer functions can be used to infer climate driven changes in the <b>moisture</b> <b>balance</b> in lake sediment cores from oligo-, hypo-, meso- and hyper-saline lakes in East Antarctic oases between 102 - 758 degreesE.

Results that link the green roof characteristics with respective traditional insulation layers are produced for all cities and it is found that optimising the plant and soil characteristics of green roofs in some climates could substitute more than 125 mm of roof insulation, while less optimum green roof types could only replace about 25 mm of roof insulation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend {{previous}} mathematical {{results on the}} probabilistic modeling of base flows driven by spatial and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture and affected by intermittent rainfall forcings and by heterogeneous transport, soil, and vegetation properties. Rainfall is modeled as a zero-dimensional marked Poisson process with exponentially distributed intensity, and various descriptors of spatial heterogeneity are used. The master equation for the probability distribution (pdf) of the base flow (here epitomized by the mean daily flow rate in suitably sized catchments) and its moment-generating function are derived by coupling soil <b>moisture</b> <b>balances</b> with a traveltime formulation of transport. Exact solutions for the flow moments are derived in the following cases: (1) two tributary areas in parallel, (2) the rigorous extension to N subbasins, and (3) a simplified geomorphic arrangement of subbasins. Base flow statistics obtained by naive spatial averages of heterogeneous properties exhibit the same mean of the exact solution but may significantly overestimate higher-order moments. Relatively wet climate conditions seem to enhance {{the effects of the}} heterogeneity of soil, vegetation, transport, and geomorphic properties, particularly for low-stage flow regimes.

The large-scale budgets of heat and moisture are examined in the analyzed and model atmosphere. The daily operational analyses and forecasts (day 1 through day 5) produced for the summer seasons comprising June, July and August of 1995 and 1993 have been considered for the purpose. The principal aim {{of the study is}} two-fold.
