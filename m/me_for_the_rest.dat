500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Cardiff manager Malky Mackay {{was proud}} of his players despite their defeat: [...] "We wanted to come here and win today but the players have done the club proud, I think today we were playing against a top team and I think we have got a lot to be proud of." [...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'd buy {{her with}} all the rest,--a girl that wouldn't look at me as I am,--would take <b>me</b> <b>for</b> all <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> you know,--that's <b>the</b> way of the world." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{looked me}} over with frank curiosity, as though I were {{some sort of}} a strange animal, and then ignored <b>me</b> utterly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my wait. Then Johnny Upright himself arrived, and I was summoned upstairs to confer with him.|$|R
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still, {{she often}} floundered {{about what to}} do and how to spend her time ("drifting" [...] was the word she {{frequently}} used), always struggling with her many eccentricities, and her lifelong melancholy and moodiness. As she approached her sixtieth birthday, she told a frequent walking companion [...] "In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of my life." [...] To another friend, she said, in 1971, [...] "I suppose I suffer from very deep depression." [...] It is also arguable, says one biographer, that she was bipolar. [...] "I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me," [...] she said in 1933.|$|E

60|$|It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his {{overcoat}} until night. He came {{a few minutes}} ago--5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen.

60|$|When {{they finally}} left <b>me</b> I lay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> day stupid and half- comatose. There {{is such a}} thing as {{anaesthesia}} of pain, engendered by pain too exquisite to be borne. And I have known that anaesthesia.|$|R

6000|$|... "He has {{kissed my}} hand," [...] she said. [...] "Does {{that tell you}} enough? Don't let him sit next me on the way home! I have borne all I can bear--spare <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{poor old}} father! Let {{him know that}} I neither would nor could disturb Robert in his inheritance, attainted traitor as the laws esteem <b>me.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> mayhap I shall write to him if the good angel you talk of will help me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{only know}} I {{did not kill}} him," [...] {{returned}} the baron; [...] "I had him down and got the prize, {{and that was enough}} <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> What <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> fellows may have done, I cannot say." ...|$|R

60|$|As he {{continued}} his harangue, however, Kory-Kory, in emulation of our more polished orators, began to launch out rather diffusely into other branches of his subject, enlarging probably upon the moral reflections it suggested; and proceeded in such a strain of unintelligible and stunning gibberish, that he actually gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> headache <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of <b>the</b> day.|$|R
