40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} cast iron and cast aluminium components, the co-operation between product development and production is important. On the engineering level, this co-operation is limited already in the product development phase e. g. by the lack of established methods to consider the <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the completed component. This thesis aims to increase the possibilities for co-operation in the product realisation process between product development and production by enabling the use of predicted local <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> in structural analyses of cast components. A literature review on existing simulation methods and a work on characterization of <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> from microstructural features are performed to identify important knowledge gaps. A simulation strategy is formulated that is able to predict local <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> throughout the entire component and incorporate the behaviour into a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of the structural behaviour of the component. In the simulation strategy, the component specific microstructure-based <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> is predicted using a casting process simulation. A computer program is developed to create FEM material definitions that capture the local variations in <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> throughout the component. The relevance of the simulation strategy is demonstrated for a ductile iron component. It is found that the local variations in <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> result in a stress-strain distribution in the component that a homogeneous material description fails to express. Residual stresses affect the <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> at low loads. At higher loads, however, the accuracy of the simulation is determined by the local variations in <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Using a material reduction technique, the local <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> can be incorporated without increasing the FEM simulation time. ...|$|R

Samples of two material batches were selected: one just stays near the upper limit of tolerance and the other has mean properties.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} cast iron and cast aluminium components, a high level of co-operation between product development and production is of great importance. From an engineering standpoint, this co-operation is limited early in the product development phase by e. g. a lack of established methods for the consideration of local variations in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> of a finished component. This thesis aims to increase the possibilities for co-operation between product development and production during the product realisation process by introducing and studying the use of predicted local <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> in structural analyses of cast components. A literature review of existing simulation methods and a work on characterisation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> from microstructural features have been performed to identify important knowledge gaps. A simulation strategy has been formulated which is able to predict local <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> throughout the entire component, and to incorporate this into a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of the structural behaviour of the component. In the simulation strategy, componentspecific microstructure-based <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> is predicted using a casting process simulation.

The relevance of the simulation strategy was experimentally verified on cast aluminium samples, where the strain field was observed using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). It was found that the local variations in <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviour</b> cause a stress-strain distribution that deviates from that predicted by a homogeneous material description, indicating the importance of calculating with and including such variations in material behaviour in FEM simulations.

A recently presented simulation strategy, the closed chain of simulations for cast components, is applied to incorporate local behaviour predicted by a casting process simulation into a Finite Element Method (FEM) structural analysis, {{and the effects of}} the strategy on predicted component behaviour and simulation time are evaluated. The results are compared to using a homogeneous material description. A material reduction method is investigated, and the effects of material reduction and number of linearization points are evaluated.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> of adhesively bonded joints are studied {{with the help}} of double lap shear (DLS) coupon tests {{conducted}} at different extension rates and temperatures. The joint specimens are made from dual-phase steel coupons bonded with epoxy resin. Tests are also carried out to ascertain the behaviours of these component materials. It has been found that at a high temperature, the adhesive joint exhibits a greater degree of strain rate sensitivity with a perceptible fall in the joint strength. However, at a low temperature, the joint strength remains comparable to that at room temperature. A new semi-analytical solution procedure is developed considering material nonlinearity to predict <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> of adhesively bonded DLS joints. The joint behaviours using the semi-analytical approach are predicted separately using the Von Mises (VM) and Raghava yield criteria. It has been found here that the application of the Raghava criterion yields good correlation with test load–extension behaviours for most temperatures and extension rates considered; on the other hand, the VM condition gives rise to perceptibly softer joint behaviour when compared to test data at a high temperature...|$|E
40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{of metal}} foams greatly {{depend on their}} cell topology, {{including}} cell shape, cell size etc. as well as relative density and material properties of the cell wall. However, the cell shape effect on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>behaviours</b> of such materials appears to be ignored in previous research. In this paper, both analytic and ﬁnite element models are developed and employed to investigate the effect of cell shape on the mechanical behaviour of open-cell magnesium alloy (AZ 91) foams under compression, including deformation modes and failure modes. For numerical modelling, both two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) ﬁnite element models are developed to predict the compressive behaviours of typical open-cell metal foams and capture the deformation modes and failure mechanisms. Two typical cell shapes i. e. cubic and diamond are taken into consideration. To validate these models, the analytic and numerical results are compared to the experimental data. Both the numerical and experimental data indicate that the cell shape signiﬁcantly affects the compression behaviour of open-cell metal foams. In general, numerical results from the three-dimensional solid-element model show better agreement with the experimental results than those from other ﬁnite element model...|$|E
