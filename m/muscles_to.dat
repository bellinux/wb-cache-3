5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on {{one part of the}} body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|The {{muscular system}} has been {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> flex the knee, a different <b>muscle</b> <b>to</b> extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small <b>muscles</b> remaining <b>to</b> bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|R
5|$|Some organisms, such as sharks, {{are able}} to detect and respond to changes in {{electric}} fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, {{are able to}} generate voltages themselves {{to serve as a}} predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An electric shock stimulates this system, and causes <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.|$|E
5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no {{faster than the}} rate at which nerves can send impulses to command the <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> beat. All other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; the wings can beat faster than {{the rate at which}} the muscles receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the <b>muscles</b> <b>to</b> move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
