40|$|Maximum {{values of}} dry matter and fat (% of the carcass weight) is {{achieved}} in swine exploited on small private family farms at 137 kg of dry matter and 115 kg of protein. Slaughtering swine at higher weight {{results in an}} increase of the dry matter and of the caloric value because of the increase {{of the amount of}} fat in the muscular fibber; thus, pork is of low quality because of the massive accumulation fat substance and the economic efficiency of producing pork is improper, with supplementary expenses on feed. Fattening swine on small family exploitations up to over 11 kg results in changes of the <b>meat</b> / <b>fat</b> <b>ratio,</b> detrimental to pork meat because of both thickening of lard on the animals’ back and of fat depositions in the muscular fibber; though this improves pork quality, it is done with high expenses of energy, resulting in inefficient exploitation on private family farms that in most cases only supply for their families and rarely sell extra production...|$|R

Bulls, heifers and steers were slaughtered at 15, 20 and 24 months of age, respectively. The diet offered before slaughter includes grass silage only, grass or maize silage plus supplementary concentrates, or concentrates offered ad libitum plus 1 kg of roughage dry matter per head daily. Following the slaughter, carcasses were classified mechanically for conformation and fatness (scale 1 to 15), and {{the right side of}} each carcass was dissected into <b>meat,</b> <b>fat</b> and bone. Carcass conformation score ranged from 4. 7 to 14. 4, 5. 4 to 10. 9 and 2. 0 to 12. 0 for bulls, heifers and steers, respectively; the corresponding ranges for fat score were 2. 7 to 11. 5, 3. 2 to 11. 3 and 2. 8 to 13. 3. Prediction equations for carcass <b>meat,</b> <b>fat</b> and bone proportions were developed using multiple regression, with carcass conformation and fat score both included as continuous independent variables. In a separate series of analyses, the independent variable in the model was the proportion of the trait under investigation (<b>meat,</b> <b>fat</b> or bone) in the hindquarter. In both analyses, interactions between the independent variables and gender were tested. The predictive ability of the developed equations was assed using cross-validation on all 662 animals. Carcass classification scores accounted for 0. 73, 0. 67 and 0. 71 of the total variation in carcass <b>meat,</b> <b>fat</b> and bone proportions, respectively, across all 662 animals. The corresponding values using hindquarter <b>meat,</b> <b>fat</b> and bone in the model were 0. 93, 0. 87 and 0. 89, respectively. The bias of the prediction equations when applied across all animals was not different from zero, but bias did exist among some of the genotypes of animals present.

40|$|Pig {{breeding}} {{is significant}} in the Czech Republic. The consumption of pork represents about 41 % of the overall meat consumption per 1 inhabitant. Pig breeding is closely linked with the nutrition of pigs. The nutrition represents about 65 to 75 % of production costs. The aim of this thesis is to create a literary review {{on the issue of}} the influence of nutrition on the quality of pork meat. The work describes generally the nutrients of the feed whose good knowledge is essential for successful pig breeding. The nutrition of livestock, including the pigs, is influenced by various factors. Above all, they are physiological and biochemical, connected with ingestion, digestion, resorption. These nutrients are necessary for keeping all vital functions, with a special regard to the efficiency of livestock. The slaughter value was also described. It expresses the quantity and quality of the products obtained by processing slaughter stock after its slaughtering in manufacturing industry. It has a decisive influence during the evaluation of slaughter stock purchased and delivered to the slaughterhouses and it also serves as a guideline to the evaluation of success rate of breeding work in the section of pig breeding. The work also focuses on the meat quality. The quality of pork meat can be defined as a summary of nutritive, sensory, technological and sanitary - toxicology characteristics. The result of strict selection for hig proportion of lean meat (which improves the overall economy of production) is partial deterioration in meat quality. In recent years there is a mounting interest in improving the pork meat quality which nowadays becomes the main consumers´ request. This fact is also caused by increasing economic power of consumers who don´t have to consider only the price any more these days. The quality of meat is affected by a lot of factors, for example, the nutrition and the related influence of feeding technology. Genetic foundation of the individual is no less important. For the production of pork, refined high-breeds with high conformation are used, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the meat. Another well-known factor is the impact of gender. Pig fattening is divided according to the gender. Boars use feed better for the creation of muscle in comparison with gilts and barrows. Their chief disadvantage is the boar´s odor of the meat. Barrows have an increased ability to store fat in comparison with gilts, that is why it is recommended to restrict feeding up to 20 % in the final stage of pig fattening. <b>Meat</b> to <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> changes as the age and weight increase...|$|R

The sausages slices were photographed and the images were analysed with the computer vision system to measure the changes in the colorimetric characteristics L*, a*, b*, hue and chroma and in the visible <b>fat</b> area <b>ratio.</b> The last parameter was assessed on the slice surface using image binarization. A consumer test was conducted to determine the relationship between the perception of visible fat on the sausage slice surface and acceptability and preference of this product. The consumers were asked to look carefully at the 6 sausages slices in a photo, minding the presence of fat, and to identify (a) the slices they considered unacceptable for consumption and (b) the slice they preferred. The results show that the color of the sausage lean part varies in relation to the raw material employed and to the producer or brand (P b 0. 001).

30|$|In {{comparison}} with milk production, the variation of milk fat content is relatively small. Thus, the milk <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> resembles the reciprocal of milk production, {{as shown in}} Equation (1). This fact vindicates an empirical finding by Wood (1976). Of course, there is a variety of choices of which indicator to use for management, and it is absolutely the farm’s choice. If the milk <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> tends to be preferable, the six different scenarios leading to {{a variation of the}} milk <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> provide useful indications for management planning strategies. Although management actions to reduce the negative effects of heat cannot be applied to each individual within a large production system (André et al. 2011), our present analysis highlights only six different required treatment strategies. Further, these may be reduced to the three major cases shown in Figure 3. Appropriate management action can be taken regarding feed composition and the prioritised allocation of cows in the barn. For Case 2, in which the production of milk and milk fat increase, no special treatment is actually required despite a decrease in the milk <b>fat</b> <b>ratio.</b> The reason for this is the faster increase of milk production compared to that of milk fat yield. For Case 5, cows are strongly affected by heat, but the milk <b>fat</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. The decreased production of milk and milk fat may be offset by allocating the cows as cool a space as possible and providing them with easily digestible and high-calorie feed. For Case 1, the decreased production of milk fat may be offset by providing cows with a fat-productive feed.|$|R
