The flue gas desulphurization unit consists of an absorber tower and an oxidation tank. Flue gas enters the absorption tower at the bottom and meets the limestone slurry. There are five important chemical reactions with a finite rate. The rate-limiting reactions are limestone dissolution, calcium sulphite precipitation and dissolution, gypsum precipitation, sulphur dioxide absorption and sulphite oxidation in the slurry. The model also accounts for the presence of chloride ions, <b>magnesium</b> ions and <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in the limestone slurry. The absorption rates of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide in the tower are calculated according to the two-film model. A non-uniform set of limestone particles is also included in the model. The model was tested against literature data and the agreement between the data and the model was satisfactory. A sensitivity analysis of the desulphurization process was carried out, the inputs to the model were changed and the results from the calculations were compared with the expected results.

40|$|Abstract Background Microbial lipids {{have drawn}} {{increasing}} attention {{in recent years}} as promising raw materials for biodiesel production, and the use of lignocellulosic hydrolysates as carbon sources seems to be a feasible strategy for cost-effective lipid fermentation with oleaginous microorganisms on a large scale. During the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials with dilute acid, however, various kinds of inhibitors, especially large amounts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> will be produced, which substantially decrease the fermentability of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. To overcome the inhibitory effects of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> it is critical to understand their impact on the growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous microorganisms. Results In our present work, we investigated {{for the first time the}} effect of ten representative <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in lignocellulosic hydrolysates on the growth and lipid accumulation of oleaginous yeast Trichosporon fermentans cells. In contrast to previous reports, we found that the toxicity of the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> to the cells was not directly related to their hydrophobicity. It is worth noting that most <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> tested were less toxic than aldehydes to the cells, and some could even stimulate the growth and lipid accumulation at a low concentration. Unlike aldehydes, most binary combinations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> exerted no synergistic inhibitory effects on lipid production. The presence of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> decelerated the consumption of glucose, whereas it influenced the utilization of xylose in a different and complicated way. In addition, all the <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> tested, except furoic acid, inhibited the malic activity of T. fermentans. Furthermore, the inhibition of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> on cell growth was dependent more on inoculum size, temperature and initial pH than on lipid content. Conclusions This work provides some meaningful information about the effect of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in lignocellulosic hydrolysates on the lipid production of oleaginous yeast, which is helpful for optimization of biomass hydrolysis processes, detoxified pretreatment of hydrolysates and lipid production using lignocellulosic materials. </p...|$|R

The ability of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to release K from soils depends on some factors such as: diffusion rate of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> in soil, the diffusion capability of organic acid-element complexes, the contact time of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> on a mineral surface, the ionization of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid,</b> the functional group of the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and its position, and the chemical affinity between the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and the mineral elements.

Mechanism of Inactivation The mechanism of inactivation by weak <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> lays down in the ability of undissociated form of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to penetrate through the cell membrane, and to dissociate inside the cell, resulting in decreased intracellular pH value, which is essential for the control of ATP synthesis, RNA and protein synthesis, DNA replication and cell growth (Booth, 1985). Beside the decrease in intracellular pH, the perturbation of the membrane functions by <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> molecule might be also responsible for the microbial inactivation. The high concentration of anions (due to dissociation) inside the cells might result in an increased osmolarity and consequently to the metabolic perturbation (Hirshfield et al., 2003).

30|$|Application of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> as {{preservative}} {{agents and}} disinfectants {{is a common}} practice in drug, cosmetic and food industries (Rico et al. 2007). Moreover, particular interest for different <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is continuously increasing worldwide creating thereby a necessity for production of huge quantities of these chemicals. From economical point of view, {{it is more important}} to produce concentrated as opposed to diluted acids because of the direct impact on the handling and transportation costs. However, handling and transportation of concentrated <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is extremely hazardous and special security means must be taken to avoid any poisoning risk and injuries. Moreover, the receiving industry must have special storage and adequate managing conditions for these chemicals. In this context, handling and managing of salts of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is suitable and easier because of the high level of safety and facility of storage and handling (Yoo et al. 2010; Luttrell 2012). Although the reactivity of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> is higher than that of the conjugated salt, it is possible to convert a salt of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to the acid form so as to obtain the desired reactivity. In this context, electrochemical activation (or simply “electro-activation”) of salt of an <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> allows its conversion to the acid form under safe conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Acidithiobacillus caldus is a {{thermophilic}} acidophile {{found in}} commercial biomining, acid mine drainage systems, and natural environments. Previous work has characterized A. caldus as a chemolithotrophic autotroph capable of utilizing reduced sulfur compounds under aerobic conditions. <b>Organic</b> <b>acids</b> are especially toxic to chemolithotrophs in low-pH environments, where they diffuse more readily {{into the cell}} and deprotonate within the cytoplasm. In the present study, the toxic effects of oxaloacetate, pyruvate, 2 -ketoglutarate, acetate, malate, succinate, and fumarate on A. caldus strain BC 13 were examined under batch conditions. All tested <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> exhibited some inhibitory effect. Oxaloacetate was observed to inhibit growth completely at a concentration of 250 M, whereas other <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> were completely inhibitory at concentrations of between 1, 000 and 5, 000 M. In these experiments, the measured concentrations of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> decreased with time, indicating uptake or assimilation by the cells. Phospholipid fatty acid analyses indicated an effect of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> on the cellular envelope. Notable differences included an increase in cyclic fatty acids {{in the presence of}} <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> indicating possible instability of the cellular envelope. This was supported by field emission scanning-electron micrographs showing blebbing and sluffing in cells grown in the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> Keywords—Acidithiobacillus Chemiosmosis Biominin...|$|R
40|$|Exudation of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} to greatly improve {{the ability of}} plants to establish on nutrient poor soils such as those found in calcareous environments. An understanding of the behaviour of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in these soils {{is crucial to the}} critical assessment of their potential capacity for nutrient mobilization. The aim of this study was therefore to study the sorption reactions and mineralization potentials of three <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> commonly found in root exudates of calcicole plants (citrate, malate and oxalate). Using maize as a model plant, we studied the root exudation of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> into a calcareous soil and assessed the <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> biodegradation rate in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our results indicate that malate and citrate are rapidly biodegraded in this calcareous soil, in agreement with previous studies presented for non-calcareous soils. In contrast, oxalate appears to be resistant to microbial degradation possibly due to substrate protection by the formation and precipitation of Ca-oxalate. The rate of malate biodegradation was significantly enhanced in rhizosphere soil relative to that in bulk soil possibly reflecting the high degree of efflux of this <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> from maize roots. The levels of free <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in the soil solution of calcareous soil surrounding maize roots, whilst higher than in the bulk soil, were extremely low...|$|R

A group of sixty 1 -year old male lambs of Kivircik Breed were used. The animals were divided in to 4 groups of 15 lambs each. The groups were assigned as control, <b>organic</b> <b>acid,</b> direct-feed microbial, and direct-feed microbial plus <b>organic</b> <b>acid.</b> A commercial direct-feed microbial product and <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> mix were used as feed treatment supplements. The average daily gain means of the lambs supplemented with <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> plus direct-feed microbials was found significantly {{higher than that of}} control group lambs. Significant differences in total proteins, cholesterol, total lipids, and serum Zn levels were detected among the groups. As a result, addition of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> and/or direct-feed microbial to the ration of yearling Kivircik male lambs resulted in an increased body weight gain (p< 0. 05). In addition, the dietary supplement of <b>organic</b> <b>acid</b> to the lambs caused a decrease in the serum cholesterol level while direct-feed microbial addition caused an increase in the serum Zn level (p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), proline and protein, and Cd uptake in different rice cultivars exposed to Cd (0, 1 and 5 mg/kg) {{in the presence of}} <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). The results showed the increase in activity of dismutase (SOD), contents of proline and protein but a decline in activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), and MDA content for cultivars Xiushui 63 and IIyou 527. The resistance to Cd was higher in Xiushui 63 than that in IIyou 527 under the same Cd treatment. Cadmium contents in grain, straw and roots of both cultivars were markedly reduced in the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and EDTA. Grain Cd contents was the highest for plants treated with <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> followed by <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> + 1 / 2 EDTA, and the lowest with EDTA; Cd contents in straw and root were the lowest for plants treated with <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> followed by <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> + 1 / 2 EDTA, and the highest with EDTA treatment when exposed to Cd...|$|R

The antibacterial efficacy of reconstituted beverage was tested on three strains of enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhi and Serratia liquefaciens). The antibacterial efficacy of beverage containing <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> (ascorbic and citric acids) {{as compared to the}} same beverage containing mineral acid was successfully demonstrated. The greatest inhibitions of bacterial growth were observed in the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>acids.</b> The antibacterial activity was significant depending on initial bacterial concentration and time of contact. However, S. liquefaciens was not detected in the beverage containing <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> regardless of the bacterial concentration added. At a concentration of 103 cells/mL, the bacterial population of S. liquefaciens, E. coli, S.
