The company wants to find the causes of losses, which occur in process production at the cup casting area. The goal that the company wants to obtain is decreasing the losses rate. The tools which being use to analyze the loss's causes are pareto diagram and cause and effect diagram. The company attempts to find their quality in QA clay too. At the current time the company uses <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> at the QA clay. The goal of the company is to find new acceptance sampling plan, which can find more defect. The tools are applied as new acceptance sampling plan are OC curve, and binomial nomograph. The conclusion is the increased loss in cup casting area affects the decreased loss in next step. Therefore, the proposed acceptance sampling plan is accepted...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{microbiological}} criteria {{established in the}} EC 2073 / 2005 for Cronobacter in powder infant formula (PIF) are based on two-class attribute sampling plans, where the sample results are qualitative (sample indicates presence or absence) and the lot is rejected if any sample is positive. The performance of a sampling plan is revealed by its Operating Characteristic (OC) curve which plots the probability of acceptance against possible values of proportion defective. The objective {{of this study is}} to generate several OC curves for single, double and multiple sampling plans assuming different statistical distributions of Cronobacter in PIF in order to determine and compare the probabilities of rejecting/accepting the lot and the respective level of contamination. In this study, the microbial distribution of Cronobacter in the PIF is described by assuming to be Poisson-lognormal (PLN), Poisson-gamma (PG), Zero- inflated Poisson-lognormal (ZIPLN) and Zero-inflated Poisson-gamma (ZIPG). For each distribution the proportion defective of the population is estimated in order to determine the probability of acceptance for single, double and multiple sampling plans. Furthermore, the effect of clustering of the bacteria on the probability of acceptance of the lot was assessed through a Poisson-logarithmic (PLOG) and a PLogn distribution. Probabilities of accepting the lot at a given level of contamination change drastically according to the statistical distribution assumed and by changing the values of its own parameters. In addition, a procedure of <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> based on resampling reveals that the producer's risk (α risk) can be reduced without affecting the consumer's risk (β risk) ...|$|E

Expressions are derived for the OC curves for several sets of general sets of three-stage chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans,</b> with cumulative acceptance numbers of (c 1,c 2,c 3) = (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 4). In the original work of Dodge (1955) only acceptance numbers of 0, 1 were used and in the extension work of Dodge and Stephens (1966) acceptance numbers of (c 1,c 2) = (0,l), (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4) and (1, 4) were used with selected sets of values of k 1 and k 2 (the number of lots considered for cumulation in the first and second stage respectively).

Double and <b>multiple</b> stage <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> may be less risky in a theoretical sense showing a lower probability of sampling error, however, applications on the shop floor require intensive training and the learning curve is uncomfortably steep.

The elimination of costly 100 % total inspection will enhance the adoption of modern management techniques in general, and help to make negotiations between buyers and sellers more transparent and organized. Our intention is to show how to improve standard <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> like the ISO standards (1999, 1985) by recalculating tables with the hypergeometric distribution, and more importantly taking into account the correct usage of hypothesis testing.

40|$|A primary {{objective}} of the Hanford Tank Initiative (HTI) project is to develop methods to estimate the inventory of residual waste in single-shell and double-shell tanks. A second objective is to develop methods to determine the boundaries of waste that {{may be in the}} waste plume in the vadose zone. This document presents statistical <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> {{that can be used to}} estimate the inventory of analytes within the residual waste within a tank. <b>Sampling</b> <b>plans</b> for estimating the inventory of analytes within the waste plume in the vadose zone are also presented. Inventory estimates can be used to classify the residual waste with respect to chemical and radiological hazards. Based on these estimates, it will be possible to make decisions regarding the final disposition of the residual waste. Four <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> for the residual waste in a tank are presented. The first plan is based on the assumption that, based on some physical characteristic, the residual waste can be divided into disjoint strata, and waste samples obtained from randomly selected locations within each stratum. The second plan is that waste samples are obtained from randomly selected locations within the waste. The third and fourth plans are similar to the first two, except that composite samples are formed from <b>multiple</b> <b>samples.</b> Common to the four plans is that, in the laboratory, replicate analytical measurements are obtained from homogenized waste samples. The statistical <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> for the residual waste are similar to the statistical <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> developed for the tank waste characterization program. In that program, the statistical <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> required <b>multiple</b> core <b>samples</b> of waste, and replicate analytical measurements from homogenized core segments. A statistical analysis of the analytical data, obtained from use of the statistical <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> developed for the characterization program or from the HTI project, provide estimates of mean analyte concentrations and confidence intervals on the mean. In addition, the statistical analysis provides estimates of spatial and measurement variabilities. The magnitude of these sources of variability are used to determine how well the inventory of the analytes in the waste have been estimated.
