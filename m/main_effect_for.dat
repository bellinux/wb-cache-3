PURPOSE: To {{examine the effects of}} a flame resistant synthetic material base layer on heat stress factors. METHODS: Ten recreationally active males (25 ± 6. 1 yrs, 80. 9 ± 8. 4 kg, 11. 1 ± 5. 3 % fat, 4. 4 ± 0. 6 L·min- 1 VO 2 max) completed two trials of intermittent (50 min walking, 10 min sitting) treadmill walking (2. 5 mph, 4 % grade) over 3 hours in a climate chamber (35 ⁰C, 30 % RH). Participants wore standard WLFF Nomex green pants, yellow shirt with either a 100 % cotton base layer (C) or a flame resistant synthetic material base layer (S), while carrying a 35 lb pack, hard hat, and gloves. Exercise was followed by a 30 minute rest period without pack, hard hat, gloves, or Nomex yellow shirt. Core (Tc) and skin (Tsk) temperature were measured continuously throughout the trial. Skin blood flow (SBF) and skin temperature (DTsk) was recorded via laser doppler for two minutes prior to walking, five minutes during each break, and three, five minute periods during the 30 minutes following exercise. Physiological strain index (PSI) was calculated. Water was scripted at 8 ml/kg/hr. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS 22. 0. RESULTS: Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on Tc (p≤ 0. 001) and Tsk (p= 0. 003). No significant trialXtime interactions were found in Tc (p= 0. 077) and Tsk (p= 0. 086). SBF showed significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time (p= 0. 001) and a trialXtime interaction (p= 0. 001). Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on DTsk (p= 0. 001). Comparisons for SBF and DTsk were made between peaks, nadirs, and the three post-exercise periods for C and S. Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on SBF peaks (p= 0. 001), nadirs (p= 0. 028), and posts (p= 0. 001). Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time were found on DTsk peaks (p= 0. 019) and posts (p= 0. 001). No significant trialXtime interactions were found between C and S. Significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> <b>for</b> time and trial were found on PSI (p≤ 0. 001 and p= 0. 04, respectively).

The failure to find significant effects of culture or sex on negative initiations suggests that the lack of cross-cultural peer interactions is not motivated by hostile intentions.

Subjects. 27 male throwers (mean age[*]=[*] 25. 1 years old, SD[*]=[*] 2. 4) with adequate knowledge of demonstrable throwing mechanics. Study Design. Randomized crossover trial with repeated measures. Methods.
