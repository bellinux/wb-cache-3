30|$|Doppler {{effect and}} {{collision}} induced alignment The most straightforward {{effects in the}} images are those that originate from a mere velocity-dependent detection efficiency. One of the most well-known {{of these is the}} Doppler effect. Since the scattered molecules are distributed according to Newton spheres, a large range of post-collision laboratory velocities are present. Ideally, the detection laser ionizes all scattered molecules with equal efficiency, i.e., all Doppler-shifted <b>absorption</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the REMPI transitions are excited with equal probability. This can either be achieved by choosing a laser with sufficiently large bandwidth, by choosing sufficient laser power to broaden the transitions, by continuously scanning the laser frequency over the Doppler profile, or by choosing an optimal laser propagation direction that minimizes Doppler shifts. Like in most experiments, such free choices are not available in our experiments. The laser propagation direction is fixed in the plane of the beams, laser power must be chosen very low to prevent (1 + 1) REMPI transitions of NO, and spectral congestion in combination with the need to perform state-selective detection force us to use a dye laser with narrow bandwidth. In the experiments, the laser wavelength was fixed to the Doppler-free <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This thus results in a detection bias for recoil velocities that is orthogonal to the laser propagation direction.|$|R

An ultrafast thulium-based fiber laser was employed to experimentally investigate ultrashort-pulse propagation through the atmosphere in a spectral region containing several strong <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> lines. The atmospheric absorption profile causes a significant degradation of the pulse quality in the time domain as well as a distortion of the transverse beam profile in the spatial domain. Numerical simulations carried out in the small signal limit accurately reproduce the experimental observations in the time domain and reveal that the relative loss in peak power after propagation can be more than twice as high as the relative amount of absorbed average power. Although their nature is purely linear (i. e. the intensities considered are sufficiently low) the discussed effects represent significant challenges to performance-scaling of mid-infrared ultrafast lasers operating in spectral regions with <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> bands.

40|$|Abstract—The {{terahertz}} band is an unlicensed {{frequency range}} {{that is expected}} to be exploited in the near future for many differ-ent types of communications, including wireless communication in nano-scale sensor networks. However, as terahertz band is the resonance frequency of many molecules, communication in this band is severely affected by <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> noise and atten-uation. In this paper, we consider a nano-scale terahertz sensor network (TSN) where the chemical composition of the medium varies over time causing <b>absorption</b> for different <b>frequency</b> regions at different times. We propose frequency hopping as a means to overcome the problem of dynamic <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> in composition varying channels. We formulate the frequency selection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which allows us to adjust the rate of frequency switching for the nano sensors because resource constrained TSN nodes {{may not be able to}} switch frequency rapidly. We show that, compared to non-hopping channel selection, frequency hopping can significantly improve capacity and bit error rate when nano sensors have severe power constraints. We propose practically realizable offline policies that obviate the need for observing the channel states, yet perform close to the MDP-based solutions.
