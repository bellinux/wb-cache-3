40|$|Lean Direct Injection (LDI) is a {{combustor}} {{concept that}} reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. This paper {{looks at a}} 3 -zone multipoint LDI concept developed by Parker Hannifin Corporation. The concept was tested in a flame-tube test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. Due to test facility limitations, such as <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure, the flame-tube test {{was not able to}} cover the full set of engine operation conditions. Three NOx correlation equations were developed based on assessing NOx emissions dependencies on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure (P 3), <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> (T 3), and fuel air equivalence ratio () to estimate the NOx emissions at the unreachable high engine power conditions. As the results, the NOx emissions are found to be a strong function of combustion <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and fuel <b>air</b> equivalence ratio but a weaker function of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure. With these three equations, the NOx emissions performance of this injector concept is calculated as a 66 % reduction relative to the ICAO CAEP- 6 standard using a 55 : 1 pressure-ratio engine cycle. Uncertainty in the NOx emissions estimation increases as the extrapolation range departs from the experimental conditions. Since maximum <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure tested was less than 50 % of the full power engine <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure, a future experiment at higher <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure conditions is needed to confirm the NOx emissions dependency on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> pressure...|$|R
40|$|Emissions and {{performance}} characteristics were determined for full-annulus swirl-can modular combustors operated to near stoichiometric fuel air ratios. The {{purposes of the}} tests were to obtain stoichiometric data at <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> up to 894 K and {{to determine the effect}} of module number by investigating 120 and 72 module swirl-can combustors. The maximum average exit temperature obtained with the 120 -module swirl-can combustor was 2465 K with a combustion efficiency of 95 percent at an inlet-air temperature of 894 K. The 72 -module swirl-can combustor reached a maximum average exit temperature of 2306 K with a combustion efficiency of 92 percent at an <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> of 894 K. At a constant <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> maximum oxides of nitrogen emission index values occurred at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 037 for the 72 -module design and 0. 044 for the 120 -module design. The combustor average exit temperature and combustion efficiency were calculated from emissions measurements. The measured emissions included carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and smoke...|$|R
40|$|Low leakage, {{non-contacting}} finger seals {{have potential}} to reduce {{gas turbine engine}} specific fuel consumption by 2 to 3 percent and to reduce direct operating costs by increasing the time between engine overhauls. A non-contacting finger seal with concentric lift-pads operating adjacent to a test rotor with herringbone grooves was statically tested at 300, 533, and 700 K <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> at pressure differentials up to 576 kPa. Leakage flow factors were approximately 70 percent less than state-of-the-art labyrinth seals. Leakage rates are compared to first order predictions. Initial spin tests at 5000 rpm, 300 K <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure differentials to 241 kPa produced no measurable wear...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{formation}} and flame stability were investigated, both experimentally and computationally, for premixed combustion with varying {{amounts of water}} vapor in the mixture. Emission measurements were made in a gas turbine combustor at atmospheric conditions, using Danish Natural Gas (NG) as fuel. The emissions were mapped {{as a function of}} humidity, <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> equivalence ratio and aerodynamic load. Operating conditions were chosen to match what can be expected from e. g. an EvGT cycle for power generation. The <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was slightly lower than the inlet temperatures that would be found in a recuperated cycle. The degree of humidity was varied from 0 w% to 33 w% of the airflow in the experiment, while the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied from 500 K to 800 K. Computations were made using a single Perfectly Stirred Reactor (PSR) model and a reaction scheme with 821 reactions and 69 species. It was found that the NO X emissions were strongly reduced by the addition of water. Most of this decrease vanishes in practical combustion since richer combustion is required to keep CO emissions (combustion efficiency) at a tolerable level. The maximum humidity was found to be dependent on <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and aerodynamic load. In this experiment, the maximum humidity achieved was 33 %...|$|R
