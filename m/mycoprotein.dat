50|$|When {{the desired}} amount of <b>mycoprotein</b> has been created, the growth medium is drawn {{off from a}} tap {{at the bottom of}} the fermenter. The <b>mycoprotein</b> is {{separated}} and purified. It is a pale yellow solid with a faint taste of mushrooms. Different flavors and tastes can be added to the <b>mycoprotein</b> to add variety.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mycoprotein,</b> {{also known}} as fungal protein, is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as [...] "the albuminoid which is the {{principal}} constituent of the protoplasm of the cell." [...] "Myco" [...] is from the Greek word for [...] "fungus". <b>Mycoprotein</b> {{is a form of}} single-cell protein and was first produced in the early 1980s.|$|E
30|$|The <b>mycoproteins</b> were {{extracted}} with ultrasonication {{and their}} concentrations determined with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The mycelia were washed in low-salt buffer (2.5  mM KH 2 PO 4, 5  mM NaH 2 PO 4) precooled to 4  °C, and then resuspended in 1  ml of lysis buffer (8  M carbamide, 1  % IPG buffer, 2  % dithiothreitol). Protein sample preparation and 2 D gel electrophoresis were performed as previously described (Helmel et al. 2014; Jan et al. 2014). (All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

40|$|The meat {{industry}} cannot {{respond to}} increases in demand by ever increasing resource use. The industry must find solutions to issues regarding animal welfare, health and sustainability {{and will have to}} do so in the face of competition from emerging non-traditional meat and protein products in an increasingly complex regulatory environment. These novel meat and protein products, otherwise known as ‘artificial meat’ are utilising ground breaking technologies designed to meet the issues facing the conventional meat industry. These artificial meats, in vitro or cultured meat and meat from genetically modified organisms have no real capacity to compete with conventional meat production in the present environment. However, meat replacements manufactured from plant proteins and <b>mycoproteins</b> are currently the biggest competitors and are gaining a small percentage of the market. Manufactured meats may push conventional meat into the premium end of the market, and supply the bulk, cheap end of the market if conventional meat products become more expensive and the palatability and versatility of manufactured meats improve. In time the technology for other artificial meats such as meat from genetic modified organisms or cultured meat may become sufficiently developed for these products to enter the market with no complexity of the competition between meat products. Conventional meat producers can assimilate agroecology ecology concepts in order to develop sustainable animal production systems. The conventional meat industry can also benefit from assimilating biotechnologies such as cloning and genetic modification technologies, using the technology to adapt to the changing environment and respond to the increasing competition from artificial meats. Although it will depend at least partly on the evolution of conventional meat production, the future of artificial meat produced from stem cells appears uncertain at this time...|$|R

50|$|The strain Fusarium venenatum A3/5 (IMI 145425, ATCC PTA-2684) was {{developed}} commercially by an ICI and Rank Hovis McDougall joint venture to derive a <b>mycoprotein</b> {{used as a}} food. Because the hyphae of the fungus are similar in length and width to animal muscle fibres the <b>mycoprotein</b> is used {{as an alternative to}} meat and is marketed to vegetarians as Quorn. It is also suitable as a substitute for fat in dairy products and a substitute for cereal in breakfast cereals and snacks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mycoprotein</b> means protein from fungi. The main <b>mycoprotein</b> {{on sale in}} Europe and North America {{is called}} Quorn. It was {{originally}} developed as a food source to combat food shortages. [...] All Quorn products contain <b>mycoprotein</b> derived from the fungus Fusarium venenatum. The fungus is grown in vats using glucose syrup as food. A fermentation vat {{is filled with the}} growth medium and then inoculated with the fungal spores. The F. venenatum culture respires aerobically, so for it to grow at an optimum rate, it is supplied with oxygen, and carbon dioxide is drawn from the vat. To make protein, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) is added and vitamins and minerals are needed to support growth. The vat is kept at a constant temperature, also optimized for growth; the fungus can double its mass every five hours.|$|E
5000|$|The UK's Advertising Standards Authority {{also had}} {{concerns}} over Marlow's practice of marketing Quorn as [...] "mushroom in origin", saying {{it had been}} [...] "misleading consumers". The ASA noted [...] "despite the advertiser’s explanation that they used the term because customers were unfamiliar with the main ingredient, <b>mycoprotein,</b> the ASA considered that the claim implied that Quorn was made from mushroom. Marlow Foods were asked either to delete the claim or give in the same font size a statement of the <b>mycoprotein</b> origin of the product or the fungal origin of the product." ...|$|E

On 14 March 2011, CEO Kevin Brennan said in an interview: [...] "Some patents surrounding the core technology have expired, but the product uses a peculiar fermentation method, and we have 30-plus years' experience in perfecting this on site to produce the product better and at a lower cost. Huge related costs include £30m cost for a fermentation tower and related equipment, so you can't simply look at a patent and say 'there you go'." ...|$|E
50|$|Quorn brand <b>mycoprotein</b> {{is sold in}} ready-to-cook forms, such as {{cubes and}} a form {{resembling}} minced meat. The company later introduced a range of chilled vegetarian meals, including pizzas, lasagne, cottage pie, and products resembling sliced meat, hot dogs, and burgers.By 2005 Quorn enjoyed around 60% of the meat-replacement food market in the UK, with annual sales of around £95 million. By 2006 it was available in stores in: the UK; Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland); and North America (Canada and United States). Since June 2010, it has been available in Australia.In May 2012 Quorn Foods opened the German website quorn.de to relaunch Quorn in Germany.|$|E
50|$|Quorn is a meat {{substitute}} product {{originating in the}} UK and available in 19 countries.It was launched in 1985 by Marlow Foods, {{a joint venture between}} Rank Hovis McDougall (RHM) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now owned by Monde Nissin Corporation.All Quorn foods contain <b>mycoprotein</b> as an ingredient, which is derived from the Fusarium venenatum fungus and is grown by fermentation using a process that its manufacturer has described as similar to the production of beer or yogurt.

50|$|Vegetarian and vegan {{sausages}} {{are also}} available in some countries, or {{can be made from}} scratch at home. These may be made from tofu, seitan, nuts, pulses, <b>mycoprotein,</b> soya protein, vegetables or any combination of similar ingredients that will hold together during cooking. These sausages, like most meat-replacement products, generally fall into two categories: some are shaped, colored, flavored, and spiced to replicate the taste and texture of meat as accurately as possible; others such as the Glamorgan sausage rely on spices and vegetables to lend their natural flavor to the product and no attempt is made to imitate meat. While not vegetarian, the soya sausage was invented 1916 in Germany. First known as Kölner Wurst ("Cologne Sausage") by later German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer (1876-1967).|$|E
50|$|Quorn is {{made from}} the soil mould Fusarium venenatum strain PTA-2684 (previously misidentified as the {{parasitic}} mould Fusarium graminearum).The fungus is grown in continually oxygenated water in large, otherwise sterile fermentation tanks. Glucose and fixed nitrogen are added as a food for the fungus, as are vitamins and minerals to improve the food value of the product. The resulting <b>mycoprotein</b> is then extracted and heat-treated to remove excess levels of RNA. Previous attempts to produce such fermented protein foodstuffs were thwarted by excessive levels of DNA or RNA; without the heat treatment, purines, found in nucleic acids, is metabolised by humans to produce uric acid, {{which can lead to}} gout.However two recent studies have found dietary factors once believed to be associated with gout are in fact not, including the intake of purine-rich vegetables and total protein.The Mayo Clinic, meanwhile, advises gout sufferers to avoid some foods that are high in purines.|$|E
40|$|Food 2030, the UK Government's {{strategic}} {{response to}} developing a sustainable food supply chain, suggests a need to reduce our consumption of meat {{and its impact on}} our health and the environment. Quorn is the world's leading meat free brand and is based on a unique protein called <b>mycoprotein.</b> Diets rich in <b>mycoprotein</b> have been reported to offer a beneficial effect on health, particularly in tackling obesity. A Life cycle Analysis (LCA) of a <b>mycoprotein</b> food product, Quorn mince has been carried out in order to begin to understand the environmental impact. Issues encountered with carrying out the LCA are discussed and conclusions presented to show that whilst more work is needed, Quorn mince may have half the embedded carbon when compared with beef. The acknowledged health benefits of <b>mycoprotein</b> combined with lower levels of embedded carbon compared with meat suggest a valuable role for Quorn with consumers who wish to reduce meat consumption without sacrificing the recipes and food textures they enjoy...|$|E

40|$|Quorn is {{the trade}} {{name of an}} edible fungus: <b>mycoprotein.</b> This new protein-rich food {{developed}} in the UK {{can be made to}} taste like beef, chicken or ham. Although it is not a product of the latest biotechniques and does not involve genetic manipulation, Quorn is a product which makes use of modern technology as it is produced on a continuous fermenter. Large sheets of <b>mycoprotein</b> are subject to a mechanical process which makes it become quite fluid. It can then be folded and extruded until it acquires the fibrous structure and texture of the food it must represent. Chicken, beef or ham flavour is added and it is then sliced or shredded into pieces. In the coming months, customers of a major supermarket in the UK will see this new product on sale. However, many problems have yet to be solved. First of all, Quorn is only slightly less expensive than comparable meat products and the present manufacturing capacity can only supply the demand of about one hundred shops. Nevertheless, factory- produced Quorn meat of plant origin could become a useful product for regions where protein sources are scarceQuorn is the trade name of an edible fungus: <b>mycoprotein.</b> This new protein-rich food developed in the UK can be made to taste like beef, chicken or ham.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{established}} to test <b>mycoprotein</b> conversion potency {{and its impact on}} the quantitative production of seven species of Pleurotus (Oyster mushroom), commonly used for commercial mushroom cultivation viz. P. eous, P. calocybe indica, P. flabellatus, P. platypus P. sajor-caju, P. florida and P. columbinus, straws of wheat (Triticum), soybean (Glycine max), paddy (Oryza sativa), chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus), gram (Cicer arietinum), pea (Pisum sativum), aize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and their combinations in ratios of 1 : 1 were used to cultivate Pleurotus. The results reached two conclusions; firstly an indication of performance of Pleurotus species on various substrates was identified, and secondly; the most suitable individual substrates for the cultivation of Pleurotus species were identified. The results established a complete selection chart for application to commercial production. Observing higher biological efficiency in chickling vetch, gram, pea, wheat/soybean, soybean/chickling vetch and paddy/chickling vetch respectively were identified as the most suitable for commercial cultivation. Wheat, soybean, paddy, chickling vetch and gram required less time duration for cultivation of Pleurotus species.

40|$|Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{antibodies}} (ASCAs) {{have been}} proposed as serological markers, which may differentiate Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis (UC) and predict disease phenotype. Their importance in pathogenesis is unproven. We investigated the relationship between ASCAs, disease phenotype and NOD 2 /CARD 15 genotype in CD and whether ASCAs were related to antibodies to other fungal proteins. Serum from 228 patients [143 CD, 75 UC, 10 with indeterminate colitis (IC) ] and 78 healthy controls (HC) were assayed for ASCA. Antibodies (IgA, IgG) to other fungal proteins (Fusarium species ATC 20334, <b>Mycoprotein)</b> were measured in the same samples using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. ASCAs were present in 57 % of CD, 19 % of UC, 30 % of IC and 8 % of HCs. ASCA-positive status was a predictor for CD with sensitivity of 57 %, specificity of 87 %, positive predictive value of 78 % and negative predictive value of 68 %. ASCA was associated with proximal (gastroduodenal and small bowel involvement) rather than purely colonic disease (P < 0 · 001) and with a more severe disease phenotype and requirement for surgery over a median follow-up time of 9 years (P < 0 · 0001). No associations with NOD 2 /CARD 15 mutations were seen. There was no association between ASCA and antibodies to MP (IgA or IgG). These data implicate ASCA as a specific marker of disease location and progression in CD, emphasizing the heterogeneity within IBD...|$|E
40|$|Short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFA), {{including}} propionate, {{are produced by}} the bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates in the colon. Propionate has many potential roles in health, including inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, de novo lipogenesis and increasing satiety. The profile of SCFA produced is determined by both the substrate available and the bacteria present and {{may be influenced by}} environmental conditions within the lumen of the colon. Whilst it may be beneficial to increase colonic propionate production, dietary strategies to achieve this are unproven. Adding propionate to food leads to poorer organoleptic properties, and oral propionate is absorbed in the small intestine. The optimum way to selectively increase colonic propionate would be to select fermentable carbohydrates that selectively promote propionate production. To date, few studies have undertaken a systematic assessment of the factors leading to increased colonic propionate production making the selection of propiogenic carbohydrates challenging. The aim of this thesis was to identify the best carbohydrates for selectively increasing propionate production, and to explore the factors which control propionate production. This work started with a systematic review of the literature for evidence of candidate carbohydrates, which led to a screen of ‘propiogenic’ substrates using in vitro batch fermentations and mechanistic analysis of the impact of pH, bond linkage and orientation using a range of sugars, polysaccharides and fibre sources. A new unit for SCFA production was developed to allow comparison of results from in vitro studies encompassing a range different methodologies found in the literature. The systematic review found that rhamnose yielded the highest rate and proportion of propionate production whereas, for polysaccharides, β-glucan ranked highest for rate and guar gum ranked highest for molar production, but this was not replicated across all studies. Thus, no single NDC was established as highly propiogenic. Some substrates appeared more propiogenic than others and when these were screened in vitro. Laminarin, and other β-glucans ranked highest for propionate production. Legume fibre and <b>mycoprotein</b> fibre were also propiogenic. A full complement of glucose disaccharides were tested to examine the role glycosidic bond orientation and position on propionate production. Of the glucose disaccharides tested, β(1 - 4) bonding was associated with increased proportion of propionate and α(1 - 1) and β(1 - 4) increased the rate and proportion of butyrate production. In conclusion, it appears that for fibre to affect satiety, high intakes of fibre are needed, and which a major mechanism is thought to occur via propionate. Within this thesis it was identified that rather than selecting specific fibres, increasing overall intakes of highly fermentable carbohydrates is as effective at increasing propionate production. Selecting carbohydrates with beta-bonding, particularly laminarin and other β(1 - 4) fermentable carbohydrates leads to marginal increases in propionate production. Compared with targeted delivery of propionate to the colon, fermentable carbohydrates examined in this thesis have lesser and variable effects on propionate production. A more complete understanding of the impact of bond configurations in polysaccharides, rather than disaccharides, may help selection or design of dietary carbohydrates which selectively promote colonic propionate production substrates for inclusion in functional foods. Overall this study has concluded that few substrates are selectively propiogenic and the evidence suggests that similar changes in propionate production may be achieved by modest changes in dietary fibre intak...|$|E
