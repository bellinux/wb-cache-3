Kankkunen {{finished}} eighth and Räikkönen 25th due to car trouble. He finished seventh in the Rallye Deutschland, his second ever asphalt rally, while notching up his first ever career stage win, the last stage of the rally.|$|E

On February 14, {{the first day of}} spring training for pitchers and catchers, when asked who the Opening Day starter would be, manager Charlie Manuel responded, [...] "Yeah, you <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>go</b> ahead and pencil him in. I don't think there's any sense in me playing games. Go ahead, pencil him in." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] tonearm), an ashtray, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible {{on the table with}} the record player, is the cover of the 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The only sound is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>go</b> public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E

500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>go</b> back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

[...] When Conner read in the newspaper that she was scheduled to appear on [...] The Pat Sajak Show in January 1990 with Panait, he wondered [...] "why it was still impossible for any friends to contact" [...] Comăneci. As he had worked for NBC Sports as a host during the previous Olympics, he knew the producer Michael Weisman (who had since moved to CBS) and contacted him to inquire about Comăneci's upcoming interview. They discussed the [...] "fact that none of [...] old friends {{had been able to}} see or contact" [...] Comăneci, and Conner was worried (given the bad press that she had been given) that [...] "something fishy" [...] was going on.
