25|$|After Superman IV in 1987, Reeve's {{relationship}} with Exton fell apart, and they separated. He moved to New York without his children. He became depressed {{and decided that}} doing a comedy <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for him. He was given a lead in Switching Channels. Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. Reeve later stated {{that he made a}} fool of himself in the film and that most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. The film did poorly, and Reeve believed that it marked the end of his movie star career. He spent the next years mostly doing plays. He tried out for the Richard Gere role in Pretty Woman but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.|$|E

2500|$|The cricket writer John Kay, in his anecdotal {{history of}} Lancashire League cricket, Cricket in the Leagues, wrote a whole chapter on Lionel Cranfield as [...] "The Man who Inspired".

He had earlier played for clubs in the Bolton League, the Central Lancashire League and the Lancashire League. Kay records that Cranfield was an inspirational cricket coach and that, when his League cricket playing career was over, he became assistant coach at Eton College, working alongside George Hirst, before retiring from that back to Middleton.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the deleted scenes feature {{additional}} {{characters from}} the television series who ultimately did {{not appear in the}} finished film. Lynch has said that [...] "I had a limit on the running time of the picture. We shot many scenes that—for a regular feature—were too tangential to keep the main story progressing properly. We thought it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> sometime to do a longer version with these other things in, {{because a lot of the}} characters that are missing in the finished movie had been filmed. They're part of the picture, they're just not necessary for the main story." [...] According to Lynch, had the film included these scenes, it [...] "wouldn't have been quite so dark.

2500|$|In a mixed review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian judged Mylo Xylotos storyline as {{incoherent}} {{and expressed}} skepticism toward the album's purported pop influences, feeling {{that much of}} the album [...] "just sounds like standard-issue Coldplay, replete with echoing guitars, woah-oh choruses and vocals that signify high drama by slipping into falsetto", apart from electronic music flourishes that [...] "genuinely [...] a bit of freshness to a formulaic sound". In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Melissa Maerz interpreted the album as an attempt by the group to sound less like themselves in order to reconcile their commercial success with the supposed stigma of being [...] "as hated as a band can be". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times was critical of Martin's lyrics, stating that [...] "every touch of lyrical bitterness is followed by enough sugar to mask the taste, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> in the short term but isn't a recipe for long-term health." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{least in}} the {{earliest}} days, the history of patent medicines is coextensive with scientific medicine. [...] Empirical medicine, {{and the beginning of}} the application of the scientific method to medicine, began to yield a few orthodoxly acceptable herbal and mineral drugs for the physician's [...] arsenal. [...] These few remedies, on the other hand, were inadequate to cover the bewildering variety of diseases and symptoms. [...] Beyond these patches of evidence-based application, people used other methods, such as occultism; the [...] "doctrine of signatures"– essentially, the application of sympathetic magic to pharmacology– held that nature had hidden clues to medically effective drugs in their resemblances to the human body and its parts. [...] This led medical men to hope, at least, that, say, walnut shells <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for skull fractures. [...] Given the state of the pharmacopoeia, and patients' demands for something to take, physicians began making [...] "blunderbuss" [...] concoctions of various drugs, proven and unproven. [...] These concoctions were the ancestors of the several nostrums.|$|E
2500|$|Economist and New York Times {{columnist}} Paul Krugman {{has argued}} that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: [...] "At this point, the guiding principle {{of one of our}} nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think something <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America." [...] He argued that Republican opposition to Medicare savings proposed by the President is [...] "utterly at odds both with the party’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe. Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending. First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. (Honest.) In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing. And in recent years, Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in entitlement spending – growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Martin was {{an honorary}} {{fellow of the}} Zoological Society of London, which owns the London Zoo. Martin thought that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> {{publicity}} for the zoo to have the Beatles pose outside the insect house for the cover photography of the album. However, the society turned down Martin's offer, and instead, Angus McBean was asked to take the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI's London headquarters in Manchester Square. Martin was to write later: [...] "We rang up the legendary theatre photographer Angus McBean, and bingo, he came round and did it there and then. It was done in an almighty rush, like the music. Thereafter, though, the Beatles' own creativity came bursting to the fore." [...] In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although the 1969 photograph was originally intended for the then-planned Get Back album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as Let It Be. Instead, the 1969 photograph, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used in 1973 for the Beatles' retrospective albums 1962–1966 and 1967–1970. Another unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot was used for The Beatles (No. 1) (EP released 1 November 1963).|$|E

2500|$|The International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) {{heavily criticized}} Virgin Galactic {{within hours of}} the accident. Tommaso Sgobba, Executive Director of the IAASS, claimed that Virgin Galactic had refused to let IAASS {{scientists}} review its procedures and snubbed industry gatherings. He stated: [...] "They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. They use outdated methods like testing and then seeing what happens. There has been no independent oversight. There is no peer review. I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen." [...] Sgobba, the former head of flight safety for the European Space Agency, said on November 6, 2014 that industry best practice called for operators to build in [...] "two-failure tolerance", or sufficient safeguards to survive two separate, unrelated failures—two human errors, two mechanical errors or one of each. [...] "What we see in the incident is what we call 'zero-failure tolerance'," [...] Mr Sgobba said. [...] "So you make the mistake—you have a catastrophe. The design would not be acceptable in other safety-critical industries, such as aircraft manufacture." [...] Other members of IAASS also commented on the accident in the immediate aftermath. Rocket propulsion expert and rocket powered dragster driver Carolynne Campbell-Knight was quoted as saying that Virgin Galactic [...] "...should stop, give up. Go away and do something they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> at like selling mobile phones. They should stay out of the space business." [...] Campbell-Knight also stated that an explosion of the nitrous oxide hybrid propulsion system was the cause of the accident, although the initial NTSB report did not indicate that the propulsion system contributed to the breakup of the vehicle.|$|E
