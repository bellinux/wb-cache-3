A total of 1850 units were produced. Today is a highly sought-after instrument which recently reached quotations around 8.000 UKP. It was succeeded by the Elka EK-22 (based on the CEM3396 chip which was also featured in e.g. Oberheim's <b>Matrix</b> <b>line</b> of synthesizers) and the Elka EK-44 (based on Yamaha's 4-OP FM).|$|E

50|$|After {{receiving}} the Blue Moon Award for the Matrix MP150, van Oosterum {{thought it was}} time to expand the <b>Matrix</b> <b>line,</b> and he did so with the launch in 2008 with the Matrix P1.0. However his designs didn’t stop there, and in 2009 and 2010 Kharma introduced the Exquisite MP1000 Power Amplifier and the P1000 Exquisite pre-amplifier, which eventually got a full upgrade in 2012 that ran a world-premiere at T.H.E. Show in Las Vegas. But before 2012 arrived, Kharma introduced a whole new product line called the Elegance line in 2010. This new line is representing the latest technologies developed by Kharma and in 2012 got equipped with the new Kharma Omega-7 driver, which is based on a new cone technology especially developed for Kharma.|$|E
50|$|The Proto <b>Matrix</b> <b>line</b> {{began with}} the 2005 model (the PM5). It uses the same {{balanced}} spool-valve design and the same FUSE style bolt system. Though {{when compared with the}} higher-end DM model, the PM lacks an Ultralite (UL) frame and Dye Ultralite barrel. When the PM5 was first released, it came with a standard Proto frame and a one-piece Proto barrel. However, with the release of the PM6, a Proto two-piece barrel was introduced and is now standard with PMs, though the same style of Proto frame remained until the 2008 Proto Matrix. The PM8 the latest Matrix released under the Proto label, now comes standard with the Dye Ultralite frame installed, as opposed to being a separate drop-in upgrade.|$|E
5000|$|The other new-to-2003 Smart Parts marker {{was called}} the Nerve. It has since been discontinued. Nerves are a {{next-generation}} Impulse design, featuring a smaller and lighter profile, improved internals, upgraded and streamlined components from the factory, and a sleeker external look. It shares many parts that are interchangeable with the shocker, however it uses a different platform for operation. When Nerves were first released (several months late due to manufacturing and development issues), {{it was designed to}} be Smart Parts flagship [...] "no upgrades needed" [...] marker. It came packed with Smart Parts best accessories. The high-end features resulted in the MSRP costing $1200 for the base model, or $1500 for the upgraded package with HPA tank included. The reasoning for this was based on the previous customized Impulse markers, which retailed for $1000+, however the Nerve's high price tag didn't fare as well with the public. This was partially because public trends were already shifting away from the stacked-tube hammer/valve markers which the Nerve was based from, and toward more advanced designs such as the Shocker, Dye <b>Matrix</b> <b>line,</b> and others (this trend proceeded through 2004). To combat this, Nerve price was dropped a few months later to $1000, then again to $850. At this point Nerves were finally gaining popularity as originally expected, however one final blow was dealt to the Nerve which would put it away - the release of the Ion (below). In late 2005 SP produced an additional large batch of Nerve parts, however after this the line was halted and the marker was unofficially discontinued in light of other products.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAssistant robots and robot companions are {{service robots}} {{designed}} {{to share the}} human living space, to navigate among and interact with human beings. From the mobility point of view, roboticists have recently striven to develop navigation scheme geared towards achieving so-called "socially acceptable motions". To that end, various concepts borrowed from environmental psychology and anthropology have been used, the Personal Space concept from Proxemics being perhaps the most widely used. The purpose of this work here is to further the {{research in this area}} by taking into account other factors such as human activities, interaction configurations and intentions. To that end, an attentional model [Maisonnasse 06] derived from cognitive psychology is used to dynamically determine the different interactions taking place between the entities, i. e. robot, persons and objects, that are present in the environment. The attention of a given person is modeled as a 3 D vector whose norm is the amount of attentional resources that the person has. The vector direction is the main attentional direction around which the attentional resources of the person are spread. How attention is spread depends on the salience, i. e. the ability to attract the attention, of the entities at hand. Computing this vector for every entity in the environment yields the corresponding attentional matrix. Each <b>matrix</b> <b>line</b> gives the amount of attention that a particular person gives to the other entities whereas a matrix column gives the amount of attention globally received by an entity. This matrix dynamically changes depending on the current situation. Now, it will be shown how the robot can use this attention information in order to decide its future course of action depending on the task at hand. It could for instant seek to attract one person's attention or, on the contrary, to minimize the distraction caused...|$|E
