5|$|The {{invasion}} of <b>Martinique</b> of 1809 {{was a successful}} British amphibious operation against the French West Indian island of <b>Martinique</b> that took place between 30 January and 24 February 1809 during the West Indies Campaign 1804–1810 of the Napoleonic Wars. <b>Martinique,</b> like nearby Guadeloupe, was {{a major threat to}} British trade in the Caribbean, providing a sheltered base from which privateers and French Navy warships could raid British shipping and disrupt the trade routes that maintained the British economy. The islands also provided a focus for larger scale French operations in the region and in the autumn of 1808, following the Spanish alliance with Britain, the Admiralty decided to order a British squadron to neutralise the threat, beginning with <b>Martinique.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became more apparent, the watches and warnings were extended southward to include <b>Martinique</b> and Saint Lucia. On <b>Martinique,</b> authorities {{released a statement}} that warned the public for the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As {{a result of the}} storm, the <b>Martinique</b> Aimé Césaire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall {{across much of}} the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in <b>Martinique</b> further north, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. The threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on Montserrat, which was being threatened by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Irisfour in <b>Martinique,</b> and one in Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{was between}} St Lucia and <b>Martinique</b> on 24 June, when she {{captured}} the 16-gun French privateer Enfant Prodigue after a 72-hour chase. The French vessel {{was under the}} command of lieutenant de vaisseau Victor Lefbru and was carrying dispatches for <b>Martinique.</b> The Royal Navy took Enfant Prodigue into service as HMS St Lucia.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in America, the 64th {{remained}} in Jamaica for two years, returning to England in 1783. Four {{years later the}} regiment was stationed in Ireland, before sailing once more for the West Indies in 1793 at {{the outbreak of the}} Napoleonic Wars. At the end of the Seven Years' War both <b>Martinique</b> and Guadeloupe had been returned to France {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris. From Barbados the 64th Foot took part in the invasion of <b>Martinique</b> in early 1794. As before the flank companies were detached from the rest of the regiment but all three elements were involved in the actions in <b>Martinique.</b> This short but successful campaign earned the regiment its second battle honour, <b>Martinique</b> 1794—although as with the earlier Guadeloupe honour, it was not actually awarded until 1909.|$|E
50|$|As an {{overseas}} départment of France, <b>Martinique's</b> culture is French and Caribbean. Its former capital, Saint-Pierre (destroyed by a volcanic eruption), was {{often referred to}} as the Paris of the Lesser Antilles. Following French custom, many businesses close at midday, then reopen later in the afternoon. The official language is French, although many Martinicans speak a Creole patois. Based in French, <b>Martinique's</b> Creole also incorporates elements of English, Spanish, Portuguese, and African languages. Originally passed down through oral storytelling traditions, it continues to be used more often in speech than in writing.|$|R
50|$|After {{appearing}} {{on the streets of}} San Francisco after M-Day, <b>Martinique's</b> powers seemed to have strengthened, her power to read minds on a basic level having grown into full-blown telepathic powers, which she is able to use to perform deeper psychic probes and mask her mind from telepathic intrusion by even a mutant as powerful as Emma Frost. <b>Martinique's</b> power of illusion seems to have mutated into incredibly powerful and complex illusions that completely warp the thoughts, personalities and perceptions of others in an entire city and its environments with ease.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Martinique</b> macaw was scientifically {{described}} by the British banker and zoologist Walter Rothschild in 1905, as a new species of the genus Anodorhynchus, A. martinicus. The taxon was solely based on a 1630s account by Père Jacques Bouton of blue and orange-yellow macaws from the Lesser Antillean island of <b>Martinique.</b> Rothschild reclassified the species as Ara martinicus in his 1907 book, Extinct Birds, which also contained a restoration of the bird by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans. The reassignment lead to confusion as recently as 2001, when Williams and Steadman assumed the two names were meant to refer to separate birds. The <b>Martinique</b> amazon (Amazona martinicana) of the same island, was also based solely on a contemporary description.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State for the French Overseas, Christian Estrosi, visited <b>Martinique</b> {{shortly after}} the {{hurricane}} to inspect the damage. He was joined by French Prime Minister, François Fillon on August 22 and the two surveyed the damaged to Guadeloupe and <b>Martinique,</b> the two hardest hit French colonies. A week after the storm hit 11,000people in <b>Martinique</b> were still without telephone and electricity and in the worst hit parts of southern Guadeloupe the water was still not drinkable. Banana crops in Guadeloupe, 80% of which were destroyed by Dean, will not recover until March, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The frigate Thétis, {{stationed}} to {{the south}} of Brest at Lorient, was selected to carry supplies to <b>Martinique</b> and given a full complement of 330 men, 40 cannon and a new captain, Jacques Pinsum. Supplies were loaded, including over 1,000 barrels of flour and 106 soldiers to reinforce the garrison at <b>Martinique.</b> Secrecy was tight: to prevent the British discovering Thétis mission, even the local shore defences were not informed of the frigate's departure early on 10 November 1808.|$|E
5|$|After conquering Canada, the British {{government}} {{put together}} a plan to defeat the French in the West Indies. In November 1761, Montgomery and the 17th set sail for Barbados, where they joined other units from North America. On January 5, 1762, the force left Barbados and headed towards the French island of <b>Martinique,</b> arriving there in mid-January. The French, having received word of an impending attack, had built up their defenses. A beachhead was quickly established, and the main offensive began on January 24. The French outer defenses were overrun and the survivors fled to the capital, Fort Royal. The British prepared to launch {{an assault on the}} fort, but the French, seeing the situation was hopeless, surrendered. On February 12, the entire island surrendered. After the fall of <b>Martinique,</b> the rest of the French West Indies, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent, fell to the British without a fight. On May 6, 1762, in reward for his actions in <b>Martinique,</b> Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell promoted Montgomery to captain and gave him command of one of the ten companies of the 17th Foot.|$|E

50|$|Due to <b>Martinique's</b> inhospitable nature, the duo {{resolved}} {{to settle in}} Guadeloupe in 1635, took possession of the island, and wiped out many of the Carib Amerindians. It was annexed to the kingdom of France in 1674.|$|R
5|$|Despite its poor cloud structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over {{portions}} of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of <b>Martinique</b> received a record 12inches (305mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, affecting many northern villages and communes. Le Prêcheur was devastated by an extensive debris flow, which washed away entire structures. The disaster wrought $19million (1993USD) in damage across <b>Martinique,</b> and left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed {{two people in the}} Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1808, {{messages}} arrived in France from <b>Martinique,</b> outlining the desperate situation of their supplies, morale and economy. It was determined that reinforcements and food supplies would be sent and the frigate Thétis was despatched in November 1808. Within days, Thétis had been captured at the Action of 10 November 1808, and subsequent operations had mixed success: the frigate Amphitrite reached <b>Martinique,</b> {{but a number of}} smaller ships were intercepted and defeated, both in Europe and the West Indies. In desperation, a major operation was planned, intended to transport substantial supplies and sufficient troops to resist the inevitable British invasion on <b>Martinique.</b> To this end, Commodore Amable-Gilles Troude was provided with the ships of the line Courageux, Polonais and Hautpoult, with the frigates Félicité and Furieuse en flûte as armed storeships, carrying the bulk of the supplies.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Abby {{bypassed}} Barbados {{a tropical}} depression, {{which resulted in}} minimal effects. Maximum sustained winds on Barbados were reported at 23mph (57km/h), while gusts were recorded up to 37mph (60km/h). There are no other effects known on Barbados. St. Lucia had borne {{the brunt of the}} storm when Hurricane Abby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. Rainfall on the island totaled at 6.80in (172.7mm). Tropical storm force winds were recorded on the island for the passage of Hurricane Abby on July 10, though there were no hurricane force winds reported. In addition, a roof collapsed in on a house, killing six of the residents living there. The passage of Hurricane Abby also resulted in $435,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) of damage on St. Lucia. <b>Martinique</b> was near the path of Hurricane Abby, which resulted in some effects. The <b>Martinique</b> Aimé Césaire International Airport in Fort-de-France recorded rainfall at nearly three inches (76.2mm), while rain in another village was measured at nearly four inches (101.2mm). Winds on <b>Martinique</b> were also at least tropical storm force during the passage of Hurricane Abby. However, wind gusts on <b>Martinique</b> were around 75mph (120km/h), greater than that which was observed on St. Lucia. There were also damaged roads and bridges, mainly due to landslides. The island nation of Dominica was also affected by Hurricane Abby. Hurricane Abby produced nearly sixin (152.4mm) of rain on the island. Winds were also similar to those that were measured on Barbados. Hurricane Abby left about $65,000 (1960 USD, $ USD) in damage to Dominica.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{entered the}} Caribbean as a Category2 {{hurricane}} through the Saint Lucia Channel on August 17. It moved briskly between the Lesser Antillean islands of St. Lucia and <b>Martinique,</b> with its storm surge and rain bands reaching every {{island in the}} chain. Damage was most severe in <b>Martinique</b> where total damage was estimated at €400million and three indirect deaths, while nearby Guadaloupe suffered €400million of damage. In St. Lucia, damage was mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at US$18million.|$|E
