Further the causes of attrition vary within a company such that causes for turnover in one department <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different from the causes of turnover in another department.

25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{vary from}} one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently {{the same from}} one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> specific, {{or it might be}} broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying {{that it is possible to}} identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, {{it seems}} to be assumed that all {{ecosystem}} services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful to us, such as coastal protection from hurricanes by mangroves for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting cattle. The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves {{play a critical role in}} regulating prey populations, the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands have caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 Adolf Dittrich and Daniel Lamparter {{did a study}} {{where they}} found that DMT-induced altered state of {{consciousness}} (ASC) is strongly influenced by habitual, rather than situative factors. In the study researchers used three dimensions of the APZ questionnaire to describe ASC (rating scales of ASC). First, oceanic boundlessness (OB) refers to dissolution of ego boundaries mostly associated with positive emotions. Second, anxious ego-dissolution (AED) includes disorder of thoughts, loss of autonomy and self-control and third, visionary restructuralization (VR) that includes auditory and visual illusions, hallucinations. Results showed strong effects within first and third dimensions for all conditions, especially DMT and suggested strong intrastability of elicited reactions independently of the condition for the OB and VR scales. Importantly, the experiment was conducted in a safe laboratory environment. This particular setting had a certain influence on found results that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different outside the laboratory environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{germination}} percentage {{is simply the}} proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The germination rate is {{the length of time}} it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by {{germination percentage}} plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> low.|$|E
500|$|The typical {{case will}} be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death. There must be a {{criminal}} act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe. Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions [...] {{where there is no}} need to show intent [...] would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by gross negligence manslaughter. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime.|$|E

Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its [...] "threshold requirement" [...] that guides what material would {{be covered by the}} law was too broad, he questioned the potential double standard that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold. Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that [...] "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games just <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show," [...] referencing the book [...] Infinite Reality [...] which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision [...] "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the Berber Apuleius, however, may be {{regarded}} as more an exception than the rule. Evidently many native Berbers adopted to the Mediterranean-wide influences operating in the province, eventually intermarrying, or otherwise entering the front ranks as notables. Yet the majority did not. There remained a social hierarchy consisting of the Romanized, the partly assimilated, and the unassimilated (here were the many rural Berbers {{who did not know}} Latin). Yet in this schema considered among the [...] "assimilated" [...] <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> poor immigrants from other regions of the Empire. These imperial distinctions overlay the preexisting stratification of economic classes, e.g., there continued the practice of slavery, and there remained a coopted remnant of the wealthy Punic aristocracy.|$|E
2500|$|For example, in most U.S. states, the {{criminal}} statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. (Codification {{is the process}} of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Three {{works have}} survived which are {{attributed}} to Hesiod by ancient commentators: Works and Days, Theogony, and Shield of Heracles. Other works attributed to him are only found now in fragments. The surviving works and fragments were all written in the conventional metre and language of epic. However, the Shield of Heracles is now known to be spurious and probably {{was written in the}} sixth century BC. Many ancient critics also rejected Theogony (e.g., Pausanias 9.31.3), even though Hesiod mentions himself by name in that poem. Theogony and [...] Works and Days <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different in subject matter, but they share a distinctive language, metre, and prosody that subtly distinguish them from Homer's work and from the Shield of Heracles (see Hesiod's Greek below). Moreover, they both refer to the same version of the Prometheus myth. Yet even these authentic poems may include interpolations. [...] For example, the first ten verses of the Works and Days may have been borrowed from an Orphic hymn to Zeus (they were recognised as not the work of Hesiod by critics as ancient as Pausanias).|$|E
2500|$|Magicians {{are able}} to cast spells, summon spirits, and create magical {{artifacts}} called [...] "foci". All magicians follow traditions that determine their understanding of magic, including hermetic mages (whose control of magic comes through study and manipulation of magical energy or mana, and who summon and bind elementals in lengthy and expensive rituals to be called on later) and shamans (whose magic derives from a connection to nature via a totem spirit, and who can summon the nature spirits associated with a particular place). Adepts use magic internally in order to accentuate their natural physical abilities. Adepts can run on walls, use mundane objects as deadly thrown projectiles, shatter hard objects with a single unarmed blow, and perform similar feats of incredible ability. All adepts follow a very personal path (Path of the Warrior, Path of the Artist, etc.) that normally determines their abilities which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> different for any two adepts (while one might demonstrate increased reflexes and facility with firearms, a second might possess unparalleled mastery of the katana, and a third {{might be able to}} pull off incredible vehicular stunts). Mystic adepts, also known as physical mages, are part magician and part adept who distribute their magic power between the abilities of both aspects.|$|E
