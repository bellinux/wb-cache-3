The glycoprotein fetuin was bound to a carboxymethylated-Dextran sensor surface usingN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. Low-pH-induced BHA rosettes bind specifically to the fetuin-derivitized sensor surface, but not to an asialofetuin-derivitized sensor surface.

The biosensor system utilizes specific interactions between proteins and cell surface receptors, which trigger a receptor aggregation process. Distance-dependent fluorescence self-quenching and resonant energy transfer mechanisms were coupled with a <b>multivalent</b> <b>interaction</b> to probe the receptor aggregation process, providing a sensitive and specific signal transduction method for such a binding event. The fluorescence change induced by the aggregation process can be monitored by different instrument platforms, e. g. fluorimetry and flow cytometry. In this article, a sensitive detection of pentavalent cholera toxin which recognizes ganglioside GM 1 has been demonstrated through the resonant energy transfer scheme, which can achieve a double color change simultaneously. A detection sensitivity as high as 10 pM has been achieved {{within a few minutes}} (c. a. 5 minutes). The simultaneous double color change (an increase of acceptor fluorescence and a decrease of donor fluorescence intensity) of two similar fluorescent probes provides particularly high detection reliability owing {{to the fact that they}} act as each other's internal reference.

Given the importance of multivalency in the natural interactions of Collagen, multivalent ligands provide unique opportunities to target Collagen architectures. Here, we explored the use of micelles as dynamic self-assembling multivalent scaffolds for the Collagen binding protein CNA 35. Despite the increased popularity of micelles as nanosized carriers in targeted drug delivery and molecular imaging, few studies have actually directly addressed the importance of <b>multivalent</b> <b>interactions</b> for micelle-based targeting. Native chemical ligation was used as a chemoselective and efficient method to prepare relatively well-defined and stable micelles with a tunable average protein content between 0 and 20 copies of CNA 35 per micelle. The thermodynamics and kinetics of CNA 35 micelle binding to Collagen was studied using solid-phase and surface plasmon resonance assays. <b>Multivalent</b> <b>interactions</b> between the micelles and Collagen had a remarkable effect on micellar stability, since no dissociation of collagen-bound micelles was observed even after extensive washing. In addition, an impressive enhancement of Collagen affinity was observed both in vitro and ex vivo resulting from multivalent display of a so-called "nonbinding" variant of CNA 35. This "restoration" of Collagen affinity was subsequently also observed for liposomes displaying the same low-affinity CNA 35 variant at a sufficient density.

Lately, analogous artificial materials have been synthesised by functionalising the outer surface of compliant Brownian units, for example emulsion droplets and lipid vesicles, with selective linkers, in particular short DNA sequences. This development extended the range of applicability of DNA as a selective glue, originally applied to solid nano and colloidal particles. On very deformable lipid vesicles, the coupling between statistical effects of <b>multivalent</b> <b>interactions</b> and mechanical deformation of the membranes gives rise to complex emergent behaviours, as we recently contributed to demonstrate [Parolini et al. Nat. Commun. 2015, 6, 5948]. Several aspects of the complex phenomenology observed in these systems still lack a quantitative experimental characterisation and a fundamental understanding. Here {{we focus on the}} DNA-mediated <b>multivalent</b> <b>interactions</b> of a single liposome adhering to a flat supported bilayer. This simplified geometry enables the estimate of the membrane tension induced by the DNA-mediated adhesive forces acting on the liposome. Our experimental investigation is completed by morphological measurements and the characterisation of the DNA-melting transition, probed by in situ Förster Resonant Energy Transfer spectroscopy. Experimental results are compared with the predictions of an analytical theory that couples the deformation of the vesicle to a full description of the statistical mechanics of mobile linkers.

Galectin- 1, {{a member of the}} galectin family of lectins, is a functionally dimeric galactoside-binding protein. Although galectin- 1 has both intracellular and extracellular functions, the defining carbohydrate-binding role occurs extracellularly. In this review, the extracellular roles of galectin- 1 in cancer processes are discussed. In particular, the importance of <b>multivalent</b> <b>interactions</b> in galectin- 1 mediated cellular processes is reviewed. <b>Multivalent</b> <b>interactions</b> involving galectin- 1 in cellular adhesion, mobility and invasion, tumor-induced angiogenesis, and apoptosis are presented.

To conclude this review, synthetic frameworks that have been used to modulate galectin- 1 processes are reviewed.
