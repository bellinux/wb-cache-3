Meade suggested that Davis wanted to have a Louisianan in his Cabinet, but that a smarter course of action would have been to send Benjamin abroad to win over the European governments. Butler called Benjamin's appointment [...] "a waste of good material". Historian William C. Davis, in his volume on the formation of the Confederate government, notes, [...] "For some there was next to nothing to do, none more so than Benjamin." [...] The role of the attorney general in a Confederacy that did not yet have federal courts or marshals was so minimal that initial layouts for the building housing the government in Montgomery allotted no space to the Justice Department.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E
500|$|While at {{the amateur}} clubs, Valbuena also honed his quickness, {{technical}} ability, and developed his tenacious {{style of play}} which contributed to his positive work-rate defensively. Léglise once stated that [...] "he had never worked with such a young person so technically brilliant" [...] in his coaching career. Valbuena's former coach also described the player's tenacious style stating [...] "Whatever the build of the opponent, he will always tackle" [...] and [...] "he also surprised <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> level of his defensive work when he is aligned on the right-hand side". Valbuena is also known for his small size and, while at Langon, began using his diminutive stature to his advantage. During his first season at Marseille, he earned the nickname le petit by his former manager Eric Gerets. Gerets described the player as [...] "extremely mobile" [...] and a player who is [...] "very quick at turning, {{from one side to}} the other".|$|E

In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E

500|$|A {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} writing credits on [...] "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: [...] "Apparently Beyoncé {{was at a}} show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on...The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement {{and that makes it}} a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." [...] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but thought {{that it would be better}} suited for Beyoncé, and later regretted giving the song to her. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, [...] "I said I originally wrote the song for me....Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away." ...|$|E

American President Woodrow Wilson remained unimpressed by Marie, and her comments on Russian laws dealing with sexual relations, which were considered inappropriate, did not help. Marie shocked many officials by waving all her ministers aside and leading negotiations herself. On this, she would later comment, [...] "Never mind, you'll all just {{have to get used to}} accepting <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> faults of my virtues." [...] Marie left Paris with numerous supplies for Romania's relief and later that year, the conference resulted in the international recognition of Greater Romania, thus doubling Ferdinand and Marie's kingdom to [...] and increasing the population by ten million.
