The maximum amounts of short-chain FAME and of aldehydic FAME obtained were of the same order (3 - 4 mg/g sample in methyl linoleate and trilinolein heated for 15 h). After a second methylation step with diazomethane, amounts of dimethyl suberate and azelate were also quantitated. The total amounts of dimethyl esters in TAG model systems ranged from 1. 07 to 3. 35 mg/g of heated sample and were similar to those found for total aldehydic FAME (from 1. 03 to 3. 15 mg/g of heated sample), suggesting that oxidation of the aldehydic acyl group to an acid acyl group was a major reaction.

40|$|Rotundone {{is a key}} {{aromatic}} compound for cool-climate Shiraz. This compound is produced in the skin of grape berries and extracted into wine during fermentation. This project investigated the influence of fermentation techniques on the concentration of rotundone in the resultant wine. Wine was fortified with ethanol and sucrose on the 1 st and 5 th days of fermentation and rotundone, volatile aroma compounds and colour were assessed in the resultant wine. The relationship between the concentration of rotundone and alcoholic strength during fermentation process was also investigated. Wine alcoholic strength and skin–wine contact time were two factors affecting rotundone extraction rate from grapes into wine. Fortification significantly enhanced rotundone extraction rate, and improved wine colour and phenolics and affects the concentration of ethyl acetate, 3 -methylbutyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl <b>octanoate,</b> <b>methyl</b> nonanoate, isopentanol and phenylethyl alcohol in the resultant wine.

However, any potential alternatives must be thoroughly characterized and tested. In this investigation nine potential biofuels derived from sustainable sources were tested for their compatibility with Jet A- 1 aviation kerosene. The fuels chosen were n-butanol, n-hexanol, butyl levulinate, butyl butyrate, ethyl <b>octanoate,</b> <b>methyl</b> linolenate, farnesene, ethyl cyclohexane and limonene. Viscosities were determined between − 30 and 40 °C and were observed to increase with decreasing temperature roughly in accordance with ideal fluid behavior. Cloud point temperatures of all samples were tested and all fuels except n-butanol and methyl linolenate were found to be below the specification maximum. Flash points of all fuels apart from pure and blends of ethyl cyclohexane and n-butanol were found to be greater than 38 °C, the minimum threshold specified in the standard. Of all the samples only the hydrocarbon fuels met the required energy content minimum with energy content decreasing with increasing oxygen content. The effect of each fuel on the range vs. the payload, relative to Jet A- 1 was determined using a simplified model in order to ascertain likely impact of adoption upon airline operations.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present work is on the {{empirical}} characterization and modeling of ignition trends of ternary blends of three distinct hydrocarbon classes, namely a methyl ester (C 9 H 18 O 2), a linear alkane (n-C 9 H 20), and a cycloalkane (MCH). Numerous surrogate biofuel formulations have been proposed in the literature, yet specific blending of these species has not been studied. Moreover, the effects of blending biofuel compounds with conventional hydrocarbons are not widely studied and a further point {{is the lack of}} studies paying specific attention to the effects of fuel variation within a given blended biofuel. To this end, a statistical Design of Experiments L 9 array, comprised of 4 parameters (%MO, %MCH, pressure, and equivalence ratio) with 3 levels of variation, constructed in order to systematically study the effects of relative fuel concentrations within the ternary blend enabled variations in fuel concentration for <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and MCH of 10 % - 30 % and 20 % - 40 %, respectively. Variation in pressure of 1 atm, 5 atm, and 10 atm and in equivalence ratio of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 were used, respectively. The fuel-volume percentage of n-nonane varied from 30 % - 70 %. In total, 10 ternary blends were studied. Ignition delay times for the ternary blends and for the three constituents were obtained by monitoring excited-state OH or CH transitions, A 2 Epsilon+ -> X 2 Pi or A 2 Delta -> X 2 Pi, respectively, behind reflected shock waves using a heated shock tube facility. Dilute conditions of 99 % Ar (vol.) were maintained in all shock tube experiments {{with the exception of a}} separate series of n-nonane and MCH experiments under stoichiometric conditions which used 4 % oxygen (corresponding to ~ 95 % Ar dilution). Temperatures behind reflected shock waves were varied over the range 1243 < T (K) < 1672. From over 450 shock tube experiments, empirical ignition delay time correlations were constructed for all three pure fuels and a master correlation equation for the blended fuels. Ignition experiments conducted on the pure fuels at 1. 5 atm indicated the following ignition delay time order, from shortest to longest: <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> < n-nonane < MCH. With increased pressure to 10 atm (nominal) the order remained, in general, consistent. Under fuel-lean conditions, ignition trends between <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and n-nonane exhibited overlap at temperatures below 1350 K, below which the trends diverged with <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> having shorter ignition delay times. Similar behavior was observed under fuel-rich conditions, yet with the overlap occurring above 1450 K. Stoichiometric ignition trends did not display overlapping behavior under either 1. 5 atm or 10 atm pressure. Laminar flame speed measurements were performed at 1 atm and an initial temperature of 443 K on the pure fuel constituents. Additional flame speed measurements of MCH were conducted at 403 K to compare with literature values and were shown to agree strongly with experiments conducted in a constant-volume apparatus. The experiments conducted herein, for the first time, measure laminar flame speeds <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate.</b> A detailed chemical kinetics mechanism was compiled from three independent, well-validated models for the constituent fuels, where the sub-mechanisms for <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and MCH were extracted for integration into a base n-nonane model. The compiled mechanism in the present study (4785 reactions and 1082 species) enables modeling of oxidation processes of the ternary fuel blends of interest. Calculations were performed using the compiled model relative to the base models to assess the impact of utilizing different base chemistry sets. In general, results were reproduced well relative to base models for both n-nonane and MCH, however results for <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> from both the compiled model and the base model are in disagreement with the results measured herein. Ignition delay times of the fuel blends are well-predicted for several conditions, specifically for blends at lean/high-pressure and stoichiometric/high-pressure conditions, however are not accurately modeled at fuel-rich, high-pressure conditions...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The malty flavor defect {{produced}} by Streptococcus lactis var. maltigenes {{has been the}} cause of considerable economic distress to various segments of the dairy industry. This {{study was conducted in}} order to develop a more thorough understanding of the chemical nature of this defect, and to formulate a synthetic malty flavor preparation. An 18 hour malty culture and an acidified heated skim milk control were steam distilled using a specially designed, low temperature, reduced pressure glass apparatus fitted with ground glass ball or standard taper joints. After subsequent ethyl ether extractions, the aqueous distillates yielded flavor concentrates which were suitable for gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) and mass spectrometric analysis. Flavor component identifications were made on both a tentative and positive basis. Tentative identifications were made using the technique of GLC relative retention times. Identifications were considered positive when GLC retention data could be coupled with mass spectral data. Compounds positively identified as being present in the malty culture included acetaldehyde, 3 -methylbutanal, phenylacetaldehyde, ethanol, butanol, 2 -methylpropanol, 3 -methylbutanol, 2 -furfurol, phenethyl alcohol, acetone, butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl octanoate, isoamyl acetate and toluene. Compounds tentatively identified included 2 -methylpropanal, pentanal, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl acetate, γ-octalactone, δ-octalactone, formic acid and acetic acid. In the heated skim milk control, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl acetate and methyl chloride were positively identified while pentanal, hexanal, octanal, nonanal, 2 -hexanone, 2 -octanone, ethyl formate, ethyl <b>octanoate,</b> <b>methyl</b> acetate, γ-octalactone and δ-octalactone remained as tentative identifications. Quantitative evaluations of the volatile constituents present in each of four strains of the malty culture were conducted using a gas entrainment, on-column trapping, GLC technique. From the quantitative data obtained from a 24 hour S. lactis var. maltigenes L/M- 20 culture, a synthetic malty flavor preparation, suitable for use in baked foods, was developed.

The peak inward current in intact axons was reduced {{reversibly}} by each substance. Sodium currents {{were recorded in}} intracellularly perfused axons before and during exposure to the test substances and the records were fitted with equations similar to those proposed by Hodgkin & Huxley (1952). Shifts in the voltage dependence of the steady-state activation and inactivation parameters (m infinity and h infinity), reductions in the peak heights of the activation and inactivation time constants (tau m and tau h) {{and changes in the}} maximum sodium conductance (gNa) caused by these substances have been tabulated and compared with the effects of <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (Haydon & Urban, 1983 b). Each compound shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation parameter in the hyperpolarizing direction and that of the steady-state activation parameter in the depolarizing direction.

The peak time constants are reduced and the voltage dependences of tau m and tau h are shifted in a direction commensurate with the shifts in steady-state properties. The maximum sodium conductance is not much affected either by the ketones or by methyl pentanoate. Large reductions in peak inward current coupled with little effect on gNa have been reported for the n-alkanols and other surface-active compounds (Haydon & Urban, 1983 b). This lack of a large effect on gNa indicates that whatever direct interaction does take place between the test substance and the channel protein, it does not result in a blockage of the channel...|$|E

The results are explained quantitatively by the Tresczanowicz-Kehiaian (TK) association model and the Flory lattice model in terms of alcohol self-association into tetramers, characterized by an OH-OH equilibrium constant and enthalpy, and by alcohol-ester complex formation characterized by an OH-COO equilibrium constant and enthalpy, each independent of alcohol and ester chain length. As predicted, phi-c(assoc) at infinite alcohol dilution is independent of the choice of alcohol, but increases with increasing ester chain length. With increasing alcohol concentration phi-c(assoc) passes through a maximum which is much reduced compared with the inert solvent case. For each alcohol, C(p) E increases with increasing ester chain length, while for the same ester, C(p) E decreases with increasing alcohol chain length. dC(p) E/dT is positive for mixtures of methanol and methyl acetate, as predicted by the TK model.

To find attractants that could be used for control of P. interrupta, either by mass trapping or by monitoring as part of integrated pest management, we screened headspace collections of sorghum and the highly attractive weed Abutilon figarianum Webb (Malvaceae) for antennal activity using gas chromatograph-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD). Compounds active in GC-EAD were identified by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Field trapping suggested that attraction is governed by a few influential compounds, rather than specific odor blends. Synthetic sorghum and abutilon odor blends were attractive, but neither blend outperformed the previously tested attractants eugenol and methyl salicylate, of which the latter also was part of the abutilon blend. The strong influence of single compounds led us to search for novel attractive compounds, and to investigate the role of individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the perception of kairomones. We screened the response characteristics of ORNs to 82 putative kairomones in single sensillum recordings (SSR), and found a number of key ligand candidates for specific classes of ORNs. Out of these key ligand candidates, six previously untested compounds were selected for field trapping trials: anethole, benzaldehyde, racemic 2, 3 -butanediol, isoamyl alcohol, methyl benzoate and <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate.</b> The compounds were selected on the basis that they activated different classes of ORNs, thus allowing us to test potential kairomones that activate large non-overlapping populations of the peripheral olfactory system, while avoiding redundant multiple activations of the same ORN type. Field trapping results revealed that racemic 2, 3 -butanediol is a powerful novel attractant for P. interrupta...|$|E

From these data, {{it was estimated that}} the standard free energy per CH 2 for adsorption to the site of action was - 3. 04 kJ mole- 1, as compared with - 3. 11 kJ mole- 1 for adsorption into phospholipid bilayers or an n-alkane/aqueous solution interface. The membrane capacity at 100 kHz was not greatly by any of the test substances at concentrations which reduced the inward current by 50 %. Na currents under voltage clamp were recorded in intracellularly perfused axons before, during and sometimes after exposure to the test substances and the records were fitted with equations similar to those proposed by Hodgkin & Huxley (1952). Shifts in the curves of the steady-state activation and inactivation parameters (m infinity and h infinity) against membrane potential, changes in the peak heights of the activation and inactivation time constants (tau m and tau h) and reductions in the maximum Na conductance (gNa) have been tabulated. All of the test substances shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state activation in the depolarizing direction and lowered the peak time constants for both activation and inactivation. The origins of these effects, and of the differences in the present results from those of the hydrocarbons (Haydon & Urban, 1983), have been discussed in terms of the physico-chemical properties of the two groups of substances and with reference to their effects on artificial membranes...|$|E
40|$|Wine aroma is an {{important}} characteristic and {{may be related to}} certain specific parameters, such as raw material and production process. The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines. Differentiation among Merlot wines and wines of other grape varieties were mainly perceived through the following components: ethyl dodecanoate, 1 -hexanol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, dehydro- 2 -methyl- 3 (2 H) thiophenone, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, ethyl tetradecanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> 1, 4 butanediol, and 6 -methyloctan- 1 -ol. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} and foraging of Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki in a microbe-rich environment reflect {{the adaptation of}} an extraordinary, sophisticated defense mechanism by the nest-mates. We aimed to explore the host pathogen interaction by studying caste-specific volatile chemistry and genes encoding the antioxidant defense of winged imagoes, nymphs, soldiers and workers of Formosan subterranean termites. Qualitative analyses of C. formosanus Shiraki performed by HS-SPME/GC-MS showed considerable variations in the chemical composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their proportions among all the castes. Winged imagoes produced the most important compounds such as naphthalene and n-hexanoic acid. The antifungal activity of these compounds along with nonanal, n-pentadecane, n-tetradecane, n-heptadecane and <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> against the conidial suspensions of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana isolates enable us {{to suggest that the}} failure of natural fungal infection in the nest is due to the antiseptic environment of the nest, which is mainly controlled by the VOCs of nest-mates. In addition, conidial germination of M. anisopliae and B. bassiana isolates evaluated on the cuticle of each caste showed significant variations among isolates and different castes. Our results showed that the conidia of M. anisopliae 02049 exhibited the highest germination on the cuticle of all the inoculated castes. Moreover, we recorded the lowest germination of the conidia of B. bassiana 200436. Caste-specific germination variations enabled us to report {{for the first time that}} the cuticle of winged imagoes was found to be the most resistant cuticle. The analysis of the transcriptome of C. formosanus Shiraki revealed the identification of 17 genes directly involved in antioxidant defense. Expression patterns of the identified antioxidant genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed the significantly highest upregulation of CAT, GST, PRXSL, Cu/Zn-SOD 2, TXN 1, TXN 2, TXNL 1, TXNL 2, TXNL 4 A and TPx genes among winged imagoes upon infection with the most virulent isolate, M. anisopliae 02049. Furthermore, soldiers showed the least expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense. Our findings indicated that the volatile chemistry of nest-mates and genes encoding antioxidant defense greatly contribute to the {{survival and}} foraging of Formosan subterranean termites in a microbe-rich habitat...|$|E

These were collected by cryogenic and chemical traps, then analysed by glc, HPLC and gc-ms. The major products so identified included; 3 -heptanone, heptanal and octanal from methyl cis- 9 -octadecenoate, hexanal, 2 -hexenal and 2 -heptenal from methyl cis- 9 -cis- 12 -octadecadienoate, and propanal, 1 -penten- 3 -ol and 1 -penten- 3 -one from methyl linolenate. <b>Methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> {{was found to be}} a product common to the autoxidation of the three methyl esters. The major products are explained by -scissions of alkoxy radicals. The quantity of volatile compounds produced was found to depend on both the degree of unsaturation and the type of promotor. Volatile products were observed during the promoted autoxidative crosslinking of polyester resins (alkyd resins). The products so formed corresponded to the fatty acids present in the resins. Time lapse infrared spectroscopy was used to observe chemical changes occurring in the drying resin films. Hydroperoxides are the primary autoxidation products and their rate of formation was shown to depend upon the promotor used. Benzoyloxyethyl cis- 9 -cis- 12 -octadecadienoate, a model alkyd, was synthesised and autoxidised. The volatile products formed were the same as those observed from methyl cis- 9 -cis- 12 -octadecadienoate. Alkyds having a high proportion of non-esterified hydroxyl groups may be crosslinked in the presence of strong acids. This {{has been shown to be}} an autoxidative process where the hydroperoxides are decomposed by the acid to give acetal type linkages. 2 -Hydroxyethyl linoleate, 2 -hydroxyethyllinolenate and a series of variable hydroxyl content alkyds were prepared. The volatile products isolated from the alkyds were similar to those produced using transition metal promotors but the 2 -hydroxyethyl esters produced only acetal type compounds. 6, 9 -Pentadecadiene, 8 -methyl- 6, 9 -pentadecadiene and 8, 8 -dimethyl- 6, 9 -pentadecadiene were synthesised and autoxidised.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of biodiesel {{has been widely}} studied. There are many raw materials used for the synthesis either from edible or non-edible oil. In this study, we investigated the {{synthesis of}} biodiesel using two steps process. The synthesis at 60 oC and ozonation are running in consecutive ways. The waste cooking oil was prepared for synthesis at 60 oC for one hour. The mol ratio of waste cooking oil and methanol was 1 : 5 and 1. 5 % w/w NaOH was used as catalyst. The reaction involved in the synthesis is transesterification, the product was collected and then will be processed for ozonation. The ozonation was carried out at 20 oC for 2 hours with mol ratio of methanol to transesterification product was 7 : 1. The acid catalyst (H 2 SO 4) was used for 1. 5 % w/w and 2 % w/w. Sample from both synthesis at 60 oC and ozonation process have been analysed using Gas Chromatography. The composition of fatty acids (% w/w) in waste cooking oil used for the experiment were : lauric acid 0. 34 %; myristate acid 1. 32 %; palmitic acid 38. 7 %, stearic acid 4. 67 %, oleic acid 40. 1 %, linoleic acid 12. 7 % and others 2. 17 %. It has been proved that transesterification product from synthesis at 60 oC contained of long chain methyl esters, hence the reaction is esterification from long chain fatty acids to long chain methyl esters which consisted of saturated and unsaturated methyl esters. The dominants long chain methyl esters from synthesis at 60 oC were methyl palmitate, methyl oleat, methyl stearate. Other long chain methyl esters are Methyl laurate, Methyl myristate, Methyl pentadecanoate, Methyl palmitoleate, Methyl linoleate, Methyl heneicosanoate, and Methyl heptadecanoate. There were three unsaturated methyl esters have been produced which are methyl palmitoleate, methyl oleat and methyl linoleate. All these products were then ozonised by ozonation process at various temperature. Short chain methyl esters which were from cracking of unsaturated methyl esters and long chain methyl esters remained as product. The transesterification can occur though it is only running at 10, 20 and 30 oC. The short chain methyl esters are methyl nonanoate, methyl hexanoate, and <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate.</b> Methyl nonanoate was a product from cracking of methyl oleate, whereas methyl hexanoate {{was a product of}} cracking of methyl linoleate.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to identify the flavor compounds in Blue cheese, however, duplication of Blue cheese flavor has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, it was desirable to make a qualitative and quantitative investigation of Blue cheese flavor compounds and to study the effect of certain microorganisms on Blue cheese flavor. The aroma fraction of Blue cheese was isolated by centrifugation of the cheese and molecular distillation of the recovered fat. The volatiles were separated by gas chromatography on packed columns containing polar and nonpolar phases and by temperature programmed capillary column gas chromatography. Relative retention time data and fast scan mass spectral analysis of the capillary column effluent were used to identify compounds in the aroma fraction. Compounds positively identified were as follows: 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -decanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, 2 -octanol, 2 -nonanol, methyl butanoate, methyl hexanote, <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> methyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanal, 3 -methyl butanal, 2 -methyl butanol, 3 -methyl butanol, 1 -pentanol, benzene, and toluene. Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl acetate, isopropyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, liquid-liquid chromatography and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during cheese curing does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate.</b> Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|E

Neutral volatile flavor compounds were isolated from Swiss cheese fat by low-temperature low-pressure distillation. The compounds were separated by temperature programmed gas chromatography. Direct analysis of cheese fat and whole cheese from four domestic and two imported good flavored cheeses by gas entrainment and on-column trapping provided a further means of isolation of volatile flavor compounds in Swiss cheese. Gas chromatography in conjunction with rapid scan mass spectrometry and relative retention time data were used to identify compounds.

Compounds tentatively identified include an aromatic hydrocarbon, pinane, α-fenchene, ethyl benzene, a di-methyl benzene, methyl benzoate, 2 -phenyl- 2 -methyl butane, 5 -methyl- 5 -ethyl decane, 3 -methyl butyl octanoate, 2, 5 -dimethyl tetra decane, methyl vinyl ether and 2 -methyl propenal. The concentration of selected volatile compounds identified by the on-column trapping technique were determined by relating their peak heights to known quantities of compound. Average concentrations calculated from the mean values for all the six cheeses and expressed in parts per million were as follows: dimethyl sulfide. 0. 107; diacetyl, 0. 8; acetaldehyde, 1. 4; acetone, 1. 6; butanone, 0. 3; 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, 0. 42; 2 -pentanone, 0. 98; 2 -heptanone, 0. 45; ethanol, 16. 3; 2 -butanol, 0. 3; 1 -propanol, 2. 9; 1 -butanol, 0. 7; methyl hexanoate, 1. 5; and ethyl butanoate, 0. 6. Liquid-liquid partition chromatography and gas chromatography were utilized to determine quantitatively the major free, fatty acids in the six Swiss cheeses. 2 -Methyl butyric acid was detected in all cheeses and varied from 9. 0 to 100. 0 mg/kg cheese. The other isomeric acid, 3 -methyl butyric, was detected in only two cheeses. Formic acid was detected in only one cheese. No n-valeric or 2 -methyl propionic acids were detected.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Increasing {{interest}} {{has been shown}} in the irradiation sterilization and irradiation pasteurization of foods, but problems of off-flavors and odors are still unsolved, {{especially in the case of}} dairy products. From the flavor chemistry point of view, milk lipids are very highly susceptible to irradiation effects. Therefore, this investigation was designed to study some irradiation induced reactions involving flavor changes in the milk fat and to identify the volatile components produced in the milk fat upon irradiation. Milk fat, prepared from raw sweet cream and washed free of phospholipids, was first irradiated in the presence of air and under vacuum in glass vials at 4. 5 Mrad with gamma rays from cobalt- 60. The irradiation resulted in increase in TBA number, peroxide value, total monocarbonyls, bleaching of color, slightly rancid and typical candle-like off-flavors. Free fatty acids were also produced upon irradiation. The changes were more drastic in air along with production of a slight oxidized flavor. The monocarbonyls identified by column and paper chromatographic methods in irradiated milk fat include: C₁ through C₁₂, C₁₄, and C₁₆ n-alkanals; C₃ through C₉, C₁₁, C₁₃ and C₁₅ alk- 2 -ones with only traces of C₆ and C₈ alk- 2 - ones; and C₅, C₆, C₉, and C₁₂ alk- 2 -enals. Irradiation of milk fat that had been dried over calcium hydride also caused free fatty acid production, especially short chain fatty acids. <b>Methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> treated with calcium hydride and irradiated at 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, and 6. 0 Mrad yielded small quantities of free octanoic acid, confirming that irradiation caused fission of the ester linkage even when traces of water were removed. The quantities of octanoic acid formed increased with increasing dose of irradiation. For identification of volatile components, the milk fat was irradiated in 307 x 409 'C' enameled cans under vacuum. The headspace analysis showed some air still left in the cans. Irradiation resulted in consumption of oxygen and production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane as identified in the headspace gases. The volatiles were isolated from the irradiated and control milk fats by low temperature, vacuum steam distillation at 40 °C and 1 - 2 mm Hg. The volatile components were then extracted from the aqueous distillate with ethyl ether. The ethyl ether extract exhibited the typical candle-like defect. The ethyl ether concentrate was analyzed by combination of GLC and fast-scan mass spectrometric techniques. Identification of various components was achieved on the basis of mass spectral data and coincidence of gas chromatographic retention times. In the case of the components for which only GLC t[subscript r]/t[subscript r] evidence was available or the mass spectra obtained were not satisfactory, the identity assigned was only tentative. The volatile compounds that were positively identified to be present in irradiated milk fat are given below: n-Alkanes C₅ through C₁₇ 1 -Alkenes C₅, C₇ through C₁₇ Fatty acids C₄, C₆, C₈ and C₁₀ n-Alkanals C₅ through C₁₁ Others γ-decalactone, δ-decalactone, 2 -heptanone, benzene, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and dichlorobenzene. The tentative identification was obtained for the following compounds: γ-lactones C₆ and C₈ δ-lactones C₆, C₈, C₁₁, and C₁₂ 1, ?-alkadienes C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, C₁₆ and C₁₇ iso-alkanes C₁₀, C₁₁, C₁₂, and C₁₃ Others methyl hexanoate, 2 -hexanone, 4 -heptanone and n-dodecanal.

Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate.

Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide.

Cette méthodologie a été appliquée à un eau naturelle artificiellement polluée par 15 composés hydrophiles non ionisables. Les rendements de récupération sont compris entre 42 % et 83 % (rendement moyen de 63 %). Non-ionic hydrophilic compounds are very {{often used as}} solvents in industrial activities or for domestic use. These products are generally alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and esters. Although they are not very dangerous for the environment at low concentrations, for hazardous pollution conditions {{there is a need}} to be able to identify and quantify such compounds. Chlorination of humic substances during drinking water treatment can also generate chlorinated by-products (chlorinated ketones). Because of their solubility in water, it is necessary to concentrate and extract these compounds before gas chromatography analysis. In this study, we describe a method where liquid/gas (steam distillation) and liquid/solid (XAD- 4 resin) extractions were combined. The aim of this work was to define analytical conditions to obtain the best efficiency for the overall method. In the first phase, we developed the liquid/solid extraction on XAD- 4 resin by studying capacity factors, elution volumes and percolated water volumes. The sorption of nine non- ionic hydrophilic compounds (ethanol, butanol- 1, pentanol- 1, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, methylisobutylketone, cyclohexanone, diisobutylketone, butanal) from water onto microparticulate XAD- 4 resin, and their subsequent recovery into water-methanol mixtures, was used to estimate the capacity factor (k'water) for each analyte. According to the capacity factor values, we could define three classes of compounds: 1. highly hydrophilic compounds such as ethanol, which were not very well retained by the resin (k'water= 11); 2. moderately hydrophilic compounds such as ethyl acetate, butanol- 1, butanal, pentanol- 1 for which capacity factors were less than 100; 3. weakly hydrophilic compounds that were well retained by the resin, such as diisobutylketone with a capacity factor equal to 1770. Subsequently, mobilization/recovery by frontal elution into each of four different solvents (dichloromethane, acetone, acetonitrile, methanol) was studied in order to define for each of the analytes an optimal recovery procedure. Recoveries were dependent on the volume of the water sample passing through the column (100 mL, 200 mL, 400 mL) and on volume of solvent used for the elution. The best recoveries were observed when 200 mL of water were passed through the column and when the elution was performed by 14 mL of acetone. Mean recovery was 80 %. Methylisobutylketone, pentanol- 1 and ethyl acetate were extracted with yields higher than 80 %, whereas butanal and 2, 2 -dichloroethanol showed a poor recovery of around 60 %. In the second phase of the study, steam distillation was also assessed as a technique for the concentration of analytes (200 mL condensate from 4 litres aqueous sample). Mean recovery was 77 %. Higher recoveries were observed for ethyl acetate, butanol- 1, pentanol- 1 and 1, 1 - dichloroacetone. Dichloroethanol was not extracted with a suitable recovery (yield around 33 %). The two extraction methods were combined to increase the extraction specificity for non- ionic hydrophilic compounds. In a preliminary concentration step, the analytes were recovered by steam distillation from 4 litre water samples. Analytes were sorbed from the condensate onto a 7 cm x 1. 5 cm column of XAD- 4 resin, then eluted with 14 mL acetone. The column eluate was concentrated to 4 mL, at room temperature in a gentle stream of nitrogen, and analyzed by gas chromatography. The extraction procedure was applied to 18 compounds (butanol- 1, pentanol- 1, hexanol- 1, octanol- 1, decanol, 2, 2 -dichloroethanol, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, methyl hexanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> methylisobutylketone, diisobutylketone, 1, 1 -dichloroacetone, octanone- 2, butanal, hexanal, octanal, benzaldehyde) in spiked ultrapure water and also to 15 compounds (same compounds except for benzaldehyde and 2, 2 -dichloroethanol) in spiked natural water. Mean recovery percentages for the analytes in ultrapure water and in natural water were respectively around 60 % and 63 %. These results demonstrate that the ionic composition of the water medium did not interfere with the efficiency of the complete method. In the case of spiked natural water, recovery yields ranged between 42 % (butanol- 1) and 83 % (octanol- 1). Keywords...|$|E
