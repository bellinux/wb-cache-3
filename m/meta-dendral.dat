5000|$|<b>Meta-Dendral</b> is {{a machine}} {{learning}} system that receives {{the set of}} possible chemical structures and corresponding mass spectra as input, and proposes {{a set of rules}} of mass spectrometry that correlate structural features with processes that produce the mass spectrum. These rules would be fed back to Heuristic Dendral (in the planning and testing programs described below) to test their applicability. [...] Thus, [...] "Heuristic Dendral is a performance system and <b>Meta-Dendral</b> is a learning system". [...] The program is based on two important features: the plan-generate-test paradigm and knowledge engineering.|$|E
5000|$|The {{software}} program Dendral {{is considered the}} first expert system because it automated the decision-making process and problem-solving behavior of organic chemists. [...] The project consisted of research on two main programs Heuristic Dendral and <b>Meta-Dendral,</b> and several sub-programs. It was written in Lisp (programming language), which was considered the language of AI because of its flexibility.|$|E
5000|$|The Dendral team {{recruited}} Bruce Buchanan {{to extend}} the Lisp program initially written by Georgia Sutherland. [...] Buchanan had similar ideas to Feigenbaum and Lederberg, but his special interests were scientific discovery and hypothesis formation. [...] As Joseph November said in Digitizing Life: The Introduction of Computers to Biology and Medicine, [...] "(Buchanan) wanted the system (Dendral) to make discoveries on its own, not just help humans make them". Buchanan, Lederberg and Feigenbaum designed [...] "Meta-Dendral", which was a [...] "hypothesis maker". [...] Heuristic Dendral [...] "would serve as a template for similar knowledge-based systems in other areas" [...] rather than just concentrating {{in the field of}} organic chemistry. <b>Meta-Dendral</b> was a model for knowledge-rich learning systems that was later codified in Tom Mitchell's influential Version Space Model of learning.|$|E
50|$|The plan-generate-test {{paradigm}} {{is the basic}} organization of the problem-solving method, and is a common paradigm used by both Heuristic Dendral and <b>Meta-Dendral</b> systems. The generator (later named CONGEN) generates potential solutions for a particular problem, which are then expressed as chemical graphs in Dendral. However, this is feasible only {{when the number of}} candidate solutions is minimal. When there are large numbers of possible solutions, Dendral has {{to find a way to}} put constraints that rules out large sets of candidate solutions. This is the primary aim of Dendral planner, which is a “hypothesis-formation” program that employs “task-specific knowledge to find constraints for the generator”. Last but not least, the tester analyzes each proposed candidate solution and discards those that fail to fulfill certain criteria. This mechanism of plan-generate-test {{paradigm is}} what holds Dendral together.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Meta-DENDRAL</b> {{program is}} a vehicle for {{studying}} problems of theory formation in science. The general strategy of <b>Meta-DENDRAL</b> is to reason from data to plausible generalizations and then to organize the generalizations into a unified theory. Three main subprobleras are discussed: (1) explain the experimental data for each individual chemical structure, (2) generalize the results from each structure to all structures, and (3) organize the generalizations into a unified theory. The program is built upon the concepts and programmed routines already available in the Heuristic DENDRAL performance program, but goes beyond the performance program in attempting to formulate the theory which the performance program will use...|$|E
40|$|An {{ability to}} reason at a meta-level is widely {{regarded}} as an important aspect of human creativity which is often missing from creative computer programs. We discuss recent experiments with the HR theory formation program where it formed meta-theories about previously formed theories. We report how HR re-invented aspects of how it forms theories and reflected {{on the nature of the}} theories it produces. Additionally, the meta-theories contains higher level concepts than those produced using HR normally. We discuss how HR’s meta-level abilities were enabled by changing domains, rather than writing new programs, which was the model previously employed in the <b>Meta-DENDRAL</b> and Eurisko programs. These experiments suggest an improved model of theory formation where meta-theories are produced alongside theories, with information from the meta-theory being used to improve the search in the original theory. ...|$|E

' We took this talk as a challenge to equip our HR program,(3; 4) with some meta-level abilities. We approached thi...|$|E
