PMCT does not show the lesions with the same resolution as can be obtained with the naked eye. Lathrop and Nolte (2016) stated that trajectories were more challenging to assess with <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds,</b> with only 44 – 58 % correctly identified due to the difficulty in adequately describing the trajectories, and not advisable to supplant autopsy with PMCT.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Ribboning, one of {{the common}} faults in yarn packages, is mathematically analysed. If yarn is repeatly laid on top of or along the same path as the {{previously}} <b>wound</b> <b>yarn,</b> this duplication of yarn path on the package creates a defect known as ribboning. The number of turns of package (n) per double traverse of yarn guide is calculated in two different way One is calculated the length of a coil on the package and total length of yarn in a double traverse; the other is considered transmission rate between drum and conical yarn package The result of two different approach is similar and the probable diameter of conical yarn package which ribboning is occurred is calculated and used on Schalafhorst-Autocore OE spinning machines...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} a yam package is {{established}} for a ring spinning system. The yarn layer, surface area, and mass of the yam package are formulated {{with respect to the}} diameters of the empty bobbin and full yarn package, yarn count, and yarn winding-on time. Based on the principles of dynamics and aerodynamics, models of the power requirements for overcoming the skin friction drag, increasing the kinetic energy of the yarn package (bobbin and <b>wound</b> <b>yarn),</b> and overcoming the yarn wind-on tension are developed. The skin friction coefficient on the surface of a rotating yam package is obtained from experiment. The power distribution during yam packaging is discussed based on a case study. The results indicate that overcoming the skin friction drag during yarn winding consumes the largest amount of energy. The energy required to overcome the yarn wind-on tension is also significant...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of war wounds {{are caused by}} antipersonnel fragments from munitions such as mortars and bomblets. Modern munitions aim to incapacitate soldiers with <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> from very small fragments of low available kinetic energy. Many of these fragments may be stopped by helmets and body armour and {{this has led to}} a predominance of <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> to limbs in those casualties requiring surgery. The development of an appropriate management strategy for these <b>multiple</b> <b>wounds</b> requires knowledge of the contamination and extent of soft tissue injury; conservative management may be appropriate. The extent of skin and muscle damage associated with a small fragment wound, the way in which these wounds may progress without intervention and their colonisation by bacteria has been determined in an experimental animal model. Results from 12 animals are presented. There was a very small (approximately 1 mm) margin of nonviable skin around the entrance wound. The amount of devitalised muscle in the wound tract was a few hundred milligrams. Some muscles peripheral to the wound track also showed signs of damage 1 h after wounding, but this improved over 24 h; the proportion of fragmented muscle fibres in the tissue around the track decreased as time went on. There was no clinical sign or bacteriological evidence of the track becoming infected up to 24 h after wounding. This preliminary work suggests that, in the absence of infection, the amount of muscle damage caused by small fragment wounds begins to resolve in the first 24 h after injury, even without surgical intervention...|$|R

40|$|High energy {{consumption}} remains a key {{challenge for the}} widely used ring spinning system. Tackling this challenge requires {{a full understanding of}} the various factors that contribute to yarn tension and {{energy consumption}} during ring spinning. In this paper, we report our recent experimental and theoretical research on air drag, yarn tension and energy consumption in ring spinning. A specially constructed rig was used to simulate the ring spinning process; and yarn tension at the guide-eye was measured for different yarns under different conditions. The effect of yarn hairiness on the air drag acting on a rotating yarn package and on a ballooning yarn was examined. Models of the power requirements for overcoming the air drag, increasing the kinetic energy of the yarn package (bobbin and <b>wound</b> <b>yarn)</b> and overcoming the yarn wind-on tension were developed. The ratio of energy-consumption to yarn-production over a full yarn package was discussed. A program to simulate yarn winding in ring spinning was implemented, which can generate the balloon shape and predict yarn tension under a given spinning condition. The simulation results were verified with experimental results obtained from spinning cotton and wool yarns. <br /...|$|R
