To solve these problems, in this study, a superhydrophobic ceramic (SC) <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> was fabricated by chemically modification using 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctylethoxysilane (FAS) solution. The <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> fabrication costs for both SC membrane and PP (polypropylene) membrane contactors per unit mass absorbed CO 2 were roughly the same.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{progress made}} during Phase I and Phase II of the project: "Pre-Combustion Carbon Capture by a Nanoporous, Superhydrophobic <b>Membrane</b> <b>Contactor</b> Process," under contract DE-FE- 0000646. The {{objective of this}} project {{is to develop a}} practical and cost effective technology for CO{sub 2 } separation and capture for pre-combustion coal-based gasification plants using a membrane contactor/solvent absorption process. The goals of this technology development project are to separate and capture at least 90 % of the CO{sub 2 } from Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants with less than 10 % increase in the cost of energy services. Unlike conventional gas separation membranes, the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> is a novel gas separation process based on the gas/liquid membrane concept. The <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> is an advanced mass transfer device that operates with liquid {{on one side of the}} membrane and gas on the other. The <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> can operate with pressures that are almost the same on both sides of the membrane, whereas the gas separation membranes use the differential pressure across the membrane as driving force for separation. The driving force for separation for the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> process is the chemical potential difference of CO{sub 2 } in the gas phase and in the absorption liquid. This process is thus easily tailored to suit the needs for pre-combustion separation and capture of CO{sub 2 }. Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and PoroGen Corporation (PGC) have developed a novel hollow fiber membrane technology that is based on chemically and thermally resistant commercial engineered polymer poly(ether ether ketone) or PEEK. The PEEK membrane material used in the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> during this technology development program is a high temperature engineered plastic that is virtually non-destructible under the operating conditions encountered in typical gas absorption applications. It can withstand contact with most of the common treating solvents. GTI and PGC have developed a nanoporous and superhydrophobic PEEK-based hollow fiber <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> tailored for the membrane contactor/solvent absorption application for syngas cleanup. The <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> modules were scaled up to 8 -inch diameter commercial size modules. We have performing extensive laboratory and bench testing using pure gases, simulated water-gas-shifted (WGS) syngas stream, and a slipstream from a gasification derived syngas from GTIÃ¢ÂÂs Flex-Fuel Test Facility (FFTF) gasification plant under commercially relevant conditions. The team have also carried out an engineering and economic analysis of the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> process to evaluate the economics of this technology and its commercial potential. Our test results have shown that 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture can be achieved with several physical solvents such as water and chilled methanol. The rate of CO{sub 2 } removal by the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> is in the range of 1. 5 to 2. 0 kg/m{sup 2 }/hr depending on the operating pressures and temperatures and depending on the solvents used. The final economic analysis has shown that the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> process will cause the cost of electricity to increase by 21 % from the base plant without CO{sub 2 } capture. The goal of 10 % increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from base DOE Case 1 (base plant without capture) is not achieved by using the <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor.</b> However, the 21 % increase in LCOE is a substantial improvement as compared with the 31. 6 % increase in LCOE as in DOE Case 2 (state of art capture technology using 2 -stages of Selexol{TM}) ...|$|E

The reactor employed a <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor</b> and a membrane separator in a concentric arrangement to affect a uniform ozone distribution along the reactor length, while allowing the simultaneous membrane separation and production of clean water.

The novel membrane reactor consistently outperformed both membrane processes. Forty-seven percent higher TOC degradation was observed compared to ozone reaction using a capillary <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor.</b> This enhancement is due to the increase in the organic pollutant concentration in the reaction zone as a result of water withdrawal by membrane pervaporation. As in the case of membrane pervaporation, clean water was produced at the permeate outlet of the novel membrane reactor.

40|$|Microporous {{hollow fiber}} gas-liquid {{membrane}} contactors have a fixed and well-defined gas-liquid interfacial area. The liquid {{flow through the}} hollow fiber is laminar, thus the liquid side hydrodynamics are well known. This allows the accurate calculation of the fiber side physical mass transfer coefficient from first principles. Moreover, {{in the case of}} gas-liquid <b>membrane</b> <b>contactor,</b> the gas-liquid exposure time can be varied easily and independently without disturbing the gas-liquid interfacial area.

In order to protect the boiler from these contaminates, they should be controlled or removed.

A commercially available polypropylene hollow fibre contactor (Liqui-Cel (R) 2. 5 x 8 with X 30 fibres) was used in this study. Stabilizing the interface between the hydro-alcoholic solvent and lemon essential oil in membrane pores proved difficult (breakthrough pressure below 0. 2 bar), even with solvents containing only 20 % v/v ethanol. This problem was probably due to defects in the membrane material such as the presence of large pores (up to 4 mu m in diameter). Nonetheless, the hydro-alcoholic extract remained emulsion free throughout extraction, considered to be an improvement since it eliminated the time-consuming decantation step (process intensification). High mass transfer coefficients up to 1. 08 x 10 (- 6) m/s were obtained for the tracer of oxygenated terpenes and a solvent with 66 % v/v ethanol.

40|$|Microporous {{polyvinylidene}} fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes were fabricated via a wet-spinning process. The prepared fibers were characterized {{in terms of}} contact angle, gas permeability, wetting pressure and morphology. CO 2 stripping from preloaded aqueous diethanolamine solution was conducted through the gas–liquid <b>membrane</b> <b>contactors.</b> The effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) concentration on the membrane properties and CO 2 stripping performance were investigated. The addition of different LiCl concentration resulted in a less finger-like structure, with highly effective surface porosity and high wetting pressure. Conversely, N 2 permeability, contact angle value and membrane pore size were reduced as the concentration of the additives were increased. For stripping flux performance, membrane with 5 wt% LiCl demonstrated the highest flux of 1. 61 × 10 − 2 mol/m 2 s at 110 ml/min of the liquid flow rate. It {{was found that the}} membrane with less finger-like structure and higher effective surface porosity exhibited higher stripping efficiency. These results suggest that developed membrane structure can be an alternative for the CO 2 stripping through gas–liquid <b>membrane</b> <b>contactors...</b>|$|R
40|$|A review with 18 refs. The {{principle}} of osmotic trans-membrane evapn. is exposed and {{compared to other}} <b>membrane</b> <b>contactors.</b> The origin and the current description of the vapor flux are critically reviewed {{as well as the}} importance of the boundary layers near the membranes. Furthermore, a compilation of results obtained on the lab. and on the industrial scale is given and the disagreements between the conclusions of different research groups are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{cationic}} steroidal receptors 9 and 11 {{have been}} synthesized from cholic acid 3. Receptor 9 extracts N-acetyl-α-amino acids from aqueous media into chloroform with enantioselectivities (L:D) of 7 - 10 : 1. The lipophilic variant 11 has been employed for the enantioselective transport of N-acetylphenylalanine, a) through dichloromethane (DCM) and dichloroethane (DCE) bulk liquid membranes (U-tube apparatus), and b) through 2. 5 % (v/v) octanol/hexane via hollow fibre <b>membrane</b> <b>contactors.</b> Significant enantioselectivities and multiple turnovers were observed for {{both types of}} apparatus. ...|$|R
