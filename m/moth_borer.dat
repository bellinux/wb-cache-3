It is thought that this parasite {{may be the most important}} agent of predispersal seed loss in the plant. The mature follicles dry and split open, releasing the seeds into the nearby environment. The seeds will remain in the soil until there is sufficient disturbance (such as a wildfire) to stimulate their germination, or until they are no longer viable. Studies of alpine and subalpine heath indicate a minimum average fire-free period greater than 250 years, and it is unlikely that many seeds will persist this long. It appears that plants of O. revolutus maintain themselves predominantly through vegetative propagation during the long disturbance free periods, and the great majority of young plants are the result of underground stems. It is therefore possible that the high levels of parasitism witnessed in the seed pods of O. revolutus represent a negligible impact on recruitment. Indeed, O. revolutus is one of the few species in the community able to resprout after fire, a character absent even in O. acicularis ...|$|E
40|$|The use of adapted {{varieties}} of sugarcane and the soil management after its harvest in mechanized systems {{may affect the}} incidence of pests and the productivity of the sugarcane plantation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of plant residues of 18 sugarcane varieties submitted to different harvest management systems on the agricultural productivity and incidence of <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> and root froghopper. The treatments were: straw without triturating and cultivation (PST/SC); straw without triturating/with disk harrow cultivation (PST/CC); triturated straw/with disk harrow cultivation (PT/CC). The yield of stalk in the sugarcane is favored by the management, with cultivation, of the straw of the green plant, mechanically harvested, without alteration {{in the incidence of}} <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> and root froghopper. The variety SP 87 - 365 of sugarcane is a viable and rentable option in any system of management green sugarcane, with adaptation to the mechanical harvest and the edaphoclimatic conditions of the region of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo State, Brazil. The incidence of <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> and root froghopper can sufficiently be reduced with the adoption of the varieties SP 88 - 817 and SP 76 - 112 of sugarcane in any system of straw management of the green sugarcane mechanically harveste, and is minimized by the mechanical harvest of the green sugarcane followed by straw triturating and the use of disk harrow in the inter-row...|$|E

40|$|THE INDONESIAN SUGARCANE {{industry}} in Java {{is affected by}} a number of moth borers that very substantially reduce the productivity of commercial crops and sugarcane streak mosaic virus has recently been identified in the Indonesian sugarcane industry. The Australian sugarcane industry is currently free of major <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> species, though on a world stage moth borers are extremely destructive and difficult to control. During the last four years, BSES scientists have been collaborating with Indonesian experts to research Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies to provide more effective <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> control. The research has principally focussed on specific parasitoids (mainly Trichogramma species) and mass-release strategies for control of species of Scirpophaga and Chilo. Recent work has enabled more effective treatments to be identified. Other research has investigated sugarcane streak mosaic and canegrub management. A vector for sugarcane streak mosaic virus (brown aphid) has been identified and other forms of transmission investigated. The paper outlines a broad range of activities encompassed in this work and complements a paper focusing on extension outcomes in the Indonesian industry. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Sugarcane moth borers are {{a diverse}} group of species {{occurring}} in several genera, and are mainly polyphagous pests of gramineous crops including corn, sugarcane, rice and sorghum. They cause economic loss in sugarcane and other crops through damage to stem by larval boring. The pink stem borer Sesamia spp. is the most destroying pest of sugarcane in South-west of Iran where it has been managed largely through the planting of resistant cultivars, cropping practices and biological control. Telenomus busseolae Gahan is the most important egg parasitoid of sugarcane stem borers in Iran and this biological control agent can periodically reduce the damage of moth borers in sugarcane cultivars. In this study, we investigated the natural parasitism of this tiny wasp in five commercial cultivars; CP 57 - 614, CP 48 - 103, CP 69 - 1062, IRC 99 - 01 and SP 70 - 1143. Samplings for eggs were carried out in both plant cane and ratoon with four replicates. In each replication, 20 stalks were cut and leaf sheaths were examined for <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> eggs whether they are healthy or parasitised. All eggs were placed separately in glass-tubes for 2 weeks until adult emergence. The results showed that the highest percentage of parasitism was associated with CP 48 - 103 variety. As a result, T. busseolae has a significant effect on <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> eggs and can be considered as a key component of borer control in the sugarcane fields. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The leopard <b>moth</b> <b>borer,</b> Zeuzera pyrina L. (Lepidoptera: Cossidae), is a cossid moth whose larvae bore into twigs, {{branches}} and trunks of various woody species, weakening and sometimes killing trees or shrubs. This is a pest with increasing importance in Iran {{in the last}} few years. Experiments were established using factors of pheromone type (pheromones of Z. pyrina, Synanthedon tipuliformis and female adult moths), height of traps (1. 5 - 2, 3 and > 6 m) and peak times for attraction of male moths. This test was done as complete randomized blocks with three replications in Iran. Results showed that levels of attraction on male moths were related to the sex pheromones of Z. pyrina, Z. pyrina female adult moths and S. tipuliformis, in descending order. Results also showed that the highest number of moths was captured from a height of more than 6 m and that there were two peak times of attraction of Z. pyrina in Iran...|$|E
40|$|Biological control {{using the}} {{parasitoid}} Cotesia flavipes (Cam.) {{is one of}} the main components in the integrated management of the sugarcane <b>moth</b> <b>borer</b> Diatraea spp. Besides this parasitoid, the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorok. are used to control sugarcane pests, and they can be found naturally parasitizing caterpillars. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of M. anisopliae and B. bassiana on different developmental stages of the C. flavipes parasitoid on Diatraea flavipennella (Box). The experiments were carried at laboratory with isolates PL 43 of M. anisopliae and ESALQ 447 of B. bassiana were applied to the parasitoid at the immature and adult phases. No negative effects were observed on the larval development of C. flavipes, and it could complete its development on caterpillars of D. flavipennella treated with fungi. The fungi did not cause pupal mortality. However, B. bassiana caused high mortality in the adult parasitoid (76 %). The fungi had negative effects on parasitoids when applied during certain developmental stages of C. flavipes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Exotic {{species are}} a great concern because of the {{possibility}} of negative effects once they become established. The exotic cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum has a reputation for being detrimental to Opuntia populations throughout Florida and the southeastern United States. Multiple projects are currently underway to attempt to contain and eradicate this species before it can migrate to the Opuntia-rich desert southwest and the agricultural Opuntia fields in the Mexican highlands. These projects have been undertaken without previous studies to determine what negative effects, if any, the moth is having on the common native Opuntia species. This is understandable; since it was earlier suggested that C. cactorum was doing great harm to rare and endangered species in the Florida Keys (Stiling et al. 2004). This study looks at the effects of the native <b>moth</b> <b>borer,</b> Melitara prodenialis and the exotic invader, Cactoblastis cactorum on two common Opuntia spp. within central Flo rida. Throughout the duration of this study, the coastal plants were subjected to damage solely by C. cactorum and the inland plants by M. prodenialis. The amount of moth damage was compared between three inland and three coastal sites, as well as between plants subjected to prescribed fire and those that were not within these sites. Plant mortality was determined for both the sites and burn treatments. The number of eggsticks was also compared between inland and coastal sites and burned and unburned treatments. The results of this study show that although there is a significant difference in plant mortality between inland and coastal sites (higher mortality was shown at inland locations), there is no difference in moth damage at these sites. This suggests that the exotic moth is doing similar or less damage to the cactus than is the native moth. The number of eggsticks was also greater at coastal sites. This indicates that although the exotic moth is more prolific than the native, it is still unable to cause higher cactus mortality rates. None of the data was significant between burned and unburned treatments, indicating that prescribed fire does not have any effect, negative or positive on the Opuntia...|$|E
30|$|A {{survey of}} the insect fauna of {{sugarcane}} fields in Upper Egypt referred to 13 insect genera as sugarcane feeders (Ezzat and Atries 1967). These are Aiolopsis and Locusta (Acrididae), Labia (Dermaptera), Phyllodromia (Blattidae), Geotomus (Cydnidae), Empoasca and Exitianus (Jassidae), Tropidocephala (Delphacidae), Chilo (Grambidae), Pelopidus (Hesperiidae), Leucania (Noctuidae), Dorylus (Formicidae), and Pentondon (Scaraebidae). The authors mentioned that although the apparent serious damage to sugarcane in Egypt is mainly due to the lepidopterous sugarcane and corn borer Chilo agamemnon Bles., all other pests in the aforementioned genera had different degrees of importance. However, the fauna included {{a considerable number of}} useful insects providing the bright aspect of the picture. The most reliable species in this beneficial group are concentrated in the orders Hemiptera, Neuroptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera. From Hemiptera, the anthocorid Orius sp.? niger is known as predator on insect eggs, mites, small insects, and aphids. Two reduviids, Oncocephalus notatus Klug and Pirates sterpitans rufipennis Lucas, were also reported as bloodsuckers of other insects. In Neuroptera, Chrysopa vulgaris (=Chrysoperla carnea) Steph. and Cueta variegata Klug were recorded. The former species is also known as predaceous on the sugarcane mealybug, Saccharicoccus sacchari Ckll., and other pests. Among Diptera, two syrphids were recorded, Syritta spinigera Loew and Syrphus corollae F., which are known to be predaceous upon aphids and nymphs of other homopterous insects. Also, the sarcophagid Sarcophaga rapax Walk. was recorded; it plays a role in controlling the sugarcane <b>moth</b> <b>borer,</b> Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius. Among the Hymenoptera, members of family Ichneumonidae include Diplazon laetorius Fabr. and Barylypa humeralis Branus (L.P.); the first is known as a parasitoid of syrphids and the second of Lepidoptera. A single parasitic species was reported for either Encyrtidae or Trichogrmmatidae, i.e., Homalitylioidae and T. evanescens, respectively. Since the 1980 s, great efforts have been carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture to utilize this parasitoid T. evanescens against C. agamemnon in sugarcane fields by mass rearing and inundative releases of the parasitoid through 14 mass-rearing units, covering all the sugarcane areas (300, 000 feddans[*]=[*] 120, 000  ha) (El-Samea and Saadia 2002). Through the implementation of this program, the infestation with C. agamemnon in sugarcane fields was reduced successfully from 17 to >[*] 3 % in almost all the sugarcane fields. In the above authors’ list, other hymenopterous species of known beneficial role are present, i.e., Myzine arabica Guer. (Scoliidae) that works as ectoparasitoid on larvae of Scarabidae; Chrysis sp. (Chrysididae) parasitizes certain caterpillars; Eumenes maxillosa F. (Eumenidae), Ammophila tyedi Guill., Liris praetermissa Rich, Phillanthus triangulum abdelkader Luc., and Sceliphron sprifex L. (Sphecidae) feeders on collected young lepidopterous larvae; and Paracyphononyx ruficrus Klug and Pompilus sp. (Pompilidae) known as predators of spiders. Among the Coleoptera, the coccinelids Chilomenes vicina Muls, C. undecimpunctata, and Scymnus syriacus (Goeze) are well known as predators in sugarcane fields {{in different parts of the}} world. The authors mentioned that the first coccinellid attacks different young insects; the second mainly attacks the mealybugs S. sacchari and Symicoccus bonsis, while the third feeds on coleopterous pests. The two staphylinids, Paederus alfierii Koch and Philonthus longicornis, were also reported; the first is a well-known predator of insect eggs and young larvae or nymphs or insect pest, and the latter most probably feeds on insect stages inhabiting the soil, e.g., pupae of Chilo. Five carabids, Calosoma levantinus leavistriatus Schatz., Broscus punctatus Dej., Calosoma rugosum chlorostictum Klug., Microlestes sp., and Tachys lucasi Duv., were included in the list. Their activity is restricted in feeding on various stages of insects inhabiting soil.|$|E
