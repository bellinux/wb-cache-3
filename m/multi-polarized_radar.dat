Earthen levees built on the natural levees parallel to the river channel are designed to protect large areas of populated and cultivated land in the Unites States from flooding. One of the signs of potential impending levee failure is the appearance of slump slides. On-site inspection of levees is expensive and time-consuming; therefore, a need to develop efficient techniques based on remote sensing technologies is mandatory to prevent failures under flood loading. Analysis of <b>multi-polarized</b> <b>radar</b> data is one of the viable tools for detecting the problem areas on the levees. In this study, we develop methods to detect anomalies on the levee, such as slump slides and give levee managers new tools to prioritize their tasks. This paper presents results of applying the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) ’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) quad-polarized L-band data to detect slump slides on earthen levees. The study area encompasses a portion of levees of the lower Mississippi River in the United States. In this paper, we investigate the performance of polarimetric and texture features for efficient levee classification. Texture features derived from the gray level co-occurrence (GLCM) matrix and discrete wavelet transform were computed and analyzed for efficient levee classification. The pixel-based polarimetric decomposition features, such as entropy, anisotropy, and scattering angle were also computed and applied to the support vector machine classifier to characterize the radar imagery and compared the results with texture-based classification. Our experimental results showed that inclusion of textural features derived from the SAR data using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features and GLCM features provided higher overall classification accuracies compared to the pixel-based polarimetric features...|$|E
40|$|Field {{measurements}} were combined with {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) images {{to evaluate the use}} of C-band <b>multi-polarized</b> <b>radar</b> remote sensing for estimating plant parameters (plant height, fresh biomass, dry biomass and vegetation water content) of wetland vegetation, and mapping the dynamics of water bodies, wetlands (natural wetlands and rice paddies) and flooding extents in the Poyang Lake region. The capacity of L-band SAR in land cover mapping was also investigated by integrating with optical imagery. Hydrological patterns in Poyang Lake are the dominant factor controlling the spatial and temporal variations of wetland species in Poyang Lake. Water levels in this region are primarily governed by five rivers (Ganjiang river, Xiushui river, Raohe river, Fuhe river, and Xinjiang river). Its northern region is also influenced by the backflow from Yangtze River. The above-ground total biomass increased steadily from March following the hydrological cycle. Wetland species colonizing at different altitudes were gradually flooded from late spring to summer. Carex spp. died during flooding periods and started another growth cycle in autumn after flooding receded. Canopy volume dominates the radar backscattering mechanism in Carex spp. wetlands during their growth period, but the temporal variation of radar backscatter from these wetlands is mainly influenced by flooding. Tall wetland species (Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Phragmites communis Trin., and others) still emerged above water surfaces during flooding peaks and started to senesce in autumn. Surface backscattering mechanism is dominant during the early growing stage and the senescent period of tall vegetation. Plant canopy variation controlled the temporal dynamics of radar backscatters from Phragmites communis Min. Radar backscattering mechanisms from Miscanthus sacchariflorus wetlands were more complicated during the flooding periods. The variations of ground water depth and plant structure of Miscanthus sacchariflorus during its growth period result in over 10 dB spatial and temporal variation in ASAR backscatter in HH- and HV-polarization. Temporal profiles of C-band multi-polarized backscatter coefficients for individual land cover types over the period of December 2004 to November 2005 were studied and described {{in the context of the}} ecology and seasonal dynamics of biophysical parameters of individual land cover types. A knowledge-based hierarchical land cover mapping method was developed to quantify the dynamics of paddy rice, natural wetlands and floods using the time series of HH- and HV-backscatters. The specific phenological and ecological characteristics of wetlands including paddy rice are the most important data in mapping their spatial and temporal patterns. The classification accuracy is over 90 % for water bodies, rice paddies and Carex spp. wetlands, but it is not high for tall wetlands (68 %). A decision tree approach was adopted to evaluate the capacity of L-band SAR in land cover mapping by combining with optical imagery. Classification errors were mainly induced by the mixed spectrum between and covers, and lack of independent training data and validation data also caused uncertainty in the results. The relationship of canopy height with ASAR backscattering coefficient is the most significant among the influencing factors (plant height, fresh biomass, dry biomass, vegetation water content) on radar backscattering mechanism (R 2 = 0. 9 for HH-polarization and R 2 = 0. 59 for HV-polarization) from Phragmites cummunis Trin. HH- and HV-backscatters are more sensitive to the variation of dry biomass (R 2 = 0. 76 for HH and R 2 = 0. 56 for HV) than to that of fresh biomass (R 2 = 0. 07 for HV and R 2 = 0. 42 for HH). Plant water content plays a negative role and attenuates the backscattering signals in both polarizations. For Phragmites communis Trin. with tall stalks (over 2 m) and long, blade-like leaves, HH-polarization is more sensitive to vegetation parameters than HV-polarization for C-band SAR signals. Similar to Phragmites communis Trin., ASAR backscattering coefficient in both polarizations is more sensitive to plant height and dry biomass of non-flooded Miscanthus sacchariflorus, and their regression coefficients (R 2) are over 0. 5 for HH-polarization and over 0. 4 for HV-polarization. Plant water content has no evident effect on the variation of ASAR backscatter. HV-polarization is more sensitive to the variation of above-water canopy parameters than HH-polarization for flooded Miscanthus saccharifiorus. HH- and HV-polarized radar backscatters from Carex spp. wetlands increased significantly with the variation of plant height, fresh biomass and dry biomass, but they reach saturated when vegetation grows up to 30 cm. Compared with those tall grass with stalks and long blade-like leaves, the correlation of fresh biomass with HV-polarization is more pronounced (R 2 = 0. 78) than that with HH-polarization (R 2 = 0. 41) for Carex spp. Vegetation structure play a more important role in radar backscattering mechanism than plant water content for these three wetland species.

40|$|Antarctica is {{surrounded}} by ice shelves and glaciers of different sizes. Satellite imagery shows different feature patterns (e. g. crevasses, rifts) at their surfaces, which control the shape {{and the size of}} icebergs that calve from their seaward edges. An edge detection method was used to map and classify the surface features, considering their orientation relative to the calving front. Calved icebergs can automatically be detected and then tracked on their way through the ocean using single and <b>multi-polarized</b> Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar</b> (SAR) images. Temporal gaps between subsequent SAR imagery can be closed by applying a simple wind-driven iceberg drift model. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The latest {{results are}} {{presented}} from an ongoing study {{of the use of}} <b>multi-polarized</b> Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar</b> as an aid in screening earthen levees for weak points. Both L-band airborne and X-band spaceborne radars are studied, using the NASA UAVSAR and the German TerraSAR-X platforms. Feature detection and classification algorithms tested for this application include both radiometric and textural methods. Radiometric features include both the simple backscatter magnitudes of the HH, VV, and HV channels as well as decompositions such as Entropy, Anisotropy, and Alpha angle. Textural methods include grey-level co-occurrence matrix and wavelet features. Classifiers tested include Maximum Likelihood and Artificial Neural Networks. The study area includes 240 km of levees along the lower Mississippi River. Results to date are encouraging but still very preliminary and in need of further validation and testing.

40|$|The {{significant}} {{growth of}} urban areas, which was observable {{in the last}} decades, is expected to continue. By the year 2050 almost {{three out of four}} people live in cities. Most parts of this development will take place in developing countries. This favors the increase of numbers of mega cities, huge urban agglomerations of more than 10 million inhabitants. Since this is an unsolvable challenge for the administrative institutions informal settlements – commonly called slums – will develop rapidly. Often it is impossible to map these settlements accurately. Remote sensing can support mapping techniques with information about the physical appearance of urban areas. Therefore the knowledge based classification of satellite images can provide thematic maps with data deduced from diverse features. In this study second order texture features of <b>multi-polarized</b> synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> (SAR) data are used for urban land cover classification. To enhance the feature spaces of the SAR data Kennaugh-elements are utilized. The classification is accomplished with a linear discriminant analysis, which also allows to test the influence of the individual features on the classification result. The results provide an overview of the classification accuracy with different combinations of Kennaugh-elements. The most valuable classification reaches an overall Kappa of 0. 76 and a quality of 69. 95...|$|R
