No significant difference in removal of virus content was observed when the Pilot Filter was loaded from two different basins with horizontal travel distances of approximately 50 and 100 feet. For identification of virus types, a rapid and economical plastic panel micro culture technique showed an excellent correlation to the standard tube culture method in virus neutralization studies.

HIV- 1 Gag binds raft-rich regions of the plasma membrane, and cholesterol depletion impairs HIV- 1 particle production. In this study, we sought to define the block imposed by cholesterol depletion. We observed that membrane binding and higher-order multimerization of Gag were markedly reduced upon cholesterol depletion. Fusing to Gag a highly efficient, heterologous membrane-binding sequence reversed the defects in Gag–membrane binding and multimerization caused by cholesterol depletion, indicating that the impact of reducing the membrane cholesterol content on Gag–membrane binding and multimerization can be circumvented by increasing the affinity of Gag for <b>membrane.</b> <b>Virus</b> release efficiency of this Gag derivative was minimally affected by cholesterol depletion.

40|$|The budding of enveloped viruses from {{cellular}} membranes {{is believed to}} be dependent on the specific interaction between transmembrane spike proteins and cytoplasmic core components of the virus. We found that the cytoplasmic domain of the E 2 transmembrane spike glycoprotein of Semliki Forest virus contains two essential determinants which are absolutely needed for budding. The first constitutes a single tyrosine residue {{in the context of a}} direct pentapeptide repeat. The tyrosine could only partially be substituted for other residues with aromatic or bulky hydrophobic side chains, although these immediately reverted to the original genotype. The second determinant involves palmitylated cysteine residues flanking the tyrosine repeat motif. The function of these is probably to anchor the tail against the inner surface of the membrane so that the tyrosine-containing motif is properly presented to the nucleocapsid.

Little is known about how the target antigens have to be presented on the cell membrane to allow specific target cell lysis and whether the different effector mechanisms have similar structural requirements for cytolysis. We have studied these questions in a model system in which purified viral spike proteins were used as target cell antigens. We were particularly interested in finding out whether it is sufficient that viral antigens are bound to cells or whether integration of the viral antigens into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for cytolysis.

40|$|Viral {{replication}} occurs within cells, with release (and onward infection) primarily {{achieved through}} two alternative mechanisms: lysis, in which virions {{emerge as the}} infected cell dies and bursts open; or budding, in which virions emerge gradually from a still living cell by appropriating {{a small part of}} the cell <b>membrane.</b> <b>Virus</b> budding is a poorly understood process that challenges current models of vesicle formation. Here, a plausible mechanism for arenavirus budding is presented, building on recent evidence that viral proteins embed in the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane. Experimental results confirm that viral protein is associated with increased membrane curvature, whereas a mathematical model is used to show that localized increases in curvature alone are sufficient to generate viral buds. The magnitude of the protein-induced curvature is calculated from the size of the amphipathic region hypothetically removed from the inner membrane as a result of translation, with a change in membrane stiffness estimated from observed differences in virion deformation as a result of protein depletion. Numerical results are based on experimental data and estimates for three arenaviruses, but the mechanisms described are more broadly applicable.

Virus uptake was 30 - to 40 -fold more efficient when the inoculum {{was placed on the}} apical rather than the basolateral surface of these cells, suggesting a greater abundance of the cellular receptor for HAV on the apical surface. Infection proceeded without cytopathic effect and did not influence transepithelial resistance or the diffusion of inulin across cell monolayers. Nonetheless, there was extensive release of progeny virus, which occurred almost exclusively into apical supernatant fluids (36. 4 % ± 12. 5 % of the total virus yield compared with 0. 23 % ± 0. 13 % release into basolateral fluids). Brefeldin A caused a profound inhibition of HAV replication, but also selectively reduced apical release of virus.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) assembles poorly in murine cells, reflecting inefficient targeting of the Gag structural polyprotein to the plasma <b>membrane.</b> <b>Virus</b> particle production can be restored by replacing the cis-acting Rev response element (RRE) in Gag-Pol mRNAs with multiple {{copies of the}} CTE (4 ×CTE), suggesting a mechanistic link between HIV- 1 RNA trafficking and productive Gag assembly. In this report, we demonstrate that Gag molecules generated from RRE-dependent transcripts are intrinsically defective for assembly in murine 3 T 3 cells. When controlled for the intracellular Gag level, modulations of the Gag matrix (MA) domain that enhance Gag membrane association (e. g., deletion of the MA globular head) substantially improve assembly for Gag derived from RRE- but not 4 ×CTE-dependent transcripts. Gag mutants carrying a leucine zipper replacement of the nucleocapsid (NC) domain remain largely assembly defective when derived from RRE-dependent transcripts, indicating that the defect does not reflect aberrant NC/RNA-driven Gag multimerization. We further demonstrate that single changes in uncharged amino acids implicated in Gag/MA myristoyl switch regulation, most notably replacing the leucine at position 21 with serine, improve assembly for Gag derived from RRE-dependent transcripts.

Here we consider the purification of human influenza virus as a model system for enveloped viruses of about 100 nm in diameter. Methods: Virus produced in roller bottles (250 mL per bottle) and microcarrier cultures (2 - 3 L wv) was clarified by two static filtration steps and inactivated with ß-propiolactone. The use of tangential flow filtration and dialfiltration was investigated in order to concentrate the virus and to reduce the level of contaminating compounds.

The three D-loop mutations caused a reduction in virus growth ranging from 1. 6 to 2 log but did not significantly affect structural protein biosynthesis or transport, dimer stability, virus fusion, or specific infectivity.
