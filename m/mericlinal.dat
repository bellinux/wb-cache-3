50|$|Three phenotypes of {{chimeric}} redwoods {{have been}} noted: sectorial, <b>mericlinal</b> and periclinal. In sectorial mutants, albino cells are present vertically through all cell layers, with genotype boundaries usually {{parallel to the}} stem. <b>Mericlinal</b> trees have mutant cells in only some cell layers and have an unstable phenotype; the albino cells can disappear and reappear in successive years. A periclinal chimera has both mutant and normal cells distributed horizontally across the tip of each bud propagating at equal rates, leading to a very stable phenotype.|$|E
40|$|In Actinidia arguta, the I tunc {{layer is}} formed by four cell {{complexes}} which descend from single initials. These initials are positioned {{in a corner}} of their complex, around the meristem axis. The meristematic activity of the I tunic layer depends on the formative divisions of the initials; the entire I tunic layer above the youngest leaf primordia is formed during the time the initials undergo only 4 - 8 divisions. In light of the development of the twin cell complexes. it is impossible for cells to be displaced from the I tunic layer into the meristem. The supposition is set forth that the impermanent. <b>mericlinal</b> sectors on variegated perinclinal chimeras develop due to periclinal cleavages within the subcomplexes which derive from tissue mother cells. Whereas. the cell initials do not undergo periclinal divisions and are not displaced...|$|E
40|$|The {{jointless}} mutation {{of tomato}} {{results in the}} formation of flower pedicels that lack an abscission zone and inflorescence meristems that revert to vegetative growth. We have analyzed periclinal chimeras and <b>mericlinal</b> sectors of jointless and wild-type tissue to determine how cells in different meristem layers (L 1, L 2, and L 3) and their derivatives interact during these two developmental processes. Cells in the inner meristem layer, L 3, alone determined whether the meristem maintained the inflorescence state or reverted to vegetative growth. Moreover, L 3 derivatives determined whether a functional pedicel abscission zone formed. Limited and disorganized autonomous development of wild-type L 2 -derived cells occurred when they overlay mutant tissue. Adjacent mutant and wild-type L 3 -derived tissues in pedicels developed autonomously, indicating little or no lateral communication. Only the outermost L 3 -derived cells within the pedicel were capable of orchestrating normal pedicel development in overlying tissues, revealing the special status of those cells as coordinators of development for L 1 - and L 2 -derived cells, whereas the innermost L 3 -derived cells developed autonomously but did not influence the development of other cells...|$|E
40|$|Okra (L 2 O) is a semidominant {{mutation}} {{of cotton}} (Gossypium barbadense) that alters leaf shape {{by increasing the}} length of lobes and decreasing lamina expansion. Chimeras containing L 2 O and wild-type tissue were generated using Semigamy (Se), a mutation that blocks syngamy during fertilization and produces haploid maternal/paternal chimeral progeny at low frequency. In sectorial chimeras, changes in leaf morphology coincide with the boundary between mutant and wild-type tissues, suggesting that L 2 O does not regulate a laterally diffusible factor within the leaf. However, in <b>mericlinal</b> or periclinal chimeras, the presence of L 2 O in tissue derived {{from any of the}} three histogenic layers (L 1, L 2, or L 3) of the shoot apical meristem produced leaves with a partial mutant phenotype. The presence of L 2 O in the epidermis (an L 1 derivative), or in the subepidermal mesophyll of the leaf (L 2 derivatives) reduced the growth of the lamina and thus increased the depth of leaf lobes. The presence of L 2 O in the middle mesophyll of the lamina and the vasculature of major lateral veins (L 3 derivatives) had no local effect on the expansion of the lamina, but significantly increased lobe length. These results demonstrate that L 2 O is active in every tissue layer of the leaf...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. A large {{sector of}} the {{forestry}} industry of South Africa comprises Eucalyptus species, covering approximately 49 % of the forestry plantation area. Polyploidy induction has become an attractive tool to increase yield and reduce invasiveness in forestry species. Polyploidy induction in Eucalyptus using colchicine treatments on seed and axillary buds was undertaken to produce tetraploids {{that could be used}} in breeding programmes; specifically to increase yield and decrease species invasiveness through the production of triploids after crossing with diploid parents. Eight seedlots of E. urophylla and seven of E. grandis were treated with four colchicine concentrations (0. 00, 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05 %) at two exposure times (18 h and 24 h), treating two seeds per treatment, repeated eight times. For axillary bud induction, 20 buds of two E. grandis clones and three E. grandis × E. urophylla hybrids and one E. grandis × E. nitens hybrid were treated with four colchicine concentrations (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 %) for three consecutive days. A known tetraploid hybrid E. grandis E. camaldulensis and its corresponding diploid were included as reference material. Seedlings and bud sports were pre-screened by determining stomatal guard cell lengths. Seedlings and bud sports displaying cell lengths significantly (p< 0. 0001) larger than the diploid were selected as putative polyploids. Polyploidy was then confirmed by quantifying the DNA content using flow cytometry. Stomatal frequencies and guard cell chloroplast frequencies were also determined in the induced tetraploid seedlings to evaluate their suitability to discern between ploids. All putative polyploidy seedlings, identified in the pre-screening process, were confirmed, using flow cytometry, as either tetraploids or mixoploids. Of the 17 E. urophylla putative polyploids, from various seedlots, six were tetraploid and 11 mixoploid. In E. grandis one of the five putative polyploids, from various seedlots, was tetraploid and four mixoploid. Pre-screening of bud sports was less accurate; only four of the 12 E. grandis hybrid putative polyploids were mixoploid and only three of the six E. grandis putative polyploids were mixoploid. E. urophylla seedlings were more sensitive to colchicine than E. grandis seedlings displaying a lower survival rate (52 %) than E. grandis (63 %). Extreme treatments that caused the lowest survival rates were also responsible for most of the polyploidy successful inductions; 0. 05 %/ 18 h and 0. 05 %/ 24 h for E. urophylla and 0. 03 %/ 24 h and 0. 05 %/ 24 h for E. grandis. Phenotypic effects of colchicine included shorter, thicker roots and hypocotyls; darker leaves; longer and narrower leaves in some tetraploids; and asymmetrical leaf margins in many mixoploids and tetraploids compared with the controls. In the tetraploids, stomata were significantly larger (p< 0. 0001) and less frequent (p< 0. 001). A significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the number stomatal chloroplasts was also ascertained. Confirmed mixoploid seedlings all displayed tetraploid leaves based on stomatal size and thus classified as periclinal chimeras. In bud sports, only leaves with islands of diploid and tetraploid stomata in the confirmed mixoploids were encountered. Mixoploid bud sports were thus either sectional or <b>mericlinal</b> chimeras. Stomatal size proved to be a suitable pre-screening method, especially in polyploidy induction in seedlings. Additionally confirmed tetraploids exhibited significantly different stomatal frequencies and stomatal chloroplast frequencies compared with the diploids, thus proving to be suitable detection methods for polyploidy screenings. Polyploidy induction in seed was effective, however, less effective in axillary buds which requires further research to refine methods...|$|E
