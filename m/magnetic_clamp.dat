50|$|In {{category}} A (1+2+3+4) is {{the fuel}} cladding, the protective and nonreactive outer {{layer of the}} fuel pellet, which uses {{none of the above}} features: It is always closed and keeps the fuel and the fission products inside and is not open before arriving at the reprocessing plant. In category B (2+3+4) is the surge line, which connects the hot leg with the pressurizer and helps to control the pressure in the primary loop of a PWR and uses a moving working fluid when fulfilling its mission. In category C (3+4) is the accumulator, which does not need signal input of 'intelligence' or external power. Once the pressure in the primary circuit drops below the set point of the spring-loaded accumulator valves, the valves open and water is injected into the primary circuit by compressed nitrogen. In category D (4 only) is the SCRAM which utilizes moving working fluids, moving mechanical parts and signal inputs of 'intelligence' but not external power or forces: the control rods drop driven by gravity once they have been released from their <b>magnetic</b> <b>clamp.</b> But nuclear safety engineering is never that simple: Once released the rod may not fulfil its mission: It may get stuck due to earthquake conditions or due to deformed core structures. This shows that though it is a passively safe system and has been properly actuated, it may not fulfil its mission. Nuclear engineers have taken this into consideration: Typically only a part of the rods dropped are necessary to shut down the reactor. Samples of safety systems with passive safety components can be found in almost all nuclear power stations: the containment, hydro-accumulators in PWRs or pressure suppression systems in BWRs.|$|E
50|$|Rhino TRU (the SPV in Anderson's earlier series): The Rhino TRU (Tactical Response Unit) is a {{heavy-duty}} attack vehicle, with an ultra-tough full armour. The Rhino {{is capable of}} high speed {{with the help of}} twin ram air booster jets at the rear. Built with ten wheels (two front sets, three rear sets), as well as with variable ride-height suspension, it is equipped with a multi-wheel steering system. This makes this cumbersome-looking vehicle easy to manoeuvre, on any kind of normal road as well as giving it good off-road performance. The Rhino is armed to the teeth with a large arsenal; two front mounted twin cannons firing explosive tipped rounds, armour piercing missiles, harpoon guns and <b>magnetic</b> <b>clamp</b> guns. There are also extendable battering rams on the front and rear. It is also equipped with evasive action anti-missiles launched from the rear. The Rhino is a sealed armoured vehicle, and access to the cabin is gained from the hatches on the vehicles sides. Retractable seats face the hatch openings to receive either the driver and/or passenger, which swing into position in front of the control panel. The vehicle can be driven from either side, the steering sliding into position to whoever wishes to drive it. Other hatches are situated on top of the vehicle and underneath it. The drivers cabin has a number of control screens, which act as the drivers eyes, as there is no window. Equipped with all manner of computerised equipment needed for Spectrum work, the Rhino also comes with a security device allowing the driver to lock the vehicle by password and voice command, thus avoiding theft of the Rhino by an enemy if it should be left by itself. Whenever a Rhino is needed on a given mission, Spectrum will use the Albatross to transport the vehicle. The Albatross will land and the hatch beneath will open, a lift lowering to the ground to deposit the Rhino - with driver inside - ready to perform its mission.|$|E

40|$|Powder {{blasting}} {{technology is}} proposed {{in this thesis}} as a new structuring tool for Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC). The process, consisting of mechanical abrasion through high speed particles, is mostly used on brittle material but was successfully adapted for the patterning of microstructures onto the fragile green tape substrate, through the manufacturing of novel stencil masks. These masks are based on high resolution patterned nickel sheet produced using UV-LIGA process or laser cutting coated with {{a thin layer of}} photopolymer which prevents efficiently the metal sheet deformations under particles bombardment. The magnetic properties of the metal allowed <b>magnetic</b> <b>clamping</b> to be used to maintain the mask down onto the substrate. The etching rate of the metal was shown to be low enough at a pressure of 50 psi (344 kPa) at a distance nozzle-substrate (N-S) of 20 mm and 50 mm so that the mask could be re-used several times and ensured good pattern transfer quality from the mask to the substrate. The process was systematically characterised on DuPont 951 P 2 (165 μm thick) green tapes. The erosion of the green tape ceramic was then characterised with the micro-patterned electroplated masks. It showed that the powder blasted structures had U shape walls and verticality of the walls closed to 90 o can be obtained with increasing the number of passes. The structures have smooth edges and do not have any melting parts. Smoother structures were obtained with distance nozzle-substrate of 50 mm favouring lower under etching of about 15 - 20 μm at the expense of a three times increase in process duration. Vias as small as 62 μm in entry diameter and 20 μm exit diameter were produced along with beams 25 μm top width and 54 μm bottom width were produced. Following the green tape characterisation, a LTCC package for an optical encoder featuring 16 layers with the glass cavity was manufactured. 45 x 45 mm nickel masks coated with LF 55 gn flexopolymer were produced featuring stacking pins, fiducials, cavities and circular apertures ranging from 100 μm to 400 μm diameters for interconnections.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We studied 23 obese adolescents with high HFF (HFF � 5. 5 %) and 20 obese adolescents with low HFF (HFF � 5. 5 %), matched for age, Tanner stage, BMI z score, and percentages of body fat, visceral fat, and IMCL.

The vibration absorber consists of mass block, cantilever beam, magnet lock system, vibration and distance sensors, controller and servo motor. The mass block is fixed on the tip of cantilever beam, and the control process is driven by a servo motor and a transmit gears. Portion of cantilever was cut in form of gear tracks, which can be driven by servo motor through transmit gear to regulate the length of the cantilever beam, and the natural frequency of absorber will also be regulated. After the mass locates in right position (i. e. the natural frequency of absorber is in assigned condition), the <b>magnetic</b> lock will <b>clamp</b> the cantilever beam. The design has the benefit of simplified control system, and extra unknown vibration modes will be averted. A fabrication prototype of the proposed semi-active vibration absorber is constructed and tested to demonstrate the application and modeling of the new cantilever beam damper. By performing the experimental work, the semi-active vibration control system is designed not only for reduce vibration level in resonant condition, but also considered for vibration attenuation in non-resonant conditions...|$|R
40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recently, {{the novel}} myokine irisin was {{described}} to drive adipose tissue 'browning', to increase energy expenditure, {{and to improve}} obesity and insulin resistance in high fat-fed mice. Here, we assessed whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FNDC 5 locus, encoding the irisin precursor, contribute to human prediabetic phenotypes (overweight, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, impaired insulin release). METHODS: A population of 1, 976 individuals was characterized by oral glucose tolerance tests and genotyped for FNDC 5 tagging SNPs. Subgroups underwent hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic <b>clamps,</b> <b>magnetic</b> resonance imaging/spectroscopy, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests. From 37 young and 14 elderly participants recruited in two different centres, muscle biopsies were obtained for the preparation of human myotube cultures. RESULTS: After appropriate adjustment and Bonferroni correction {{for the number of}} tested variants, SNPs rs 16835198 and rs 726344 were associated with in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity. Via interrogation of publicly available data from the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium, rs 726344 's effect on insulin sensitivity was replicated. Moreover, novel data from human myotubes revealed a negative association between FNDC 5 expression and appropriately adjusted in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity in young donors. This finding was replicated in myotubes from elderly men. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that the FNDC 5 gene, encoding the novel myokine irisin, determines insulin sensitivity in humans.

We examined water relations in dominant Banksia menziesii R. Br. trees using <b>magnetic</b> leaf patch <b>clamp</b> pressure (ZIM-) probes that allow continuous, real-time monitoring of leaf water status. Multiple ZIM-probes across the crown were complemented by traditional ecophysiological measurements. During summer, early stomatal downregulation of transpiration prevented midday balancing pressures from exceeding 2. 5 MPa. Diurnal patterns of ZIM-probe and pressure chamber readings agreed reasonably well, however, ZIM-probes recorded short-term dynamics, which are impossible to capture using a pressure chamber. Simultaneous recordings of three ZIM-probes evenly spaced along leaf laminas revealed intrafoliar turgor gradients, which, however, did not develop in a strictly basi- or acropetal fashion and varied with cardinal direction. Drought stress manifested as increasing daily signal amplitude (low leaf water status) and occasionally as rising baseline at night (delayed rehydration). These symptoms occurred more often locally than across the entire crown. Microclimate effects on leaf water status were strongest in crown regions experiencing peak morning radiation (East and North). Extreme spring temperatures preceded {{the sudden death of}} B. menziesii trees, suggesting a temperature- or humidity-related tipping point causing rapid hydraulic failure as evidenced by collapsing ZIM-probe readings from an affected tree.

40|$|Background/question/methods: Banksia {{woodlands}} in south-west Australia {{are currently}} facing multiple threats, including fragmentation and drought- or temperature-induced mortality {{due to the}} region’s changing climate. We examined, in unprecedented detail, water relations in Banksia menziesii R. Br. trees using a novel <b>magnetic</b> leaf patch <b>clamp</b> pressure probe (ZIM-probe) that allows continuous, real-time monitoring of leaf water status. Several ZIM-probes were installed across the crown and complemented by sap flow and traditional ecophysiological spot measurements. Results/conclusions: Drought stress manifested as increasing daily signal amplitudes. Drought stress symptoms occurred more often locally than across the entire crown. Diurnal recordings during summer showed that stomatal down-regulation of transpiration commenced {{in the morning when}} vapour pressure deficit (VPD) reached 2 - 2. 5 kPa. This early reduction in stomatal conductance prevented midday balancing pressures from exceeding 2. 5 MPa. During peak summer, water status in the east and north responded more strongly to VPD than in south and west. Sap flow response to VPD reached a saturation plateau at ca. 2. 5 kPa coincident with the onset of stomatal down-regulation. Unexpectedly high spring temperatures preceded the sudden death of several B. menziesii trees, suggesting a temperature- or VPD-related tipping point causing rapid hydraulic failure as evidenced by collapsing ZIM-probe readings recorded on an affected tree. The ZIM-probe’s high sensitivity renders it an ideal tool for drought stress monitoring and evaluating adaptive forest and woodland management strategies.

After appropriate adjustment, none of the PIK 3 CG tagging SNPs was significantly associated with body fat content/distribution, adipokine/cytokine concentrations, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, or blood glucose concentrations (p> 0. 0127, all; Bonferroni-corrected α-level: 0. 0051). However, six non-linked SNPs displayed at least nominal associations with plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations, two of them (rs 4288294 and rs 116697954) reaching the level of study-wide significance (p = 0. 0003 and p = 0. 0004, respectively). More precisely, rs 4288294 and rs 116697954 influenced HDL 2 -, but not HDL 3 -, cholesterol. With respect to the SNPs' in vivo functionality, rs 4288294 was significantly associated with PIK 3 CG mRNA expression in PBMCs. We could demonstrate that common genetic variation in the PIK 3 CG locus, possibly via altered PIK 3 CG gene expression, determines plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations.

40|$|Stem {{sap flow}} (Q) and leaf turgor {{pressure}} (P c) were measured simultaneously on 4 -year-old, 2. 4 m tall 'Arbequina' olive trees in a hedgerow orchard. Measurements {{were performed on}} well-watered control trees {{as well as on}} 60 RDI and 30 RDI trees (RDI=regulated deficit irrigation). The 60 RDI trees received 59. 2 % of the crop water needs (ET c), and the 30 RDI trees received 29. 4 % of ET c. P c was determined non-invasively using the <b>magnetic</b> leaf patch <b>clamp</b> pressure probe (ZIM probe). The patch pressure P p measured by the probe is inversely correlated with turgor pressure at P c>ca. 50 kPa. P c is coupled with xylem pressure; thus P p yields information about the development of tension in xylem. In the case of the control trees a positive correlation between Q and P p was generally found, i. e. Q increased usually with increasing P p and decreased with decreasing P p, as expected. However, Q peaking did not always coincided with P p peaking at noon. Occasionally, Q peaking preceded or followed P p peaking with a time difference of up to 3 h in both cases. Under some circumstances, the onset of Q after sunrise was greatly delayed, even though a pronounced increase of P p was observed. A delayed onset of Q after sunrise resulted in hysteresis phenomena, i. e. the linear increase of Q and P p in the morning hours did not coincide with the corresponding decrease of Q and P p in the afternoon. The development of severe water stress (P c<ca. 50 kPa) associated with the increase in the intercellular spaces of the spongy tissue in the leaves resulted in inverted diurnal P p curves, i. e. minimum P p values were recorded at noon and maximum P p values during the night on the 30 RDI trees. The effects were reversible as shown by re-watering. By contrast, the magnitude of Q decreased continuously from the turgescent state to the state of severe water stress; maximum Q values were still recorded around noon. The data suggests that short-range tension forces are responsible for water lifting in olive trees and that water uptake from water storage reservoirs must {{play an important role in}} the supply of the leaves with water. Furthermore, for setting of irrigation thresholds the finding of shape changes of the P p curves upon severe water stress seems to be a useful indicator. Such shape changes are detected and monitored more sensitively than changes in the magnitude of sap flow rates or of turgor pressure. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Die Vorteile einer sehr guten Fokussierbarkeit von Scheiben- und Faserlaser lassen sich auf verschiedene Art und Weise nutzen. Kleinere Fokusdurchmesser und die daraus resultierenden hohen Intensitäten ermöglichen einen Tiefschweißprozess bei sehr hohen Vorschubgeschwindigkeiten. Für den industriellen Einsatz ist vor allem eine reproduzierbare hohe Qualität des bearbeiteten Bauteils entscheidend. Schädigungen, wie insbesondere der Verzug, sollen so weit wie möglich reduziert werden. Untersuchungen zeigen, dass bei einer konstanten Einschweißtiefe mit einem kleineren Fokusdurchmesser, einer höheren Vorschubgeschwindigkeit und einem kleineren Divergenzwinkel der Verzug stark reduziert werden kann. Der Vorteil einer sehr guten Strahlqualität kann auf der anderen Seite sehr hohe Intensitäten in den Schweißoptiken mit sich bringen. Durch Absorptionen im Bulkmaterial und den Beschichtungen kommt es zu thermischen Effekten und somit zu einer Verschlechterung der Strahlqualität und zu einem Fokus-Shift. Diese können so gravierend sein, dass Auswirkungen auf den Schweißprozess einhergehen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden mit hochwertiger und komplexer Messausrüstung transiente und stationäre Strahlqualitätsmessungen an Schweißoptiken durchgeführt. Ein neuentwickeltes und neuartiges Verfahren ermöglicht eine einfache Qualifizierung von Optiken. Der sogenannte „Referenzprozess“ macht dazu Veränderungen der Intensität bzw. der Intensitätsverteilung auf dem Werkstück sichtbar, die zu unterschiedlichen Schweißergebnissen führen und sich mittels Messschieber einfach auswerten lassen. Ein weiterer Vorteil der hohen Intensitäten von im infraroten emittierenden Laser-strahlquellen ist die Bearbeitung von Kupferwerkstoffen im Dauerstrichbetrieb. Dabei lassen sich mehrere Millimeter Einschweißtiefe erreichen. Eine Herausforderung stellt die geringe Absorption von gerade einmal 5 % zu Prozessbeginn dar. Starke Rückreflexe können dabei zu Schädigungen in den optischen Komponenten führen. Durch die Verwendung von frequenzverdoppelten Lasersystemen kann die Absorption etwa versiebenfacht werden, so dass Rückreflexe reduziert werden. Diese neuartigen im „grünen“ emittierenden cw-Laser sind in ihrer Leistung noch stark begrenzt, weshalb in dieser Arbeit ein Kombinationsprozess realisiert wurde, mit dem höhere Einschweißtiefen möglich werden und der Vorteil der kürzeren Wellenlänge deutlich wird. New {{developments}} in diode-pumped fibre lasers and disc lasers open up opportunities for completely new process strategies {{as a result}} of their incomparable focusability at high laser power. This yields unprecedented beam parameter quotients (power divided by focus diameter) which are needed for high welding velocities. In addition this allows deep penetration welding in highly reflective materials such as copper. The laser sources used for this work were fibre coupled allowing high accessibility and flexibility as well as lower costs for the handling devices. Another important property of shorter wavelengths is the generally increased absorptivity in metals. With the use of 1 µm lasers instead of CO 2 lasers, an increase of absorptivity has already been attained. A further improvement of the absorptivity, especially in copper material, can be achieved by using laser sources in the visible range. This kind of novel laser sources, which have not been available so far, goes along with new possibilities in material processing. For industrial application the above mentioned advantages can be exploited in high efficiency processes. The small interaction zones enable deep penetration welding with less distortion of the workpiece. The joint geometries of thin samples of less than one millimeter have never been achievable before and were therefore never examined in the past. The minimization of distortion through minimizing the heat input is clearly shown in this work. For this purpose samples of stainless steel with a thickness of 500 µm were used. The distortion angle (averaged angle of the distorted workpiece adjacent the weld seam) was measured with a surface topography system. Therewith a comparison of different welding parameters could be performed. Three laser sources with different beam qualities were used for the investigations. Different focal diameters in the range from 14 µm to 200 µm were achieved with different focusing arrangements. A reduction of the distortion angle was demonstrated for: Smaller focus diameter; Higher processing speeds (up to 50 m/min); Smaller divergence angle of the laser beam. In doing so the penetration depth of welds was kept constant. The above mentioned three parameters directly reduced the cross-sectional area of the weld seam and therefore resulted in a smaller distortion angle. Due to the decreasing focal diameters new clamping devices with a high position accuracy had to be developed. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>clamping</b> device fulfilling this demand was constructed and manufactured. However, high average power very often causes thermal beam distortion inside trans-mitting optical elements. This effect is especially pronounced in contaminated optics. It results in a significant decrease of the beam quality and a shortening of the effective focal length, also referred to as focus shift. Both effects directly modify the laser spot size and thus the intensity on the workpiece. This is very critical for most laser material processing applications. Especially welding of highly reflective materials such as copper is very sensitive to changes in the laser intensity. To prevent process failures, the focus shift and also the beam quality have to be measured behind the optical components. Static as well as transient measurements showed that the focus shift and the degraded beam quality directly reduce the intensity on the workpiece. In addition the power which is absorbed, reflected, and scattered in the optical components also reduces the intensity on the workpiece. Reductions of the intensity on the workpiece of up to 88 % were measured. The remaining 12 % obviously are not sufficient to allow a stable welding process. These results imply that the use of appropriate and very clean processing optics is mandatory for a reproducible and stable welding process. The above mentioned measurements require very expensive and complex measure-ment equipment. In this work, a novel and simple method is presented, which uses the welding process itself to quantitatively determine the focus shift. The so-called “reference process” was developed, which takes benefit of the dependence of the deep penetration welding threshold on the beam diameter. After a defined preheating time in order to control the thermal load of the optics, a weld trace of a few centimeters is generated in a sample by applying a laser power ramp. The position of the transition from heat conduction welding to deep penetration welding is easily noticeable by visual inspection of the seam width on the workpiece surface. This allows measuring it with a simple caliper, yielding the threshold transition power. By the outcome of four different welds with suitably varying laser parameters, the focus shift can be calculated with appropriate accuracy. With this method, a new and easily applicable tool is available. This is an important requirement for a reproducible and stable welding process and even holds for changing conditions, as e. g. slowly contaminated safety glasses. Presuming correct conditions of the laser beam on the workpiece, also highly reflec-tive materials can be welded by the means of highly brilliant 1 µm laser beams. With the use of 1 µm lasers the absorptivity can be increased from about 1 % to about 5 % in copper material at room temperature as compared to CO 2 -lasers. Using high-power 1 µm lasers this absorptivity increase guarantees that enough energy absorbed for starting a deep penetration welding process. In addition the absorptivity of copper increases with temperature and even shows a large step in absorptivity at the phase transition from solid to liquid from about 8 % to about 13 %. When the processing optics are not aligned and shielded correctly, the large amount of back reflected laser light causes severe damage somewhere in the optics chain. This happens especially at the process start. To control the process start condition, the absorptivity was increased by coupling more laser power in the copper material. This was done by using a beam source with a once more shorter wavelength. A frequency-doubled thin-disk laser with a wavelength of 515 nm and a maximum average output power of 100 W was available for the experiments presented here. At this wavelength, the absorptivity for the “cold” copper material is more than seven times higher as compared to the infrared (IR) laser beam. However, due to the limited power the penetration depth of pure copper welds was only about 100 µm, which is not sufficient for most industrial applications. Therefore, a commercial thin-disk laser (&# 955; = 1030 nm) and the frequency doubled thin-disk laser were combined allowing a so-called hybrid process. The preceding green laser beam with a focal diameter of 25 µm was used to heat up, melting and forming a small keyhole on the surface of the copper material. The IR laser beam was focused onto the workpiece to a diameter of 100 µm and the distance between the two laser beams was adjusted to 100 µm. The large distance was chosen so that there was no interaction between the keyhole created by the green laser beam and the interaction region of the IR beam. Numerical simulation of these conditions showed an increase of absorptivity in the interaction zone of the IR beam from 5 % to about 11 %. Under these conditions the IR beam interacted with the preheated material which leads to an enhanced absorptivity and a lower threshold for deep penetration welding. Welding experiments confirmed the predictions. For the described hybrid process two laser sources as well as two very accurately aligned processing heads were necessary. The high complexity of the optical arrange-ment and the resulting high cost make the hybrid process only reasonable for specific industrial applications. Nevertheless, the encouraging results using the hybrid process suggest further research on laser sources providing - at least at the process start - enough “green” laser power to force well-controlled deep penetration welding in copper materials...|$|R
