5000|$|When Cramer-Krasselt {{took over}} as <b>Master</b> <b>Lock's</b> agency later in the year, the company {{decided to make the}} gun ads a tradition, and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one {{featuring}} skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an [...] "event" [...] that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve <b>Master</b> <b>Lock's</b> market share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year. <b>Master</b> <b>Lock's</b> yearly Super Bowl commercials accounted for nearly all of the company's annual advertising budget.|$|R

500|$|Another {{preliminary}} {{match was}} between the Raw and SmackDown! brands. The feud began on the October 3 episode of Raw, in which WWE Chairman Vince McMahon wanted a match between SmackDown! wrestlers on the program. A match was scheduled, but before it could get underway, Eric Bischoff announced that McMahon had left the arena, thus leaving himself in charge. Seeing SmackDown! as inferior, Bischoff stopped the match by turning off the lights and going to a commercial break. At {{the end of the}} broadcast, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long, led SmackDown! superstars to the ring, and they fought with Raw superstars. On the October 17 episode of Raw, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield's (JBL) (SmackDown!) entrance music played during Edge's (Raw) match, the distraction caused Edge to lose the match. As part of the storyline, Edge and Chris Masters showed up to the SmackDown! program on the October 21 episode, in which they interfered in a match between JBL and Rey Mysterio, where they assaulted Mysterio. On the October 24 episode of Raw, a match was made between Edge and Masters, and two of five SmackDown! superstars chosen by the fans, and Mysterio attacked Edge from behind. The following week, Bischoff invited Mysterio to the Raw program to take the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge, a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Masters' swinging full nelson submission hold, which he calls the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> Mysterio, however, attacked Masters instead, which caused Bischoff to call for other Raw superstars. Long called for SmackDown! superstars, and they fought until the Raw roster retreated.|$|E
500|$|Another major rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. This feud began the night after SummerSlam, where Michaels lost a match to Hulk Hogan. Michaels {{admitted}} he fell victim to Hogan's leg drop, a move where Hogan drops his legs across the opponent's head or chest. He concluded that Hogan was the better man {{and it was time}} to get [...] "back to reality". Midway through Michaels' speech, Masters interrupted him and informed Michaels that individuals like Hogan and Michaels did not know how to pass the torch to new wrestlers. Michaels went along with Masters' comments and warned Masters to not group him with Hogan. Masters concluded by stating that he was not [...] "trying" [...] to steal the spotlight from Michaels, but that he was going to [...] "take it". Michaels responded by saying that he knew where Masters was coming from, which led to Michaels slapping Masters. The two then brawled, thus turning Michaels into an on-screen hero, as he had been a villain in rivalry between Hogan. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Michaels was involved in the Masterlock Challenge, a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Master's full Nelson submission hold, which he calls the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> Despite Michaels' best efforts, he could not break free. Upset at the vigorous resistance of Michaels, Masters released the hold and hit Michaels with a steel chair before re-applying the hold. The following week, Michaels issued a challenge to Masters at Unforgiven, in which he vowed to get revenge on Masters for his actions the previous week.|$|E
2500|$|On the February 20, 2006 {{edition of}} Raw, Michaels was pitted against {{four of the}} five members of the Spirit Squad in their in-ring debut. After he had {{connected}} with [...] "Sweet Chin Music", Michaels was attacked by all five members until an unknown man came storming in to the ring to defend Michaels. During the melee, it was revealed that it was Jannetty coming to defend his former tag team partner. Later on Raw, Vince McMahon came out to mention that he would offer Jannetty a full-time contract. However, Mr. McMahon added a stipulation - Jannetty had to join Mr. McMahon's [...] "Kiss My Ass Club" [...] the following week on Raw. On Raw Jannetty refused to kiss Mr. McMahon’s ass. McMahon instead offered Jannetty the possibility of breaking Chris Masters' signature submission hold, the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> Jannetty appeared to almost break the hold, but Mr. McMahon (who was officiating) delivered a low blow, and Jannetty was never able to break it, only being released when Michaels ran in to save him. Shortly after Michaels had saved Jannetty, Shane McMahon ran in the ring with a steel chair and knocked out Michaels. The former Rockers were supposed to continue a program with the McMahons, but Jannetty was absent from the next edition of Raw which meant that they had to rewrite the angle leaving Jannetty out of it.|$|E

6000|$|Leaving this point, we ask why a man already suspicious, like James, let the <b>Master</b> <b>lock</b> any {{door behind}} him.

We may also suppose that, till facts proved the locking of one door at least (for about {{that there is no}} doubt), James did not know that any door was locked. On August 11 the Rev. Mr. Galloway, in a sermon preached before the King and the populace at the Cross of Edinburgh, says that the Master led the monarch upstairs, ‘and through a trans’ (a passage), ‘the door whereof, so soon as they had entered, chekit to with ane lok, then through a gallery, whose door also chekit to, through a chamber, and the door thereof chekit to, also,’ and thence into the turret of which he ‘also locked the door.’ {53} ...|$|E
5000|$|On the December 4 {{episode of}} Raw, Jonathan Coachman {{set up a}} <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge against John Cena for the WWE Championship. Masters {{appearing}} to have the challenge won released the hold for a short time, allowing Cena to reverse the hold into his own <b>Master</b> <b>Lock,</b> forcing Masters to submit, retaining his title, and making Cena the first to win the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge. At the start of 2007, Masters would restart his feud with Carlito, which led to several matches between the two. The first was a one-on-one contest at New Year's Revolution won by Masters. In a rematch the next night on Raw, Carlito came out victorious. On the January 15 episode of Raw, Ron Simmons, with interference from Super Crazy, almost [...] "won" [...] the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge. An attempted <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge for The Great Khali on the February 26 episode of Raw did not occur when Masters was unable to apply the hold to Khali. The <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> was first officially broken on the March 19 episode of Raw, by ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley. after Masters debuted it {{more than two years}} ago.|$|E

5000|$|Masters made a {{claim that}} {{his version of the}} full nelson hold, which he dubbed the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock,</b> was unbreakable. Masters began a series of {{contests}} he would call [...] "Master Lock Challenges" [...] where Masters would put an opponent in the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> and the opponent would try to break free before Masters made him submit or pass out. Masters would go on to log more full nelson submission victories than any wrestler in WWE history, breaking the record previously held by Kurt Angle. Originally he would call out plants from the crowd, placing a $1,000 prize of his own money to be paid to anyone who could break free from the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> At Backlash, he defeated Melissa Coates in a <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge. He engaged in feuds with lower-card wrestlers, Val Venis and Sgt. Slaughter, who both failed to break the <b>Master</b> <b>Lock.</b> Using villainous tactics, he often attacked the wrestlers beforehand and frequently cheated (for example using a low-blow to escape Sgt. Slaughter's cobra clutch). Masters increased the offered reward each week up to $20,000 and sometimes threw in a bonus. After defeating the 400-pound Rosey on July 18, Masters defiantly stated [...] "it doesn't matter how big they are!", prompting The Big Show to accept a <b>Master</b> <b>Lock</b> Challenge.

5000|$|The {{simplest}} way {{to open the}} majority of pin locks is to insert a key (or variety of keys) which have been cut so that each peak of the key is equal and has been cut down to the lowest groove of the key. This key is then struck sharply with a hammer whilst applying torque. The force of the blow is carried {{down the length of}} the key and (operating as does a Newton's cradle) will move only the driver pins leaving the key pins in place.

Despite the initial revolt passing largely peacefully with slave <b>masters</b> <b>locked</b> in their homes, those who were considered ringleaders were tried at set up at different estates along the coast and executed by shooting; their heads were cut off and nailed to posts. A variety of sentences were handed out, including solitary confinement, lashing, and death. Bryant (1824) records 72 slaves having been sentenced by court-martial {{at the time of}} publication. He noted that 19 of the 45 death sentences had been carried out; a further 18 slaves had been reprieved.
