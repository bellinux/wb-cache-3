500|$|... "Fuck Them All" [...] is a 2005 song {{recorded}} by French singer-songwriter Mylène Farmer. Released on 14 March 2005, {{it was the}} lead single from her sixth studio album, Avant que l'ombre.... Like all tracks from the album, the lyrics were written by the singer with music composed by Laurent Boutonnat. [...] "Fuck Them All" [...] combines pop music elements with acoustic guitar, electronic beats and synths, with a <b>musical</b> <b>bridge</b> sung as a rap in English. As a result, it is often compared to Madonna's early 2000s songs. Using both crude and colorful lyrics, including sex and vulgarity, the song deals with the war between the sexes and was often considered a feminist plea in which women are presented as warriors.|$|E
500|$|... "Si j'avais au moins..." [...] was {{performed}} {{as the last}} song during the 2009 tour, {{but only in the}} halls venues, and was cancelled for the concerts in stadiums. Farmer then wore a long white dress, and the stage was bathed in red and orange lights. During the refrain, many screens displayed images of lava expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The last <b>musical</b> <b>bridge</b> was extended while part of the staircase raised and showed a tunnel throughout which Farmer left the stage. In December2009, Farmer officially released the live video of the song on the Internet, video which was not featured on the DVD and Blu-ray for N°5 on Tour; the instrumental version of the song, however, was used for the ending credits [...] "Générique".|$|E
500|$|This song is {{characterized}} by its music produced from synthetic keyboards, and {{has been criticized for}} its lack of innovation, its <b>musical</b> <b>bridge</b> containing vulgar lyrics (with rap) reminiscent of the Madonna's song [...] "American Life", and choirs of children on guitar riffs which are actually the singer's voice remixed. According to journalist Alice Novak, the song begins with [...] "trippy and mysterious" [...] notes played on keyboards, then continues with [...] "fast and nervous" [...] sounds on the drum machine; the tone is [...] "rather dark, hypnotic", with an [...] "swaying and repetitive" [...] end which uses [...] "the machinery of the lyrics of some rap groups". Author Erwan Chuberre deemed the lyrics [...] "easy, but deep" [...] and contain an allusion to Farmer's friend Marie Trintignant, who died in 2003.|$|E

500|$|On 15 December 2008, {{recording}} company Polydor officially {{announced that}} [...] "Si j'avais au moins..." [...] {{as the next}} single from the album Point de suture (2008) while simultaneously a promotional format was released on radio stations. This format contained a radio edit version, in which the last refrain of the original song, before the <b>musical</b> <b>bridge,</b> was deleted. Many fans were disappointed by this choice, {{as demonstrated by the}} results of a survey published on the website Mylene.net which showed that only 1.7% of the voters wanted the song as the third single. Charles Decant of Ozap deemed this release a [...] "surprising decision" [...] which recalled the choice of the ballad [...] "Redonne-moi" [...] as the third single from her previous album Avant que l'ombre... (2005). As the song has a very slow tempo, author Erwan Chuberre deemed that Farmer made [...] "an artistic rather than a commercial choice" [...] when she decided to release the song as a single.|$|E
500|$|Tasso, {{based on}} the life of sixteenth-century Italian poet, Torquato Tasso, {{is a perfect example of}} both Liszt's working method and his {{achievements}} based on restless experimentation. The 1849 version following a conventional overture layout, divided into a slow section ("Lament") and a fast one ("Triumph"). Even with this division, the entire work was actually a set of variations on a single melody—a folk hymn sung to Liszt by a gondolier in Venice in the late 1830s. Among the most significant revisions Liszt made was the addition of a middle section in the vein of a minuet. The theme of the minuet was, again, a variant of the gondolier's folk hymn, thus becoming another example of thematic transformation. Calmer than either of the outer sections, it was intended to depict Tasso's more stable years in the employment of the Este family in Ferrara. In a margin note, Liszt informs the conductor that the orchestra [...] "assumes a dual role" [...] in this section; strings play a self-contained piece {{based on the}} original version of the gondolier's hymn while woodwinds play another based on the variation used in the minuet. This was very much in the manner of Italian composer Pietro Raimondi, whose contrapuntal mastery was such that he had written three oratoriosJoseph, Potiphar and Jacobwhich could be performed either individually or together. Liszt made a study of Raimondi's work but the Italian composer died before Liszt could meet him personally. While the minuet section was probably added to act as a <b>musical</b> <b>bridge</b> between the opening lament and final triumphal sections, it along with other modifications [...] "rendered the 'Tasso Overture' an overture no longer". The piece became [...] "far too long and developed" [...] to be considered an overture and was redesignated a symphonic poem.|$|E

She states that while she wrote the song, she did not realize what she was actually writing and that it was not before meeting Tammy Lynn Michaels that she understood what this song means to other people.

2500|$|Cluster's first release, an eponymous {{debut in}} 1971 on Philips, {{was the first}} major label release for the musicians. Previous Kluster works had been small or private label {{releases}} with no more than 300 copies pressed and sold. This album and the 1972 follow-up were a <b>musical</b> <b>bridge</b> between the avant-garde, discordant, proto-industrial sound of Kluster and the softer and more controlled ambient and rock sounds of their mid to late '70s albums. Cluster (later reissued as Cluster '71) has little or no discernible melody or beat. Allmusic review describes it, in part as [...] "...a dislocating, disorienting meld of random space music, industrial noise, proto-ambient atmospherics, feedback, and soundwash..." [...] The first album is also the only Cluster release on which Conny Plank is listed as a full third member of the band. He is credited as a composer and producer on Cluster II. Cluster signed with the influential Krautrock label Brain Records for their second release, a relationship which would continue through 1975.|$|E
2500|$|A full orchestral {{arrangement}} with strings and French horns adorning a bluesy rhythm track and bass line provides the instrumentals. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic {{notes that the}} song is narrated {{by a man who}} imagines a relationship with the woman he loves but is canny enough to realize that his daydreams are fiction, yet is overwhelmed by them. The lyrics capture his resignation to his fantasies. The song as a whole captures their full emotional effect on him. [...] The first two verses establish the theme and explore the narrator's daydreams, in which he and the object of his affections are lovers preparing to be married, to [...] "raise a family" [...] and build [...] "a cozy little home / out in the country / with two children, maybe three." [...] In the bridge, the narrator prays that he will never lose her love to another, or he will surely die." [...] By introducing this doubt, the <b>musical</b> <b>bridge</b> simultaneously bridges the movement from dream to reality, completed when the final lines shift from imagery to bald statement: [...] "But in reality / she doesn't even know me." [...] For Erlewine, [...] "the Temptations' performance has a dream-like quality, quietly drifting through the singer's hopes and desires." [...] We must add that just as the lyrics track the movement from dream to reality, the chorus goes on to anchor the drifting melody in a robust and highly memorable rhythm.|$|E

50|$|Tristan {{was written}} as a musical joke. It {{was a period}} when I was fond of all the stories about King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Tristan {{was not only a}} great fighter, but he also played many musical {{instruments}} and had a beautiful singing voice. This is why I thought he could be the subject of a piece to suggest the process of improvising in a characteristic early style that then begins to change to futuristic musical ideas. The first section of the piece is clearly ancient in style; the second is more modern; then the third introduces elements of Eastern music as well as some rock riffs. The idea is that Tristan, during his improvising, is building <b>musical</b> <b>bridges</b> to the future.|$|R
