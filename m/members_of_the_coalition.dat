5|$|After their {{defeat at}} the Convention, members of two {{minority}} caucuses helped to found new socialist organizations. At most 200 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> Caucus joined Michael Harrington in forming the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which {{later became the}} Democratic Socialists of America. At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington. Second, {{many members of the}} Debs Caucus joined David McReynolds in reconstituting the Socialist Party USA also in 1973.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 2009, the Coalition's {{climate change}} {{spokesman}} Ian Macfarlane {{agreed to a}} deal with the government to amend the ETS legislation. The amendments provided industry with substantial compensation and exemptions from the ETS. Turnbull took the deal to Liberal MPs for formal approval, but a majority of backbenchers opposed it. Turnbull nonetheless claimed he had the Coalition's support, by counting as supporters the 20 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> Shadow Cabinet who he argued should be presumed to support the deal. This claim was met with rancour by his opponents in the Coalition.|$|E

25|$|Prodi's {{government}} faced {{a crisis}} over policies in early 2007, after just {{nine months of}} government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved {{the expansion of the}} US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR Populars, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.|$|E

25|$|The Syrian Civil War and its {{domestic}} impact have furthered the polarisation of Lebanese politics. The March 14 Alliance, dominated by Christian- and Sunni-based parties, is broadly {{sympathetic to the}} Syrian opposition to Bashar Al-Assad. In August, youth members of 14 March parties including Kataeb, Lebanese Forces, National Liberal Party, Future Movement and Islamic Group held a rally to demand the expulsion of the Syrian Ambassador. 8 March parties generally supported {{the continuation of the}} Assad government, but analysts believe some groups within the coalition may seek new alliances if the Assad government falls. More moderate <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> in government have begun distancing themselves from the Assad government.|$|E
25|$|Murray’s advice {{had been}} met with dismay from some Liberal <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> Cabinet, who were unhappy at the {{realignment}} of Britain’s war effort towards total {{war and a}} massive commitment of troops to the Western Front. Augustine Birrell (Chief Secretary for Ireland), along with Reginald McKenna (Chancellor of the Exchequer), Walter Runciman (President of the Board of Trade) and Sir Edward Grey (Foreign Secretary) had contemplated joining Sir John Simon (Home Secretary) in resigning in protest at the conscription of bachelors, due to be enacted in January 1916. Birrell wrote to the Prime Minister (29 December) that he and Runciman agreed that finance and “strategic policy as expounded in Murray’s long, unconvincing and frightening paper” were more important than conscription.|$|E

25|$|Another {{formidable}} {{and dangerous}} obstacle for Nariakira in {{not only his}} plans to bolster the defenses of all of Japan but also his ascendancy to daimyō of Satsuma was Yura, {{the mother of his}} half-brother, Hisamitsu. By the time Nariakira had arrived in Satsuma to address a crisis related to the Ryūkyū Kingdom (a vassal state under Satsuma) in 1846, Yura had used her charm to thoroughly convince Narioki to promote the interests of her son Hisamitsu over Narioki’s legitimate son and heir-apparent (Nariakira). Zusho, Narioki, Yura, and Hisamitsu were the key <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> which rallied other Satsuma bureaucrats who felt threatened by Nariakira’s immense and highly intimidating intelligence, and tried to impede all attempts Nariakira made to retire his father as daimyō and take his place.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the period}} of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat {{experienced}} a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often {{on the occasion of}} anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the Bush administration to foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the Abu Ghraib prison), calls for withdrawal of <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.|$|E
25|$|The incursions {{continued}} {{entering into}} 1514, with the Spanish mining activity {{focused on the}} Cordillera Central, efforts continued to eliminate resistance in this region. The year began with an incursion led by Jerónimo de Merlo in lands prospected by the viceroy to create a settlement. On July 26, 1514, an attack by the belligerent natives came near Caparra, before being defeated and sentenced. Two months later, another attack by some 300 <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> came near Caparra and later injured cacique Cacibona, a Spanish ally, at modern day Loíza. During this timeframe, one of the belligerent caciques that {{had been charged with}} killing two Spaniards was pardoned and joined the Spanish. The stability of the main island was further compromised by the first insurrection of African slaves. The year closed with an increase of Spanish slaving ships bringing more work force, as part of initiatives led by viceroy Colón.|$|E

25|$|Liberal MP's {{who raised}} the {{prospect}} of a free vote in the party in June 2017 had their advances rejected by several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> who insisted no change could be made without first having a plebiscite. On 9 July 2017, Liberal Senator Dean Smith revealed he was drafting a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. The bill would include legal protections for celebrants who wish not to perform same-sex marriages. Smith stated he intended to bring the bill to the Liberal party room for debate in due course with the hope of having a conscience vote on the legislation {{before the end of the}} year, though {{the prospect of}} crossing the floor has also been raised. The move was countered by a fresh push from several conservative members of the government, including Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, to instead have a plebiscite conducted by postal mail.|$|E
500|$|Upon Napoleon's {{return to}} power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition, and began to {{mobilize}} armies. Wellington and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack them separately {{in the hope of}} destroying them before they could join in a co-ordinated invasion of France with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition.</b> Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, {{while at the same time}} a portion of the French army attacked an Allied army at the Battle of Quatre Bras.

All of this had taken place before Gates was able to return to New York; when he was briefed on the situation, he was told that all other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> had agreed to Morgan's terms.

[...] On the same day, Bosnian Defense Minister Ejup Ganić and Croat <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> government urged Izetbegović to mobilize the TORBiH due to the inability of the JNA to stop the violence. Izetbegović described the images coming out of Bijeljina as [...] "unbelievable". [...] "I thought it was a photomontage," [...] he explained. [...] "I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't believe it was possible." [...] He described the takeover as [...] "criminal", and said he considered the JNA responsible for Bijeljina's fall because it [...] "passively stood by and watched what was happening". Izetbegović mobilized the Territorial Defense later that day so as to [...] "enable people to defend themselves... from future Bijeljinas". The Serb members of the Bosnian Presidency, Plavšić and Nikola Koljević, denounced the mobilization as illegal and resigned. On 8 April, Izetbegović announced a [...] "state of imminent war danger". The JNA rejected requests from the Bosnian Presidency to return the TORBiH's weapons that they had confiscated in 1990. Karadžić and the Bosnian Serb leadership used Izetbegović's mobilization order as a pretext to independence and mobilized their Municipal Crisis Headquarters, reserve police units, and TO forces.|$|E
