25|$|Reduced partial {{pressures}} of {{oxygen in the}} arteries due to intermittent hypoxia are sensed by and stimulate the carotid body, a chemoafferent receptor. The activated carotid body triggers the release of serotonin that attach to serotonin receptors {{on the surface of}} motoneurons, such as the phrenic <b>motoneuron</b> in the case of respiratory recovery. This signal transduction pathway then uses downstream molecules such as TrkB, BDNF, and PKA to increase the synaptic output of the involved motor neuron which in turn increases the motor output of the involved muscles and, thus, decreases functional impairment. As the amount of intermittent hypoxia changes the amount of serotonin release and, as a result, the amount of LTF, this process exhibits metaplasticity. Metaplasticity occurs when the LTF is itself plastic or variable.|$|E
25|$|Stiff-limb {{syndrome}} is {{a variant of}} SPS. This syndrome develops into full SPS about 25 percent of the time. Stiffness and spasms are usually limited to the legs and hyperlordoisis generally does not occur. The stiffness begins in one limb and remains most prominent there. Sphincter and brainstem issues often occur with stiff-limb syndrome. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity, another variant of the condition, includes symptoms of SPS with brainstem issues and autonomic disturbances. It involves polio-encephalomyelitis in the spine and brainstem. There is cerebellar and brainstem involvement. In some cases, the limbic system is affected, as well. Most patients have upper <b>motoneuron</b> issues and autonomic disturbances. Jerking man syndrome or jerking SPS is another subtype of the condition. It begins like classical SPS and progresses for several years, up to 14 in some cases. It is then distinguished {{by the development of}} myoclonus as well as seizures and ataxia in some cases.|$|E
25|$|For speech production, the ACT model {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In {{the case of a}} frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs {{at the level of the}} phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. <b>Motoneuron</b> activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently movement patterns of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal.|$|E
40|$|The extraocular {{muscles in}} mammals, the {{effector}} organs of the oculomotor system, are {{fundamentally different from}} skeletal muscle. All extraocular muscles consist of two different layers, an orbital and a global layer. There are two basic categories of the muscle fibers: twitch or singly-innervated muscle fiber (SIF) and non-twitch or multiply-innervated muscle fiber (MIF). Previous studies in monkey revealed that SIF and MIF <b>motoneurons</b> are anatomically separated and have different premotor inputs. SIF and MIF <b>motoneurons</b> were identified by tracer injection into the belly, or the distal myotendinous junction, of the eye muscles. There are two groups of MIF <b>motoneurons</b> in the oculomotor nucleus, the C- and S-group. The C-group <b>motoneurons</b> innervate the medial rectus (MR) and inferior rectus (IR), while S-group <b>motoneurons</b> innervate the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles. The <b>motoneurons</b> of C-group are located around {{the periphery of the}} oculomotor nucleus. We investigated the location of MR and IR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> in C-group, and the dendritic spread of MR compared with IR MIF <b>motoneurons.</b> We found that the MR and IR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> are two different populations of neurons in C-group. They lie relatively separated. The MR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> are located more dorsomedially than IR MIF <b>motoneurons.</b> The pattern of dendritic spread of these two MIF <b>motoneurons</b> is also different. The dendrites of IR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> spread into the supraoculomotor area bilaterally, but do not approach the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, in contrast, the dendrites of MR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> extend into the supraoculomotor area and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus unilaterally. The function of Edinger-Westphal nucleus is associated with the “near response”. In conclusion, the different location and different dendritic trees suggest that MR and IR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> have different functions. The IR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> may help to stabilize the eye position along with MIF <b>motoneurons</b> from other eye muscles, while the MR MIF <b>motoneurons</b> might also participate the vergence eye movements...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{localization}} of <b>motoneurons</b> in the spinal. The <b>motoneurons</b> in {{the spinal cord}} belong to two functional groups: somatic and visceral. Somatic <b>motoneurons</b> innervate skeletal or voluntary muscle while visceral (autonomic) <b>motoneurons</b> innervate smooth muscle and glands. Somatic <b>motoneurons</b> {{are located in the}} ventral horn of the gray of the spinal cord and innervate the striated muscles of the axial skeleton (neck and trunk) and the muscles of the upper and lower limbs. The majority of somatic <b>motoneurons</b> are alpha <b>motoneurons</b> innervating the extrafusal muscle fibers within skeletal muscle.

In adult animals, {{however, the}} mechanism of degeneration of injured <b>motoneurons</b> is still controversial. Because caspases are important mediators of apoptosis, we have investigated {{the effects of the}} caspase inhibitors, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe) fluoromethylketone (Boc-D-FMK), and N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO) on the survival of neonatal and adult spinal <b>motoneurons</b> after root avulsion of the C 7 spinal cord. In the control neonatal animals, virtually all <b>motoneurons</b> had degenerated by 7 days following root avulsion. Treatment with either 0. 5 μg Boc-D-FMK or 1 μg Ac-DEVD-CHO enhanced the survival of <b>motoneurons</b> to 80 % and 85 % for up to 2 weeks post-injury. By 21 days post-injury, 70 % of avulsed <b>motoneurons</b> were still present after Boc-D-FMK treatment, whereas all avulsed <b>motoneurons</b> died after treatment with Ac-DEVD-CHO.

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} a {{relationship}} between the deficit of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and motoneuronal degeneration, such as that occurring in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Strikingly, extraocular <b>motoneurons</b> show lesser vulnerability to neurodegeneration in ALS compared to other cranial or spinal <b>motoneurons.</b> Therefore, the present study investigates possible differences in VEGF and its main receptor VEGFR- 2 or Flk- 1 between extraocular and non-extraocular brainstem <b>motoneurons.</b> We performed immunohistochemistry and Western blot to determine the presence of VEGF and Flk- 1 in rat <b>motoneurons</b> located in the three extraocular motor nuclei (abducens, trochlear and oculomotor) and to compare it to that observed in two other brainstem nuclei (hypoglossal and facial) that are vulnerable to degeneration. Extraocular <b>motoneurons</b> presented higher amounts of VEGF and its receptor Flk- 1 than other brainstem <b>motoneurons,</b> and thus these molecules could be participating in their higher resistance to neurodegeneration.

40|$|Locomotion {{relies on}} a {{precisely}} timed activation of sets of <b>motoneurons.</b> A fundamental question is how this is achieved. In the lamprey, fin and myotomal <b>motoneurons</b> located {{on the same side}} of the spinal cord display alternating activity during straight swimming. The neural mechanism underlying this alternation is studied here during fictive locomotion induced by superfusion with NMDA, or locomotor bursting induced by electrical stimulation. If the spinal cord is split longitudinally, each hemicord still displays rhythmic locomotor related burst activity, but now fin and myotomal <b>motoneurons</b> become active in-phase. The out-of-phase activation of fin <b>motoneurons</b> persists only when at least three segments are left intact in the rostral part of the spinal cord. Proper coordination of fin <b>motoneurons</b> thus requires input from contralateral rostral segments. We show that commissural excitatory interneurons with long descending axons, previously reported to be active in phase with their ipsilateral myotomal <b>motoneurons,</b> provide monosynaptic excitation to contralateral fin <b>motoneurons.</b> Together, these results strongly indicate that, although myotomal <b>motoneurons</b> receive their phasic excitation from ipsilateral excitatory interneurons, fin <b>motoneurons</b> are mainly driven from the contralateral segmental network during bilateral locomotor activity. However, during unilateral bursting, fin and myotomal <b>motoneurons</b> instead receive a common input, which is apparently masked during normal fictive swimming.

Interestingly, the input resistance as well as the slope of the frequency-intensity curves of other spinal neurons did not show such differences. Finally, the amplitude of dorsal root-evoked potentials following high-intensity stimulation was significantly smaller in SOD 1 (G 85 R) <b>motoneurons.</b> The superoxide dismutase 1 mutation thus induces specific alterations of the functional properties of <b>motoneurons</b> early in development...|$|R
