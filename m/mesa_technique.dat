40|$|This {{summary report}} is a {{collection}} of four separate progress reports prepared under three contracts, which are all sponsored by the Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Virginia. This report contains the results of investiga-tions into the app- *tion of the maximum entropy method (MEM), a high resolL-ion, frequency and wavenumber estima-tion technique. The report also contains a description of two new, stable, high resolution spectral. estimation tech-niques that is provided in the final report section. Many examples of wavenumber spectral patterns for all investiga-ted techniques are included throughout the report. The maximum entropy method is also known as the maxi-mum entropy spectral analysis (<b>MESA)</b> <b>technique,</b> and both names are used in the report. Many MEM wavenumber spectral patterns are demonstrated using both simulated and measure...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{study of the}} field and size dependencies of the static fluxon lattice configuration in Bi- 2212 intrinsic Josephson junctions and investigate conditions needed for the formation of a rectangular fluxon lattice required for a high power flux-flow oscillator. We fabricate junctions of different sizes from Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +x and Bi 1. 75 Pb 0. 25 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +x single crystals using the <b>mesa</b> <b>technique</b> and study the Fraunhofer-like modulation of the critical current with magnetic field. The modulation can be divided into three regions depending on the formed fluxon lattice. At low field, no periodic modulation and no ordered fluxon lattice is found. At intermediate fields, modulation with half-flux quantum periodicity due to a triangular lattice is seen. At high fields, the rectangular lattice gives integer flux quantum periodicity. We present these fields in dependence on the sample size and conclude that the transitions between the regions depend only on lambdaJ(Jc) and occur at about 0. 4 and 1. 3 fluxons per lambdaJ, respectively. These numbers are universal for the measured samples and are consistent with performed numerical simulations. Comment: Conference paper LT 2...|$|E
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) is {{well known}} for its large {{potentiality}} for power device applications. SiC presents a high critical electric field, allowing small dimensions and relatively high doping levels, favorable for reduced power losses in the on-state together with high blocking voltage capability. SIC has a wide band-gap, inducing very low intrinsic carrier concentrations even at high temperature. and consequently allows very low leakage currents and off-state pou sr losses. The present paper focuses on problems related to the high voltage capability of SiC components. After dealing with the bulk breakdown voltage of a SiC semi-infinite parallel-plane abrupt junction, a short review of the methods allowing the potential distribution spreading near the periphery of the real junction is given. Some methods have been implemented and the edge-termination protection has been optimized by the way of numerical simulation. This includes equipotential rings, junction termination extension as planar protections, and MESA as an etched-contour periphery. Examples of realizations are given, and electrical characteristics are presented. They show a better capability of the junction termination extension periphery over the <b>MESA</b> <b>technique</b> to reach a 1500 V-blocking voltage objective...|$|E
40|$|The {{off-axis}} {{approach to}} SiC epitaxial growth has not prevented many substrate crystal defects from propagating into SiC epilayers, {{and does not}} permit the realization of SiC heteropolytype devices. This paper reviews recent advancements in SiC epitaxial growth that begin to overcome the above shortcomings for arrays of device-sized mesas patterned into on-axis 4 H/ 6 HSiC wafers. These on-axis <b>mesa</b> growth <b>techniques</b> have produced 4 H/ 6 H-SiC homoepilayers and 3 C-SiC heteroepilayers with substantially lower dislocation densities. The results should enable improved homojunction and heterojunction silicon carbide prototype devices...|$|R
40|$|Homoepitaxial CVD {{growth of}} thin lateral {{cantilevers}} {{emanating from the}} edges of mesa patterns dry-etched into on-axis commercial 4 H-SiC substrates prior to growth is reported. Cantilevers {{on the order of}} a micrometer thick extending tens of micrometers from the edge of a mesa have been grown. The termination of vertically propagating screw dislocations, including a micropipe, that are overgrown by the cantilevers has been demonstrated, in large part because the crystal structure of the cantilevers is established laterally from the <b>mesa</b> sidewalls. This <b>technique</b> could help reduce performance-degrading dislocations in SiC electrical devices...|$|R
40|$|We report {{detailed}} {{results on}} the temperature dependence and thermal stability of the planar-integrated enhancement/depletion-mode (E/D-mode) AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). Compared to the standard <b>mesa</b> etching <b>technique,</b> the plasma treatment can achieve the same device isolation results. The E/D-mode HEMTs and the corresponding digital integrated circuits fabricated by the planar process exhibit stable operation from room temperature up to 350 degrees C. No degradation in device performance was observed after a 140 -h thermal stress at 350 degrees C, implying excellent thermal stability of the planar process. The direct-coupled FET logic inverter, realized by planar-integration of ED-mode HEMTs, presents larger noise margins (NMs) at high temperatures than the previously reported work, demonstrating promising potential for GaN-based high-temperature digital ICs. The NM improvement {{can be attributed to}} the higher threshold voltage and the improved gate turn-on voltage of the E-mode HEMTs that is achieved with larger plasma treatment dose.

40|$|Narrow {{conducting}} channels {{have been}} fabricated {{in the two}} dimensional electron gas in a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure, using a recently developed shallow <b>mesa</b> etch <b>technique.</b> Four terminal high field magnetoresistance measurements at temperatures down to 2 K have been performed on samples with etched width between 8 µm and 0. 5 µm. The Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are studied, and clear evidence is presented for magnetic depopulation of 1 -dimensional subbands. The data for the 0. 5 µm wide channel are in satisfactory agreement with a simple analysis based on a parabolic confinement potential. Large sidewall depletion effects are found, in agreement with our recent analysis of the weak field negative magnetoresistance. We also observe irregular structure in the magnetoresistance. The dependence of the effects on {{the orientation of the}} magnetic field shows that the magnetoresistance arises from the orbital motion of the 2 -dimensional electrons. The magnitude and typical field scales of the aperiodic structure are in agreement with predictions based on the theory of universal conductance fluctuations. ...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{effects are}} already {{important}} in currently operating interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Planned upgrades of these detectors involve increasing optical power to combat quantum shot noise. We consider {{the ramifications of}} this increased power for one particular class of laser beams [...] wide, flat-topped, mesa beams. In particular we model a single mesa beam Fabry-Perot cavity having thermoelastically deformed mirrors. We calculate the intensity profile of the fundamental cavity eigenmode {{in the presence of}} thermal perturbations, and the associated changes in thermal noise. We also outline an idealized method of correcting for such effects. At each stage we contrast our results with those of a comparable Gaussian beam cavity. Although we focus on <b>mesa</b> beams the <b>techniques</b> described are applicable to any azimuthally symmetric system...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} great {{interest}} in using ion implantation for III-V semiconductor device isolation {{as an alternative to}} <b>mesa</b> isolation <b>technique.</b> This is attributed to several advantages that implant isolation has over mesa isolation. Mesa isolation exhibits problems such as over/under etching, repeatability issue of etching depth and nonplanarity of the surface of the semiconductor. However implant isolation is advantageous as the surface planarity is maintained and in general, less intrusion under the mask edges is observed. This thesis presents a study on the isolation of both n and p-type InP and InGaAs layers and n-type InGaAsP layers by ion implantation. Several different ion species such as protons, helium, nitrogen and iron were used to isolate these materials. The n and p-type layers were grown by Solid Source Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Conductive n-type InP layers were also formed using multiple energy silicon implantation to create a uniform dopant distribution throughout the n-type region. The effects of ion mass, implantation temperature, damage accumulation, initial carrier concentration of the conductive layer and post-implant annealing temperature were investigated in detail through electrical and structural characterisation. The major part of the work was to develop recipes for the isolation of the individual InP, InGaAs and InGaAsP layers. The effects of implantation temperature and dose were also examined thoroughly. A parallel resistor model was also created to confirm the reliability of the measurements...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{absence of}} the vas deferens or other unbeatable forms of obstructive {{azoospermia}} may be successfully overcome by microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) as described by Silber. Thanks {{to the introduction of}} sperm microinjection techniques (ICSI), the results of MESA have been improved and pregnancies have been reported also in cases with testicular failure, employing sperm retrieved from the testicular parenchyma (TESE). The steps of <b>MESA</b> and TESE <b>techniques,</b> including the laboratory section of ICSI are shown in detail in the video. The standard approach of MESA with tubule micropuncture is illustrated. This technique, which employs a glass micropipet with a cutting tip, allows a bloodless sperm retrieval. We have also recently developed a minimally invasive approach of MESA under local anaesthesia, performed through a small "window" scrota! incision, without delivering the testis through the scrotum. Total count of sperm retrieved are comparable to the standard technique, but the patient can be immediately discharged. In selected cases the procedure may be preceded by the endoscopie exploration of the whole epididymis. TESE was performed on azoospermic patients with testicular failure (Sertoli Cells Only Syndrome, maturation arrest). In the procedure, multiple biopsies are taken from both testes and the specimen obtained are processed for sperm extraction. The interesting case of a man with azoospermia due to severe tubular fibrosis and maturation arrest is presented No mature germ cells were visible in the diagnostic testicular biopsy. However, with TESE a total of 200 sperms were retrieved and 4 good quality embryos developed after ICSI. This confirms the possibility of fertilization in cases so far considered absolutely infertile...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} demonstration of a new technique for the fabrication of well-defined quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate, for potential applications such as quantum computation in coupled quantum dots. Hall characterisation was performed on double-gated mesaMetal-Oxide- Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, {{for the purpose of}} silicon quantum dots in etched nanowires on SOI. Carrier density and mobility results are presented, demonstrating top- and backgate control over the two inversion layers created at the upper and lower surfaces of the superficial silicon <b>mesa.</b> A new <b>technique</b> is developed enabling effective depletion gating of quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate. A lower layer of aluminium gates is defined using electron beam lithography; the surface of these gates is oxidised using a plasma oxidation technique; and a further layer of aluminium gates is deposited. The lower gates form tunable tunnel barriers in the narrow inversion layer channel created by the upper MOSFET gate. The two layers of gates are electrically isolated by the localised layer of aluminium oxide. Low-temperature transport spectroscopy has been performed in both the many electron (&# 8764; 100 electrons) and the few electron (&# 8764; 10 electrons) regimes. Excited states in the bias spectroscopy provide evidence of quantum confinement. Preliminary temperature and magnetic field dependence data are presented. These results demonstrate that depletion gates are an effective technique for defining quantum dots in silicon. Furthermore, the demonstration of the first silicon radio-frequency single electron transistor is reported. The island is again defined by electrostatically tunable tunnel barriers in a narrow channel field effect transistor. Charge sensitivities of better than 10 &# 956;e/&# 8730;Hz are demonstrated at MHz bandwidth. These results establish that silicon may be used to fabricate fast, sensitive electrometers...|$|R
