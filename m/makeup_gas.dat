5000|$|The {{electron}} capture detector {{is used for}} detecting electron-absorbing components (high electronegativity) such as halogenated compounds in the output stream of a gas chromatograph. The ECD uses a radioactive beta particle (electron) emitter {{in conjunction with a}} so-called <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flowing through the detector chamber. The electron emitter typically consists of a metal foil holding 10 millicuries (370 MBq) of the radionuclide [...] Usually, nitrogen is used as <b>makeup</b> <b>gas,</b> because it exhibits a low excitation energy, so it is easy to remove an electron from a nitrogen molecule. The electrons emitted from the electron emitter collide with the molecules of the <b>makeup</b> <b>gas,</b> resulting in many more free electrons. The electrons are accelerated towards a positively charged anode, generating a current. There is therefore always a background signal present in the chromatogram. As the sample is carried into the detector by the carrier gas, electron-absorbing analyte molecules capture electrons and thereby reduce the current between the collector anode and a cathode. The analyte concentration is thus proportional to the degree of {{electron capture}}. ECD detectors are particularly sensitive to halogens, organometallic compounds, nitriles, or nitro compounds.|$|E

40|$|Composting is an {{alternative}} method of animal mortality disposal suitable for on-farm emergency containment of infectious diseases. Mortality composting can produce a complex variety of gases {{and some of them}} are known to be odorous. To date, relatively little is known about the makeup and temporal trends of organic gases and odors produced and emitted during composting processes. In this research, utilizing gas characterization for monitoring of the composting process was investigated. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and odors produced during composting of three carcass cover materials (corn stalks, oat straw and corn silage) were qualitatively studied at a laboratory scale set-up. Headspace samples were analyzed with multidimensional gas chromatography - mass spectrometry – olfactometry (MDGC-MS-O). Headspaces of decaying plant materials were tested using 85 µm Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) SPME fiber. Aerobic and anaerobic conditions representing extremes of composting conditions were simulated to determine if composition of the gaseous byproducts can be used to evaluate aeration effectiveness. Volatile fatty acids (acetic, propanoic, isobutyic, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, hexanoic and heptanoic) were found as indicators of anaerobic decomposition of corn stalks and oat straw. The chemical <b>makeup</b> of <b>gas</b> and odor emissions was observed to decrease with compost age and was different for aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Chemical makeup and temporal trends in specific VOCs can be useful in non-invasive and indirect determination of the aeration status and completion of the composting process inside the biosecurity containment...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{precision}} and accuracy of in situ Nd isotope analyses in geological samples, high analytical sensitivity and minimized non-linear mass dependent fractionation are desirable. In this study, we investigated the effects of three different cone combinations {{and the addition of}} N 2 with the guard electrode, either grounded or floating, on the performance of Nd isotope analyses. Signal enhancements (2. 5 - 3 folds) were observed for the Jet sample cone + X skimmer cone and for the standard sample cone + X skimmer cone, which were compared to those of the standard sample cone + H skimmer cone with the addition of N 2 at 3 or 6 ml min- 1. The influence of a guard electrode on the LA-MC-ICP-MS sensitivity was minimal for dry plasma conditions but became significant in the presence of N 2. The addition of 3 or 6 ml min- 1 N 2 into the carrier gas increased the sensitivity for Nd by a factor of 1. 6 with the GE-on mode for the Jet sample cone + X skimmer cone. However, in the GE-off mode, the addition of 2 - 3 ml min- 1 N 2 decreased the signal intensity of Nd by a factor of two to three. The <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the mass bias stability of Nd isotopes, and this effect was different for different cone combinations. To stabilize the mass bias, measurements at elevated <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates was required for the combination of the X skimmer cone with the standard sample cone or Jet sample cone, at the expense of sensitivity. In notable contrast, the mass bias was stable for the combination of the standard sample cone and H skimmer cone under their corresponding optimum <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates. However, we found that the neodymium isotopes exhibited a large non-linear component at elevated <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates that could not be corrected by the accepted mass fractionation laws. The addition of 3 - 6 ml min- 1 nitrogen to the central gas flow in laser ablation MC-ICP-MS was found to not only significantly enlarge the mass bias stability zone, but also to suppress the non-linear mass dependent fractionation for the combination of X skimmer cone with Jet sample cone or standard sample cone. The accuracy and precision of the developed analytical method for Nd isotope using Jet sample cone + X skimmer cone with the addition of nitrogen has been demonstrated by analyzing a series of reference glasses (JNdi- 1 glass, LREE glass, NIST 610) and minerals (apatite, monazite and titanite). Results obtained for 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios in these reference materials are in excellent agreement with published values, demonstrating the capability of the developed analytical method to be an important tool for providing high-quality in situ Nd isotope data in geological samples.

40|$|This liquid/gas {{separator}} {{provides the}} basis for a first stage of a fuel cell product water/oxygen gas phase separator. It can separate liquid and gas in bulk in multiple gravity environments. The system separates fuel cell product water entrained with circulating oxygen gas from the outlet of a fuel cell stack before allowing the gas to return to the fuel cell stack inlet. Additional <b>makeup</b> oxygen <b>gas</b> is added either before or after the separator to account for the gas consumed in the fuel cell power plant. A large volume is provided upstream of porous material in the separator to allow for the collection of water that does not exit the separator with the outgoing oxygen gas. The water then can be removed as it continues to collect, so that the accumulation of water does not impede the separating action of the device. The system is designed with a series of tubes of the porous material configured into a shell-and-tube heat exchanger configuration. The two-phase fluid stream to be separated enters the shell-side portion of the device. Gas flows to the center passages of the tubes through the porous material and is then routed to a common volume {{at the end of the}} tubes by simple pressure difference from a pumping device. Gas flows through the porous material of the tubes with greater ease as a function of the ratio of the dynamic viscosity of the water and gas. By careful selection of the dimensions of the tubes (wall thickness, porosity, diameter, length of the tubes, number of the tubes, and tube-to-tube spacing in the shell volume) a suitable design can be made to match the magnitude of water and gas flow, developed pressures from the oxygen reactant pumping device, and required residual water inventory for the shellside volume...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{compact device}} based on purge-and-trap multicapillary gas {{chromatography}} {{was developed for}} sensitive species-selective analysis of methylmercury and Hg 2 + by atomic spectrometry.

Developments regarding each of {{the steps of the}} analytical procedure and effects of operational variables (sample volume, purge flow, trap temperature, separation conditions) are discussed. The device allows speciation of MeHg+ and Hg 2 + down to 5 pg g- 1 in urine and, after a rapid microwave-assisted hydrolysis, down to 0. 1 ng g- 1 in solid biological samples with a throughput of 6 samples/h.

40|$|The sulfur isotope is an {{important}} geochemical tracer in diverse fields of geosciences. In this study, the effects of three different cone combinations {{with the addition of}} N 2 on the performance of in situ S isotope analyses were investigated in detail. The signal intensities of S isotopes were improved by a factor of 2. 3 and 3. 6 using the X skimmer cone combined with the standard sample cone or the Jet sample cone, respectively, compared with the standard arrangement (skimmer cone combined with the standard sample cone). This signal enhancement is important for the improvement of the precision and accuracy of in situ S isotope analysis at high spatial resolution. Different cone combinations {{have a significant effect on}} the mass bias and mass bias stability for S isotopes. Poor precisions of S isotope ratios were obtained using the Jet and X cones combination at their corresponding optimum <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow when using Ar plasma only. The addition of 4 -ml min- 1 nitrogen to the central gas flow in laser ablation MC-ICP-MS was found to significantly enlarge the mass bias stability zone at their corresponding optimum <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow in these three different cone combinations. The polyatomic interferences of OO, SH, OOH were also significantly reduced, and the interference free plateaus of sulfur isotopes became broader and flatter in the nitrogen mode (N 2 = 4 ml min- 1). However, the signal intensity of S was not increased by the addition of nitrogen in this study. The laser fluence and ablation mode had significant effects on sulfur isotope fractionation during the analysis of sulfides and elemental sulfur by laser ablation MC-ICP-MS. The matrix effect among different sulfides and elemental sulfur was observed, but could be significantly reduced by line scan ablation in preference to single spot ablation under the optimized fluence. It is recommended that the d 90 values of the particles in pressed powder pellets for accurate and precise S isotope analysis should be less than 10 3 ̆bcm.

40|$|Vacuum-outlet {{operation}} of short fused-silica open tubular columns for gas chromatography provides benefits to analysis speed {{by increasing the}} optimum velocity while minimizing the loss in resolution. Vacuum-outlet {{operation of}} a column with a gas chromatographic detector necessitates that the detector also be under vacuum. Simple modifications were made to a gas chromatograph-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) for vacuum-inlet and vacuum-outlet operation. The vacuum-inlet system was operated in the splitless mode to allow for efficient sample loading prior to operation at reduced pressures. The goal of FID operation at 100 torr or less was achieved by using oxygen in place of air and optimizing the gas flows under vacuum to maintain a stable flame at pressures as low as 46 torr. An outlet pressure of 85 torr with optimized gas flows allowed for routine operation of the FID without solvent flame-out. It was discovered that the sensitivity is enhanced compared to atmospheric operation over a range of outlet pressures from approximately 200 to 400 torr; however, operation of the FID at the lowest possible pressures decreases the analytical sensitivity due to both the outlet pressure {{and the absence of}} helium <b>makeup</b> <b>gas...</b>|$|E

An original GC-ECD method using N- 2 as carrier gas was improved by introducing a small flow rate of CO 2 <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> into the ECD, which could well remedy the above defects. The N 2 O signal of the improved method was 4 -fold higher than that of the original method and the relative standard deviation was reduced from > 1 % to 0. 31 %. N 2 O concentrations with different CO 2 concentrations (172. 2 x 10 (- 6) - 1722 x 10 (- 6) mol/mol) measured by the improved GC-ECD method were in line with the actual N 2 O concentrations. However, the N 2 O concentrations detected by the original method were largely biased with a variation range of - 4. 5 %similar to 7 %. The N 2 O fluxes between an agricultural field and the atmosphere measured by the original method were greatly overestimated in comparison with those measured by the improved method. Good linear correlation (R- 2 = 0. 9996) between the response of the improved ECD and N 2 O concentrations (93 x 10 (- 9) - 1966 x 10 (- 9) mol/mol) indicated that atmospheric N 2 O could be accurately quantified via a single standard gas.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{different}} cone combinations {{on the performance of}} laser ablation MC-ICP-MS (Neptune plus) for the in situ Hf isotope analysis of zircon were investigated. The signal sensitivities of Hf, Yb and Lu were improved by a factor of 1. 4 and 2. 5, respectively, with using the X skimmer cone + standard sampler cone and the X skimmer cone + Jet sample cone compared to the standard arrangement (H skimmer cone + standard sample cone). However, when using the high-sensitivity Jet sample cone, the instrumental mass fractionation for hafnium displayed a large non-linear component that could not be corrected using the normal mass fractionation laws. The magnitude of this non-linear mass fractionation was strongly related to the central gas flow rate. The in situ Hf isotope analysis of zircon standards 91500 and Mud Tank using the Jet cone displayed large deviations (4102 ̆ 013470 ppm) at the optimum central gas flow rate for Hf, which seriously deteriorated the performance of the Jet cone. The addition of 4 ml min 2 ̆ 2129 nitrogen to the central gas flow in laser ablation MC-ICP-MS was found to not only increase the sensitivity of Hf by a factor of 2. 1, but also suppress this non-linear mass fractionation. The determined Yb/Hf and Lu/Hf ratios at their corresponding optimum <b>makeup</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates for Hf intensity were found to be reduced by factors of 2 and 1. 3 in the presence of nitrogen, respectively, which would benefit the accurate in situ determination of Hf isotopes in high-content Yb and Lu samples. Compared to the standard arrangement, the corresponding precision (23 ̆c 3) of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf for single spot analysis of zircon standard 91500 was improved from 224 ppm to 50 ppm by using the newly designed X-skimmer cone and Jet sample cone in combination with the nitrogen addition technique. The determined 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios are in excellent agreement with published values in five reference zircon standards (91500, GJ- 1, Mud Tank, Penglai and Ple 1 ̆ 61 ovice). Our first Hf isotopic results from zircon standard M 257 (0. 281544 1 0. 000018; 2 SD, n = 151) showed that it was fairly homogeneous in Hf isotopes.
