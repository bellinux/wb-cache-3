5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus {{is defined as the}} energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{strongly}} {{a material}} opposes {{the flow of}} electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
5|$|The crucial {{property}} {{turns out}} to be treewidth, a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> tree-like the graph is. For a graph G of treewidth at most k and a graph H, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |V(H)|O(k) with a standard dynamic programming approach. In fact, it is enough to assume that the core of G has treewidth at most k. This holds even if the core is not known.|$|E

50|$|Problems {{related to}} <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> {{usability}} include {{the fact that}} <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> learning and retention <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to use an interface are rarely employed and some studies treat <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> users interact with interfaces as synonymous with quality-in-use, despite an unclear relation.|$|R
40|$|We develop two simple <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much {{inequality}} {{is explained}} by individual population characteristics or groups of characteristics, analogous to R 2 in regression analysis.

5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone {{with at least}} tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was {{not as strong as}} that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> closely the two sequences are related.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Though {{trust and}} {{reputation}} {{systems have been}} extensively studied, general architectural commonalities between the two have received little attention. In this paper, we present a life cycle model of reputation and trust systems, along with accompanying <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much effect signaling and sanctioning have on a given system. We map reputation attacks within our framework and apply our framework to an online auction model. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} Turing degree is {{fundamental}} in computability theory, where sets of natural numbers are often regarded as decision problems.

We present a family of structural conditions that both imply tractability and capture some of the established benchmark domains.

These scaling laws of physical phenomena should have correlates in perceptual mechanisms that have evolved to transduce them.
