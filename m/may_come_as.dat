500|$|The End of the Road is in a {{realistic}} style that <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> {{a surprise to}} those familiar only with Barth's later books. [...] The narrator avoids naturalistic descriptions of his surroundings, and most other details, and describes the physical aspects of life (especially of women) with disgust or contempt. [...] He indulges in occasional bursts of eloquence: [...] "A turning down of dinner damped, in ways subtle past knowing, manic keys on the flute of me, least pressed of all, which for a moment had shrilled me rarely". [...] The realism is not a conventional everyday realism: the situations themselves are fantastic, though plausible.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is also a}} repeating binary {{fraction}} 0.0... It <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> {{a surprise}} that terminating decimal fractions can have repeating expansions in binary. It {{is for this reason}} that many are surprised to discover that 0.1 + ... + 0.1, (10 additions) differs from 1 in floating point arithmetic. In fact, the only binary fractions with terminating expansions are of the form of an integer divided by a power of 2, which 1/10 is not.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{difficulty}} whatsoever in obtaining models of static spherically symmetric stellar models, {{in which a}} perfect fluid interior is matched across a spherical surface, {{the surface of the}} star, to a vacuum exterior which is in fact a region of the Schwarzschild vacuum. [...] In fact, it is possible to write down all these static stellar models in a way which makes clear that they exist in plenitude. [...] Given this success, it <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a nasty shock that it seems to be very difficult, mathematically speaking, to construct rotating stellar models in which a perfect fluid interior is matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. [...] This observation is the basis of the most prominent technical objection to the notion of asymptotic flatness in general relativity.|$|E

60|$|We see, then, {{that there}} is an {{intimate}} connection between the two subjects--human associations in the colouring of flowers and in the voices of birds; and that in both cases this association constitutes, or is a principal element in, the expression. This connection, {{and the fact that the}} present subject was suggested and appeared almost an inevitable outcome of the one last discussed, must be my excuse for introducing a chapter on flowers in a book on birds--or birds and man. But an excuse is hardly needed. It must strike most readers that a great fault of books on birds is, {{that there is}} too much about birds in them, consequently that a chapter about something else, which has not exactly been dragged in, <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> a positive relief.|$|E
60|$|Christ {{may come}} to us when our {{thoughts}} are cleaving to the ground, and ready to grow earthy of the earth--through noble poetry, noble music, noble art--through aught which awakens once more in us the instinct of the true, the beautiful, and the good.

Or He <b>may</b> <b>come,</b> <b>as</b> He comes on winter nights to many a gallant soul--not in the repose of Nature, but in her rage--in howling storm and blinding foam and ruthless rocks and whelming surge--and whisper to them even so--as the sea swallows all of them which it can take--of calm beyond, which this world cannot give and cannot take away.|$|E
6000|$|To the wit of Lethington we may plausibly {{attribute}} {{a proposal}} which, on October 25, Knox submitted to Croft. {159} It was that England should lend 1000 {{men for the}} attack on the Regent in Leith. Peace with France need not be broken, for the men <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> private adventurers, and England may denounce them as rebels. Croft declined this proposal as dishonourable, and as too clearly a breach of treaty. Knox replied that he had communicated Croft's letter [...] "to such as partly induced me before to write" [...] (October 29). Very probably Lethington suggested the idea, leaving the burden of its proposal on Knox. Dr. M'Crie says that it is a solitary case of the Reformer's recommending dissimulation; but the proceeding was in keeping with Knox's previous statements {{about the nature of the}} terms made in July; with the protestations of loyalty; with the lie given to Mary of Guise when she spoke, on the whole, the plain truth; and generally with the entire conduct of the prophet and of the Congregation. Dr. M'Crie justly remarks that Knox [...] "found it difficult to preserve integrity and Christian simplicity amidst the crooked wiles of political intrigue." ...|$|E

60|$|The State {{would provide}} {{these things for}} its citizen {{as though it was}} his right to require them; he would receive as a {{shareholder}} in the common enterprise and not with any insult of charity. But on the other hand it will require that the citizen who renders the minimum of service for these concessions shall not become a parent until he is established in work at a rate above the minimum, and free of any debt he may have incurred. The State will never press for its debt, nor put a limit to its accumulation so long as a man or woman remains childless; it will not even grudge them temporary spells of good fortune when they may lift their earnings above the minimum wage. It will pension the age of everyone who cares to take a pension, and it will maintain special guest homes for the very old to which they <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> paying guests, spending their pensions there. By such obvious devices it will achieve the maximum elimination of its feeble and spiritless folk in every generation with the minimum of suffering and public disorder.|$|E
60|$|The {{practical}} person, to {{whom this}} <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> {{a new idea}} and who wishes not to waste any time in experiments, would doubtless like to hear how the plan works. He will say that he certainly wants all the happiness to be {{got out of his}} rambles, {{but it is clear that}} without the book in his pocket he would miss many interesting things: Would the greater degree of pleasure experienced in the others be a sufficient compensation? I should say that he would gain more than he would lose; that vivid interest and pleasure in a few things is preferable to that fainter, more diffused feeling experienced in the other case. Again, we have to take into account the value to us of the mental pictures gathered in our wanderings. For we know that only when a scene is viewed emotionally, when it produces in us a shock of pleasure, does it become a permanent possession of the mind; in other words, it registers an image which, when called up before the inner eye, is capable of reproducing a measure of the original delight.|$|E
6000|$|SIR, Your Billingsgate Muse methinks does begin With {{much greater}} noise than a {{conjugal}} din. A pox of her bawling, her tempora et mores! What are times now to me; a'nt I {{one of the}} Tories? You tell me my verses disturb you at prayers; Oh, oh, Mr. Dean, are you there with your bears? You pray, I suppose, like a Heathen, to Phoebus, To give his assistance to make out my rebus: Which I don't think so fair; leave it off for the future; When the combat is equal, this God should be neuter. I'm now at the tavern, where I drink all I can, To write with more spirit; I'll drink no more Helicon; For Helicon is water, and water is weak; 'Tis wine on the gross lee, that makes your Muse speak. This I know by her spirit and life; but I think She's much in the wrong to scold in her drink. Her damn'd pointed tongue pierced almost to my heart; Tell me of a cart,--tell me of a ----, I'd have you to tell on both sides her ears, If she comes to my house, that I'll kick her down stairs: Then home she shall limping go, squalling out, O my knee; You shall soon have a crutch to buy for your Melpomene. You <b>may</b> <b>come</b> <b>as</b> her bully, to bluster and swagger; But my ink is my poison, my pen is my dagger: Stand off, I desire, and mark what I say to you, If you come I will make your Apollo shine through you.

40|$|Hölderlin’s {{interest}} in Geography is not widely known and <b>may</b> <b>came</b> <b>as</b> {{a surprise to}} some readers of his works. Hölderlin’s writing is more commonly associated with idealism and spiritual themes rather than with scientific positivism. However, many of Hölderlin’s Poems and his Novel Hyperion describe geographic features such as rivers, mountains, landscapes and cityscapes. Hölderlin, {{like many of his}} generation, was inspired by the recent discovery of new Worlds and Lands, and fascinated by the descriptions of new Civilizations and Cultures, which opened up new horizons for the old Europe. This paper analyses some of Hölderlin’s own landscape descriptions and reveals the importance of places in his works and the impact of new geographic discoveries on his writing generally...|$|R
