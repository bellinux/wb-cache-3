25|$|Blowfish's key {{schedule}} starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values {{derived from}} the hexadecimal digits of pi, which contain no obvious pattern (see nothing up <b>my</b> <b>sleeve</b> number). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P1 and P2. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P3 and P4. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.|$|E
500|$|Writer Rob LaZebnik {{told the}} New York Post that the episode was {{inspired}} by his son Johnny, who came out as gay while at high school: [...] "I am a Midwestern guy, so I don’t tend to wear my emotions on <b>my</b> <b>sleeve,</b> but I thought, 'What better way to tell my son I love him than to write a cartoon about it?'". He added that he pitched the storyline three years earlier, and got approval for his script from his son. Smithers' coming out is low-key, as was Johnny's; he told the Post that as he was [...] "the gayest little kid", his parents were not surprised by his sexual orientation. The episode aired five days before Johnny's 22nd birthday, {{and he said he}} would have a viewing party because the episode would be [...] "particularly meaningful" [...] to him. The elder LaZebnik stated his opinion that LGBT-related television can have a [...] "real impact on people's thinking".|$|E
