40|$|The microtubule-targeting maytansinoids {{accumulate}} in cells and induce mitotic arrest at 250 - to 1000 -fold lower concentrations than those required for {{their association with}} tubulin or microtubules. To identify the mechanisms of this intracellular accumulation and exceptional cytotoxicity of maytansinoids we studied interaction of a highly cytotoxic <b>maytansinoid,</b> S-methyl DM 1 and several other maytansinoids with cells. S-methyl DM 1 accumulated inside the cells with a markedly higher apparent affinity than to tubulin or microtubules. The apparent affinities of maytansinoids correlated with their cytotoxicities. The number of intracellular binding sites for S-methyl DM 1 in MCF 7 cells was comparable {{to the number of}} tubulin molecules per cell (~ 4 - 6 × 10 (7) copies). Efflux of 3 [H]-S-methyl DM 1 from cells was enhanced in the presence of an excess of non-labeled S-methyl DM 1, indicating that re-binding of 3 [H]-S-methyl DM 1 to intracellular binding sites contributed to its intracellular retention. Liposomes loaded with non-polymerized tubulin recapitulated the apparent high-affinity association of S-methyl DM 1 to cells. We propose a model for the intracellular accumulation of maytansinoids in which molecules of the compounds diffuse into a cell and associate with tubulin. Affinities of maytansinoids for individual tubulin molecules are weak, but the high intracellular concentration of tubulin favors, after dissociation of a compound-tubulin complex, their re-binding to a tubulin molecule, or to a tip of a microtubule in the same cell, over their efflux. As a result, a significant fraction of microtubule tips is occupied with a <b>maytansinoid</b> when added to cells at sub-nanomolar concentrations, inducing mitotic arrest and cell death...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of immunostimulatory agents with cytotoxic drugs {{is emerging as}} a promising approach for potentially curative tumor therapy, but advances in this field are hindered by the requirement of testing individual combination partners as single agents in dedicated clinical studies, often with suboptimal efficacy. Here, we describe {{for the first time}} a novel multipayload class of targeted drugs, the immunocytokine-drug conjugates (IDC), which combine a tumor-homing antibody, a cytotoxic drug, and a proinflammatory cytokine in the same molecular entity. In particular, the IL 2 cytokine and the disulfide-linked <b>maytansinoid</b> DM 1 microtubular inhibitor could be coupled to the F 8 antibody, directed against the alternatively spliced EDA domain of fibronectin, in a site-specific manner, yielding a chemically defined product with selective tumor-homing performance and potent anticancer activity in vivo, as tested in two different immunocompetent mouse models...|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} consideration is {{the limited number}} of payload molecules that can be efficiently delivered into target cells. Only 1.56 % of administered drug molecules can enter target cells if the efficiency of each step in the ADC mechanism is assumed to be 50 % (biodistribution, binding to antigen, internalization, release of payload, intracellular stability of payload, and payload binding to target) (Teicher and Chari, 2011). Indeed, the actual uptake is estimated to be much lower than this assumption (< 0.01 % injected dose per gram of tumor) (Sedlacek et al., 1992). Thus, to maximize treatment efficacy using ADCs, cytotoxic potency of payload is required to be high enough to effectively eradicate target cells, ideally in the picomolar range. While important to select highly potent toxic agents as payload, ideal agents have inherent selectivity for target cancer cells. Certain types of noncancerous cells may be capable of internalizing ADCs through nonspecific pinocytosis or fragment crystallizable (Fc) region receptor-mediated endocytosis (Lencer and Blumberg, 2005). Furthermore, payload may be released upon degradation into circulating blood. Thus, payloads have primarily been selected based on the above-mentioned consideration; antimitotic agents, which are generally less toxic to noncancerous cells than to cancerous cells, are payloads that have been mainly used in the FDA-approved ADCs and ADCs in clinical trials. In addition to calicheamicins (used in Mylotarg®), auristatins (used in Adcetris®), and <b>maytansinoids</b> (used in Kadcyla®), new classes of highly potent antimitotic compounds have also been explored for ADC payloads: duocarmycins, pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers (PBDs), amanitins, and tubulysin analogs are such examples (Chari et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2014).|$|R

The potential curability of non-Hodgkin lymphoma differs among the various histologic subtypes and is associated in part with the stage at presentation. CD 19 antigen is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin Ig superfamily. CD 19 is specifically expressed in normal and neoplastic B-cells. Recent study showed that in a mouse model, CD 19 and c-Myc synergize functionally to accelerate B-cell lymphomagenesis, which is associated with increased disease severity. Specificity {{is the most important}} challenge in cancer therapeutics. Antibody–drug conjugates have the prospect of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy over unconjugated monoclonal antibodies through the selective delivery of cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. The ubiquitous expression of CD 19 in these tumors, especially at an earlier stage and the property of efficient internalization, makes CD 19 an attractive and affective target for antibody–drug conjugate therapy as compared to CD 20. SAR 3419 (huB 4 -DM 4) is a novel antibody–drug conjugate that is composed of a humanized monoclonal IgG 1 anti-CD 19 antibody (huB 4) attached to the potent cytotoxic drug, a maytansine derivative (DM 4), through a cleavable disulfide cross-linking agent N-Succinimidyl- 4 - 2 -pyridyldithio butanoic acid (SPDB). The preclinical efficacy of maytansine derivative–anti-CD 19 conjugate was demonstrated in our laboratory, and SAR 3419 was found to be more effective than CHOP in a xenograft model.

This is a rare case in which the genes involved in the formation of a secondary metabolite are dispersed in separate regions in an Actinomycete. A set of genes, asm 22 – 24, asm 43 – 45, and asm 47, was identified for the biosynthesis of the starter unit, 3 -amino- 5 -hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA).

Ansamitocin P 3 potently inhibited the proliferation of MCF- 7, HeLa, EMT- 6 /AR 1 and MDA-MB- 231 cells in culture with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 20 ± 3, 50 ± 0. 5, 140 ± 17, and 150 ± 1. 1 pM, respectively. Ansamitocin P 3 strongly depolymerized both interphase and mitotic microtubules and perturbed chromosome segregation at its proliferation inhibitory concentration range. Treatment of ansamitocin P 3 activated spindle checkpoint surveillance proteins, Mad 2 and BubR 1 and blocked the cells in mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Subsequently, cells underwent apoptosis via p 53 mediated apoptotic pathway. Further, ansamitocin P 3 was found to bind to purified tubulin in vitro with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1. 3 ± 0. 7 µM. The binding of ansamitocin P 3 induced conformational changes in tubulin. A docking analysis suggested that ansamitocin P 3 may bind partially to vinblastine binding site on tubulin in two different positions.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN 853) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets FRα for tumor-directed delivery of the <b>maytansinoid</b> DM 4, a potent agent that induces mitotic arrest by suppressing microtubule dynamics. Here, combinations of IMGN 853 with approved therapeutics were evaluated in preclinical models of EOC. Combinations of IMGN 853 with carboplatin or doxorubicin resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects in the IGROV- 1 ovarian cancer cell line in vitro. IMGN 853 potentiated the cytotoxic activity of carboplatin via growth arrest and augmented DNA damage; cell cycle perturbations were also observed in cells treated with the IMGN 853 /doxorubicin combination. These benefits translated into improved antitumor activity in patient-derived xenograft models in vivo in both the platinum-sensitive (IMGN 853 /carboplatin) and platinum-resistant (IMGN 853 /pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) settings. IMGN 853 co-treatment also improved the in vivo efficacy of bevacizumab in platinum-resistant EOC models, with combination regimens causing significant regressions and complete responses in the majority of tumor-bearing mice. Histological analysis of OV- 90 ovarian xenograft tumors revealed that concurrent administration of IMGN 853 and bevacizumab caused rapid disruption of tumor microvasculature and extensive necrosis, underscoring the superior bioactivity profile of the combination regimen. Overall, these demonstrations of combinatorial benefit conferred by the addition of the first FRα-targeting ADC to established therapies provide a compelling framework for the potential application of IMGN 853 in the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer...|$|E

The drug molecules are linked to huN 901 through random modification of huN 901 at ɛ-amino groups of lysine residues, thus yielding a heterogeneous population of conjugate species. We studied the drug distribution profile of huN 901 –DM 1 by electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry(ESI-TOFMS), which showed that one to six DM 1 drug molecules were attached to an antibody molecule. Both light and heavy chains contained linked drugs. The conjugation sites in both chains were determined by peptide mapping using trypsin and Asp-N protease digestion. Trypsin digestion identified modified lysine residues, since these residues were no longer susceptible to enzymatic cleavage after conjugation with the drug. With respect to Asp-N digestion, modified peptides were identified by observing a mass increase corresponding to the modification. The two digestion methods provided consistent results, leading to the identification of 20 modified lysine residues in both light and heavy chains. Each lysine residue was only partially modified.

In MM cells, they induced G 2 -M cell cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis associated with cleavage of caspase- 3, caspase- 8, caspase- 9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Nonconjugated nBT 062 completely blocked cytotoxicity induced by nBT 062 -maytansinoid conjugate, confirming that specific binding is required for inducing cytotoxicity. Moreover, nBT 062 -maytansinoid conjugates blocked adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells. The coculture of MM cells with bone marrow stromal cells protects against dexamethasone-induced death but had no effect on the cytotoxicity of immunoconjugates. Importantly, nBT 062 -SPDB-DM 4 and nBT 062 -SPP-DM 1 significantly inhibited MM tumor growth in vivo and prolonged host survival in both the xenograft mouse models of human MM and SCID-hu mouse model. Conclusion: These results provide the preclinical framework supporting evaluation of nBT 062 -maytansinoid derivatives in clinical trials to improve patient outcome in MM...|$|E
40|$|Background IMGN 901 is a CD 56 -targeting antibody-drug {{conjugate}} {{designed for}} tumor-selective {{delivery of the}} cytotoxic <b>maytansinoid</b> DM 1. This phase 1 study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of IMGN 901 in patients with CD 56 -expressing solid tumors. Methods Patients were enrolled in cohorts of escalating IMGN 901 doses, administered intravenously, on 3 consecutive days every 21  days. A dose-expansion phase accrued patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), or ovarian cancer. Results Fifty-two patients were treated at doses escalating from 4 to 94  mg/m(2) /day. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) {{was determined to be}} 75  mg/m(2). Dose-limiting toxicities included fatigue, neuropathy, headache or meningitis-like symptoms, chest pain, dyspnea, and myalgias. In the dose-expansion phase (n =  45), seven patients received 75  mg/m(2) and 38 received 60  mg/m(2) for up to 21  cycles. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP 2 D) was established at 60  mg/m(2) during dose expansion. Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by 96. 9  % of all patients, the majority of which were Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were hyponatremia and dyspnea (each 8. 2  %). Responses included 1 complete response (CR), 1 clinical CR, and 1 unconfirmed partial response (PR) in MCC; and 1 unconfirmed PR in SCLC. Stable disease was seen for 25  % of all evaluable patients who received doses ≥ 60  mg/m(2). Conclusions The RP 2 D for IMGN 901 of 60  mg/m(2) administered for 3 consecutive days every 3  weeks was associated with an acceptable tolerability profile. Objective responses were observed in patients with advanced CD 56 + cancers...|$|E
