25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge.

500|$|Salinger was {{assigned}} to a counter-intelligence division, for which he used his proficiency in French and German to interrogate prisoners of war. In April 1945 he entered a liberated concentration camp, probably one of Dachau's sub-camps. Salinger earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and served in five campaigns. Salinger's experiences in the war affected him emotionally.

Salinger continued to write while serving in the army, publishing several stories in slick magazines such as Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post.

500|$|There was initial {{concern over}} Reeve's stamina for {{shooting}} the scenes, as his particular scene with Welling was six pages long, which translated to approximately twelve {{hours of work}} day. Beeman tried to design everything so it was as simple as possible, but Reeve quickly readjusted the scene. Beeman originally had Welling walk into frame and {{stand in front of}} Reeve, and then make a single move behind Reeve. Beeman was told, by Reeve, the scene needed more dynamic between the characters, and if Welling only made a single move, the dynamic would be lost. According to Reeve, [...] "Tom moving around me will hide the fact that I'm unable to move." [...] Beeman's fear of overstretching Reeve's stamina, because of the added shots to the scene, were put to rest when Reeve himself stated it did not <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it took to finish the scene, as long as it turned out great. Reeve was directing Yankee Irving when Smallville was gearing up to film the fourth season opener. As a result, Reeve could not reprise his role as Dr. Swann, which was the intention.|$|E
500|$|Khaba {{is known}} by his serekh and Golden Horus name only. His Nisut-Bity title and his Nebty name are unknown. Additionally, Khaba {{is one of}} the very few kings from Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom times with an archaeologically proven Gold name, a likely {{predecessor}} to the Golden Horus name, which Khaba may also have introduced. Aside from Khaba, the only kings with Gold names who lived before king Sneferu, founder of the 4th dynasty, were Djer, Den, Nynetjer, Khasekhemwy, and Djoser. From Snefru onward, the Golden Horus name became a fixed royal title to any ruling king, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the king ruled. Khaba's Golden Horus name can be found on several seal impressions, although its correct reading and translation are disputed. Peter Kaplony interprets it as Nub-iret or Nub iret-djedef, though he is unsure whether the syllable djedef was an inherent part of the name or an additional honorary title. Thomas Schneider and Jürgen von Beckerath, in contrast, see Khaba's Golden Horus as Netjer-nub, which means [...] "golden falcon". Khaba's Gold name is the first to show the infinitive form of the royal Gold name.|$|E
500|$|Artists, however, do not {{necessarily}} take geometry literally. As Douglas Hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, Gödel, Escher, Bach, by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: [...] "The difference between an Escher drawing and non-Euclidean geometry {{is that in the}} latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> one stares at the pictures." [...] Hofstadter discusses the seemingly paradoxical lithograph Print Gallery by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a [...] "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" [...] to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical. The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra, who propose that it could contain a Droste effect copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.|$|E

Benard came in for a meeting with Wendy Riche, and the two immediately clicked. It was only a <b>matter</b> of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would take to get Benard on screen. Initially, the character was only supposed to last for six months as Benard was not interested in anything more than a year. Benard revealed that after his stint on All My Children, he was not interested in doing another soap. He joined the cast of General Hospital because he had gone broke and acting was all he knew at the time. The producers offered him two separate roles, that of mobster Damian Smith, with a two-year contract, and that of Sonny. In addition the role being short term, Benard also chose the role because he liked the character's name. Benard revealed that just two weeks after starting work, he suffered a manic depressive breakdown. At one point he had stopped coming in to work but expressed his gratitude to the network for keeping faith in him instead of firing him immediately.|$|R

As Hutton's innings began to assume epic proportions, Verity stayed with him throughout the intervals, helping him to maintain concentration. On the Sunday of the match, when there was no play, Verity arranged for Hutton to have a break by the sea to relax away from cricket. Hutton commented: [...] "I owe [...] the kind of debt that one can never fully repay... His quiet, natural dignity was an immense source of strength to me throughout those long hours". The series was drawn; Verity took 14wickets at an average of 25.28, finishing second in the England bowling averages, behind Bowes. However, Charlie Barnett, who played in the series but disliked Hammond, believed that Hammond's poor tactical use of Verity cost England potential victories in the second and fourth Tests.
