40|$|Ultra Wide-band (UWB) {{is a novel}} {{high-speed}} {{wireless communication}} technology. It is difficult to sample UWB signal directly as its wider band width. Compressed sensing (CS) provides a feasible way with under-sampling. However, existing CS-UWB channel estimation method must be used {{on the assumption that}} channel sparsity is known. In order to solve this problem, an UWB channel estimation method based on Bayesian Compressed Sensing (BCS) theory is proposed in this paper. BCS introduces Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) theory into CS. It sets posterior probability density function controlled by hyperparameters to each value of the object vector. In updating process, hyperparameters corresponding to insignificant <b>multi-paths</b> tends to infinity and their posterior probability tends to zero. This method can distinguish and reconstruct significant <b>multi-paths</b> in channel vector automatically. Experiment result shows that the proposed method can reconstruct original UWB channel effectively when channel sparsity is unknown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{reliability}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} is significant in certain applications, especially the reliable routing. Most existing routing protocols use <b>multi-paths</b> to improve routing reliability. However, <b>multi-paths</b> waste {{a large amount of}} energy to obtain redundancy. This is not an optimal option for sensor nodes with limited energy. In this paper, a novel clustering-based reliable multi-hop routing algorithm (CRMR) is proposed. The algorithm adopts a mechanism of multiple backup cluster heads efficiently to extend time of stable period of clusters and to decrease energy consumption for reconstructing clusters. The local reconstruction of clusters is addressed for improving cover-age, maintaining connectivity, and extending the network lifetime. While the algorithm overcomes the randomicity of selecting cluster heads and ensures well proportioned clusters. Employing backup cluster heads and gateways can ensure {{reliability of}} routing and overcome disadvantages of most existing reliable routing protocols, which is to preserve multiple backup paths. The algorithm adopts query driving data transmission mode for finding routes and bypassing unavailable routing nodes for backtracking to ensure the speediness of data transmissions and the reliability. The simulation results show that the algorithm can achieve good performance on both routing reliability and energy consumption.

25|$|In graded-index fiber, {{the index}} of {{refraction}} in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce <b>multi-path</b> dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index profile is chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index profile {{is very close to}} a parabolic relationship between the index and the distance from the axis.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the use of high-resolution parameter estimation for channel characterisation and modelling purposes, the influence of the antenna data model on robustness and accuracy of the estimation has been underexposed. The point to be addressed in this paper is that the use of an incomplete data model inherently will result in biased and artificially spread angular estimates. For some antenna array types, estimation bias is even unavoidable, irrespective of the used data model. It is not inconceivable that the popular approach of clustering <b>multi-paths</b> components for channel modelling is spurred by the artefacts resulting from data model choices as described in this paper. Practical examples are given for two popular types of arrays, the uniform linear and uniform circular array. ...|$|R

The main conclusion is that, even with the above comprehensive set of demanding assumptions, as far as the theoretical channel capacity is considered, transmission with higher than often now spectral efficiency (e. g. 2 to 4 bits/sec/Hz) appears as a reasonable objective in typical time-varying underwater acoustic communication channels, providing SNR about 15 to 20 dB...|$|R
