40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} funding in the EU’s external policies on <b>migration,</b> borders <b>and</b> <b>asylum.</b> Academics have looked extensively into the political and legal resources of the EU in this area, but surprisingly {{little attention has been}} paid to the role of funding in the governance of this cooperation with third countries. The objective of this paper is to understand what EU funds are involved and which actors are setting priorities for funding in the field of <b>migration,</b> borders <b>and</b> <b>asylum.</b> This is a highly technical field of EU governance, characterised by complex political and legal dynamics. The funding landscape is fragmented and incoherent, with limited coordination, but this incoherence can be understood in light of the broader political, sociological and institutional struggles that come to the fore in the setting of priorities for funding. This paper argues that a certain degree of incoherence is an inevitable characteristic of EU governance in this field. The bigger issue is the challenge posed to accountability by this EU funding...|$|R

In addition to finding data for each of these predefined domains, the catalogue can be searched using keywords.

50|$|The Tampa affair arose {{during the}} {{election}} campaign. Following the election, the Howard Government made significant changes to Australia's immigration policy. It {{put in place a}} policy known as the Pacific Solution, which was implemented by then Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock. Under this policy, many islands were excised from the Australian <b>migration</b> zone, <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers were removed to third countries to determine their refugee status, namely at detention camps on small island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Also, a policy of turning back boats where possible was instigated. Howard's policies were often controversial, were criticised by some human rights groups and were the subject of protest both within and without detention centres. Through the final years of the Howard Government, Australia's detention facilities were near empty, few boat voyages were being attempted and the practice of detention of children had been ended.|$|R
30|$|Free or {{facilitated}} {{access to}} the EU territory has long been sought by many Turkish citizens as {{this would be the}} most tangible benefit of European integration for ordinary citizens.

It offers visa-free or facilitated {{access to the}} Schengen Area to citizens of third countries when they conclude readmission agreements with the EU. Most of these countries are either source and/or transit countries for irregular migration to the EU. 5 Candidate countries, on the other hand, are already obliged to make their borders impermeable against irregular migrants and other undesirable persons.

40|$|International audienceAcademics {{and policy}} makers require a better {{understanding}} of the variation of policies that regulate global <b>migration,</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> immigrant naturalization. At present, however, there is no comprehensive cross-national, time-series database of such policies, rendering the analysis of policy trends across and within these areas difficult at best. Several new immigration databases and indices have been developed in recent years. However, there is no consensus on how best to conceptualize, measure <b>and</b> aggregate <b>migration</b> policy indicators to allow for meaningful comparisons through time and across space.

We also offer two typologies, which can be used to map the most important dimensions of variation.

40|$|Forced <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> refugee <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> issues are, by definition, often {{a matter}} of {{international}} politics as they affect the relationship between countries of origin and countries of destination.

This paper seeks to provide an overview of the multidisciplinary academic literature on forced migration, its key debates and major contributions. Although it attempts to provide as balanced and comprehensive an account as possible, the sheer scope of the subject means that choices as to the geographical, theoretical, and empirical coverage of the paper had to be made. The paper takes as its main focus the question of how the global refugee framework and regional legal regimes on forced migration (such as that of the European Union) have come about, how they have been assessed, and what {{attempts have been made to}} reform them.

40|$|The current <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> {{debate in}} the European Union is {{distinguished}} by the growing importance of somehow integrating <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> issues into the Union's relations with third countries. The external dimension of <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> policy is more than ever salient and is gradually leaving the stage of declarations of intent. Now work is being made of the implementation and the financial implications of this new policy area. However, {{this seems to be}} quite problematic. The difficulty-as well as the challenge-lies in the fact that coordination of <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> policy <b>and</b> the Union's external affairs is inherently cross-pillar. To start with, this paper will briefly sketch the emergence and evolution of the external dimension of EU <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration</b> policy by means of an overview of the programs of the consecutive EU Presidencies, the Communications and Reports from the Commission and the Conclusions of the European Councils. Then, based on theories of governance and securitisation, we will outline a theoretical framework that aims at providing an explanation for the emergence of this new policy dimension. Finally, in an attempt to narrow down, four case studies of the external dimension will be introduced: the High-Level Working Group on <b>Asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>Migration,</b> clauses <b>and</b> agreements on <b>migration</b> management <b>and</b> readmission, cooperation with the Balkans on <b>asylum</b> <b>and</b> <b>migration,</b> <b>and</b> temporary protection of displaced persons in case of a mass influx...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{is one of}} the top {{regional}} destinations {{for refugees}} <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers. The South African government has chosen to adopt local integration as its main strategy in dealing with the refugees <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers it currently hosts, as opposed to housing refugees in camps. This step has been hailed as progressive, and the Refugee Act has espoused the issuing of progressive identity documents to refugees <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers as the viaduct through which refugees <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers can become fully integrated. In this regard then, refugee <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seeker identity documents are critical and the study sought to investigate the extent to which this policy intent of using identity documents to facilitate integration had become a reality. The study began by looking at the evolution of refugee <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seeker law in South Africa. From there it looked at the differences between refugees <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers, <b>and</b> what distinguishes them from other migrants such as economic migrants. Thereafter the study looked at theoretical frameworks surrounding <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> integration, especially as pertains to the refugee <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seeker context. In particular, the study sought to present the experiences of identity documents in facilitating integration from two main perspectives namely the refugees <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers who are issued with and make use of these identity documents, and service providers who interact with these documents on a daily basis and provide services to the refugee <b>and</b> <b>asylum</b> seeker communities. The findings presented highlight that despite the progressive evolution of refugee law in South Africa, the role of these identity documents, in facilitating access to services and promoting integration, has largely failed, from the practical to the policy level...|$|R
