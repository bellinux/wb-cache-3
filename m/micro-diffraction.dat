40|$|An overall {{trend toward}} smaller {{electronic}} packages and devices makes it increasingly important {{and difficult to}} obtain meaningful diffraction information from small areas. X-ray <b>micro-diffraction,</b> electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) and Kossel are <b>micro-diffraction</b> techniques used for crystallographic analysis including texture, phase identification and strain measurements. X-ray <b>micro-diffraction</b> primarily is used for phase analysis and residual strain measurements. X-ray <b>micro-diffraction</b> primarily is used for phase analysis and residual strain measurements of areas between 10 {micro}m to 100 {micro}m. For areas this small glass capillary optics are used for producing a usable collimated x-ray beam. These optics are designed to reflect x-rays below the critical angle therefore allowing for larger solid acceptance angle at the x-ray source resulting in brighter smaller x-ray beams. The determination of residual strain using <b>micro-diffraction</b> techniques {{is very important to}} the semiconductor industry. Residual stresses have caused voiding of the interconnect metal which then destroys electrical continuity. Being able to determine the residual stress helps industry to predict failures from the aging effects of interconnects due to this stress voiding. Stress measurements would be impossible using a conventional x-ray diffractometer; however, utilizing a 30 {micro}m glass capillary these small areas are readily assessable for analysis. Kossel produces a wide angle diffraction pattern from fluorescent x-rays generated in the sample by an e-beam in a SEM. This technique can yield very precise lattice parameters for determining strain. Fig. 2 shows a Kossel pattern from a Ni specimen. Phase analysis on small areas is also possible using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EBSD) and x-ray <b>micro-diffraction</b> techniques. EBSD has the advantage of allowing the user to observe the area of interest using the excellent imaging capabilities of the SEM. An EDS detector has been used for simultaneous element identification which enhances phase identification of unknowns. The x-ray area detector also allows for rapid microstructure information including crystallite orientation and size by directly observing the diffraction rings. These techniques allow for small area analysis that in the past would have been difficult if not impossible to obtain.
