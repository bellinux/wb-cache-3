500|$|Gunn had a [...] "fantastic {{rapport with}} the Norwich supporters". As a player, he liked [...] "to tease the crowd during the game". Before each half of a match, Gunn would run toward his goal and pretend to attempt to headbutt the crossbar. Gunn {{says this is a}} habit he began as a youngster, and cannot {{remember}} how or why he began to do it. Norwich fans noticed it soon after his arrival at the club and, in Gunn's words, [...] "would wait until I got to about the 18-yard line and then start a small [...] "Wooo..." [...] which would build into a full-blown [...] "WOOOO ... AH!" ... I loved it and came close to smacking <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the woodwork a couple of times". [...] During play, he would cup his ear, which would prompt shouts of [...] "Bryan, Bryan, give us a wave".|$|E
500|$|The dark {{music on}} My War lacks the humor and fist-pumping anthems that {{lightened}} up Damaged—no longer the snotty-nosed punk {{approach of the}} Keith Morris era, the band now focused on gloom, depression, defeatism, and aggression. [...] The sides on the original LP divide the tracks into stylistic halves. [...] The first half features five tracks of high-powered hardcore punk and closes with a noisy freak-out, [...] "The Swinging Man". [...] Dukowski penned the opening title track. [...] Ginn's [...] "Can't Decide" [...] follows, a gloomy ode to frustration: [...] "I conceal my feelings/ So I don't have to explain/ What I can't explain anyway". [...] "Beat <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> the Wall" [...] rails at conformity and the band's experience with a major label: [...] "Swimming in the mainstream/ Is such a lame, lame dream". [...] Dukowski's [...] "I Love You" [...] parodies pop ballads with lyrics of violence and dysfunction in a relationship gone wrong. [...] Ginn and Rollins share credit on the metallic [...] "Forever Time" [...] and the noisy [...] "Swinging Man".|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E

6000|$|... "When I think," [...] said Kipps, {{as soon as}} {{the door}} closed again behind Gwendolen, [...] "when I think of the 'ole people and 'aving to tell 'em of it all--I want to smesh <b>my</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>against</b> the nearest wall. Smesh my silly brains out! And Buggins--Buggins what I'd 'arf promised to start in a lill' {{outfitting}} shop in Rendezvous Street."...|$|R
60|$|In my {{attempts}} I {{tried to}} rise to my feet, but found it an impossibility, and only succeeded in bumping <b>my</b> <b>head</b> severely <b>against</b> the wall.|$|R
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] I explained to him that I had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through which I could not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Johnson changed {{labels to}} the United States-based Tree International, owners of Dial Records, {{and for two}} years he wrote songs for other artists while vainly {{attempting}} to record his own material. He later recalled [...] "Because I'd signed with an American company I couldn't record here ... two years writing and bashing <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a brick wall". In September 1973 he issued [...] "Rock and Roll I Gave You the Best Years of My Life". It peaked at No.10 in Melbourne, and at No.4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Big & Rich's foundation, John Rich was a {{founding}} member of the band Texassee, which later became Lonestar. Rich played bass guitar in the band and alternated with Richie McDonald on lead vocals; he also co-wrote their singles [...] "Come Cryin' to Me" [...] and [...] "Say When". After Lonestar released its second album, Rich departed from the band in 1998. Kenny Alphin (aka Big Kenny) was signed to Hollywood Records in 1998, where he recorded a rock album called Live a Little a year later. [...] Although one of its songs was featured in the soundtrack to the film Gun Shy, Live a Little was not released, and Hollywood Records held the rights to the songs for five years. In the meantime, The Mavericks recorded one of Alphin's songs ("I Hope You Want Me Too") on their 1998 album Trampoline, and Danni Leigh recorded his [...] "Beatin' <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Against</b> the Wall" [...] on her album 29 Nights. Big Kenny then befriended Rich after meeting him at a club, and the two began writing songs together. Their first songwriting collaboration was [...] "I Pray for You," [...] which they wrote in October 1998.|$|E
6000|$|The constable gave {{a slight}} gulp. [...] "I saw the three running {{by the side}} of the road," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Their {{behaviour}} seemed suspicious, so I collared the big one, but they set on me like wild cats. They had me down three times; the last time I laid <b>my</b> <b>head</b> open <b>against</b> the kerb, and when I came to my senses again they had gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon {{a drop of}} whisky will do me good if {{anything}} will," [...] Ben said. [...] "I was crushed pretty near flat, and if <b>my</b> <b>head</b> hadn't been <b>against</b> the wall I should have been smothered. Are you all right, young Tom?" ...|$|R
60|$|When next {{consciousness}} came, the tarry, salt {{smell of}} a ship was in my nostrils, and I {{knew that we were}} embarked. I lay in a clean bunk in a fair-sized and sun-washed cabin, and I heard the scraping of ropes and the tramp of feet on the deck above <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Framed <b>against</b> the irregular glass of the cabin window, which was greened by the water beyond, Dorothy and my Lord stood talking in whispers.|$|R
60|$|I {{went forward}} and seated {{myself in a}} tar-bucket, with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the mast, to get what sleep I could.|$|E
60|$|I am beating <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> {{the door}} with grief and frenzy, and I shall {{continue}} to do so, until I receive your answer.|$|E
6000|$|DAISY. [With {{a passion}} of despair.] Oh, I {{might as well}} batter <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a brick wall. How {{can you be so}} unkind to me? ...|$|E
6000|$|From a {{chaos of}} wild dreams was finally evolved a {{gigantic}} clam, whose mission {{it was to}} devour me as I had devoured its relatives. The sharp shells gaped before me, a solemn voice said, [...] "Take her by her little head and eat her quick." [...] Retribution was at hand, and, with a despairing effort to escape by diving, I bumped <b>my</b> <b>head</b> smartly <b>against</b> the wall, and woke up feeling {{as if there was}} an earthquake under the bed.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{turned and}} ran, or rather waddled, for in that gear I could not run, {{out of the}} chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me, and there, with my back towards her, thrust <b>my</b> helmeted <b>head</b> <b>against</b> it, for I felt as though red-hot bradawls had been plunged into my eyes. So I stood while she laughed and mocked behind me until at length I heard the door close and the blessed {{darkness}} came like a gift from Heaven.|$|R
60|$|We {{were both}} of us capsized in a second, and {{both of us}} rolled, almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, {{tumbling}} stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that <b>my</b> <b>head</b> came <b>against</b> the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees.|$|R
6000|$|I {{took another}} turn across the room, full {{of love for}} my pretty wife, and distracted by self-accusatory inclinations to knock <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the door. I sat down again, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|MACAIRE. Bertrand, I will bet you <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> your own--the longest odds I can imagine--that with honesty for my spring-board, I leap {{through history}} like a paper hoop, {{and come out}} among posterity heroic and immortal.|$|E
60|$|He {{shortened}} {{his sword}} to kill me, but, changing his mind, he seized {{me by the}} throat and banged <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the stones until I was unconscious. So it was that I became the prisoner of the Russians.|$|E
5000|$|Aamer {{says that}} the [...] "MI5" [...] interrogators {{told him he had}} two choices: (1) agree to spy on {{suspected}} jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody. He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room. [...] "All I know is that I felt someone grab <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and start beating <b>my</b> <b>head</b> into the back wall - so hard that <b>my</b> <b>head</b> was bouncing. And they were shouting that they would kill me or I would die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know who}} has been putting that in your head,' rejoined her son disconsolately; 'that's Little Bethel again. Now I say, mother, pray don't take to going there regularly, for if I was to see your good-humoured face that has always made home cheerful, turned into a grievous one, and the baby trained to look grievous too, and to call itself a young sinner (bless its heart) and {{a child of the}} devil (which is calling its dead father names); if I was to see this, and see little Jacob looking grievous likewise, I should so take it to heart that I'm sure I should go and list for a soldier, and run <b>my</b> <b>head</b> on purpose <b>against</b> the first cannon-ball I saw coming my way.' ...|$|R
60|$|Well, then, {{to return}} to myself. It was determined, as I said, that I was not fit for tragedy, and unluckily, as my study was bad, having a very poor memory, I was {{pronounced}} unfit for comedy also: besides, the line of young gentlemen was already engrossed by an actor with whom I could not pretend to enter into competition, he having filled it for almost half a century. I came down again therefore to pantomime. In consequence, however, of the good offices of the manager's lady, who had taken a liking to me, I was promoted from {{the part of the}} satyr to that of the lover; and with my face patched and painted, a huge cravat of paper, a steeple-crowned hat, and dangling, long-skirted, sky-blue coat, was metamorphosed into the lover of Columbine. My part did not call for much of the tender and sentimental. I had merely to pursue the fugitive fair one; to have a door now and then slammed in my face; to run <b>my</b> <b>head</b> occasionally <b>against</b> a post; to tumble and roll about with Pantaloon and the clown; and to endure the hearty thwacks of Harlequin's wooden sword.|$|R
60|$|How long I stood {{listening}} {{in the darkness}} I do not know, but the silence was unbroken, and at last I sunk to the hard floor of my prison, where, leaning <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the stony wall, I slept.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I see, capsized," [...] he said, {{rising and}} {{pressing}} {{his hand to}} his brow, [...] "I believe I must have hit <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> a stump, for I've been slightly stunned. However, `all's well that ends well.' Not hurt, Francois?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is wind {{enough when}} we once get {{well beyond the}} town; but unless we get a good start they will {{overtake}} us in boats. Is it a state affair, Maitre Perrot? For I own to you I don't like running <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the state." ...|$|E
60|$|Sleep got {{the better}} of fear {{to such an extent that}} my boots {{appeared}} to gape, and my bonnet nodded on its peg, before I gave in. Having piled my cloak, bag, rubbers, books and umbrella on the lower shelf, I drowsily swarmed onto the upper one, tumbling down a few times, and excoriating the knobby portions of my frame in the act. A very brief nap on the upper roost was enough to set me gasping as if a dozen feather beds and the whole boat were laid over me. Out I turned; and after a series of convulsions, which caused my neighbor to ask if I wanted the stewardess, I managed to get my luggage up and myself down. But even in the lower berth, my rest was not unbroken, for various articles kept dropping off the little shelf at the bottom of the bed, and every time I flew up, thinking my hour had come, I bumped <b>my</b> <b>head</b> severely <b>against</b> the little shelf at the top, evidently put there for that express purpose. At last, after listening to the swash of the waves outside, wondering if the machinery usually creaked in that way, and watching a knot-hole in the side of my berth, sure that death would creep in there as soon as I took my eye from it, I dropped asleep, and dreamed of muffins.|$|R

It was in [...] Piccadilly, when I was home, some months ago, in reference to an [...] increase of my nominal salary from the EI (which by the way came to [...] nothing--its original figure). I entered a 'bus and ran <b>my</b> <b>head</b> [...] <b>against</b> that of a lady who was coming out. I looked up to apologise, [...] and was struck dumb. It was Blue-eyes!

I moved after her. I traced her (reverentially) [...] to a house. It was that of a personal friend! I visited that friend, [...] I became particularly intimate with that friend, I positively bored [...] that friend until he detested me. At last I met her at the house of [...] that friend and--but why go on?
