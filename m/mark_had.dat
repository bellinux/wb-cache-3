5|$|As a senior, he mostly played running back. In the 2009 TAPPS Division I {{football}} semifinals, <b>Mark</b> <b>had</b> 102 {{yards on}} 16 carries, including two rushing touchdowns and a 33-yard receiving touchdown. However, he was stopped on fourth and goal {{to go from}} the 2-yard-line with 11 seconds left as the team lost Nolan Catholic High School 3628. Mark's senior season statistics were 23 receptions for 242 yards, 92 rushes for 772 yards and 20 total touchdowns (four on punt and kickoff returns). He also had seven touchdowns called back due to penalties. He was honored as a first team All-state selection.

5|$|Mark's early storylines often {{revolved}} around {{his relationship with}} Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). He was initially wary of getting involved with Kate because of her ex-boyfriend, Declan Napier (Erin Mullally), and the age gap between them. Mark's focus on his work eventually forced him to choose between Kate and Paul's case. Following {{the end of his}} relationship with Kate, <b>Mark</b> <b>had</b> a one-night stand with her best friend Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). He also faced problems at work after reporting a fellow officer for corruption, which led to his life being threatened. Mark left for witness protection during a special real-time episode. Mark later returned during an eclipse and tried to win Kate back. Following her death, he embarked on a relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) and three members of his family were introduced. The character has been mostly well received by critics and viewers during his time on the show.|$|E

25|$|Much early {{development}} of conversions {{was carried out}} by Grand Central Aircraft, whose drawings and personnel were taken up by the On Mark Engineering Company of Van Nuys, California from about 1955.

The Gospel of Mark is less a legend, than a biography written with credulity (p. 118). It would be rash to say that <b>Mark</b> <b>has</b> not been interpolated and retouched (p. 120).|$|R

On their trip around the Mediterranean sea, Paul and his companion Barnabas stopped in Antioch where they had a sharp argument about taking John Mark with them on their trips.

25|$|Two rookies faced off in Game1 for {{the first}} time in history: Anthony Reyes for St. Louis and Justin Verlander for Detroit. It looked like the Tigers were going to get to Reyes early in the bottom of the first, when Craig Monroe doubled and Magglio Ordóñez walked. Carlos Guillén singled Monroe in, giving the Tigers a 1–0 lead. However, in the top of the second, Scott Rolen hit a long home run to left field, tying the score at 1–1. Rolen was 0-for-15 in his career in the World Series before hitting the home run. The {{previous}} <b>mark</b> <b>had</b> been 0-for-13, set by Benny Kauff of the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series. In the third inning the Cards broke through, first when Chris Duncan's RBI double scored Yadier Molina to give the Cardinals the lead. On Verlander's next pitch, 2005 National League MVP Albert Pujols banged a two-run home run, punishing the rookie who elected to pitch to the dangerous Pujols, rather than walk him with first base open and two outs and pitch to Jim Edmonds.|$|E

25|$|In January 2007, Staal {{participated in}} the NHL YoungStars Game during the All-Star festivities, along with {{teammates}} Ryan Whitney and Malkin. Shortly thereafter, on February 10, 2007, Staal scored his first NHL career hat trick against the Toronto Maple Leafs and set yet another NHL record by becoming the youngest player in league history to score a hat trick at 18 years and 153 days. His first goal came at 19:22 in the first period, the second came at 3:32 in the second, and his third was the game winner, as he beat Toronto goalie Andrew Raycroft stick-side at 3:54 in overtime. The previous <b>mark</b> <b>had</b> been held for over sixty years by Jack Hamilton, who achieved a four-goal game at 18 years and 185 days old with the Maple Leafs against the New York Rangers on December 4, 1943. Then, late in the season, on March 6, Staal scored his league-leading seventh shorthanded goal of the season to break the previous league record for shorthanded tallies by a rookie, set by Gerry Minor of the Vancouver Canucks in 1980–81 and matched by John Madden in 1999–2000. The goal cued a late third period comeback for the Penguins to win 5–4 in a shootout against the Ottawa Senators.|$|E
25|$|Paine {{was arrested}} in France on December 28, 1793. Joel Barlow was {{unsuccessful}} in securing Paine’s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine’s release to the Convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine’s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine himself protested and claimed {{that he was a}} citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the <b>mark</b> <b>had</b> accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was {{due to the fact that}} the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).|$|E

500|$|In April 2011, a TV Week {{columnist}} {{reported that}} Mark {{would have a}} one-night stand with Kate's best friend, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita).

An Inside Soap reporter observed {{that of all the}} women Mark could have sought comfort in, Jade seemed the most unlikely as there was tension between them. Jade believed <b>Mark</b> <b>had</b> sided with Toadie against her sister and she told Kate not to give him a second chance.|$|E
500|$|With {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II, nickel became a {{critical}} war material, and the Mint sought to reduce its use of the metal. On March 27, 1942, Congress authorized a nickel made of 50%copper and 50%silver, but gave the Mint the authority to vary the proportions, or add other metals, in the public interest. The Mint's greatest concern was in finding an alloy that would use no nickel, but still satisfy counterfeit detectors in vending machines. An alloy of 56%copper, 35%silver and 9%manganese proved suitable, and this alloy began to be coined into nickels from October 1942. In the hope of making them easy to sort out and withdraw after the war, the Mint struck all [...] "war nickels" [...] with a large mint mark appearing above Monticello. The mint mark P for Philadelphia {{was the first time}} that mint's <b>mark</b> <b>had</b> appeared on a US coin. The prewar composition returned in 1946; all nickels struck since then have been in 75% copper and 25% nickel.|$|E
