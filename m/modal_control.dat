40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in various aspects of control theory, there still appears to be no adequate theory for the control of large-scale linear time-invariant multivariable systems. If the engineering specifications required of the controlled system can be effectively summarized in a quadratic performance measure, then linear optimal control theory, in principle, provides a linear feedback controller which would perform the required task. Even under these circumstances the computational problems may be insurmountable. In an effort to circumvent these difficulties Rosenbrock suggested the use of <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> as a design aid. <b>Modal</b> <b>control</b> may be defined as control which changes the modes (i. e., the eigenvalues of the system matrix) to achieve the desired control objectives. This paper presents a complete and rigorous theory of <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> as well as recursive algorithms which permit <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> to be realized...|$|E

40|$|Second order matrix {{equations}} {{arise in}} the description of real dynamical systems. Traditional <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> approaches utilise the eigenvectors of the undamped system to diagonalise the system matrices. Any remaining off-diagonal terms in the modal damping matrix are discarded. A regrettable automatic consequence of this action is the destruction of any notion of the skew-symmetry in the damping. The methods presented in this thesis use the `Lancaster Augmented Matrices' (LAMs) allowing state space representations of the second order systems. `Structure preserving transformations' (SPTs) are used to manipulate the system matrices whilst preserving the structure within the LAMs. Utilisation of the SPTs permits the diagonalisation of the system mass, damping and stiffness matrices for non-classically damped systems. Thus a <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> method is presented in this thesis which exploits this diagonalisation. The method introduces independent <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> in which a separate modal controller is designed in modal space for each individual mode or pair of modes. The modal displacements and velocities for the diagonalised systems are extracted from the physical quantities using first order SPT-based filters. Similarly the first order filters are used to translate the modal force into the physical domain. Derivation of the SPT-filters is presented together with a method by which one exploits the non-uniqueness of the diagonalising filters such that initially unstable filters are stabilised. In the context of active control of rotating machines, standard optimal controller methods enable a trade-off to be made between (weighted) mean-square vibrations and (weighted) mean-square control forces, {{or in the case of}} a machines controlled using magnetic bearings the currents injected into the magnetic bearings. One shortcoming of such controllers for magnetic bearings is that no concern is devoted to the voltages required. In practice, the voltage available imposes a strict limitation on the maximum possible rate of change of control force (force slew rate). This thesis presents a method which removes the aforementioned existing shortcomings of traditional optimal control. Case studies of realistic rotor systems are presented to illustrate the <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> and control force rate penalisation methods. The system damping matrices of the case studies contain skew-symmetric components due to gyroscopic forces typical of rotating machines. The SPT-based <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> method is used to decouple the non-classically damped equations of motion into n single degree of freedom systems. Optimal modal controllers are designed independently in the modal space such that the modal state, modal forces and modal force rates are weighted as required. The SPT-based <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> method is shown to yield superior results to the conventional notion of independent modal space control according to reasonable assessment.

Depending on the kind and number of sensors and actuators available for control, the mode shape can be imposed in both a direct and an indirect way. Owing {{to the need for}} modal sensors and actuators for direct mode shape imposition, the second methodology is often preferred in many engineering applications. In the indirect method, the optimal closed loop mode shapes set is computed with an optimization algorithm in order to minimize an Input-Output Performance Index. The worsening spillover effects due to errors in the estimates of the system state variables are considered when computing the gain matrix and {{play an important role in}} the entire control logic.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the optimal {{vibration}} control of clamped-free conical shells using di-stributed helical piezoelectric sensor/actuator (S/A) pairs. Based on the independent modal space control, the response of conical shell to external excitations {{is represented by the}} sum-mation of all participating natural modes and their respective modal participation factors, and each mode can be controlled independently. The modal equation is transformed into the linear state space form. The linear quadratic (LQ) controllers are designed for each indepen-dent mode. The optimal gain matrix is related to the ratio G ∗ between the control voltage and sensing signal by the <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> force per unit voltage B 2 and the sensing signal per unit displacement C 1. Because B 2 and C 1 change with locations of the S/A pair, the optimal control effects, <b>modal</b> <b>control</b> forces and corresponding optimal control voltages are evaluated using two S/A pairs at different locations. The results indicate that the optimal control method is effective in vibration control of the shell.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new control technique for reducing vibration in flexible structures. It {{is based on}} the modal approach and is called dependent <b>modal</b> space <b>control</b> (DMSC). The well-known independent <b>modal</b> space <b>control</b> (IMSC) method, devised in the 1980 s, allows the frequency and damping of the controlled modes to be changed using diagonal control gain matrices, leaving the mode shapes unaltered. DMSC, on the other hand, can impose not only frequency and damping but also the controlled mode shapes by using full control gain matrices. In many applications, owing to the limited number of sensors–actuators available for control and the increasing spillover effects, generic assignment of eigenvectors is not possible. However, an optimal eigenstructure assignment can be computed to reduce structure vibration by minimizing an input–output performance index. To demonstrate the advantages of this new method, we compare IMSC and DMSC using numerical simulation on a finite element method model of a cantilevered beam...|$|R
