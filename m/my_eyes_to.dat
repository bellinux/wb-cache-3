It was featured in Spike and Mike's book Outlaw Animation, written by Jerry Beck, and in the Spike and Mike DVD.|$|E

Parker and Simper started off playing covers of Rage Against the Machine, Unwritten Law, Sunk Loto and Korn songs, along with Dan Debuf, {{who is now a}} presenter on 2Day FM. In his late-teens, Parker discovered the many '60s and '70s psychedelic rock artists that would have a huge influence on his music, saying that [...] "I got into bands like Cream and Jefferson Airplane in a big way, and loved the sound of their recordings. My friends were listening to bands like Brainticket and Demon Fuzz who opened <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> different ways of constructing songs. The Beatles way of singing vocal lines often crept into the recordings because they are so unique, whereas the elements we take from those other bands are usually common among a few other bands we listen to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> the ugly facts before me." ...|$|E

Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>to</b> be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with." ...|$|E

She used to advocate different ways of healing the mind and counsel people on their day to day problems suggest solutions for them. Chakraverti used the curative powers of crystals [...] for curing people of backache, pains and spinal injuries. She also started investigating and bringing to light the plight of women in rural Bengal where many were tortured after being labeled as witches. Chakraverti travelled to such villages in Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and documented such crimes, sometimes teaching women who were emotionally or physically battered by men to recognize and unleash the power within themselves. [...] "Wicca can do that through their empowerment of the goddesses. [...] The village women—simple women accused of witchcraft—would give me stories which were really heartbreaking. It opened <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> how much venom there was in these men. [...] I have tried [...] to bring succor to women branded ‘witches' or ‘dayans' who are still today being molested and killed {{for what they are}} believed to practice. I have brought their cases before the authorities and the press in an attempt to show up the hypocrisy of their persecutors– mostly men– who are trying to denigrate this ancient branch of learning in order to wreak revenge on these women for some very personal motives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Phoenix {{starred in}} the James Mangold {{directed}} film Walk the Line, a Johnny Cash biopic, after Cash himself approved of Phoenix. All of Cash's vocal tracks in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack are played and sung by Phoenix. The film was released on November 18, 2005, eventually grossing $186 million. Phoenix's performance received rave reviews from critics and it inspired film critic Roger Ebert to write, [...] "Knowing Johnny Cash's albums more or less by heart, I closed <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> focus on the soundtrack and decided that, yes, that {{was the voice of}} Johnny Cash I was listening to. The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked". For his portrayal of [...] Johnny Cash, Phoenix was nominated for his second Academy Award, in the category of Best Actor as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.
