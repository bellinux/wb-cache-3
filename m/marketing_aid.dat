50|$|The {{investment}} requirements for mechanized farming favored prosperous cultivators, and eventually most farms {{came to be}} operated by entrepreneurs who raised capital through mortgageable property or other assets in the urban centers. Through arrangements with other individuals, these entrepreneurs frequently managed to control additional plots beyond the legal limit of two. Their ability to obtain capital also permitted them to abandon depleted land and to move into newly demarcated uncleared areas, a practice that had a deleterious impact upon the environment, deprived the indigenous inhabitants of work opportunities, and increased desertification. In 1968, to expand the operator base and to introduce more control over land allocation, crops, and farming methods, the government established the Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC), an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. From 1968 through 1978, the IDA made three loans to the government to enable the MFC to provide technical assistance, credit for landclearing and machinery, and <b>marketing</b> <b>aid</b> to individual farmers and cooperative groups. The MFC also became the operator of state farms.In the late 1970s, about 2.2 million hectares had been allocated for mechanized farming, and about 420,000 hectares more had been occupied without official demarcation. About 1.9 million hectares in all {{were believed to be}} under cultivation in any one season. Of the officially allocated land, more than 70 percent was held by private individuals. Private companies had also begun entering the field, and some allocations had been made to them. State farms accounted for another 7.5 percent. About 15 percent of the total allocated land was in MFC-IDA projects. The largest proportion of mechanized farming was in Ash Sharqi Province, 43 percent; the next largest in Al Awsat Province, 32 percent; and about 20 percent was in Aali an Nil Province. Mechanized farming had also been initiated in southern Kurdufan Province through a project covering small-scale farmers {{in the area of the}} Nuba Mountains, but under a different government program. Proposals also have been made for MFC projects using mechanized equipment in other areas of southern Kurdufan (some have already been tried) and southern Darfur provinces. There were serious feasibility problems in view of competition for land and conflicts with traditional farming practices, difficult soil conditions, and the probable negative effect on the large numbers of livestock of nomads.|$|E
50|$|Another of the one-off {{projects}} {{funded by}} the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation was the re-design of the Touring Exhibitions Group’s website. Keeping a numerous and dispersed membership informed about the policies and activities of the committee that was working on its behalf is a challenge for any organisation. For one with limited resources, communication was difficult {{because of the cost}} of producing and mailing regular newsletters. There is the opportunity at Annual General Meetings for members to question and challenge the outgoing committee on its achievements and failures, but an AGM is retrospective, only once a year and attended by a small proportion of the membership. A more continuous, two-way interaction between the Committee and the membership is now possible, thanks to the explosive development of the internet, which has {{had a profound impact on}} the way that TEG functions. As late as 1997, the exchange of drafts by email was thought worthy of mention in that year’s annual report, not just for its speed and economy but also because the drafts were tested in a wider consultation with those members who had e-mail addresses (by no means a universal condition in 1997). Ten years later, monthly e-newsletters, simple and inexpensive to produce and distribute, provided a regular channel of information to the membership. TEG’s first website went on-line in 1999. It was written on a shoestring, with help in kind from Panelock. Like all first websites, it was tentative and experimental, testing what such a site should provide and how it might be done, with new features added as and when the need was recognised. By 2003, this structure (with its superstructure of add-ons) was creaking at the seams, so a radical overhaul and redesign by the website designers, Red Leader Industries, became one of the stand-alone projects funded by EFF. This second website gives members easy access to news and resources. At the most formal level, minutes from committee meetings are posted on the website so that members are able to follow the work of the Committee and - if they feel moved to - provide comment and influence policy. At a different level, the website includes a database which allows members to use different criteria (subject, period, size, etc.) to search for exhibitions available for hire. In the event, this database proved to be so effective - simple to use and with immediate results - that it made the publication ‘X’ wholly redundant, and it has now been replaced by a twice-yearly magazine, Exchange, explicitly a <b>marketing</b> <b>aid</b> for TEG events.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to improve}} the current {{demolition}} techniques selection process that involves a multicriteria decision making problems because the decision performed by demolition engineers were based on their knowledge and experience without any systematic procedure that can be followed to support the decision process. There is also a need to capture the expert's knowledge since significant proportion of senior, experienced demolition engineers are close to retirement, and unless their knowledge is captured in some form, it would be lost. Concerning to these needs, the research aim is to develop an intelligent decision support system that incorporated the demolition expert's knowledge in selecting the most appropriate demolition techniques for a given structure. Various research methodologies were adopted to achieve the aim. Literature on demolition industry was first reviewed. Knowledge acquisition approaches were used to capture the demolition expert knowledge, which included an industry survey through postal questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, and protocol analysis. The rapid prototyping methodology was used in developing the prototype system. The proposed intelligent decision support system is called 'Demolition Techniques Selection System' (DTSS). The prototype system consists of two stages. The first stage will assist the decision maker to select the most appropriate demolition techniques in term of technical aspects by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. The second stage allows the decision maker to assess the demolition techniques in terms of cost by using the Demolition Cost Estimation model. The prototype was evaluated during and after the development process to verify, validates, and improves it. The evaluation revealed that the prototype system demonstrated many benefits and applicable for use in the industry. It is concluded that the prototype provides a clear, systematic and structured framework that improved the current demolition techniques selection process. It also serves as an information source that contains a considerable amount of information on demolition techniques.

40|$|An Economic Assessment of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy Reform. The main {{innovation}} of the June 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reform is}} to replace most <b>market</b> <b>aids</b> {{by a single}} direct payment per farm disconnected from production choices and levels (decoupling process), conditional on the respect of statutory environmental, food safety, animal health and animal welfare standards as well as good agronomic and environmental practices (cross-compliance process). This decoupled payment will be progressively reduced up {{to a maximum of}} 5 % and funds saved through this modulation mechanism will be switched from the first pillar of the CAP to a consolidated and strengthened rural development regulation confirmed as the second pillar of the CAP. In application of the subsidiary principle, important degrees of freedom are given to Member States in terms of <b>market</b> <b>aids</b> which would remained coupled and in defining cross-compliance national criteria. The objectives of this paper are the following. In a first stage, it presents the reform and proposes a qualitative analysis of measures adopted in June 2003. In a second stage, it provides a quantitative assessment of the reform for the European agricultural sector: impacts on supply, demand, exports and imports, prices, agricultural incomes, budget costs and welfare. In a third stage, the same exercise performed at the French scale allows us to give first responses to some interrogations raised by the decoupling of the income support policy. Attention is focused on three issues, i. e., land abandonment, extensification and the process of specialisation of farms and regions. We conclude by presenting our point of view on necessary evolutions of the CAP. ce est utilisé pour apporter une première réponse à certaines interrogations que pose le découplage.

Districts {{are not permitted}} to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher on a per district basis by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values (<b>Market</b> <b>Aid</b> Ratio) and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases.
