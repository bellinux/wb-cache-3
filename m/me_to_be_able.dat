25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
500|$|Rachel Nichols {{was born}} January 8, 1980 in Augusta, Maine, to Jim, a schoolteacher, and Alison Nichols. She {{attended}} Cony High School, where she {{competed in the}} high jump. Nichols {{said in an interview}} that she was not the hot chick in high school and her mother would euphemistically refer to her as [...] "a late bloomer", [...] "which meant that I had uncontrollable arms and legs, I had very long appendages. I took several years of very highly structured dance classes for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to control myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was {{surrounded}} by the Spanish language, and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to connect with all my fans. I {{had so much fun}} singing in Spanish. It reminded me of growing up in Houston". The Denver Post John Wenzel interpreted the release of Irreemplazable as [...] "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".|$|E

500|$|Various actresses {{auditioned for}} the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before Lisa Bonet secured the part. Bonet was then known for her role on the family-oriented sitcom The Cosby Show, and her casting in Angel Heart sparked {{significant}} controversy. Parker cast Bonet based on the strength of her audition and was unaware of her role on The Cosby Show. On preparing {{for the role}}, Bonet said, [...] "I did a lot of meditation and a lot of self-inquiry. I did some research on voodoo. My earnest endeavor was really to let go of all my inhibitions. It was really necessary for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to let go of Lisa and let Epiphany take over." [...] Parker had difficulty finding an actress {{for the role of}} Margaret Krusemark, until Rourke suggested English actress Charlotte Rampling. Rampling secured the role after Parker contacted her to discuss the part.|$|E
500|$|Years later, {{reflecting}} on his tenure with the Royals, Affeldt said, [...] "I was pretty frustrated. I wanted to quit. I didn't {{want to go}} to the ballpark. I was just failing a lot. I was getting hurt. I didn't understand my role. I bounced around and I just didn't enjoy the game." [...] At the trade deadline on July 31, Affeldt was traded along with Denny Bautista to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann. [...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I need to give you a fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.' [...] I have a lot of respect for him now because he saw that. It was a move that had to be made for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to continue playing baseball. I'm very thankful for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Amid the {{political}} pressure, George {{was on his}} deathbed, suffering from severe asthma and dropsy. He died at 1:30p.m. on 28 October 1708 at Kensington Palace. The Queen was devastated. James Brydges wrote to General Cadogan, [...] "His death has flung the Queen into an unspeakable grief. She never left him till he was dead, but continued kissing him the very moment his breath {{went out of his}} body, and 'twas {{with a great deal of}} difficulty my Lady Marlborough prevailed upon her to leave him." [...] Anne wrote to her nephew, Frederick IV of Denmark, [...] "the loss of such a husband, who loved me so dearly and so devotedly, is too crushing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to bear it as I ought." [...] Anne was desperate to stay at Kensington with the body of her husband, but under pressure from the Duchess of Marlborough, she reluctantly left Kensington for St James's Palace. Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural [...] "to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead". Anne and the Duchess had been very close, but their friendship had become strained over political differences. The immediate aftermath of George's death damaged their relationship further. He was buried privately at midnight on 13 November in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

[...] "It is just {{possible}} that this person requires an immediate reply, in which case it may be convenient for <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get at the Prime Minister. Bring him along into my private room, Sidney." ...|$|R

2500|$|Érik Morales {{currently}} {{spends his}} time managing a $3.5 million budget running {{the parks and}} recreation department in Tijuana. Morales donates his salary back to the department to further help fund it.

2500|$|... "A lot {{of people}} forget that Tiananmen Square was going on. The {{crackdown}} that happened was on the middle Sunday at the French Open, so if I was not practicing or playing a match, I was glued to the television, watching the events unfold...I often tell people I think it was God's purpose for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to win the French Open {{the way it was}} won because I was able to put a smile on Chinese people's faces around the world {{at a time when there}} wasn't much to smile about." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Neuhaus: [...] "I {{learned a}} lot from him, even though he kept saying that {{there was nothing he could}} teach me. Music is written to be played and listened to and has always seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to manage without words... This was exactly the case with Heinrich Neuhaus. In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he taught me the meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. He said I was incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted. And so he left me to do as I liked." ...|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{characterized}} Reese as [...] "very {{warm and}} real and very expressive with her feelings". Her relationship with Bianca is also [...] "very" [...] affectionate. In the past whenever a kiss {{was written in}} for Bianca, significant soap opera press usually focused in on the moment as an event and another kiss usually took a year or longer to happen following the immediate shift of making her romance more physically reserved than heterosexual relationships on the show. The atmosphere was different for Reese and Bianca's relationship. Braun {{said in an interview}} with Shewired.com that she would not have been able to portray the character as well back then because Reese is so affectionate. [...] "This character is warm and open and for me to play a woman who's in love, it's important for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to express that," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps that's one of the reasons they wanted me to play this." [...] Braun and Riegel have portrayed their characters as in love and committed to each other. Reese was also scripted early on as the love of Bianca's life, negating Bianca's previous true love Maggie.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Exclaim!, Nick Thorburn explained that the overhauled lineup {{was a product of}} his desire to try new things. [...] "That's important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ― <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> constantly try new things. That's why this record's largely informed by electronic stuff like drum machines, sequencing, and programming, which really scales it back from the last record." [...] Thompson once again left the band prior to the summer 2010 tour, and was again replaced by Aaron Harris.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{the year}} draws {{to a close}} and we {{contemplate}} our eighth year of publication we reflect a while {{on the state of the}} industry. How well is III–Vs doing? It irritates <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> give a strongly positive answer. Overall, the verdict is that III–Vs is doing very well but still largely in discretes rather than in ICs. By inference, epitaxy — the major source of discretes — is doing very well, and semiconducting substrates and associated materials are too. In comparison with silicon however, the picture is inevitably less rosy...|$|R
