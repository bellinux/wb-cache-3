There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to <b>measuring</b> <b>surface</b> or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E

Control tests are used to validate the inversion scheme, and sensitivity tests are performed to evaluate the influence of uncertain parameters. Inversion of the <b>measured</b> <b>surface</b> velocities reveals an unusually high contribution of basal motion to the overall motion. Based on these results and several other lines of evidence, we suggest that the glacier may be undergoing a slow surge...|$|R

50|$|Optothermal {{stability}} {{describes the}} rate at which an optical element distorts due to a changing thermal environment. Therefore, optothermal stability is an issue for optics that are present in a changing thermal environment. Optothermal stability is important for objects in orbit which have varying heating levels from changes in spacecraft attitude, solar flux, planetary albedo, and planetary infrared emissions. Optothermal stability is important when <b>measuring</b> <b>surface</b> figure of optics because thermal changes are typically of a low frequency nature (diurnal or HVAC cycling) which makes it difficult to use the same methods used to remove errors due to vibrational disturbances. Also, optothermal stability is important for certain optical systems such as those that use a coronagraph which requires a high level of stability.|$|E
