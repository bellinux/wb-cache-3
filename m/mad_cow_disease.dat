5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease)</b> caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{also has}} other powers of general supervision, mainly {{granted by the}} Maastricht Treaty. The Parliament {{has the power to}} set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease</b> or CIA {{detention}} flights—the former {{led to the creation of}} the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease</b> and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

40|$|In {{times of}} crisis, an {{effective}} communication mechanism is paramount in providing accurate and timely {{information to the}} community. Recent examples are the outbreak of SARS, bird flu, <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>diseases,</b> September 11 attacks and the 2004 tsunamis. Such events have illustrated the importance of an effective and efficient crisis communication system. In this paper, it is proposed the incorporation of an intelligent agent software robot into a crisis communication portal (CCNet) in order to send alert news to subscribed users via email and others mobile services such as Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS). The proposed system consists of the integration of an intelligent conversation agent that is employed to gain trust from the users of the portal and an Automated Knowledge Extraction Agent (AKEA), which retrieves first hand information from relevant sources such as WHO. org, CBC Canada, info. gov. hk and Sars. gov. sg...|$|R
40|$|Proteins {{are vital}} {{components}} of living cells. A number of {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's, Cystic fibrosis and <b>Mad</b> <b>Cow</b> <b>diseases</b> are shown to result from misfunctioning of proteins. Problem statement: Protein folding problem {{is the process of}} predicting the optimal 3 D molecular structure of a protein, or tertiary structure, which is an indication of its proper function. Approach: An enhancement over persistent elitist compact genetic algorithm (pe-cGA) was made to minimize the energy of proteins indicating how far it is from its optimal 3 D structure. Energy was calculated using the Empirical Conformational Energy Program for Peptides (ECEPP) package. Results: Experiments were performed on the Met-enkephalin protein. The enhanced algorithm reached an energy of - 7. 378 in 140, 000 iterations surpassing the Distributed Genetic Algorithm (DGA) which reached the same energy in 700, 000 iterations. A comparison was also made with the Breeder Genetic Algorithm (BGA) which did not reach this energy in the first place. Conclusions/Recommendations: Results show that the enhanced algorithm is superior to DGA and BGA and a computational alternative to costly laboratory methods and an efficient means for solving organic docking problems...|$|R
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease,</b> and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland cattle in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (<b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease)</b> outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of Highland cattle for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{the use of}} {{meat and}} bone meal in cattle feed {{resulted}} in the world's first outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or, colloquially, <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease)</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|While {{it is true}} that {{receiving}} a unit of transfused blood in the US does not carry many risks, with only 10 to 20 deaths per million units, blood substitutes could eventually improve on this. There is no practical way to test for prion-transmitted diseases in donated blood, such as <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> and Creutzfeldt-Jakob <b>disease,</b> and other disease could emerge as problems for the blood supply, including smallpox and SARS.|$|R
40|$|A {{change of}} the prion protein {{conformation}} results {{in a class of}} neurodegenerative diseases called the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (like <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> and Creutzfeld–Jakob <b>diseases).</b> The function of the normal prion protein is unknown, although much of recent research demonstrates the it may be a copper binding protein selective for Cu(II). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) releases the 39 – 42 amino acid peptide, a major constituent of the deposit in plaques of Alzheimer disease brain. Also APP is a metal binding protein, including copper ions. The link between copper and both proteins may provide insight into the role of metals in neurodegenerative pathologies...|$|R
50|$|Despite all this, Osorno {{has seen}} some {{economic}} stagnation {{in the past}} several decades. Agriculture alone has not allowed it {{to keep pace with the}} booming, rapidly industrializing Chilean economy; Osorno lacks both industrial and information-services sectors. In one effort to combat this, the city has forged international business ties with several Dutch companies, after it was discovered that the local climate is ideal for the growing of tulips. Likewise, Osorno has recently entered the international meat market. Besides offering high-quality beef, the isolated region is also completely free of the recent rash of cattle plagues such as <b>Mad</b> <b>Cow</b> and foot-and-mouth <b>disease,</b> guaranteeing the safety of Chilean meats.|$|R

25|$|Ten {{days after}} the deal was {{formally}} signed, MBC’s current affairs program “PD Diary” aired a multi-part episode entitled “U.S. beef, is it safe from mad cow disease?” It was reported by MBC that Koreans carry a gene making them more susceptible to <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease</b> than Americans. This claim has since been retracted by MBC. MBC further devoted 15 out of 25 other news slots to publicizing the issue showing images of downer cows from England and U.S., and reporting information such as claiming that variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) is easily transmittable through methods including blood transfusions, eating instant noodles containing beef products and using cosmetics made with cow-derived collagen.|$|E
25|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), {{commonly known as}} <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease,</b> is a transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} and fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that may be passed to humans who have eaten infected flesh. BSE causes a spongiform degeneration {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. BSE has a long incubation period, of 2.5 to 5 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years. BSE is caused by a misfolded protein—a prion. In the United Kingdom, more than 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered during the eradication program. In France, the country worst affected overall, over 300,000 cases were identified, although most were not recorded at the time.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, {{under the}} pretext of concern about <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> <b>disease,</b> Ratsiraka {{obstructed}} Ravalomanana's {{plans to build a}} farm stocked with imported high-yield milk cows. Ravalomanana overcame the objection by breeding high-yield cows locally, thereby further boosting Tiko production. Later that same year, Ratsiraka's daughters began competing with Tiko by importing and reselling vegetable oil under the brand name [...] "Eden". When Norbert Ratsirahonana declared himself a candidate in the 1997 presidential elections against Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy, Ravalomanana provided significant financial contributions to the Ratsirahonana campaign in return for tax exemptions on his edible oil products for a period of five years. The profits he consequently earned were reinvested to create the Magro wholesale company in 1998.
