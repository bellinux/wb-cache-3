In this correlational study, the authors examined whether the relations between children's negative emotionality and problematic behavior (internalizing and externalizing) were partially mediated by parenting style (authoritative and authoritarian) in a community sample of 196 3 -year-old children and their mothers.

40|$|Reactive astrocytes are {{strongly}} induced by {{central nervous system}} (CNS) injury and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which we termed A 1, is induced by classically activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A 1 astrocytes by secreting Il- 1 α, TNF and C 1 q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A 1 astrocytes. A 1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A 1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A 1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A 1 astrocytes contribute {{to the death of}} neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.

This refers to the phenomenon whereby women are {{more likely than men to}} be appointed to leadership positions associated with increased risk of failure and criticism because these positions are more likely to involve management of organizational units that are in crisis. This paper presents three experimental studies (Ns= 95, 85, 83) that represent the first experimental investigations of the glass cliff phenomenon. In these, management graduates (Study 1), high-school students (Study 2) or business leaders (Study 3) selected a leader for a hypothetical organization whose performance was either improving or declining. Consistent with predictions, results indicate that the likelihood of a female candidate being selected ahead of an equally qualified male candidate increased when the organization's performance was declining rather than improving. Study 3 also provided evidence that glass cliff appointments are associated with beliefs that they (a) suit the distinctive leadership abilities of women, (b) provide women with good leadership opportunities and (c) are particularly stressful for women.

40|$|Trapping {{light with}} noble metal {{nanostructures}} overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically {{on the order}} of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual atomic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer ("picocavities"), enabling optical experiments on the atomic scale. These atomic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single atomic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10 $^{ 6 }$ enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds.

British Journal of Psychology, 106 : 635 – 655, which has been published in final form at doi: 10. 1111 /bjop. 12106. Women have made substantial inroads into some traditionally masculine occupations (e. g., accounting, journalism) but not into others (e. g., military, surgery). Evidence suggests the latter group of occupations is characterized by hyper-masculine 'macho' stereotypes that are especially disadvantageous to women. Here, we explore whether such macho occupational stereotypes may be especially tenacious, {{not just because of}} their impact on women, but also because of their impact on men. We examined whether macho stereotypes associated with marine commandos and surgeons discourage men who feel that they are 'not man enough'. Study 1 demonstrates that male new recruits' (N = 218) perceived lack of fit with masculine commandos was associated with reduced occupational identification and motivation. Study 2 demonstrates that male surgical trainees' (N = 117) perceived lack of fit with masculine surgeons was associated with reduced identification and increased psychological exit a year later.

Using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling, we classified GHS peptide and nonpeptide agonist binding {{in the context of}} its receptor environment. All peptide and nonpeptide ligand classes shared a common binding domain in transmembrane (TM) region 3 of the GHS-R. This finding was based on TM- 3 mutation E 124 Q, which eliminated the counter-ion to the shared basic N � group of all GHSs and resulted in a nonfunctional receptor. Restoration of function for the E 124 Q mutant was achieved by a complementary change in the MK- 0677 ligand through modification of its amine sidechain to the corresponding alcohol.

40|$|Fine non-biological {{particles}} {{small enough}} to be suspended in the air are continually inhaled as we breathe. These particles deposit on airway surfaces where they are either cleared by airway defences or can remain and affect lung health. Pollutant particles from vehicles, building processes and mineral and industrial dusts {{have the potential to}} cause both immediate and delayed health problems. Because of their small size, it has not been possible to non-invasively examine how individual particles deposit on live airways, or to consider how they behave on the airway surface after deposition. In this study, synchrotron phase-contrast X-ray imaging (PCXI) has been utilized to detect and monitor individual particle deposition. The in vitro detectability of a range of potentially respirable particulates was first determined. Of the particulates tested, only asbestos, quarry dust, fibreglass and galena (lead sulfate) were visible in vitro. These particulates were then examined after delivery into the nasal airway of live anaesthetized mice; all were detectable in vivo but each exhibited different surface appearances and behaviour along the airway surface. The two fibrous particulates appeared as agglomerations enveloped by fluid, while the non-fibrous particulates were present as individual particles. Synchrotron PCXI provides the unique ability to non-invasively detect and track deposition of individual particulates in live mouse airways. With further refinement of particulate sizing and delivery techniques, PCXI should provide a novel approach for live animal monitoring of airway particulates relevant to lung health. <b>M.</b> Donnelley, <b>K.</b> <b>S.</b> Morgan, <b>A.</b> Fouras, W.

The acute stress response functions to prioritize behavioural and physiological processes that maximize survival in the face of immediate threat. There is variation between individuals in the strength of the adult stress response that is of interest in both evolutionary biology and medicine. Age is an established source of this variation-stress responsiveness diminishes with increasing age in a range of species-but unexplained variation remains. Since individuals of the same chronological age may differ markedly in their pace of biological ageing, we asked whether biological age-measured here via erythrocyte telomere length-predicts variation in stress responsiveness in adult animals of the same chronological age. We studied two cohorts of European starlings in which we had previously manipulated the rate of biological ageing by experimentally altering the competition experienced by chicks in the fortnight following hatching. We predicted that individuals with greater developmental telomere attrition, and hence greater biological age, would show an attenuated corticosterone (CORT) response to an acute stressor when tested as adults. In both cohorts, we found that birds with greater developmental telomere attrition had lower peak CORT levels and a more negative change in CORT levels between 15 and 30  min following stress exposure. Our results, therefore, provide strong evidence that a measure of biological age explains individual variation in stress responsiveness: birds that were biologically older were less stress responsive. Our results provide a novel explanation for the phenomenon of developmental programming of the stress response: observed changes in stress physiology as a result of exposure to early-life adversity may reflect changes in ageing.

Perpendicular magnetic recording is currently very near to its physical limit, {{making it difficult}} for researchers to keep the pace of the growth of areal density of hard disk drives. Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is considered to be the next generation technology for magnetic recording beyond 1 Tb/in 2. Complete understanding of HAMR processes is necessary to optimize the design parameters. In this thesis, current state-of-the-art modelling methods are developed aiming at HAMR recording. First a simple torque-based method for calculating the transient behavior of temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropy is introduced. By using this method several physical quantities at finite temperature including effective anisotropy, anisotropy field, and their fluctuations are obtained. A composite grain that includes a high Curie temperature soft layer can reduce the anisotropy fluctuations. Then a new scheme for the simulation of HAMR that systematically includes fluctuating material properties above a predefined length scale, while retaining magnetostatic interactions is introduced. Renormalized media parameters, <b>M</b> <b>s,</b> <b>K</b> u, <b>A</b> ex and &alpha, suitable for useful length scales, are found numerically. These renormalized parameters are then used to model the Voronoi-cell-composed medium in the HAMR simulation. Transition jitters are obtained under various conditions. The results show that moderate maximum temperature of the heat spot, intergranular exchange coupling, media thickness of at least 10 nm, nonzero canting angle of the head field, relatively low head velocity, and large head-field strength are helpful for a successful recording. This scheme of HAMR simulation is used to find the dependencies of recording performance on the grain size and damping. The simulated results are used to compare with an experimental demonstration. Finally, composite FeRh/FePt for HAMR media is investigated with micromagnetic simulation. It is found to potentially lower recording temperature, while retaining high anisotropy field gradient. The transition width is predicted to depend on the media cooling rate. The thickness of the FeRh layer and the applied field can significantly affect the switching time of FePt layer, and therefore alter recording performance. Applied field magnitudes and angles are identified that allow successful switching within 100 pS. It is shown that by using up to 15 nm of FeRh with 6 nm of FePt, the jitter for 5. 6 nm grains can be nearly equal to the grain-size limited value, for head velocities as high as 20 m/s...|$|R

Atomic layers containing hybridized domains of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BNC) constitute {{a new kind of}} disordered 2 D electronic system. Magnetoelectric transport measurements performed at low temperature in vapor phase synthesized h-BNC atomic layers show a clear and anomalous transition from an insulating to a metallic behavior upon cooling. The observed insulator to metal transition can be modulated by electron and hole doping and by the application of an external magnetic field. These results supported by ab initio calculations suggest that this transition in h-BNC has distinctly different characteristics when compared to other 2 D electron systems and {{is the result of the}} coexistence between two distinct mechanisms, namely, percolation through metallic graphene networks and hopping conduction between edge states on randomly distributed insulating h-BN domains. © 2012 American Physical Society.
