25|$|Undercuts on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} undercuts, where external undercuts are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior undercuts are {{on the inside of the}} part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the <b>molded</b> <b>part</b> due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|E
25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a <b>molded</b> <b>part</b> to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E

The quality of the microchannels and through-holes was observed with optical microscope and SEM images. A part-to-part variation analysis was conducted for ten parts by averaging the channel height, channel width, and hole diameter measurements obtained with an optical profilometer. The results were compared to a research study previously conducted on hot embossed and through-hole punched parts. The walls of the injection molded microchannels were observed to be smoother than the hot embossed microchannels, but ridges were detected on the outmost channels of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> which resulted in measurement errors. The through-holes of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> formed completely, without burrs or flash, {{in contrast to the}} through-hole punched parts where the quality of the hole varied by the substrate material. The average variance ratio of the channel height and width of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> was 0. 83 % and 0. 21 % respectively, when the sites containing ridges (sites 1 and 4 of the top side) {{were not included in the}} calculation. The average channel height variance ratios were approximately the same for injection molding and hot embossing, while injection molding had less than half the variance ratio for the channel width. The hole diameter variance ratios of the injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> averaged 0. 094 %, making it better than the other dimensions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{report was}} carried out to study {{experimentally}} the water-assisted injection molding process of glass fiber-reinforced polyamide- 6 (Nylon- 6) composites. Experiments were carried out on an 80 ton injection molding machine equipped with a lab scale water injection system, which included a water pump, a water injection pin, a pressure accumulator, a water tank equipped with a temperature regulator, and a control circuit. The materials used were Nylon and 30 % glass fiber-filled Nylon composites. A spiral mold cavity was used to mold the composites. After molding, the lengths of water penetration in <b>molded</b> <b>parts</b> were measured. The effects of different processing parameters on the lengths of water penetration were determined: melt temperature, mold temperature, melt-filling speed, short-shot size, water pressure, water temperature, water hold, and water injection delay time. Mechanical property tests were performed on the water-assisted injection <b>molded</b> <b>parts.</b> X-ray diffraction was also employed to identify the structural parameters of the materials. In addition, the in-mold temperature distribution of the polymeric materials during the cooling process was measured.
