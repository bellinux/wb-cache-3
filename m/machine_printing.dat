40|$|Abstract The {{convenience}} of search, {{both on the}} personal computer hard disk {{as well as on}} the web, is still limited mainly to <b>machine</b> <b>printed</b> text documents and images because of the poor accuracy of handwriting recognizers. The focus of research in this paper is the segmentation of handwritten text and <b>machine</b> <b>printed</b> text from annotated documents sometimes referred to as the task of “ink separation” to advance the state-of-art in realizing search of hand-annotated documents. We propose a method which contains two main steps—patch level separation and pixel level separation. In the patch level separation step, the entire document is modeled as a Markov Random Field (MRF). Three different classes (<b>machine</b> <b>printed</b> text, handwritten text and overlapped text) are initially identified using G-means based classification followed by a MRF based relabeling procedure. A MRF based classification approach is then used to separate overlapped text into <b>machine</b> <b>printed</b> text and handwritten text using pixel level features forming the second step of the method. Experimental results on a set of machine-printed documents which have been annotated by multiple writers in an office/collaborative environment show that our method is robust and provides good text separation performance...|$|R

50|$|On {{the date}} of the drawing, the Maragos {{brothers}} travelled around Pennsylvania buying large quantities of tickets containing the eight possible numbers. The investigation was broken open when an anonymous tip led to a bar near Philadelphia where the brothers had bought a large number of lottery tickets. An employee remembered the brothers coming into the bar with a platinum-blonde woman and laying down a large amount of cash to buy lottery tickets, all on the eight specific numbers. The employee recalled that while he printed the tickets, one of the brothers made a pay phone call, spoke in a foreign language, and held up the phone so the listener could hear the lottery <b>machine</b> <b>printing</b> the tickets. Investigators pulled the phone records and traced the call to the WTAE-TV announcer's booth in the studio where the drawing was done. This strongly implicated Perry (who, like the Maragoses, could speak fluent Greek), but it was also clear that he could not have acted alone. Further investigation and questioning of the Maragos brothers eventually implicated the rest of the men. William Moran of Fairmont, West Virginia organized the out-of-state buying of additional lottery tickets for a numbers-running scam.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} system that classifies pixels in a {{document}} image according to marking type such as <b>machine</b> <b>print,</b> handwriting, and noise. A segmenter module first splits an input image into fragments, sometimes breaking connected components. Each fragment is then classified by an automatically trained multi-stage classifier that is fast and considers features of the fragment, {{as well as its}} neighborhood. Features relevant for discrimination are picked out automatically from among hundreds of measurements. Our system is trainable from example images in which each foreground pixel has a “ground-truth ” label. The main distinction of our system is the level of accuracy achieved in classifying fragments at sub-connected component level, rather than larger aggregate groups such as words or text-lines. We have trained this system to detect handwriting, <b>machine</b> <b>print</b> text, <b>machine</b> <b>print</b> graphics, and noise. ...|$|R

Trained Fisher classifiers are used to identify <b>machine</b> <b>printed</b> text and handwriting from noise and we further exploit context to refine the classification.

They are set in 10pt Baskerville with no italic, except for the book or journal titles listed in the acknowledgements; no bold; and no colour, except for Flame Red for the title on the title page and a stripe of etching down the front cover printed in Ruby Red.This stripe - an etching by Robin Wallace-Crabbe - matches similar etching stripes also drawn by Wallace-Crabbe on sixteen of the forty pages of text. Each stripe bleeds off the fore-edge and, indeed, bleeds over onto the next page. So there are eight etchings, each providing two stripes. The etchings were printed first on an etching press followed by the text printed on a flatbed <b>machine.</b> <b>Printing</b> is on one side only of each sheet of Magnani paper, which is folded and bound with Japanese stabs into the spine of the French false cover.

50|$|The Reichswehr (Army of the Weimar Republic) started {{experimenting with}} {{camouflage}} patterns for Wehrmacht uniforms before World War II, and some army units used Splittertarnmuster ("splinter camouflage pattern"), first issued in 1931, {{and based on}} Zeltbahn shelter halves/groundsheets. Waffen-SS combat units used various patterns from 1935 onwards. The SS camouflage patterns were designed by Johann Georg Otto Schick, a Munich art professor and then {{the director of the}} German camouflage research unit, at the request of an SS Major, Wim Brandt. Brandt was an engineer and the commander of the SS-VT reconnaissance battalion, and he was looking for better camouflage. Schick had researched the effect of light on trees in summer and in autumn. These led to the idea of reversible camouflage clothing, with green summer patterns on one side, brown autumn patterns on the other. In 1937, the patterns were field tested by the SS-VT Deutschland regiment, resulting in an estimate that they would cut casualties by fifteen percent. In 1938, a reversible spring/autumn helmet cover, smock, and sniper's face mask in Schick's forest patterns on waterproof cotton duck were patented for the Waffen-SS. The patent is said to have prevented the Wehrmacht from using the patterns, which became a distinctive emblem of the Waffen-SS during the war. Production of groundsheets, helmet covers and smocks by the Warei, Forster and Joring companies began in November 1938. They were initially hand-printed, limiting deliveries by January 1939 to only 8,400 groundsheets and 6,800 helmet covers and a small number of smocks. By June 1940, <b>machine</b> <b>printing</b> had taken over, and 33,000 smocks were made for the Waffen-SS. Supplies of high quality cotton duck, however, remained critically short throughout the war, and essentially ran out in January 1943. It was replaced by non-waterproof cotton drill cloth.|$|E

Results showed that most printers ’ ecological impacts were dominated by electricity use, not materials, and the changes in electricity use due to different plastics was not significant compared to variation from one machine to another. Variation in machine idle time determined impacts per part most strongly. However, material impacts were quite important for the inkjet printer hacked to print in salt: In its optimal scenario, it had up to 1 / 38 th the impacts coreper part as the worst-performing machine in the same scenario.

40|$|Abstract: This paper reports an {{investigation}} of some methods for isolating, or segmenting, characters during the reading of machineprinted text by optical character recognition systems. Two new segmentation algorithms using feature extraction techniques are presented; both are intended {{for use in the}} recognition of machine-printed lines of lo-, 11 - and 12 -pitch serif-type multifont characters. One of the methods, called quasi-topological segmentation, bases the decision to “section ” a character on a combination of featureextraction and character-width measurements. The other method, topological segmentation, involves feature extraction alone. The algorithms have been tested with an evaluation method that is independent of any particular recognition system. Test results are based on application of the algorithm to upper-case alphanumeric characters gathered from print sources that represent the existing world of <b>machine</b> <b>printing.</b> The topological approach demonstrated better performance on the test data than did the quasitopological approach...|$|E

40|$|As {{a former}} {{employee}} of Cranston Printworks and a current professor at the University of Rhode Island, Richard Malachowski provided a detailed history and overview of textile printing. Printing dates back 2000 years to the Chinese culture. Printings during early times were created manually, by stencils, or by blocks. The dyes used in this time period were derived from natural resources, such as roots or bark. “Industrial Printing” did not develop until 1690, when Richmond on Thames, the first printing company, opened in England. The revolution of <b>machine</b> <b>printing</b> began when engraved copper rollers were created in 1783. This technology lasted for about one hundred and eighty years. The dyes, however, did evolve over time. There were synthetic dyes created during this industrial revolution. Richard Malachowski included a photo of copper rollers in use at Cranston Printworks. It wasn’t until 1963 that copper rollers became outdated technology. Taking over in copper rollers place was rotary screen-printing, which is now the dominant method that is used...|$|E
