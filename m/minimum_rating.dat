40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a scalable maxmin flow control protocol which guarantees the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> for each connection-oriented flow without requiring per-flow information. The protocol is called MR-ASAP (<b>Minimum</b> <b>Rate</b> guaranteeing Adaptive Source-link Accounting Protocol). MR-ASAP {{is an extension}} of ASAP [Tsa 98 a, Kim 99], the first exact maxmin flow control protocol for best-effort connection-oriented traffic in integrated service networks, without requiring per-flow accounting at the intermediate network node. In the classical maxmin computation, only the maximum rate constraints are considered; in this pa-per the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> requirements are treated similarly as the maximum rate constraints. Existing proto-cols that achieve exact maxmin optimality with <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee require per-flow information and complex computation such as sorting of the <b>minimum</b> <b>rates</b> at the switch. By generalizing the concept of constraint, the complex sorting and per-flow accounting required in the existing protocols are avoided. Simulation demonstrates fast convergence to optimality. The convergence of MR-ASAP is also proved analytically. Key words: Generalized maxmin, flow control, and <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee. 1...|$|R

40|$|Annual <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> {{of return}} {{guarantees}} are analyzed together with rules for distribution of positive excess return, i. e. investment returns {{in excess of}} the guaranteed minimum return. Together with the level of the annual <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee both the customer's and the insurer's fractions of the positive excess return are determined so that the market value of the insurer's capital inflow (determined by the fraction of the positive excess return) equals the market value of the insurer's capital outflow (determined by the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee) at the inception of the contract. The analysis is undertaken both with and without a surplus distribution mechanism. The surplus distribution mechanism works through a bonus account that serves as a buffer in the following sense: in ("bad") years when the investment returns are lower than the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee, funds are transferred from the bonus account to the customer's account. In ("good") years when the investment returns are above the <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee, a part of the positive excess return is credited to the bonus account. In addition to characterizations of fair combinations of the level of the annual <b>minimum</b> <b>rate</b> of return guarantee and the sharing rules of the positive excess return, our analysis indicates that the presence of a surplus distribution mechanism allows the insurer to offer a much wider menu of contracts to the customer than without a surplus distribution mechanism...|$|R
