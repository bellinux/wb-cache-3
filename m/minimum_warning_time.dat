40|$|It {{is shown}} through some {{preliminary}} flight measurement research that a forward looking infrared radiometer (FLIR) {{system can be}} used to successfully detect the cool downdraft of downbursts (microbusts/macrobursts) and thunderstorm gust front outflows that are responsible for most of the low altitude wind shear (LAWS) events. The FLIR system provides a much greater safety margin for the pilot than that provided by reactive designs such as inertial air speed systems. Preliminary results indicate that an advanced airborne FLIR system could provide the pilot with remote indication of microburst (MB) hazards along the flight path ahead of the aircraft. Results of a flight test of a prototype FLIR system show that a <b>minimum</b> <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> of one to four minutes (5 to 10 km), depending on aircraft speed, is available to the pilot prior to the microburst encounter...|$|E

30|$|The {{requirement}} for extra <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> for pedestrians and motorists in grade crossings of high-speed rail operations {{is emerging as}} an additional issue for safety upgrades at such crossings. Currently, the typical <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> at crossings where pedestrians may be present is between 20 and 30  s for conventional speed trains. In an environment with 110  mile an hour trains, {{there would be a}} need to provide confirmation signals to the train crew and the onboard computer that the crossing is clear likely requiring a <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> of at least 80  s. The question about how pedestrians will react to such extended <b>warning</b> <b>times</b> at pedestrian crossings remains to be determined. This is because currently most of the <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> is built into the time that the train occupies the crossing. When high-speed trains begin to operate, most of the <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> is going to be built into the time for the train approaching the crossing. Therefore, there would be an extended <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> where the crossing remains unoccupied while a high-speed train cannot even be seen on the horizon. This situation will require “reeducation” of the public, especially in areas where crossings are very near to each other.|$|R

40|$|A lane {{departure}} {{warning system}} (LDWS) should give as much <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> as possible, while triggering few, if any, false alarms. In this paper, a virtual lane boundary based LDWS (VLWM) is proposed to approach this goal. VLWM allows the driver to drift beyond the physical lane boundary by adding a virtual lane boundary. Accounting for the driving habit of the driver, lane geometry, and the local driver behavior changes, the virtual lane width is determined using a fuzzy-logic inference method. When the vehicle is predicted to exceed the virtual lane boundary, an alarm is triggered. Real world driving data are {{used to test the}} LDWSs. Compared with time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) based method, the VLWM has a much lower false alarm rate, while their <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> is almost similar.

40|$|Tangjiashan Landslide Dam, with {{a height}} of 82 - 124 m, a volume of 20. 4 million m 3 and a {{reservoir}} volume of 316 million m 3, is the largest landslide dam induced by the Ms 8. 0 Wenchuan Earthquake on 12 May 2008. The breaching of the dam threatens more than 1. 3 million people downstream. This paper outlines a procedure to estimate the loss of lives (LOL) due to various potential modes of failure of the landslide dam. A regression model with parameters of population at risk (PAR), <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> (WT) is studied. Based on empirical breach parameters, analysis of flood routing in the river downstream the dam is performed using a river analysis program, HEC-RAS. Both the real failure scenario and two assumed overtopping failure scenarios are considered. The inundation area and <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> for each affected zone in each scenario are obtained. A physical model is selected to obtain the population at risk based on historical data and the information of water depth, flow velocity, <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> etc from the analyses using HEC-RAS.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Motorists deciding to drive around lowered gates at gated active highway-railroad grade crossings are likely one of the main contributors to many of the accidents that occur at these crossings. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop relationships between these violations and the geometric and operational characteristics that exist at gated active highway-railroad grade crossings. Data was collected using a remote video recording system. Train speed, <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> length, impedance, exposure, AADT per lane, number of highway lanes, false activations, number of tracks, <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> device type (constant versus fixed-distance), and adequacy of sight distance were the variables investigated in this study. The data was analyzed using both a site-specific approach and an arrival-specific approach. These approaches investigated the influence of average site characteristics and the specific conditions present during each train-vehicle arrival, respectively. It was found that the frequency of violations before the gates were fully lowered is almost exclusively a function of the exposure. Train speed and <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> length were found to be the variables that most influenced violations occurring after the gates were fully lowered, but before the train arrived. Variables that also significantly impacted the frequency and likelihood of this type of violation included false activations, number of tracks, and the variability in <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> (the presence of constant or fixed-distance <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> devices). Violations occurring after the train passed through the crossing occurred only on rare occasions. It appeared that violations of this type were influenced by longer than average train delays and delays due to the gate arms remaining down for an were developed to predict the number of violations expected during a 24 hour period. It was recommended that a similar modeling procedure be used as a surrogate to accident prediction models to estimate the degree of hazard presented by a given highway-railroad grade crossing. It also was recommended that constant <b>warning</b> <b>time</b> devices be used whenever feasible with priority given to crossings with multiple tracks and/or average train speeds below 35 km/hr...|$|R
