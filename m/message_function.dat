40|$|It is {{proposed}} that a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) {{is used to}} perform turbo equalization in a system transmitting information over a Rayleigh fading multipath channel. The DBN turbo equalizer (DBN-TE) is modeled on a single directed acyclic graph by relaxing the Markov assumption and allowing weak connections to past and future states. Its complexity is exponential in encoder constraint length and approximately linear in the channel memory length. Results show that {{the performance of the}} DBN-TE closely matches that of a traditional turbo equalizer that uses a maximum a posteriori equalizer and decoder pair.

30|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} {{decentralized}} estimation for a deterministic parameter using digital communications over orthogonal multiple-access fading channels with a multiple-bit quantizer. By introducing a general <b>messaging</b> <b>function,</b> the proposed estimators {{can be applied}} for various quantization, coding and modulation schemes, including AF transmission, binary quantization and with or without training symbols.|$|R
30|$|We {{strive for}} {{deriving}} MLEs and feasible suboptimal estimator when different local processing and communication strategies are used. To this end, we first present a general <b>message</b> <b>function</b> to represent various quantization and transmission schemes. We then derive the MLE for an unknown parameter with known CSI at the FC.|$|E
30|$|In {{practical}} WSNs, the FC {{usually has}} no CSI, and the sensors can transmit training symbols to facilitate channel estimation. The training symbols {{can be incorporated}} into the <b>message</b> <b>function</b> c(x). Then, the MLE with training symbols available is a special form of the MLE with unknown CSI. We will derive the MLE with unknown CSI with general c(x) in the following and derive that with training symbols in c(x) in next subsection.|$|E

While facilitators often invited participants to “chime” or “check in,” only eight messages were coded as “chimes,” meaning they did only what facilitators asked by responding with a simple update on their courses.|$|E
5000|$|According to Shockley-Zalabak, The Functional Tradition is [...] "a way of {{understanding}} organizational communication by describing what messages do and how they move through organizations". There are different functions within this process that all work together {{to contribute to the}} overall success of the organization, and these functions occur during the repetition of communication patterns in which the members of the organization engage in. The first types of <b>functions</b> are <b>message</b> <b>functions</b> which are [...] "What communication does or how it contributes to the overall functioning of the organization", and we describe <b>message</b> <b>functions</b> in three different categories which are organizational functions, relationship functions, and change functions. Organizing functions as Shockley-Zalabak states, are [...] "Messages that establish the rules and regulations of a particular environment". These messages can include items such as newsletters or handbooks for a specific organization, that individuals can read to learn the policies and expectations for a certain company. Relationship functions are [...] "Communication that helps individuals define their roles and assess the compatibility of individual and organizational goals". These relationship functions are a key aspect to how individuals identify with a company and it helps them develop their sense of belonging which can greatly influence their quality of work. The third and final subcategory within <b>message</b> <b>functions</b> are change functions, which are defined as [...] "messages that help organizations adapt what they do and how they do it". Change messages occur in various choice making decisions, and they are essential to meet the employee's needs as well as have success with continual adaptations within the organization.|$|R

We analyzed the effects of the writers' characteristics (age, gender, and SMS-messaging experience) on message length (number of characters and number of words), dialogue structure (with or without an opening and a closing), and <b>message</b> <b>function</b> (informative vs. relational). The SMS messages were produced in a realworld situation. We found differences across writers’ characteristics for all the dependant variables. The commonly reported distinctions between girls and boys were mitigated. Moreover, for dialogical structure, the messages differed from those found in traditional oral and written interactions since 73 % of them did not have the conventional opening-messageclosing format (the opening and/or the closing was missing). The results are discussed in terms of the specific characteristics that define the SMS register, and potentially relevant approaches to be taken in future research are addressed...|$|E
