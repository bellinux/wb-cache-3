5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise orbital parameters which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
40|$|Many physics {{analyses}} at ATLAS {{are dependent}} on the delivery of high quality tracking performance from the Inner Detector. This performance can be substantially degraded by <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> the Inner Detector modules which are not corrected for by the alignment procedure. In this note we show results {{from a number of}} studies into the impact <b>of</b> <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> the Inner Detector on physics and performance. Both random and global systematic <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> the Inner Detector are used in these studies. Their impact on Z->mumu reconstruction using Inner Detector tracks, B-physics observables and Tau identification and rejection performance are investigated...|$|R

5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E
5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused the calendar to become neglected. The calendar required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the calendar, an intercalary month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was looking for any excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, that he would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{mechanical}} {{breaking of}} the axonal cytoskeleton, DAI pathology also includes secondary physiological changes such as interrupted axonal transport, progressive swellings and degeneration.

40|$|Linear {{equations}} {{of motion}} are derived that describe small-amplitude centroid oscillations induced by displacement and rotational <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> the focusing solenoids in the transport lattice, dipole steering elements, and initial centroid offset errors. These equations are analyzed in a local rotating Larmor frame to derive complex-variable "alignment functions" and "bending functions" that efficiently describe {{the characteristics of the}} centroid oscillations induced by mechanical <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> the solenoids and dipole steering elements. The alignment and bending functions depend only on properties of the ideal lattice in the absence of errors and steering and have associated expansion amplitudes set by the misalignments and steering fields. Applications of this formulation are presented for statistical analysis of centroid deviations, calculation <b>of</b> actual lattice <b>misalignments</b> from centroid measurements, and optimal beam steering...|$|R

40|$|The main linac 30 GHz RF source called drive beam {{consists}} in {{a succession of}} structures resonating at this frequency, loaded by convenient trains of high charge bunches for transfer of the energy (group velocity # 0) to the structures of the main linac. Maximum efficiency is obtained if one can focus the drive beam {{up to the point}} where particles with minimum energy reach energy zero. At this point, some particles still have their initial energy, then all the spectrum is represented. The challenge is to keep the beam envelope within the iris, with this chromaticity, with the <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> beam at entry, <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> structures and quadrupoles, and also with the transverse wake they create.

These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface, <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.|$|E

25|$|The {{chain drive}} {{improved}} comfort and speed, as the drive {{was transferred to}} the non-steering rear wheel and allowed for smooth, relaxed and injury free pedaling (earlier designs that required pedalling the steering front wheel were difficult to pedal while turning, due to the <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> rotational planes of leg and pedal). With easier pedaling, the rider more easily turned corners.|$|E
40|$|Microelectromechanical systems {{production}} {{is still an}} immature technology compared to the classical semiconductor industry. MEMS fabrication and packaging processes may present misalignments which result in an improper placement of the internal microstructures or dies. In this work, the possibilities <b>of</b> diagnosing mechanical <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> dual axis IC accelerometers are explored. The used method dynamically correlates the two output signals in orthogonal directions. This leads to a Lissajous composition which is able to manifest the actual level <b>of</b> <b>misalignment.</b> The definition <b>of</b> a metric and its variation rate study allows the diagnosis procedure. Experimental results using a commercial dual axis capacitive accelerometer reveal diagnosis discrepancies as low as 1. 1...|$|R
40|$|Backpack laser {{scanning}} systems have emerged recently enabling fast {{data collection and}} flexibility to make measurements also in areas that cannot be reached with, for example, vehicle-based laser scanners. Backpack {{laser scanning}} systems have been developed both for indoor and outdoor use. We have developed a quality analysis {{process in which the}} quality of backpack laser scanning data is evaluated in the forest environment. The reference data was collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) laser scanning system. The workflow included noise filtering, division of data into smaller patches, ground point extraction, ground data decimation, and ICP registration. As a result, we managed to observe the <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> backpack laser scanning data for 97 patches each including data from circa 10 seconds period of time. This evaluation revealed initial average <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> 0. 227 m, 0. 073 and - 0. 083 in the easting, northing and elevation directions, respectively. Furthermore, backpack data was corrected according to the ICP registration results. Our correction algorithm utilized the time-based linear transformation of backpack laser scanning point clouds. After the correction of data, the ICP registration was run again. This revealed remaining misalignments between the corrected backpack laser scanning data and the original UAV data. We found average <b>misalignments</b> <b>of</b> 0. 084, 0. 020 and - 0. 005 meters in the easting, northing and elevation directions, respectively...|$|R

25|$|A 90° {{twist of}} the C=C bond (which may be {{determined}} by the positions of the groups attached to the carbons) requires less energy than the strength of a pi bond, and the bond still holds. This contradicts a common textbook assertion that the p orbitals would be unable sustain such a bond. In truth, the <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the p orbitals is less than expected because pyramidalization takes place (See: pyramidal alkene). trans-Cyclooctene is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19° with a dihedral angle of 137° (normal 120°) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18°. The trans isomer of cycloheptene is stable only at low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|In {{an ideal}} doped fiber without {{birefringence}}, the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers {{small amounts of}} birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to polarization mode dispersion) produce a <b>misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG {{is very difficult to}} observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).|$|E
25|$|Working {{extended}} {{hours or}} overnight shifts also poses the added difficulty of requiring performance from an individual at a time with the body is driven to sleep by the circadian system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning {{are determined by the}} interaction of two processes: the endogenous circadian pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. <b>Misalignment</b> <b>of</b> the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.|$|E
