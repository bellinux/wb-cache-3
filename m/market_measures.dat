40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} some {{insights}} into the acceptability of <b>marketing</b> <b>measures</b> in public transport. In a stated choice experiment {{respondents were asked to}} evaluate three different measures: fare adjustment, seat guarantee, and extra service. All <b>marketing</b> <b>measures</b> were specified in combination with a certain time period and number of bus lines. More than 560 respondents living in the region of North-Holland participated in the experiment. The choices were analyzed using binary logit models. The results indicate that respondents are not very sensitive to differences in time period, number of bus lines, and the distinguished levels of the <b>marketing</b> <b>measures.</b> The most important measure is fare adjustment. Some differences between public transport users and non-users are found. Public transport users prefer a fare adjustment on one specific bus line most. Respondents who do not use public transport prefer a 100 percent seat guarantee during 12 months on all bus lines...|$|R

If there is a unique probability measure that must be used to price assets in a market, then the market is called a complete market.|$|E

Results of the study indicate that director ownership and foreign ownership have non-linear relationship with MTBV using quadratic function. While family ownership and ownership by government-linked investment companies have linear relationship. Director ownership has negative relationship which indicate the entrenchment effect at the lower stake. However, director ownership has positive relationship meaning the alignment effect occurs at the higher stake. However, foreign ownership has alignment effect at the lower stake and entrenchment effect at the higher stake. Government-linked investment companies has negative relationship.
