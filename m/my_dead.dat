25|$|Some {{material}} in Over <b>My</b> <b>Dead</b> Body would in later decades be thought inappropriate {{at the very}} least. There is a minor character who is described {{in a way that}} brings Steppin Fetchit to mind. And Stout puts seven consecutive ethnic epithets in Cramer's mouth, at least five of which would in later years be considered offensive.|$|E
500|$|Bouchard {{was a tough}} {{opponent}} even {{outside of}} hockey. When the Mafia {{of the day in}} Montreal attempted to intimidate him into hiring their people for his restaurant, Bouchard invited the head man to Chez Butch Bouchard for dinner. Bouchard's wife, Marie-Claire, recalled he told them, [...] "Il lui a dit over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body. Je n'embaucherai jamais un de tes hommes." [...] which translates [...] "Over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body, I will never hire one of your men." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Detroit's declaration of bankruptcy, Paul stated {{he would not}} allow the government to attempt to bail out Detroit. In a phone interview with Breitbart News on July 19, 2013, Paul said, [...] "I basically say he is bailing them out over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body, because we don't have any money in Washington." [...] Paul said he thought a federal bailout would send {{the wrong message to}} other cities with financial problems.|$|E
500|$|Although Saprang and General Sonthi accused Thaksin of {{insulting}} and disrespecting King Bhumibol, {{he noted}} that the junta did not pursue lèse majesté charges against Thaksin because [...] "the police corrupted the evidence", and delivered such a weak case that the attorney-general could not file a lawsuit. [...] A vocal self-proclaimed royalist, he insisted that various groups actively tried to challenge the monarchy, and that he [...] "couldn't stand it." [...] He noted, [...] "I am a soldier, born to protect the Crown. They could only challenge the monarchy over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body." ...|$|E
500|$|Hancock began filming in June 1977. However, {{after nearly}} a month of filming, Universal and MCA {{executives}} disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress Lorraine Gary (Ellen Brody), [...] "should {{go out on a}} boat and help to rescue the kids." [...] When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, [...] "Over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body." [...] The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress {{who turned out to be}} a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{choice of}} burial site proved {{controversial}} and proposals {{were made for}} Richard {{to be buried in}} places which some felt were more fitting for a Roman Catholic and Yorkist monarch. Online petitions were launched calling for Richard to be buried in Westminster Abbey, where 17 other English and British kings are interred; York Minster, which some claimed was Richard's own preferred burial site; the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral; or in the Leicester car park in which his body was found. Only two options received significant public support, with Leicester receiving 3,100 more signatures than York. The issue was discussed in the Houses of Parliament; the Conservative MP and historian Chris Skidmore proposed that a state funeral should be held, while John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, suggested that the body should be buried in Worksop in his constituency—halfway between York and Leicester. All options were rejected in Leicester, whose mayor Peter Soulsby retorted: [...] "Those bones leave Leicester over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body." ...|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{included}} {{a recording of}} [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] on their 1965 debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day. The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him [...] "The only way you're {{going to get through}} that door is over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body...You're going to stay in this room until you do the vocal." [...] According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer [...] "got it all out and sang like an angel." ...|$|E
500|$|After Fox {{dropped the}} film in early 2000 and before USA Films {{expressed}} interest soon after, Soderbergh paid for pre-production with his own money. USA Films agreed to give him final cut on Traffic and also agreed to his term that all the Mexican characters would speak Spanish while talking to each other. This meant {{that almost all of}} Benicio del Toro's dialogue would be subtitled. Once the studio realized this, they suggested that his scenes be shot in both English and Spanish, but Soderbergh and del Toro rejected the suggestion. Del Toro, a native of Puerto Rico, was worried that another actor would be brought in and re-record his dialogue in English after he had worked hard to master Mexican inflections and improve his Spanish vocabulary. Del Toro remembers, [...] "Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your voice? I said, 'No way. Over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body.' Steven was like, 'Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.'" [...] The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the [...] "impenetrability of another culture".|$|E

500|$|Business negotiations, {{allegations}} of sexual impropriety, alcohol and non-prescription drug use were sources of tension between the Maharishi and the Beatles. Aspinall was surprised when he realised the Maharishi was a sophisticated negotiator, knowing {{more than the average}} person about financial percentages. [...] Evans told Saltzman that the Maharishi wanted the band to deposit up to 25% of their next album's profits in his Swiss bank account as a tithe, to which Lennon replied, [...] "Over <b>my</b> <b>dead</b> body". Mardas pointed to the luxury of the facility and the business acumen of the Maharishi and asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Mardas said the Maharishi offered him money to build a high-powered radio station. Lennon later told his wife that he felt that the Maharishi had, in her words, [...] "too much interest in public recognition, celebrities and money" [...] for a spiritual man. According to her sister, Pattie Boyd had dreamt that [...] "the Maharishi wasn't what he seemed". Cynthia Lennon, Cooke de Herrera and authors such as Barry Miles have blamed Mardas for turning Lennon against the Maharishi but Mardas denied this. Meanwhile, the weather, which had been quite cool in February, was growing hot [...] and the Maharishi was planning to move the whole group to Kashmir, at a higher and cooler altitude in a week.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics, recognizing {{it as one}} of the most powerful intros to a hip-hop album in years. In her review of the album, Erika Ramirez of Billboard said of the song: [...] "Drake is aware of his greatness, and makes sure listeners are just as aware from the jump." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust commended the song for being a strong opener, similar to his other album opener's; [...] "Fireworks" [...] and [...] "Over <b>My</b> <b>Dead</b> Body". Unterberger praised the use of the Whitney Houston sample, and finished his review as saying: [...] "How much time is Drake spending on the intro? As much time as he goddamn pleases, and if he wants to go an hour on the beat, we’ll listen for the whole thing and not check our watch once." [...] Writing for Spin, Brandon Soderberg included [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] as one of the [...] "Rap Songs of the Week", calling it [...] "expertly conceptualized" [...] and praised it as properly introducing the album. Will Lavin of Gigwise gave the song a positive review, noting Drake's in depth discussions about his label, his friends, and his peers. Lavin went on to say: [...] "For Drake, when it comes to album openers, his track record is thought provokingly flawless." ...|$|E
