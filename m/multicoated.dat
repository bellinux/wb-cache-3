25|$|MINOX M.D.C, 1992–1995. This is the {{flagship}} of Minox 35mm series. MDC differs {{from all other}} models by its anodized aluminium shell over Macrolon body; with two styles: a gold plated model and a titanium coated model. MDC has a <b>multicoated</b> Minoxar 35mm/2.8 lens, all other functions are identical to Minox 35ML. Due to the extra metal shell, the dimension of Minox M.D.C is slightly larger than other Minox 35 cameras.|$|E
50|$|The Iscorama 36 was a re-badged {{version of}} the Cinegon {{anamorphic}} adapter, and was available in both <b>multicoated</b> and non <b>multicoated</b> versions. There are unsubstantiated reports that ISCO produced a batch of Iscorama 36s with a 1.33x horizontal stretch ratio.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{indicate that}} the polymer coatings used to protect steel structures from corrosive environments are rarely one-component systems. Polymeric blends used to protect the structures are a mixture of atleast two polymers or copolymers. The heterophase polymer blends are known as polymer-polymer composites (PPC). The advantages of PPC coatings in comparison to <b>multicoat</b> system are high thickness per coat, excellent protection and superior layer adhesion. Presents a study in which a poly (epoxy-chlorinated rubber-silicone) PPC coating was prepared and its chemical resistance properties in acid, alkali and neutral solutions were studied. Different combinations of these three binders were also prepared in toluene:acetone solvent mixture and the chemical resistance properties of these PPCs were evaluated {{in comparison with the}} corresponding <b>multicoat</b> system with the same thickness. Finds that the PPCs show superior properties when compared to <b>multicoat</b> systems. Studies the electrochemical behaviour such as potential, resistance and capacitance of the PPCs and the <b>multicoat</b> systems on stee...|$|R

50|$|The M7 offers {{viewfinder}}s with magnifications 0.58, 0.72 (28 mm) and 0.85 (35 mm). The viewfinder optics are <b>multicoated</b> {{to reduce}} flare.|$|E
50|$|This is {{an update}} of the Super-Angulon lens design, {{incorporating}} modern glass and <b>multicoating</b> technologies, and an expanded angle of coverage.|$|R
50|$|This is a 6-element, 4-group {{apochromatic lens}} design, {{which has since}} been {{replaced}} by the Apo-Symmar L-Series. Using low-dispersion glass and <b>multicoating</b> techniques, secondary-spectrum reflections have been greatly reduced. The Apo-Symmar lenses up to 360 mm have a 72° angle of coverage, and the 480 mm lenses give a 56° angle.|$|R
50|$|With {{computer-aided}} design, aspherics, <b>multicoating,</b> {{very high}} refraction/low dispersion glass and unlimited budget, {{it is now}} possible to control the monochromatic aberrations to almost any arbitrary limit - subject to the absolute diffraction limit demanded by the laws of physics. However, chromatic aberrations remain resistant to these solutions in many practical applications.|$|R
50|$|Sealed {{anamorphic}} monobloc {{based on}} Pentax’s venerable 50mm 1.7 prime. The Iscorama 2003 was fitted with the Pentax K mount, and had fully <b>multicoated</b> optics.|$|E
50|$|Coating lenses {{with up to}} a {{dozen or}} more {{different}} layers of chemicals to suppress reflections across the visual spectrum (instead of at only one compromise wavelength) were a logical progression. Asahi Optical's SMC Takumar lenses (1971, Japan) were the first all <b>multicoated</b> (Super-Multi-Coated) lenses for consumer cameras (M42 screw mount Asahi Pentax SLRs). Modern highly corrected zoom lenses with fifteen, twenty or more elements would not be possible without multicoating. The transmission efficiency of a modern <b>multicoated</b> lens surface is about 99.7% or better.|$|E
50|$|Fujinon A lenses are 6 {{elements}} in 4 groups, {{and have an}} angle of view of 70°. Some of them are <b>multicoated</b> with Fuji's multicoating, EBC (Electron Beam Coating).|$|E
50|$|The next {{landmark}} zoom was the Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan) of 1981. It was {{the first}} super-wide angle zoom lens for still cameras (most 35mm SLRs). Previously, combining the complexities of rectilinear super-wide angle lenses, retrofocus lenses and zoom lenses seemed impossible. The Sigma's all-moving eleven element/seven group/three cell formula was a triumph of computer-aided design and <b>multicoating.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Symmar-S is an {{incremental}} improvement {{to the original}} Symmar design, adding <b>multicoating</b> to the feature set. The lens is not symmetric like its predecessor and is not convertible. The available focal lengths are slightly different, with the subtraction of the 80 mm, and addition of a 120 mm and two 480 mm lenses of varying speeds.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981: Sigma 21-35mm f/3.5-4 (Japan): first super-wide angle {{zoom lens}} for SLRs. For decades, {{combining}} {{the complexities of}} rectilinear super-wide angle lenses, retrofocus lenses and zoom lenses seemed impossibly difficult. Sigma did the impossible and reached a 91° maximum field of view for 35 mm SLRs with an all-moving eleven element formula through the maturation of computer-aided design and <b>multicoating.</b> In 2004, the Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 EX DG Aspherical HSM (Japan) zoom reached 122°, wider than any SLR prime lens ever made, by taking additional advantage of aspherics and low dispersion glasses.|$|R
50|$|The only sealed {{anamorphic}} monobloc manufactured from {{a premium}} quality prime, the donor lens being the Leica 50mm 2 Summicron. The Iscorama 2004s were <b>multicoated</b> lenses, and featured a Leica R Mount camera fixing.|$|E
50|$|The Tele-Arton is a {{telephoto}} design. Earlier f/4 and f/5.5 {{models are}} 5 elements in 4 groups. The 250 mm f/5.6 {{is a modern}} <b>multicoated</b> 5-element, 5-group lens. All models have a 35° angle of coverage.|$|E
50|$|The last of {{the sealed}} {{anamorphic}} monoblocs, the 2005 was built out of the cheap I.O.R.-made second iteration of the Pentacon Prakticar 50mm 2.4 pancake lens. The Iscorama 2005 was <b>multicoated</b> and had a Praktica B Mount.|$|E
40|$|Liquid cryistal {{displays}} (LCDs) {{have been}} widely used in visual display unit work. These LCDs maintain superior visibilituy nder a higher diffuse surface reflectance compared with cathode-ray tube displays. Specular (mirror-like) reflection on LCDs, however, can cause disturbed visibility and the resultant visual fatigue. The present experiment was designed to investigate whether visual fatigue consequent to the specular reflection on LCDs could be reduced by anti-reflective-glare filetering. Visual fatigue was compared between three experimental conditions, one with specular reflection and two with the use of different anti-reflective-glare filters (<b>multicoating</b> type and matprocessing type), under a within-subject experimental design. Each of twenty subjects performed a visuals earch task consisting of three sessions of 25 min each followed by a rest period of 25 min. Grating acuity, dark-focus accommodation, and replies to a visual fatigue questionnaire were studied {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, after each session and after the rest period. The results of the visual fatigue questionnaire showed no significant differences between the three experimental conditions. However, the use of anti-reflective-glare filtering of <b>multicoating</b> type induced significantly better visual search performance and visual acuity. The use of mat-processing type filtering showed less influence on dark-focus accommodation. These results suggest that the prevention of specular reflection on LCDs may lead to the possibility of reduced visual fatigue...|$|R
40|$|The photooxidative {{degradation}} of e-coats in different automotive multilayer coating systems was investigated by performing photooxidation index (POI) measurements using a FT-IR-microscopic device. For the photoxidation index measurements a special flat cutting {{was developed and}} the measurements were performed on the original and the corresponding weathered <b>multicoat</b> systems. The obtained POl results were compared with the corresponding UV-VIS-NIR transmittance and absorption data and finally the influencing parameters of photochemical degradation processes were discussed. The obtained results prove that the transmittance of UV-light {{is not the only}} important parameter which influences the degradation stability of the e-coat and thermocatalytic effects, which accelerate the photooxidation process, should be regarded...|$|R
50|$|Some inkjet {{papers are}} made from high quality deinked pulp or {{chemical}} pulps. Quality inkjet paper requires good dimensional stability, no curling or cockling, and good surface strength. For most purposes surface smoothness is required. Sufficient and even porosity is required to counteract spreading of the ink. For lower quality printing, uncoated copy paper suffices, but higher grades require coating. The traditional coatings are not widely used for inkjet papers. For matte inkjet papers, {{it is common to}} use silica as pigment together with polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH). Glossy inkjet papers can be made by <b>multicoating,</b> resin coating, or cast coating on a lamination paper.|$|R
50|$|Marketed as a {{projection}} lens, the Wide-Screen 2000 was sold {{as an individual}} lens unit, complete with front and rear caps, but without a projector mount. All Wide-screen 2000 lenses were fully <b>multicoated.</b> The lens produced a 1.5× horizontal stretch.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{accessories}} {{were made}} available for the CE-5 soon after its production, including power winders, dedicated flashes, [...] "Info-Back" [...] data-imprinting units, [...] "Auto Date digital data imprinting" [...] units, lenses advertised as [...] "Super <b>multicoated</b> lenses", autofocus lenses and more.|$|E
50|$|The 2001 was {{produced}} in both single-coated and <b>multicoated</b> versions, and along with the 2004, is the only 2000 series lens to sometimes feature a serial number on the front lock ring. These appear to be rather random, covering a range from 00002 to 73892.|$|E
5000|$|C — Indicates a <b>multicoated</b> F-type lens. Appears with an interpunct {{after the}} number of optical {{elements}} (in the form [...] "Nikkor-X&middot;C"). This designation was introduced in 1971 and discontinued in 1974 {{with the introduction of}} [...] "Modern" [...] (K-type) Nikkors, when multicoating had become standard practice.|$|E
50|$|This was a {{dedicated}} sealed anamorphic projection lens {{for use with}} standard 35mm slide projectors and was designed to complement the 2000 series sealed monobloc anamorphic lenses. The most interesting feature of the 1000 series projector lenses was their elegant anamorphic alignment mechanism. The 1060 was a <b>multicoated</b> lens.|$|E
50|$|The Iscorama 42 was {{introduced}} in 1982, and was essentially a mechanically upgraded, metal-bodied version of the Iscorama 36, with both lenses sharing very similar vignetting characteristics due to their closely related rear anamorphic element diameters. Unlike the Iscorama 36 and 54, the Iscorama 42 was only available as a <b>multicoated</b> lens.|$|E
50|$|The 1968 Iscorama was {{available}} in Exakta, Minolta SR, Nikon F, and Praktica M42 mounts and was the only Iscorama model to always feature an individual serial number on the front lock ring. They were shipped in blue and white packaging for the domestic German market, whilst export versions came in yellow and red boxes. None of this first generation of Iscoramas were <b>multicoated.</b>|$|E
50|$|Asahi Optical was {{an early}} and {{enthusiastic}} participant in this competition. The Asahi Pentax Electro Spotmatic (Honeywell Pentax Spotmatic ES in the USA) of 1971 was the first 35 mm SLR with electronic aperture priority autoexposure and the Pentax ME was the first electronic autoexposure-only 35 mm SLR. Asahi Optical {{was also the first}} company to offer publicly available anti-reflection <b>multicoated</b> photographic lenses with their SMC Takumar lenses in 1971.|$|E

50|$|These are {{wide-angle}} lenses {{which have}} been developed in several steps. The Super-Angulons are Biogon designs, making for huge, heavy lenses, but also giving very generous angles of coverage. The f/4 lenses give 95° of coverage, the f/8 models give 100°, and the f/5.6 units give a 105° coverage angle. The f/4 and f/5.6 lenses are 8-element, 4-group designs, while the f/8 lenses are older 6-element, 4-group, symmetrical designs. Coating technologies improved along the production life of these lenses, and recent Super-Angulons are <b>multicoated.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1971: Asahi SMC Takumar lenses (Japan): first all <b>multicoated</b> (Super-Multi-Coated) lenses for {{consumer}} cameras; for M42 screw mount Asahi Pentax SLRs. Process co-developed with Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen, West Germany). Lenses with glass elements [...] "single-coated" [...] {{with a very}} thin layer (about 130-140 nanometers) of magnesium or calcium fluoride to suppress flare producing surface reflections were invented by Carl Zeiss (Jena, Germany) in 1936 and first sold in 1939. They became standard for high quality cameras by the early 1950s. Coating lenses with up to a dozen different layers of chemicals to suppress reflections across the visual spectrum (instead of at only one compromise wavelength) was a logical progression.|$|E
