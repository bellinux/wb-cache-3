40|$|Abstract — Elliptic curve {{cryptography}} (ECC) {{is mainly}} {{an alternative to}} traditional public-key cryptosystems (PKCs), such as RSA, due to its smaller key size with same security level for resource-constrained networks. The computational efficiency of ECC depends on the scalar point multiplication, which consists of <b>modular</b> <b>point</b> addition and point doubling operations. The paper emphasizes on point multiplication techniques such as Binary, NAF, w-NAF and different coordinate systems like Affine and Projective (Standard Projective, Jacobian and Mixed) for point addition and doubling operations. These operations are compared based on execution time. The results given here are for general purpose processor with 1 : 73 GH z frequency.

40|$|With {{this work}} we {{initiate}} {{a study of}} the representations of a unipotent group over a field of characteristic zero from the <b>modular</b> <b>point</b> of view. Let G be such a group. The stack of all representations of a fixed finite dimension n is badly behaved. We introduce an invariant, w, of G, its width, as well as a certain nondegeneracy condition on representations, and we prove that nondegenrate representations of dimension n < w+ 1 form a quasi-projective variety. Our definition of the width is opaque; as a first attempt to elucidate its behavior, we prove that it is bounded by the length of a composition series. Finally, we study the problem of gluing a pair of nondegenerate representations along a common subquotient. Comment: 78 page...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study {{deformation}} theory of trianguline B-pairs for any p-adic field. For benign B-pairs, a special good class of trianguline B-pairs, we prove a main theorem concerning tangent spaces of these deformation spaces. These are generalizations of Bellaiche-Chenevier's and Chenevier's works in the case of K=Q_p, where they used (phi,Gamma) -modules over Robba ring instead of using B-pairs. The main theorem, the author hopes, will play crucial roles in some problems of Zariski density of <b>modular</b> <b>points</b> or of crystalline points in deformation spaces of global or local p-adic Galois representations.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{comparison}} theorems for Hecke algebras {{and universal}} deformation rings with strong restrictions at the critical prime l, as {{provided by the}} results of Wiles, Taylor, Diamond, et al., we prove under rather general conditions that the corresponding universal deformation spaces with no restrictions at l can be identified with certain Hecke algebras of l-adic modular forms as conjectured by Gouvêa, thus generalizing previous work of Gouvêa and Mazur. Along the way, we show that the universal deformation spaces we consider are complete intersections, flat over Zl of relative dimension three, in which the <b>modular</b> <b>points</b> form a Zariski dense subset. Furthermore the fibers above Q l of these spaces are generically smooth. 1. Introduction. Whe...|$|R
40|$|Given a rank 3 real {{arrangement}} A of n {{lines in}} the projective plane, the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture (proved by Green and Tao in 2013) states that for n sufficiently large, the number of simple intersection points of A is {{greater than or equal}} to n/ 2. With a much simpler proof we show that if A is supersolvable, then the conjecture is true for any n (a small improvement of original conjecture). The Slope problem (proved by Ungar in 1982) states that n non-collinear points in the real plane determine at least n- 1 slopes; we show that this is equivalent to providing a lower bound on the multiplicity of a <b>modular</b> <b>point</b> in any (real) supersolvable arrangement. In the second part we find connections between the number of simple points of a supersolvable line arrangement, over any field of characteristic 0, and the degree of the reduced Jacobian scheme of the arrangement. Over the complex numbers even though the Sylvester-Gallai theorem fails to be true, we conjecture that the supersolvable version of the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture is true.

40|$|For a fixed mod p {{automorphic}} Galois representation, p-adic automorphic Galois representations lifting it determine {{points in}} universal deformation space. In {{the case of}} modular forms and under some technical conditions, Böckle showed that every component of deformation space contains a smooth <b>modular</b> <b>point,</b> which then implies their Zariski density when coupled with the infinite fern of Gouvêa-Mazur. We generalize Böckle's result to the context of polarized Galois representations for CM fields, and to two dimensional Galois representations for totally real fields. More specifically, under assumptions necessary to apply a small R = T theorem and an assumption on the local mod p representation, we prove that every irreducible component of the universal polarized deformation space contains an automorphic point. When combined with work of Chenevier, this implies new results on the Zariski density of automorphic points in polarized deformation space in dimension three.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} the superuniversality of the phase transition between different quantum Hall plateaus. We construct a set of models which give a qualitative description of this transition in a pure system of interacting charged particles. One of the models is manifestly invariant under both Duality and Periodic shifts of the statistical angle and, hence, it has a full Modular Invariance. We derive the transformation laws for the correlation functions under the modular group and use them to derive symmetry constraints for the conductances. These allow us to calculate exactly the conductivities at the <b>modular</b> fixed <b>points.</b> We show that, at least at the <b>modular</b> fixed <b>points,</b> the system is critical. Away from the fixed points, the behavior of the model is determined by extra symmetries such as Time Reversal. We speculate that if the natural connection between spin and statistics holds, the model may exhibit an effective analyticity at low energies. In this case, the conductance is completely determined by its behavior under modular transformations. Comment: 44 pages, Revtex. Corrected manuscript, Submitted to Nucl. Phys. ...|$|R

40|$|The motor {{activity}} involves the activation of an extremely complex function that begins {{even before the}} action becomes perceptible. The {{very large number of}} degrees of freedom possessed by the hand seems to provide almost endless possibilities of movements. To grasp an object, it is necessary to take into account all its physical characteristics (topography, orientation, size and shape). When transmitting strength though his hand during the act of prehension, the subject must take into account the estimated weight of the object, the texture of its surface as well as the degree of stability he is aiming at. Thus, the number of parameters to deal with in order to perform the grasp seems very large. However, Napier (1956) tried to simplify the study of the prehension movement by defining two types of grip: the precision grip and the power grip. Their analysis provided a new parameter, named the opposition axis (Napier, 1955; Iberall et al. 1986), in reference to the spatial line connecting the index to the thumb and through which the forces applied to the object are transmitted during the grasp. In order to further study the prehension through the observation of the opposition axis behavior, we have performed the kinematics analysis of the hand during a prehension movement of cylindrical objects using a precision grip. A computerized motion analyzer was used to record the position of the markers placed on the hand during the grasp. A special attention was give to the position of the opposition axis {{at the end of the}} movement. Three experiments were performed involving real and simulated grasps of cylindrical objects. The results show that the opposition axis behaves as a controlled variable of both real and simulated prehension movements.

40|$|Globalization {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the rise of the borderless world. However in practice, true globalization points rather to a “spatial logic” by which globalization is manifested locally in the shape of insular space. Globalization in this sense is not merely about the creation of physical fragmentation of space but also the creation of social disintegration. This study tries to proof that global processes also create various forms of insular space leading also to specific social implications. In order to examine the problem this study looks at two cases: China’s Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Jakarta in Indonesia. The PRD case reveals three forms of insular space namely the modular, concealed and the hierarchical. The <b>modular</b> <b>points</b> to the form of enclosed factories where workers are vulnerable for human-right violations due to the absent of public control. The concealed refers to the production of insular space by subtle discrimination against certain social groups in urban space. And the hierarchical points to a production of insular space that is formed by an imbalanced population flow. The Jakarta case attempts to show more types of insularity in relation to the complexity of a mega-city which is shaped by a culture of exclusion. Those are dormant and hollow insularity. The dormant refers to the genesis of insular– radical – community from a culture of resistance. The last type, the hollow, points to the process of making a “pseudo community” where sense of community is not really developed as well as weak social relationship with its surrounding. Although global process creates various expressions of territorial insularization, however, this study finds that the “line of flight” is always present, where the border of insularity is crossed. The PRD’s produces vernacular modernization done by peasants which is less likely to be controlled by the politics of insularization. In Jakarta, the culture of insularization causes urban informalities that have no space, neither spatially nor socially; hence their state of ephemerality continues as a tactic of place-making. This study argues that these crossings possess the potential for reconciling venue to defuse the power of insularity.

40|$|This is {{a summary}} of a three-part lecture series given at the meeting on “Explicit methods in number theory ” that was held in Oberwolfach from July 12 to 18, 2009. The theme of this lecture series was the {{explicit}} construction of algebraic points on elliptic curves from cycles on modular varieties. Given a fixed elliptic curve E over Q, {{the goal is to}} better understand the group E (¯ Q) of algebraic points on E by focusing on the following question: Which points in E (¯ Q) can be accounted for by a “modular construction”? Heegner points arising from CM <b>points</b> on <b>modular</b> curves are the prototypical example of such a modular construction. While we do not dispose of a completely satisfactory general definition of <b>modular</b> <b>points,</b> fulfilling the conflicting requirements of flexibility and mathematical precision, several “test cases ” that go beyond the setting of Heegner points have been studied over the last 10 years (cf. [Da 01], [DL], [BDG], [Da 04], [Tr], [Gre], [BDP 2]). Three illustrative examples were touched upon in these lectures: 1. [BDP 1], [BDP 2]. “Chow-Heegner points ” arising from algebraic cycles on higher dimensional varieties. The existence and key properties of Chow-Heegner points are typically conditional on the Hodge or Tate conjectures on algebraic cycles. 2. [DL], [BDG], [CD]. “Stark-Heegner points ” arising from ATR (“Almost Totally Real”) cycles on Hilbert modular varieties parametrising elliptic curves over totally real fields. These ATR cycles are not algebraic, and the expected algebraicity properties of the associated Stark-Heegner points do not seem (for now) {{to be part of a}} systematic philosophy. 3. [Da 01], [DP]. Stark-Heegner points attached to real quadratic cycles on the “mock Hilbert modular surface ” SL 2 (Z[1 /p]) Hp ×H) parametrising an elliptic curve E over Q of prime conductor p. These real quadratic cycles are indexed by ideal classes of orders in a real quadratic field K, and are topologically isomorphic to R/Z. By an analytic process that combines complex and p-adic integration, they can be made to yield p-adic points on E which are expected to be defined over class fields of K. This setting leads to convincing experimental evidence for the existence of a theory of “complex multiplication for real quadratic fields”...|$|R

They then have the potential to shift and to reduce energy consumption or even to store it with various storage capacities: thermal storage, hot-water tank and also electrical battery. But to ensure their efficiency, it is necessary to develop building energy management (BEM) systems which can interact with the grid and control the building and its systems.

The idea is to schedule the actions of the various controllable systems to minimize the energy cost while maintaining the occupant comfort and systems constraints. This scheduling is based on the knowledge of the future data profiles as well as the future cost of energy. The cost reduction is ensured by means of the building storage capacities and by shifting the house consumption periods if the future price is high.

We present the main ingredients of the border basis algorithm and the other methods implemented in this package: numerical solutions from multiplication matrices, real radical computation, polynomial optimization. The implementation parameterized by the coefficient type and the choice function provides a versatile family of tools for polynomial computation with <b>modular</b> arithmetic, floating <b>point</b> arithmetic or rational arithmetic. It relies on linear algebra solvers for dense and sparse matrices for these various types of coefficients. A connection with SDP solvers has been integrated for the combination of relaxation approaches with border basis computation. Extensive benchmarks on typical polynomial systems are reported, which show the very good performance of the tool...|$|R
40|$|Compact Riemann {{surfaces}} and their abelian functions are instrumental to solve integrable equations; more recently the representation {{theory of the}} Monster and related <b>modular</b> form have <b>pointed</b> to the relevance of τ-functions, which are in turn connected with {{a specific type of}} abelian function, the (Kleinian) σ-function. This paper proposes a construction of σ-functions based {{on the nature of the}} Weierstrass semigroup at one point of the Riemann surface as a generalization of the construction of plane affine models of the Riemann surface. Because our definition is algebraic, we are able to consider the properties of the σ-functions including their Jacobi inversion formulae, and to give an observation of their properties to those of a Norton basis for replicable functions, in turn relevant to the Monstrous Moonshine.
