The Archives has been housed in the Grandmaster's Palace {{for most of its}} lifetime, having moved to three separate locations during the late 1980s. In 1988, the Legal Documentation Section of the National Archives of Malta was opened, after records of court and tribunal hearings and decisions had been transferred to a Mdina facility beginning the previous year. A Gozo facility was opened soon after, and in 1994, the then-President of Malta, Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, officially opened the Archives' new Rabat head office and <b>main</b> <b>facility.</b> All of the Archives' locations feature a reading room, with facilities for researchers open to those over the age of sixteen who produce valid identification.|$|E

The second facility is the Archives' Gozo location, which holds over 9,000 items. The final facility {{to be opened}} was the Head Office, located in Rabat, which was officially opened in 1994.

25|$|On May 26, 1942, the California State Railroad Commission {{proposed}} {{an extension of}} the Burbank Line to the Lockheed plant.

The Red Car line in Burbank was abandoned and the tracks removed in 1956.|$|E

25|$|After the {{decision}} to switch to diesel traction, the site was completely rebuilt in 1962 to accommodate diesels, including the Warship Class that were used on the Exeter to Waterloo services. The Factory was reformed to provide four roads with servicing pits and cab level platforms, providing facilities to repair eight locomotives at the same time. Access was via the existing traversing table. A daily servicing and fuelling point was built beside the old steam shed {{and it was this}} which provided the <b>main</b> <b>facility</b> after the factory closed in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog's board {{decided in}} December 1990 {{to close the}} sulfite pulp mill and build a new {{magazine}} paper machine, PM6. The decision to terminate cellulose production was both caused by the environmental impact {{as well as by}} a steady diminishing demand for chemical pulp. The recession following the dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that exports to Eastern Europe were decimated. Meanwhile, new production technologies for paper had less demand for cellulose. The closing resulted in a loss of 210 jobs, of which 25 were transferred to PM6 and 50 were retired early. Construction of the new mill took place at Skakkestad, to the northeast of the <b>main</b> <b>facility.</b> Originally PM6 was proposed to produce light weight coated paper, but after Stora bought the technological partner Feldmühle, PM6 had to revert to supercalender.|$|E

To save time soil compaction was used instead. Layers were laid down and compacted with sheepsfoot rollers in the areas {{that had to be}} filled in, and the footings were laid over compacted soil in the low-lying areas and the undisturbed soil in the areas that had been excavated. Activities overlapped, so concrete pouring began while grading was still going on. [...] Cranes started lifting the steel frames into place on 19 January 1944.|$|E
