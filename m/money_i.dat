It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much <b>money</b> <b>I</b> made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

In the very few {{interviews}} I've made, it doesn't matter how long we've talked to each other, the headline is still just about my paycheck." [...] After extensive media coverage of his earnings, PewDiePie posted a video, expressing his frustration at the extensive media coverage over his income. In the video he claimed, [...] "We did raise a million dollars for charity, and very few articles picked up on that, but here it is everywhere how much <b>money</b> <b>I</b> make", adding, [...] "It seems like the whole world cares more about how much <b>money</b> <b>I</b> make than I do myself."

500|$|In {{part due}} to its dual printing, [...] "The Raven" [...] made Edgar Allan Poe a {{household}} name almost immediately, and turned Poe into a national celebrity. Readers began to identify poem with poet, earning Poe the nickname [...] "The Raven". The poem was soon widely reprinted, imitated, and parodied. Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success. As he later lamented, [...] "I have made no <b>money.</b> <b>I</b> am as poor now as ever I was in my life—except in hope, which {{is by no means}} bankable".|$|E

I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for <b>money.</b> <b>I</b> play music because I love it.|$|E

[...] In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales.

He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City/Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings' coach early in the 1973–74 NBA season with a 141–209 record.|$|E

Life stated that [...] "the Cardinale appeal {{is a blend of}} solid {{simplicity}} and radiant sensuality. It moves men {{all over the world to}} imagine her both as an exciting mistress and wife." [...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If I have to give up the <b>money,</b> <b>I</b> give it up.

He raps at a slow pace and incorporates both double entendres and humorous remarks, including a sexual reference that Claire Suddath viewed was an indication of Jay Z's enjoyment on the song: [...] " [...] had it by her bladder, she's like 'Oh I gotta pee!'." [...] Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly remarked that he [...] "even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can fly out to Pisa / Just to get some pizza." ...|$|E
