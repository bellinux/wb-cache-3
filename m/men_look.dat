25|$|After {{interviewing}} 31 dogmen {{and attending}} 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights. In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness {{in terms of}} masculinity and class immobility. In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society. Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity. So, working class <b>men</b> <b>look</b> for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One {{way to do this}} is through dogfighting. This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented. Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men. Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.|$|E
500|$|The Entombment shows Christ's body, {{wrapped in}} a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns, as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is {{attended}} by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two <b>men</b> <b>look</b> directly at Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet. The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes, even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows. The vista in The Entombment is {{regarded as one of}} his finest, and is typically [...] composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky.|$|E
500|$|Flower Drum Song {{came to be}} seen by some as stereotypical and patronizing towards Asians, {{and that}} it was [...] "inauthentic, even {{offensive}} in its relentlessly upbeat picture of a big-city Chinatown". [...] In 1983, the announcement that it would be produced in San Francisco started a furor; the producers pointedly stated that the show would be set in the 1930s and would have [...] "a greater sensitivity toward the Chinese immigration problems at that time". [...] They added a scene in which Mei Li listens apprehensively to a radio broadcast warning about the dangers to the United States caused by Asian immigration. [...] Many lines of dialogue were cut, and producer Fred Van Patten stated that [...] "hat we've done is cut things in the show that Asians said to make white people laugh." [...] The song [...] "Chop Suey" [...] was deleted, as was Master Wang's line that all white <b>men</b> <b>look</b> alike (based on a line in C. Y. Lee's novel, in which Wang states that all foreigners look alike). [...] The author gave a rare public interview to defend his novel and the musical adaptation. [...] The production, which had been scheduled for a three-week run, closed early. [...] A well-attended production in Oakland in 1993 adhered strictly to the 1958 script, though part of the ballet was cut for lack of rehearsal time; a more heavily censored 1996 production in San Mateo also did well at the box office.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of {{displaying}} the documents struck one academic critic looking {{from the point}} of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as [...] "idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution". By 1816, Jefferson wrote that [...] "ome <b>men</b> <b>look</b> at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the Ark of the Covenant, too sacred to be touched". But he saw imperfections and imagined that there could potentially be others, believing as he did that [...] "institutions must advance also".|$|E
2500|$|The {{models for}} the {{paintings}} were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the CÃ©zanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the <b>men</b> <b>look</b> down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as [...] "human still life", while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.|$|E
