The water content value of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> in China is higher than foreign countries. The specific gravity of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> in Chongqing is between 1. 70 ~ 2. 56. The porosity ratio of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> in Chongqing between 1. 0 ~ 4. 0. The permeability order of magnitude is approximately scm / 10 3 −. The properties of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> includes density, water content, specific gravity and porosity ratio, these parameters will be used frequently when calculation and analysis [1]. And these parameters related to landfill capacity calculation, stability evaluation, leachate and landfill gas collection system design. Compare to the test of soil engineering properties, the properties test of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> is difficult. The reasons are that (1) At different time and area, the <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> content will present great difference.

(2) Due to the composition uniformity and fifferent bury time, the organic matter degradation is different, so it is difficult to obtain representative samples.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{a comparison of}} Turkey’s and Finland’s <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management systems {{in order to provide}} pathways to improve Turkish <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management system and to provide information on it. Comparison of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management systems was conducted under the categories of legislation, finance, collection, transport and treatment of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste,</b> and the performance of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management systems. It was found that the current Turkish <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management system is not in line with the European Union standards.

Bioenergy production from sustainable biomass sources is considered to be carbon neutral because CO2 emitted during combustion or natural degradation processes is captured by growing plants. Although biomass-based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) with carbon capture storage (CCS) may be promising technologies for reducing GHG emissions from electricity generating plants, these technologies are small-scale and not well developed in Ontario.
