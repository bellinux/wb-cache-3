40|$|Abstract: Why do states use secrecy? What {{dynamics}} {{exist in}} the dim corners of the “covert realm ” of interstate security competition? This book-length project analyzes how secrecy is used in international affairs and why states so often resort to its use. Extant scholarship suggests states use secrecy in security competition to surprise adversaries or insulate domestically vulnerable leaders from dovish <b>constituents.</b> <b>My</b> project develops an alternative logic rooted in controlling conflict escalation risks. I focus on military interventions by outside powers and argue intervening states choose covert methods when the local conflict has high potential for hard-to-control escalation. By intervening secretly and without official acknowledgement, intervening states harness {{the political power of}} ignorance and ambiguity, circumventing several pathways that make escalation by leaders on both sides hard to resist. If done successfully, covertness makes retaliation by other states less likely; restraint and withdrawal by the intervening state is also easier. This escalation-based motive also makes sense of puzzling forms of “tacit collusion, ” i. e. when third party states and adversaries join in concealing an intervention.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} emergence of an alternative Latino identity formation referred to as Central American-American. Informed by diaspora studies, subaltern studies, and cultural studies, it examines Central American and U. S. Central American texts to highlight how Central American-American identity and culture has been forged by such factors as: inherited ideologies from the isthmus, the socio-cultural landscape of the U. S, specifically the city of Los Angeles, and by its current (dis) location within Latinidad. As such, it reveals how Central American-American identity, emanating as it does from transnational networks composed from geo-political locations like “the isthmus. ” the U. S., and translocal spaces like Los Angeles, alters {{what it means to be}} Central American. It also reveals the limitation present in Latino discourse which attempts to speak for, but which cannot account for all of its presumptive <b>constituents.</b> 	<b>My</b> analysis sketches the discursive contours of inclusive-exclusion as it pertains to the Central American nation and subject, as they are articulated within literary and cultural practices. In Chapter 1, I examine 19 th and 20 th century political and historical texts to argue that rather than being read as just an “isthmus,” Central America needs to be understood as a national formation known as Patria Grande, which produces a cultural nationalism that influences the way Central American immigrants re-constitute themselves in the diaspora. In Chapter 2 I analyze immigrant testimonials, the urban space known as “Little Central America” and the COFECA parade, in order to illuminate how these cultural expressions have facilitated a Central American pan-ethnic consciousness, and a thriving identity politics in Los Angeles. In Chapter 3 I explore the contentious and constitutive relationship between the Central American-American and Latino subject. In it, I suggest that Central American-American subjectivity is as an effect of power relations whereby the categories of Latino, Latin American and American are maintained through the exclusion of U. S. Central Americans. Subsequently, this dissertation highlights how these third-word subjects, labeled “Central American” in the U. S., often produce in their cultural expressions a notion of Central American-Americaness that both re-writes the Central American imaginary and challenges conventional articulations of Latinidad...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} the {{culmination}} of several months of research and data analysis on the Wise Use movement and takings legislation in six states (Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Oregon, and Rhode Island). The aim of the research was to determine the relationship, if any, between the strength of environmental and land use regulation in the states and the prevalence of takings legislation. With {{a better understanding of the}} relationship of these factors, legislators, regulators, and planners will be better able address the concerns of <b>constituents.</b> <b>My</b> hypothesis was that the prevalence and strength of takings or property rights legislation is related to the strength of land-use and environmental regulation in the states. The Wise Use movement bills itself as a grass-roots organization of property owners that wishes to regain the property rights that have been 2 ̆ 2 taken 2 ̆ 2 by federal, state and local governments through various environmental and land use regulations, and to influence federal policy relating to the use of public lands. The various adherents to the Wise Use movement are attempting to eliminate these regulations and are working to implement 2 ̆ 2 takings 2 ̆ 2 legislation in many states. Private property rights and takings legislation are just part of the agenda of Wise Use. The roots of the Wise Use movement are in the attempt to influence federal policy regarding the use of public lands by the extractive industries, including grazing rights and timber harvesting. The focus of this research is on takings legislation. Takings legislation can be categorized by levels of strength. The strength ranges from measures that would require compensation by the government for regulation that is found to cause diminution of private property values, to others that simply require that new regulations be examined to determine the potential for conflict with Constitutional takings provisions. Having an understanding of the current status of takings law is of extreme importance to planners. Over the past several decades there has been a narrowing of the limits to which regulation will be allowed to go. And with the current push of the Wise Use movement and takings bills in almost every state, planners should expect that there will be further change. This change will define what planners role 2 ̆ 7 s will be, and may require adaptation in planning practice...|$|R
