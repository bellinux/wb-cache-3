5|$|In December 2000, {{a fourth}} {{passenger}} terminal was opened: the Domestic Express Terminal, located {{to the south}} of the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> at a cost of $9 million. It was the first additional passenger terminal facility to be built at Melbourne Airport since 1971.|$|E
5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building.</b> The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 4 – {{originally}} {{called the}} Domestic Express or South Terminal – {{is dedicated to}} budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett. A$5million refit began in June 2007 {{along the lines of}} the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Lower landing and airport handling fees are charged to airlines due to the basic facilities, lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal. However, the terminal is located next to the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building,</b> unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.|$|E

50|$|In early April 2013, {{demolition}} {{work on the}} <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>buildings</b> began, and by September 2013, nothing remains of the former heliport, with a supermarket chain now dominating the site.|$|R
5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. The airport typically also has a few flights a week leaving Calgary at 8:45 PM and arriving in Penticton {{later on in the}} night, the plane then stays at the Penticton Airport and leaves for Calgary at 7:00 AM and arrives in Calgary around 9:00 AM. However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight and connection options for travellers. Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days coming in and out of Penticton.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> {{was built}} in 1964, and was designed by the architectural firm of Green Blankstein Russell and Associates (subsequently GBR Associates and Stantec Limited). It was expanded and renovated in 1984 by the architectural firm of IKOY, and a hotel was built across from the terminal in 1998. The original <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building</b> was closed on Sunday October 30, 2011 and has since been demolished.|$|E
50|$|Being an {{international}} airport, all terminals {{are equipped with}} immigration processing facilities and security scanning for all passengers, including domestic passengers. The Satellite terminal handles most of the international flights, while the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building's</b> contact pier handles domestic traffic, regional international flights and international flights routed to other hubs within Malaysia. Malaysia Airlines operates from both <b>terminals,</b> and the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building's</b> contact pier is their preferred terminal for domestic flights. Conversely, low cost carriers such as Tigerair, Cebu Pacific and AirAsia group of airlines operate domestic and international flights out of klia2, the low-cost carrier terminal at KLIA.|$|R

25|$|Winnipeg's main airport {{terminal}} {{was designed by}} Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects and Stantec. The terminal's design {{was inspired by the}} City of Winnipeg's distinctive landscape and the province of Manitoba's vast prairies and sky. It was the first {{airport terminal}} in Canada to be LEED-certified for its environmentally friendly concept, design, construction and operation. The terminal was constructed in two phases, with construction beginning in 2007 and ending on October 30, 2011 when it was officially opened to the public. Prior to the opening of the current <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building,</b> a multi-level access road and four-level, 1,559 stall parkade were both opened in November 2006. All airlines serving Winnipeg International Airport operate at the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>building,</b> with the exception of Perimeter Aviation.|$|E

5000|$|Daniel K. Inouye International Airport {{has three}} <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>buildings.</b> A fleet of Chance RT-52 buses provide inter-terminal {{transportation}} between the ticket counters {{of all three}} terminals and between the concourses in the Inter-island and <b>Main</b> <b>terminals.</b> These buses, known as [...] "Wiki Wiki" [...] buses (from the Hawaiian word for [...] "quick"), are the namesake for the WikiWikiWeb, the first wiki. All gates in the airport are connected post-security. However, passengers with carry-on luggage who arrive in the inter-island or commuter terminal and wish to connect to a flight in the overseas terminal must clear an agricultural inspection.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of battles for the airport, the airport complex {{suffered}} extensive damage from constant bombardments and change of hand between pro-government and rebel forces. The <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>buildings,</b> with their sturdy concrete construction, served as garrisons and shelters for soldiers defending the airport grounds, {{and as a result}} the buildings would be subjected to attacks and suffer extensive structural failures, most notably {{with the collapse of the}} massive roof over the new <b>terminal</b> <b>building's</b> mezzanine. Similarly, the control tower was contested by opposing forces due to its strategic lookout point, but eventually collapsed in January 2015 during the final leg of the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport.|$|R
