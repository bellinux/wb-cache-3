5|$|The {{machines}} were not all straight {{copies of the}} ZX81; some, such as the CP-200, came with extra memory and a larger case (often with a chiclet keyboard {{in place of the}} original <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboard).</b> One clone, the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy, could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper.|$|E
5|$|Timex {{produced}} a second {{version of the}} ZX81 {{in the form of}} the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboard</b> and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of membrane-based <b>keyboards,</b> flat-panel <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> and full-travel <b>membrane</b> keyboards: ...|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{industry}} and application, membrane switches are {{also referred to}} as <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> and <b>membrane</b> keypads.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of membrane switches include ease of cleaning, sealing ability and their low profile. Membrane switch {{can be used}} together with other control systems such as touch screens, keyboards, lighting, and {{they can also be}} complicated like the <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> and switch panels in mobiles and computers.|$|R
500|$|The {{front part}} of the case is {{occupied}} by an integrated 40-key <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboard</b> displaying 20graphic and 54inverse video characters. Each key has up to five functions, accessed via the SHIFT and FUNCTION keys or depending on context. For example, the P key combines the letter P, the [...] " [...] character, and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB. The ZX81 uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.|$|E
500|$|The ZX81 was {{designed}} to be small, simple, and above all cheap, using as few components as possible to keep the cost down. Video output was to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. Programs and data were loaded and saved onto audio tape cassettes. It had only four silicon chips on board and a mere 1KB of memory. The machine had no power switch or any moving parts (with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present on early [...] "ZX81 USA" [...] models and the Timex-Sinclair 1000) and used a pressure-sensitive <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboard</b> for manual input. The ZX81's limitations prompted the emergence of a flourishing market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Such limitations, however, achieved Sinclair's objective of keeping the cost of the machine as low as possible. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought its designer, Rick Dickinson, a Design Council award.|$|E
500|$|The ZX80's design {{introduced}} many {{key features}} that were carried {{over to the}} ZX81; as Sinclair himself later said, [...] "the ZX80 {{was very much a}} stepping stone to the ZX81". The design was driven entirely by the desired price – the machine had to cost less than £100 but still make a healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge-shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch-sensitive <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboard</b> were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair's approach, [...] "Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine." [...] The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair's cost-cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter-style keyboard, though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and [...] "feel".|$|E
5000|$|To {{resolve this}} problem, the {{processor}} in a keyboard [...] "debounces" [...] the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one [...] "confirmed" [...] keystroke that (usually) corresponds {{to what is}} typically a solid contact. Early <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> had limited typing speed {{because they had to}} do significant debouncing. This was a noticeable problem on the ZX81.|$|R
50|$|Keyboards made of {{flexible}} silicone or polyurethane materials can roll up in a moderately tight bundle. Tightly folding the keyboard may damage the internal membrane circuits. When {{they are completely}} sealed in rubber they are water resistant. Like <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards,</b> they are reported {{to be very hard}} to get used to, as there is little tactile feedback, and silicone will tend to attract dirt, dust, and hair.|$|R
50|$|Generally, flat-panel <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> do {{not produce}} a {{noticeable}} physical feedback. Therefore, devices using these issue a beep or flash a light when the key is pressed. They are often used in harsh environments where water- or leak-proofing is desirable. Although used {{in the early days}} of the personal computer (on the Sinclair ZX80, ZX81 and Atari 400), they have been supplanted by the more tactile dome and mechanical switch keyboards.|$|R

5000|$|Membrane {{switches}} are user-equipment interface utilities {{that allow}} for the communication of commands from users to electronic devices. Membrane switches {{can be thought of}} as one category of interface utilities alongside touch screens, plastic keyboards, toggle switches and many other kinds of control systems. Interface utilities can be as simple as tactile switches for controlling lighting, and they can be as complicated as <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> and switch panels for use with computers.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from early}} hobbyist/kit/home {{computers}} and some video game consoles, membrane-based QWERTY keyboards {{are used in}} some industrial computer systems, and are also found as portable, even [...] "rollable-collapsible" [...] designs for PDAs and other pocket computing devices. Smaller, specialised <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards,</b> typically numeric-and-a-few-control-keys only, {{have been used in}} access control systems (for buildings and restricted areas), simple handheld calculators, domestic remote control keypads, microwave ovens, and other similar devices where the amount of typing is relatively small or infrequent, such as cell phones.|$|R
50|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> work by {{electrical}} {{contact between the}} keyboard surface and the underlying circuits when keytop areas are pressed. These models were used with some early 1980s home computers, enjoying wide adoption in consumer electronics devices. The keyboards are quite inexpensive to mass-produce, and are more resistant against dirt and liquids than most other keyboards. However, due to a low or non-existent tactile feedback, most people have difficulty typing with them, especially when larger numbers of characters are being typed. Chiclet keyboards were a slight improvement, at least allowing individual keys to be felt to some extent.|$|R

25|$|As direct-contact <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> became popular, the {{available}} rollover of keys was optimized {{by analyzing the}} most common key sequences and placing these keys {{so that they do}} not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.|$|R
50|$|The Plus/4 was the {{flagship}} computer of the line. The Plus/4 had 64 KB of memory while the C16 and 116 had 16 KB. The Plus/4 had built-in software, whereas {{the others did}} not. The Plus/4 and C16 had full-travel keyboards; the 116 used a rubber chiclet keyboard that was still superior to the flat <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> used on less-expensive Timex-Sinclair computers. The C116 was only sold in Europe. All of the machines were distinguished by their dark gray cases and light gray keys. This was {{a reversal of the}} color scheme on the 64 and VIC, which used lighter cases and darker-colored keys.|$|R

50|$|A laser {{projection}} device {{approximately the}} size of a computer mouse projects the outline of keyboard keys onto a flat surface, such as a table or desk. This type of keyboard is portable enough to be easily used with PDAs and cellphones, and many models have retractable cords and wireless capabilities. However, sudden or accidental disruption of the laser will register unwanted keystrokes. Also, if the laser malfunctions, the whole unit becomes useless, unlike conventional keyboards which can be used even if a variety of parts (such as the keycaps) are removed. This type of keyboard can be frustrating to use since it is susceptible to errors, even in the course of normal typing, and its complete lack of tactile feedback makes it even less user-friendly than the lowest quality <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Flat-panel <b>membrane</b> <b>keyboards</b> {{are most}} often found on {{appliances}} like microwave ovens or photocopiers. A common design consists of three layers. The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back. Under this it has a spacer layer, which holds {{the front and back}} layer apart so that they do not normally make electrical contact. The back layer has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid. This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed.|$|R

5000|$|The use of contact-switch {{membrane}} sheets {{under the}} monoblock. This technology came from flat-panel switch membranes, where the switch contacts are printed {{inside of a}} top and bottom layer, with a spacer layer in between, so that when pressure {{is applied to the}} area above, a direct electrical contact is made. The membrane layers can be printed by very-high volume, low-cost [...] "reel-to-reel" [...] printing machines, with each <b>keyboard</b> <b>membrane</b> cut and punched out afterwards.|$|R
