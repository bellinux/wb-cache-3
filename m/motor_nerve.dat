40|$|AbstractChondroitin sulfates {{have been}} implicated in the {{promotion}} and in the inhibition of axon growth. In the zebrafish embryo, chondroitin sulfates are present at the interface of the somites and the notochord where spinal motor axons extend ventrally to establish the midsegmental ventral <b>motor</b> <b>nerves.</b> Injection of chondroitinase ABC prior to motor axon outgrowth effectively removed all chondroitin sulfate immunoreactivity and induced abnormal axonal outgrowth in many (39 %) of the ventral <b>motor</b> <b>nerves.</b> The most common abnormality was the formation of side branches, approximately half of which extended posteriorly, the others anteriorly. The effect was specific to the removal of chondroitin sulfates, since injections of vehicle solution or of heparinase III {{did not affect the}} ventral <b>motor</b> <b>nerves.</b> Electron microscopic examination demonstrated that the injections caused no damage to spinal cord, somite, and notochord. This suggests that chondroitin sulfates normally constrain the outgrowth of the ventral <b>motor</b> <b>nerves.</b> Consistent with this hypothesis, injections of soluble chondroitin sulfates, either as a mixture or individually, led to truncated or missing ventral <b>motor</b> <b>nerves.</b> Truncations were most frequent after injection of chondroitin sulfate-B (up to 23 %) while chondroitin sulfate-A had a lesser, and chondroitin sulfate-C no apparent, effect...|$|R

25|$|Tetanospasmin {{released}} in the wound is absorbed into the circulation and reaches the ends of motor neurons all over the body. The toxin acts at several sites within the central nervous system, including nerve terminals, the spinal cord, and brain, and within the sympathetic nervous system. By binding to peripheral motor neuron terminals, the toxin enters the nerve axons, and is transported across synaptic junctions to the nerve-cell body in the brain stem and spinal cord by retrograde intraneuronal transport, until it reaches the central nervous system, where it rapidly binds to gangliosides at the presynaptic membrane of inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>nerve</b> endings.|$|E
25|$|The {{tetanus toxin}} {{initially}} binds to peripheral nerve terminals. It is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions {{until it reaches}} the central nervous system. There it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>nerve</b> endings, and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis. The effect of the toxin is to block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) across the synaptic cleft, which is required to check the nervous impulse. If nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms, the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus are produced. The toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, synaptobrevinII, and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{malnutrition}} many alcoholics suffer deprives them {{of important}} cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and <b>motor</b> <b>nerve</b> axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation {{is a large}} obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system. EMSCs are multipotent and possess a self-renewing capacity. They {{can be thought of}} as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with dorsal root ganglion and <b>motor</b> <b>nerve</b> development. EMSC differentiation appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment. Schwann cells are the source for both neurotropic and neurotrophic factors essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated cell processes, which is common to Schwann cells in vitro. Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines GDNF, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating MAP kinases. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. Myelinated axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.|$|E

500|$|Cnidarians are {{generally}} {{thought to have}} no brains or even central nervous systems. However, they do have integrative areas of neural tissue {{that could be considered}} some form of centralization. Most of their bodies are innervated by decentralized nerve nets that control their swimming musculature and connect with sensory structures, though clade has slightly different structures. These sensory structures, usually called rhopalia, can generate signals in response to various types of stimuli such as light, pressure, and much more. Medusa usually have several of them around the margin of the bell that work together to control the <b>motor</b> <b>nerve</b> net, that directly innervates the swimming muscles.

2500|$|Muscle {{relaxation}} and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites, including {{the central nervous}} system, myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated <b>motor</b> <b>nerve</b> terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor end plate, and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus. Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction.

Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the motor end plate. The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor. This allows [...] and [...] ions to enter the cell and [...] ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the end plate, resulting in muscle contraction.

2500|$|Brachial plexus {{block is}} {{typically}} performed by an anesthesiologist. To achieve an optimal block, {{the tip of}} the needle should be close to the nerves of the plexus during the injection of local anesthetic solution. Commonly employed techniques for obtaining such a needle position include transarterial, elicitation of a paresthesia, and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator or a portable ultrasound scanning device. If the needle is close to or contacts a nerve, the subject may experience a paresthesia (a sudden tingling sensation, often described as feeling like [...] "pins and needles" [...] or like an electric shock) in the arm, hand, or fingers. Injection close to the point of elicitation of such a paresthesia may result in a good block. A peripheral nerve stimulator connected to an appropriate needle allows emission of electric current from the needle tip. When the needle tip is close to or contacts a <b>motor</b> <b>nerve,</b> characteristic contraction of the innervated muscle may be elicited.
