25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, the {{original}} ZETA II proposal {{had been growing}} ever-larger, eventually specifying currents as powerful as the Joint European Torus that was built years later. As it seemed this was beyond the state-of-the-art, the project was eventually cancelled in February 1959. A new proposal soon took its place, the Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment (ICSE). ICSE was designed {{to take advantage of}} further stabilising effects noticed in M-theory, which suggested that very fast pinches would cause the current to flow only in the outer layer of the plasma, which should be much more stable.

Both the physical properties (major and <b>minor</b> <b>diameters,</b> aspect ratio, root peel thickness, peel proportion to root and root densities) and proximate compositions of anchote roots were significantly influenced by accessions type and growing sites. Over all, better quality, in terms root peel thickness and peel to root ratio, were observed for the accessions grown at Hawassa.

2500|$|The primary coil's {{resonant}} frequency is tuned {{to that of}} the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and retuning if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a [...] "breakout bump") is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive 'loading' by the streamers tends to lower the {{resonant frequency}} of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A toroid with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electrical field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a toroid permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus spark breakout voltage. A toroid's capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the spark breakout voltage is mainly a function of its <b>minor</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|E

40|$|Peculiarities of {{quantitative}} hard x-ray phase contrast imaging of micropipes in SiC are discussed. The micropipe is assumed as a hollow cylinder with an elliptical cross section.

It is shown that one projection image gives an information which does not allow a complete determination of the elliptical cross section, if an orientation of micropipe is not known. Another problem is a weak accuracy in estimating the diameters, partly because of using pink synchrotron radiation, which is necessary because a monochromatic beam intensity {{is not sufficient to}} reveal the weak contrast from a very small object. The general problems of accuracy in estimating the two diameters using the least square procedure are discussed.
