5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; they eat {{a wide variety}} of insects, including beetles such as weevils, leaf-, jewel-, flea- and ground-beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, moths, wasps and cicadas. Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> a very small proportion of its diet. It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and on the edges of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. Adults of both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.|$|E

However, by 2010, this {{appeared to have}} changed, with Nunavut Tourism providing media outlets with general figures on trends in tourism in Nunavut. Tourism brings approximately CAD $30 million to Nunavut's economy each year according to Nunavut Tourism, with one in five of its tourists arriving on cruise ships. Between June and October 2008, 33,378 people visited Nunavut by air and sea, according to the territory's Department of Economic Development and Transportation. This is an almost 16 percent increase {{on the number of}} people who visited Nunavut by air and sea during the same period in 2006, which was 28,802 people. The average age of people arriving in Nunavut was 46 during the period in 2008 that the Department of Economic Development and Transportation conducted its survey, and the majority of visitors were in the territory for business purposes. 96 percent of all business travellers entering the territory were domestic travellers (Canadian residents). However, among the leisure traveller sub-group, the proportion of domestic travellers declines - Canadians <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 72 percent of the leisure traveller arrival numbers, with travellers from the United States (20 percent) and other countries (8 percent) making up the difference.
