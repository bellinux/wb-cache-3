5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to operate pneumatic valves throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter touch, and <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> in {{the location of}} the console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid {{would be unable to}} move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E

5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the {{through station}} was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow <b>more</b> <b>flexibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was {{purchased}} by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D rules to date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a music-driven {{summarization}} system for home videos based on several content-aware mechanisms. Many {{audio and video}} features are employed to help analyzing and synchronizing input audios and videos. The synchronization is conducted by matching {{the rhythm of the}} video with that of the audio.

30|$|To {{close this}} gap, we {{developed}} a new sensing engine based on a commercial SDR platform. Compared to most low-cost sensing solutions, our solution provides much <b>more</b> <b>flexibilities</b> in terms of configuration. The most important feature is its capability of seamless capturing and long-term recording. The implementation is based on several open-source libraries supported on major platforms. This makes our solution transparent {{and being able to}} run on a broad range of operating systems. Additionally, our solution can easily be extended into cooperative and distributed sensing systems, as described in Section 4.3.|$|R
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap. Some young players, such as LeBron James, began signing shorter contracts that allowed for <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> in team choice and salary. The agreement expired in 2005, and both sides became concerned about the possibility of another work stoppage. A lockout was prevented, however, when a six-year CBA was reached in June 2005. After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement. Each team's schedule in the 2011–12 NBA season was cut by 16 games.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> in {{choosing}} materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir {{could continue to}} be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Carnivàle {{takes place}} in the 1930s Dust Bowl and {{revolves}} around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> in story decisions. The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but were not part of the show's visible structure. The audience therefore only learned more about the characters as a natural aspect in the story.|$|E

5|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{wrote the}} script after Gale mused upon {{whether he would}} have befriended his father if they had {{attended}} school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it <b>more</b> <b>flexibility,</b> and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing <b>more</b> <b>flexibility</b> in {{granting}} advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new entropy rate {{estimator}} {{for a second}} and/or higher-order correlated source by modeling it as the output of a linear filter, which can be mixed-phase, driven by Gaussian or non-Gaussian noise. Based on this estimator, we develop a new spatiotemporal blind source separation (BSS) algorithm, full BSS (FBSS), by minimizing the entropy rate of separated sources. FBSS provides <b>more</b> <b>flexibilities</b> in exploiting the temporal structures of sources than the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal BSS algorithms, which use AR models, and thus imply minimum-phase property of sources.
