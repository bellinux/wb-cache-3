50|$|The Industrial Revolution {{received}} a further boost with the upcoming railways. These arose {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century in England as innovation in the mining industry. The work in coal mines was hard and dangerous, and so there was a great need for tools to ease this work. In 1804, Richard Trevithick placed the first steam engine on rails, and was in 1825 the Stockton and Darlington Railway was opened, intended to transport coals from the mine to the port. In 1835 the first train drove in continental Europe between Mechelen and Brussels, and in the Netherlands in 1839 the first train drove between Amsterdam and Haarlem. For the machinery industry this brought all sorts of new work with new <b>machinery</b> <b>for</b> <b>metallurgy,</b> machine tool for metalworking, production of steam engines for trains with all its necessities etc.|$|E
