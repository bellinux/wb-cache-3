50|$|Though muscles {{produce and}} absorb {{mechanical}} power, tendons {{still have an}} integral role for dissipation of mechanical energy. This action is essential for activities like deceleration, when landing from a jump or downhill running. R.I. Griffiths conducted cross-experiments of isolated muscle-tendon preparations with in vivo studies in 1991 to keep muscles isometric during muscle-tendon unit lengthening. This was achieved with the practice of rapid stretches applied to muscle-tendon units which are then absorbed by the stretch of tendons. Experimenters explain this phenomenon {{by the idea that}} muscles are susceptible to damage when actively lengthened and this practice acts as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffer</b> against it. In addition, in vivo experiments it has been found that the elastic mechanism gives protection to musculoskeletal structure exceeding the sarcomere. Due to this fact, forces developed in active muscles eventually decide the forces on tendons such as bones, joints, and ligaments.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the rifle were not revealed to the public early on and so some misconceptions occurred through the development period: there was word about a sort of recoil buffer {{in the form of}} a venting system that recovered part of the gases generated by the shot and pushed it back in a space located behind the bolt; during the cycle, the bolt would thus [...] "bounce" [...] on a sort of [...] "gas cushion" [...] that acted as a buffer, dramatically reducing recoil. That provoked more than a disappointment as the production-stage VHS was reported to operate in a much more conventional manner no longer utilizing this buffering system. According to the project deposited at the European Patent Office however it seems that such voices originated from a misconception of related data, i.e. merging in one two different features: a forced air ventilation system similar to the one in Pecheneg machine gun and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffer</b> reductor, similar in conception but not identical to the one used in Ultimax 100, a weapon Croatia used in Croatian War of Independence and still has in its reserve inventory. The same patent states also that Vehesica works neither through direct gas impingement nor through a short or long stroke piston, but through a 'tappet' type of closed gas system much like the FN SCAR. There it was also another precedent design sporting some of said features, but it was rejected after the first real testing, so it is also possible that the [...] "gas cushion" [...] was instead a feature of that former model.|$|E

40|$|Elastic tendons {{can act as}} {{muscle power}} {{amplifiers}} or energy-conserving springs during locomotion. We used an in situ muscle-tendon preparation to examine the mechanical function of tendons during lengthening contractions, when muscles absorb energy. Force, length, and power were measured in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle of wild turkeys. Sonomicrometry {{was used to measure}} muscle fascicle length independently from muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length, as measured by a muscle lever system (servomotor). A series of ramp stretches of varying velocities was applied to the MTU in fully activated muscles. Fascicle length changes were decoupled from length changes imposed on the MTU by the servomotor. Under most conditions, muscle fascicles shortened on average, while the MTU lengthened. Energy input to the MTU during the fastest lengthenings was − 54. 4 J/kg, while estimated work input to the muscle fascicles during this period was only − 11. 24 J/kg. This discrepancy indicates that energy was first absorbed by elastic elements, then released to do work on muscle fascicles after the lengthening phase of the contraction. The temporary storage of energy by elastic elements also resulted in a significant attenuation of power input to the muscle fascicles. At the fastest lengthening rates, peak instantaneous power input to the MTU reached − 2, 143. 9 W/kg, while peak power input to the fascicles was only − 557. 6 W/kg. These results demonstrate that tendons may act as <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffers</b> by limiting peak muscle forces, lengthening rates, and power inputs during energy-absorbing contractions...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} muscle {{recruitment}} alters series elastic function during lengthening contractions During eccentric contractions muscles are actively lengthened to dissipate energy. While eccentric contractions are physiologically common, muscle injury and soreness are {{often associated with}} actively lengthened muscle fibers. It {{has been suggested that}} ser ies e last ic e lements (tendons and aponeuroses) may act as <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffers</b> to mitigate these potentially damaging outcomes. During eccentric contractions, strain energy is initially loaded into series elastic elements before tendon recoil stretches the muscle fascicles. By temporarily storing elastic energy, tendons can slow the rate of stretch applied directly to fascicles and can therefore function in attenuating power. Here we examine how the timing of muscle activation relative to muscle lengthening may alter the effective utilization of tendons in attenuating power. Using an in vitro muscle-tendon preparation, we test the prediction that muscle recruitment in anticipation of lengthening can reduce the rate and magnitude of stretch applied directly to muscle fascicles. Plantaris muscles of Rana catesbeiana (bullfrog) were instrumented with sonomicrometry crystals to measure muscle fascicle length. MTU length, force and power were measured by a servomotor. The MTU was lengthened at a constant speed while being stimulated at either 50 ms before (early-start), concurrent with, or 50 ms after (late-start) MTU lengthening. We find that the magnitude and rate of stretch applied directly to the fascicles decreased when the muscle was stimulated in advance of lengthening (early-start). We conclude that motor control strategies used during energy dissipating tasks can determine the degree of power attenuation by series elasti...|$|R

It is called elastomer coated prosthesis (ECP) and has a metal core, coated with an elastomer layer as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffer</b> between the core and the femoral cortex. For the ECP coating a thermoplastic polyolefin elastomer (TPO) was chosen. Required implant sizes were determined from a measurement campaign on the intramedullar canal of German Shepherds' femora. Stress distribution in photo-elastic models of the ensemble ECP core and TPO coating was studied and compared to {{a model of a}} cementless system. The core was tested for fatigue resistance in a simulator.

40|$|An {{important}} function of skeletal muscle is deceleration via active muscle fascicle lengthening, which dissipates movement energy. The mechanical interplay between muscle contraction and tendon elasticity is critical when muscles produce energy. However, {{the role of}} tendon elasticity during muscular energy dissipation remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that tendon elasticity functions as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffer,</b> preventing high (and probably damaging) velocities and powers during active muscle fascicle lengthening. We directly measured lateral gastrocnemius muscle force and length in wild turkeys during controlled landings requiring rapid energy dissipation. Muscle-tendon unit (MTU) strain was measured via video kinematics, independent of muscle fascicle strain (measured via sonomicrometry). We found that rapid MTU lengthening immediately following impact involved little or no muscle fascicle lengthening. Therefore, joint flexion had to be accommodated by tendon stretch. After the early contact period, muscle fascicles lengthened and absorbed energy. This late lengthening occurred after most of the joint flexion, and was thus mainly driven by tendon recoil. Temporary tendon energy storage led to {{a significant reduction in}} muscle fascicle lengthening velocity and the rate of energy absorption. We conclude that tendons function as power attenuators that probably protect muscles against damage from rapid and forceful lengthening during energy dissipation...|$|E

There is a growing need for functional imaging of tendon, for example to provide noninvasive biochemical and biomechanical insight into injured, diseased or repairing tendon. This study focuses on ex vivo imaging using a novel combination of state of the art imaging technology, specifically ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near infrared-multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (NIR-MPLSM). We show that both imaging modalities are able to distinguish between normal and damaged tendon. MR imaging revealed macroscopic changes and evidence of tissue disruption; high signal intensity corresponding to surrounding sheaths and some intra-tendinous regions. NIR-MPLSM demonstrated that local interactions between collagen and other matrix components are altered in enzyme-digested tendon. We propose a novel method for quantifying tendon disruption based on tendon crimp waveform parameterisation. Our findings suggest that MRI and NIR-MPLSM are useful technologies for extracting functional information from tendon. We provide insight into how biomechanical properties are related to biochemical parameters, and thus consider the future of in vivo functional MR imaging of tendon. ...|$|E

This study addresses the following questions: 1) how much extra metabolic energy is associated with traveling a unit distance by adopting acceleration/deceleration cycles in walking and running, with respect to constant speed, and 2) how can biomechanics explain those metabolic findings. Ten males and ten females walked and ran at fluctuating speeds (5 ± 0, ± 1, ± 1. 5, ± 2, ± 2. 5 km/h for treadmill walking, 11 ± 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3, ± 4 km/h for treadmill and field running) in cycles lasting 6 s. Field experiments, consisting of subjects following a laser spot projected from a computer-controlled astronomic telescope, were necessary to check the noninertial bias of the oscillating-speed treadmill. Metabolic cost of transport was found to be almost constant at all speed oscillations for running and up to ± 2 km/h for walking, with no remarkable differences between laboratory and field results. The substantial constancy of the metabolic cost is not explained by the predicted cost of pure acceleration/deceleration. As for walking, results from speed-oscillation running suggest that the inherent within-stride, elastic energy-free accelerations/decelerations when moving at constant speed work as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffer</b> for among-stride speed fluctuations, with no extra metabolic cost. Also, a recent theory about the analogy between sprint (level) running and constant-speed running on gradients, together with the mechanical determinants of gradient locomotion, helps to interpret the present findings...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblasts are {{a type of}} cell {{which forms}} the {{structural}} framework of the connective tissue and are key players of wound closure, fibrosis and cancer. These cells experience mechanical perturbations due to matrix remodelling and interstitial fluid movement. Chemical signals from the tissue microenvironment such as Transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) promote differentiation of fibroblasts to a myofibroblastic phenotype marked by enhanced expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) rich stress fibres. However most of the evidence for this has been derived in static cultures which do not fully recapitulate the mechanically dynamic environment in vivo. The response of primary human fibroblasts to physiological levels of fluid movement and chemical perturbations from TGF-β 1 is examined in this study. Findings show that fluid flow induced widespread changes in gene expression compared to static cultures and up-regulated genes such as α-SMA and Collagen 1 A 1. Surprisingly the combination of flow and exogenous TGF-β 1 resulted in reduced myofibroblast differentiation. Myofibroblastic differentiation under flow was partially inhibited by follistatin- 288 and blocked by TGF-β 1 supplementation.

High cell voltage, good cycle life, and an attractive combination of energy and power generation {{are on the verge of}} being guaranteed for high-power and large-scale applications, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles. This investigation examines the circumstances attending the development of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery, to seek a better understanding of the factors affecting its electrochemical performance. The major objective of this work is to determine the advantages and drawbacks of tin dioxide (SnO 2) nanostructured materials as alternative anode materials and to suggest promising structural modifications in order to improve their electrochemical properties. Another important objective is to identify the correlation between electrochemical performance and particle size minimization in the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) system, a promising cathode material, and to give further evidence supporting the incomplete room-temperature reaction mechanism. The selection and assembly of nanostructured materials have been considered as central issues in the development of alternative anode materials that possess higher capacity and better cyclic retention compared to commercial graphite. SnO 2 has shown high capacity and a relatively low reaction potential with Li+, and is thus under consideration as a possible candidate for high-power and high-energy applications. We have synthesized various types of SnO 2 nanostructured materials, such as nanopowders, nanowires, and nanotubes in this work, and their electrochemical properties have been carefully compared in order to demonstrate the effects of their morphological differences on the electrochemical performance, based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. By incorporating structural modifications into the SnO 2 nanostructured materials, we have formed Carbon encapsulated SnO 2 nanopowders and nanowires by simple decomposition of malic acid (C 4 H 6 O 5) at low temperature, which effectively improved specific capacity and cyclic performance. Combining surfactant mediated synthesis and the sol–gel vacuum suction method, SnO 2 –mesoporous organo-silica nano-array (MOSN) nanocomposites were prepared for controlling the large volume variation of SnO 2 during cycling, where the MOSN could act as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>buffer,</b> resulting in a strong enhancement of cyclic retention. On the other hand, the reaction mechanism and phase transition of LiFePO 4 at room temperature have not been fully understood yet. In pursuit of extending our understanding, we have prepared LiFePO 4 /C nanocomposites with different particle sizes and characterized their fundamental crystal structure, which is directly related to the electrochemical behavior. Considering the fact that the room temperature phase diagram is essential to understand the facile electrode reaction of LixFePO 4 (0 3 ̆c x 3 ̆c 1), here, we have suggested experimental evidence for isolation of an intermediate solid solution phase at around x = 0. 93 at room temperature, which strongly supports the incomplete miscibility gap model. More interestingly, the impacts of air exposure on the LiFePO 4 /C nanocomposites have been systematically investigated as a function of temperature. We found that Li+ could be spontaneously extracted from the host structure, even at room temperature under air atmosphere. This finding also can explain the room temperature phase transition of LiFePO 4 and provide the reason for the undesirable Li+ loss that is induced by external factors at room temperature...|$|E

The method proved easy to use, did not require a background in multivariate statistics, and accurately described community divergence in mesocosm systems.

The bacterial communities associated with the interstitial water, pea gravel media, and rhizospheric regions from both planted and unplanted CW mesocosms were profiled using the CLPP method and compared. Vertical community stratification was observed for all mesocosm systems. Rhizospheric communities were found to be significantly more active than their gravel-associated counterparts, suggesting that although rhizospheric bacteria were less abundant in the mesocosms they may play a more significant role in the removal and fate of water born contaminants. The start-up dynamics of CW mesocosms was investigated using the CLPP and standard CW characterization methods over an eight month period. All mesocosms showed a steep increase in interstitial community divergence until day 75 - 100, at which point a steady-state was reached. The interstitial communities were also characterized in terms of similarity based on experimental design treatments (planted/unplanted and origin of seeding inoculum). Four stages were identified during the start-up consisting of an initial stage where mesocosm communities were differentiated based on origin of the inoculum, a period where adjustments and shifts occurred in all mesocosm, a time where all mesocosm communities were quite similar, and a final state where community differentiations were made based plant presence in the mesocosms...|$|R
