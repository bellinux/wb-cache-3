The inquiry which {{occupied}} {{us in the}} two preceding Books, {{has conducted}} us to what appears a satisfactory solution of the principal problem of Logic, according to the conception I have formed of the science. We have found, that the mental process with which Logic is conversant, the operation of ascertaining truths by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> is always, even when appearances point to a different theory of it, a process of induction. And we have particularized the various modes of induction, and obtained {{a clear view of}} the principles to which it must conform, in order to lead to results which can be relied on.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. The {{notion of}} Cause being {{the root of}} the whole theory of Induction, it is {{indispensable}} that this idea should, at the very outset of our inquiry, be, with the utmost practicable degree of precision, fixed and determined. If, indeed, it were necessary for the purpose of inductive logic that the strife should be quelled, which has so long raged among the different schools of metaphysicians, respecting the origin and analysis of our idea of causation; the promulgation, or at least the general reception, of a true theory of induction, might be considered desperate {{for a long time to}} come. But the science of the Investigation of Truth by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evidence,</b> is happily independent of many of the controversies which perplex the science of the ultimate constitution of the human mind, and is under no necessity of pushing the analysis of mental phenomenon to that extreme limit which alone ought to satisfy a metaphysician.|$|E
60|$|It can not, indeed, be {{pretended that}} logical {{principles}} can be altogether irrelevant to those more abstruse discussions; {{nor is it}} possible but that the view we are led to take of the problem which logic proposes, must have a tendency favorable {{to the adoption of}} some one opinion, on these controverted subjects, rather than another. For metaphysics, in endeavoring to solve its own peculiar problem, must employ means, the validity of which falls under the cognizance of logic. It proceeds, no doubt, as far as possible, merely by a closer and more attentive interrogation of our consciousness, or more properly speaking, of our memory; and so far is not amenable to logic. But wherever this method is insufficient to attain the end of its inquiries, it must proceed, like other sciences, by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Now, the moment this science begins to draw inferences from evidence, logic becomes the sovereign judge whether its inferences are well grounded, or what other inferences would be so.|$|E

60|$|The {{object of}} logic, {{as defined in}} the Introductory Chapter, is to {{ascertain}} how we come by that portion of our knowledge (much the greatest portion) which is not intuitive: and by what criterion we can, in matters not self-evident, distinguish between things proved and things not proved, between what is worthy and what is unworthy of belief. Of the various questions which present themselves to our inquiring faculties, some receive an answer from direct consciousness, others, if resolved at all, can only be resolved by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> Logic is concerned with these last. But before inquiring into the mode of resolving questions, {{it is necessary to}} inquire what are those which offer themselves; what questions are conceivable; what inquiries are there, to which mankind have either obtained, or been able to imagine it possible that they should obtain, an answer. This point is best ascertained by a survey and analysis of Propositions.|$|E

50|$|Gatso {{installations}} in the UK and in Queensland, Australia are characterised by a measurement strip {{on the road}} surface, which {{is a series of}} white lines painted on the road, which are used with two photographs taken by the camera. If the camera is set to take two photographs, with a known time interval between them, this time interval will be 0.5 or 0.7 seconds - 0.5 is better for high speed roads and 0.7 better for low speed roads. The vehicle's position, relative to the white road markings in the two photographs, can be used to calculate the vehicle speed. In the UK, the evidence is only admissible in court if the speed measured by the radar and the speed calculated from the distance travelled between the photographs agrees within 10%. The speed indicated by the radar unit is too unreliable to be used as the sole <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> as it is prone to error due to multiple reflections etc. Further, it does not distinguish between multiple vehicles in shot.|$|E

40|$|Resumé Proving guilt in a {{civil case}} is the most {{important}} part of judicial proceedings, since final decision of the court in a particular case results mainly from its course. This is also the main reason why I have chosen this issue as the topic of my diploma thesis. Studying this issue in depth and learning to orientate in it it's very contributive for each lawyer's practice. The diploma thesis consists of three main chapters, introduction and conclusion. The first chapter consists of five sub-chapters, they are of a general nature and explain elementary terms, institutes and principles of the procedural proving guilt; one of five sub-chapters describes the whole process of proving guilt. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the addressee into the issue and to explain elementary principles and problems of proving guilt {{in a civil}} case.

40|$|I this {{dissertation}} I {{study the}} standard of evidence practiced in crime investigation. I concentrate on one recurrent decision-problem: That of assessing and deciding the basic, causal/logical, evidential value of <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in given criminal cases. I restrict further to such problems when the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is based on imprints without transferred components (illustrated by bitemarks on human skin) and expert-knowledge about such imprints (forensic odontology and medicine). The question is: Which standard of induction {{can and should be}} required for crime investigative decisions in modern democracies? The answer depends on (a) the specification of “logical coherence” and (b) the analytical and institutional conditions and aims of crime investigation. Having established a minimum standard of evidence and the conditions and aims of crime investigation, I ask: (1) What is the current inductive procedure for determining the evidential value of <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> based on imprints in the form of bitemarks on human skin?; (2) does this procedure provide logically coherent justification according to the minimum standard of evidence identified I chapter 1 ? Two empirical studies suggest a procedure of the type “incomplete and open induction” and “no” to question (2). An alternative procedure, “complete and closed induction”, anchored in Bayesian Theory and Bayesian Inference Networks, is suggested, theoretically justified, and demonstrated in the last four chapters of the dissertation. The question is: This procedure provides logically coherent justification to {{the standard of}} evidence identified in chapter 1 and thus secures the basic shared epistemic aspects of trust-formation, but is it compatible with and able to secure the further and internally conflicting contextual/situational legal, social, and emotional aspects of trust-formation? The answer is a contingent “yes” – if it is restricted to the investigative phase and under-communicated during {{the last part of the}} trial phase: Epistemic needs are as necessary for trust-formation as are contextual/situational social and emotional needs, but the former is not directly compatible with the latter and must therefore be secured prior to the latter...|$|E

Seu ponto de partida foi a evolução histórica das provas, que foi visitada rapidamente. Na seqüência, foram enfrentadas as questões ligadas ao conceito e a natureza jurídica das provas, bem como o dogma da verdade no processo. Nas etapas seguintes foram estudados os princípios, as classificações e os meios de prova. Como a análise de cada meio de prova típico foge ao objeto do trabalho, foram realizados brevíssimos comentários sobre eles. Ato contínuo foi visto, também em breve passagem, as etapas da atividade probatória e os momentos e locais em que elas são produzidas. Os poderes instrutórios do juiz e o ônus da prova foram estudados logo em seguida para dirigir-se a análise da valoração dos meios de prova. Sobreveio, nas etapas finais, a análise das provas ilícitas e atípicas. O último capítulo foi dedicado ao manejo prático das provas no processo do trabalho.
