5000|$|In an interview, Rahman stated {{his desire}} to score for an intense {{emotional}} American film which got completed through this film. He added that the score was challenging for him as the script emphasized affectionate feels between a family specifically on sibling relations. It was necessary that the score must neither sound romantic nor put people into too much negative emotions since mild and minimal sound arrangements were present. Rahman introduced deliberate nuanced imperfections in the score, like all the imperfections that the characters have in the film and yet {{having a lot of}} beauty and hope in it. The soundtrack includes an end credits theme song named [...] "Dotted Line" [...] sung by Liz Phair who had co-written the song with the composer. The song highlights the music composer's rich orchestral score with the singer's acoustic guitar strums, mostly. Phair, keeping the script and three main characters in mind, penned the lyrics partially in just one night after listening to the base score [...] "Dotted Line". She stated the song as lullabying with repetitive word 'Na Na' since the song brings out <b>missing</b> <b>sort</b> of feelings in lives of characters which was to be recreated in the movie.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a novel sorting pairing method for the azimuth-elevation estimates {{obtained from the}} Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational In- variance Techniques (ESPRIT) based closed-form source localization algorithm. The ESPRIT algorithm estimates Direction of Arrival (DOA) angles from a given source using arbitrarily spaced three-dimensional arrays of vector sensors, whose locations need not be known. In estimating the DOAs there can be miss-pairings of DOA azimuth and elevation direction cosines in certain cases. In such cases, the incident angles calculated can be permuted which produces miss matching of angles or <b>misses.</b> The <b>sorting</b> pairing method presented exploits the order of eigenvalues and thereby the DOAs estimated from the ESPRIT algorithm. The sorting pairing method is compared to two other pairing methods: the traditional pairing method, a method that is simplistic in nature when dealing with misses; and the exhaustive pairing method, a method that exhaustively attempts to find the eigenvalue pairing that yields {{the least amount of}} error. Simulation results provides strong evidence that the sorting pairing method gives good results over a much larger range of signal-to-noise ratios than the traditional method, and has an accuracy that is nearly co-linear with the exhaustive method. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{involvement}} with the Kraft Music Hall came about when Larry Crosby, Bing’s brother and public relations director, sent Trotter a wire asking if {{he could be in}} Hollywood on June 28, 1937 to take over the orchestra of the Kraft Music Hall on July 8. Although Trotter had rehearsed and directed orchestras, he had never had an orchestra of his own, with his own name. The first time he appeared under his own name ‘John Scott Trotter and his Orchestra’ was on the Kraft Music Hall with Bing Crosby. The Kraft Music Hall went fifty weeks a year and Trotter did one hundred and forty consecutive Thursdays without <b>missing</b> one; some <b>sort</b> of record. Bing Crosby talked very warmly about Trotter in his 1953 autobiography Call Me Lucky and commented about Trotter's remarkable self-control.|$|R

40|$|Judgment and Agency {{contains}} Sosa’s latest {{effort to}} explain how higher epistemic value of the <b>sort</b> <b>missing</b> from an unwitting clairvoyant’s beliefs might be a special case of performance normativity, with its superior value following from truisms about performance value. This paper argues that the new effort rests on mistaken assumptions about performance normativity. Once these mistaken assumptions are exposed, {{it becomes clear that}} higher epistemic value cannot be a mere special case of performance normativity, and its superiority cannot be guaranteed just by truisms about performance value. Sections 1 and 2 set the stage, clarifying the thesis and the relevant features of Sosa’s strategy, and explaining why the strategy requires the mistaken assumptions. Section 3 presents a dilemma for the new account of higher epistemic value. Section 4 deepens the case for one of the horns. Section 5 takes stock and draws some broader morals...|$|R

His visit made a good impression wherever he went, and he was universally put down as a right good fellow.|$|R

There, at a smaller table, sat Miss Stewart, half a dozen gallants hovering near her, engaged upon a game of cards of a vastly different <b>sort.</b> <b>Miss</b> Stewart did not gamble.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{randomized}} algorithms for sorting and convex hull that achieves optimal performance (for speed-up and cache misses) on the multicore model with private cache model. Our algorithms are cache oblivious and generalize the randomized {{divide and conquer}} strategy given by Reischuk [14] and Reif and Sen [17]. Although the approach yielded optimal speed-up in the PRAM model, we require additional techniques to optimize cache-misses in an oblivious setting. Let p, n,M,B respectively denote number of processors, problem size, the size of individual processor cache memory and block size respectively, then we obtain expected parallel running time O(np log n + log n log log n) with expected O (nB logM n) cache <b>misses</b> for <b>sorting</b> n keys and constructing convex hull of n points. For p ≤ nlog logn, and under the tall-cache assumption M ≥ B 2, both speed-up and cache-misses are the best possible. Since the input-size n ≥ Mp, under a very mild assumption M ≥ log log n, p ≤ nlog logn, so in all realistic scenarios, our algorithm will have optimal time and cache misses with high probability. Although similar results have been obtained recently for sorting [11], we feel that our approach is simpler and general and we apply it to obtain an algorithm for 3 D convex hulls with similar bounds. We also present a simple randomized processor allocation technique without the explicit knowledge {{of the number of}} processors that is likely to find additional applications in resource oblivious environments...|$|R
40|$|Missing {{data are}} a {{persistent}} problem in psychological research. Peer nomination data present a unique missing data problem, because a nominator's nonparticipation results in missing data for other {{individuals in the}} study. This study examined the range of effects of systematic nonparticipation on the correlations between peer nomination data when nominators with various levels of popularity and social preference are missing. Results showed that, compared to completely random nominator missingness, systematic missingness of raters based on popularity {{had a significant impact}} on the correlations between various peer nomination variables. Systematic missingness based on social preference had a smaller impact. These results demonstrate varying (and potentially large) effects of systematically missing nominators on studies using nomination data. It is important that researchers using peer nomination data explore whether nominators are <b>missing</b> in any <b>sort</b> of systematic way and include these results as part of each study. Future research into the nature of systematic nominator missingness could make it possible to use advanced methodologies, such as multiple imputation, in an attempt to minimize the issues associated with systematic missingness...|$|R
40|$|Explanatory {{pluralism}} {{holds that}} the sorts of comprehensive theoretical and ontological economies, which microreductionists and New Wave reductionists envision and which antireductionists fear, offer misleading views of both scientific practice and scientific progress. Both advocates and foes of employing reductionist strategies at the interface of psychology and neuroscience have overplayed the alleged economies that interlevel connections (including identities) justify while overlooking their fundamental role in promoting scientific research. A brief review of research on visual processing provides support for the explanatory pluralist=s general model of cross-scientific relations and discloses the valuable heuristic role hypothetical identities play in cross-scientific research. That model also supplies grounds for hesitation about the correlation objection to the psycho-physical identity theory and complaints about an explanatory gap in physicalist accounts of consciousness. These takes on psycho-neural connections <b>miss</b> both the <b>sorts</b> of considerations that motivate hypothetical identities in science and their fundamental contribution to progressive research. Thus, their focus on the contributions of research at multiple levels of analysis does not bar explanatory pluralists from considering heuristic identity theory (HIT). Arguably, it encourages it. 1 I...|$|R
