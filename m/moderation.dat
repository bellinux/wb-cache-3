5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{internal}} assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and {{is marked by a}} teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external <b>moderation</b> of internal assessment. Based on this <b>moderation,</b> the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.|$|E

5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price <b>moderation.</b> A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels {{offer the}} {{prospect}} of real market competition and oil price <b>moderation.</b> According to the Wall Street Journal, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would {{be as much as}} 25 per cent more expensive, {{if it were not for}} biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to <b>moderation</b> by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
50|$|At the University of Oxford, {{a formal}} degree Class is given, {{and this is}} {{typically}} based on the final examinations. In Oxford, examinations for Prelims or Honour <b>Moderations</b> are also undertaken in first/second year, however these results do not typically affect the final degree classification. Until the 1970s, the four honours divisions in Oxford's <b>moderations</b> and final examinations were named first, second, third and fourth class, but eventually Oxford gave in and adopted the numbering used by other English universities.|$|R
40|$|This mixed methods study {{investigated}} the dynamic impacts of instructor <b>moderations</b> and peer reviews on critical thinking (CT) in a virtual learning community. Multiple data sets were collected from online discourses, participants’ written reflections, and learning artifacts, and analyzed and triangulated with both quantitative and qualitative methods. Both instructor <b>moderations</b> and peer reviews had great impacts on learner’s CT in multiple ways, and stimulated CT development throughout the semester. As learners grew with more CT skills, the needs for instructor <b>moderations</b> decreased; yet peer reviews peaked in terms of quantity, length, and depth of discussions. Peer reviews in this study also demonstrated effective questioning patterns, which were positively accepted by students being questioned or criticized, and resulted in changes and improvements in the final learning artifacts. Practical implications for online teaching and learning and community building are discussed, together with suggestions for future research...|$|R

Chance fined his players for {{shaking hands with}} members of the opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker {{for the remainder of the}} season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} <b>moderation</b> in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging {{restraint}} on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was {{an appeal to the}} papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's tactic of ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} relationships within clans and communities, {{and to promote}} <b>moderation</b> and equitable distribution of resources, Andrianampoinimerina decreed that families should build larger, monolithic stone tombs to hold the remains of all family members, and that the construction of these tombs was to be undertaken as a shared responsibility {{among members of the}} family to be entombed there.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was the {{principal}} monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–550). Under this rule {{the lives of the}} monks were mainly devoted to prayer, together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by <b>moderation</b> and prudence.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in {{defiance}} of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual <b>moderation</b> {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E

5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage <b>moderation</b> {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>moderation</b> and clemency {{shown by}} Kantakouzenos in this settlement, {{it did not}} gain {{universal}} acceptance. Supporters of the Palaiologoi still distrusted him, while his own partisans {{would have preferred to}} depose the Palaiologoi outright and install the Kantakouzenoi as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, and had to be placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous appanage covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a march against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated exclave surrounded by the Serbs, refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a de facto independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{immediately}} {{sought to}} curb the worst excesses of the Spanish, and impressed upon the colonists the need to treat the natives fairly, and within the law. He sent many of the Achi Maya auxiliaries back to Guatemala due to their depredations among the generally peaceful Chontal Maya of the Sula littoral. The <b>moderation</b> of Montejo's actions encouraged considerable numbers of natives {{to return to their}} villages, especially around Gracias a Dios, and the encomienda system began to function as was intended, which greatly alleviated the constant struggle for provisions.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political <b>moderation</b> and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into his philosophy of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|The Junta was {{rejected}} in Montevideo, {{as was the}} exile of Cisneros and the former Audiencia. Moreno reacted immediately, replying to the Montevidean concerns. He supported {{the legitimacy of the}} Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas, as it was debated during the open cabildo. He also called for unity and support of the metropolis, and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch. He argued that the Junta treated the exiles initially with <b>moderation,</b> but their obstinacy, particularly on the part of Cisneros, generated popular discontent. Matías Irigoyen told the same thing to the British Lord Strangford in Río de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural meeting}} of the Women's Franchise League (WFL) was held on 25 July 1889, at the Pankhurst home in Russell Square. William Lloyd Garrison spoke at the meeting, warning the {{audience}} that the US abolition movement had been hampered by individuals advocating <b>moderation</b> and patience. Early members of the WFL included Josephine Butler, leader of the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts; the Pankhursts' friend Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy; and Harriot Eaton Stanton Blatch, daughter of US suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton.|$|E

40|$|We measure price-level {{uncertainty}} and {{instability in the}} U. S. over the period 1850 - 2012. Major outbreaks of price-level {{uncertainty and}} instability occur {{both before and after}} World War II, alternating with three price-level <b>moderations,</b> one near the turn of 20 th century, another under Bretton Woods, and a third in the 1990 s. There {{is no evidence that the}} price level was systematically more stable or less uncertain before or after the Second World War. <b>Moderations</b> sometimes involved links to gold, but the experience of the 1990 s proves that a well-managed fiat regime can achieve the same outcome.
