The theological <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holidaythe Incarnationis rarely encountered in Christmas television. Such a message would be inaccessible to many Americans.|$|E
5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plays. But he also noted ways in which no actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E

5|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E

5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for less government spending.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E

5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
5|$|Sander Gommans {{started the}} {{composition}} of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in Reuver, working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium. This part of the creative process had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums and it would be shared with keyboard player Joost van den Broek for the following ones. Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal, reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting as many different musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs. Meanwhile, his fiancée Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, twisting and reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each participant was infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they learn in each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
