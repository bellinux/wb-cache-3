40|$|Abstract: Livelihoods of the resettled IDPs were {{critically}} poor, {{immediately after}} the resettlement process of post war recovery in Sri Lanka. Cash for Work (CFW) was implemented by Emergency Northern Recovery Project to facilitate them with <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>stability.</b> It facilitates the community for their short term employment; in the mean time it creates a community ownership in the village, by renovating the community assets with the participation of community itself. This facilitated the community strengthening with livelihood development. This was identified as an ideal method for emergency situations such as, post conflict, post war, and post disaster. This study area confines in Northern Provence. Continuous review was carried out {{since the beginning of}} the CFW programme up to the final stage of CFW programme. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) was carried out to find out the strength and weakness of implementation of CFW programme and recommendation for improvements. Impact assessment survey was done to visualize the livelihood development of CFW beneficiaries during and after the CFW programme. Modification in Implementation of CFW programme was undertaken throughout regular Monitoring and Evaluation process. Finally, Generalized Model for Implementation of Cash for Work Program for post emergency situation in Sri Lanka was developed. The common recommendation for CF...|$|E

30|$|Subjective {{well-being}} {{cannot be}} considered a specific unidimensional construct (Diener et al. 1999). Diener defines subjective well-being as “all of {{the various types of}} evaluations, both positive and negative, that people make of their lives. It includes reflective cognitive evaluations, such as life satisfaction and work satisfaction, interest and engagement, and affective reactions to life events, such as joy and sadness”. (Diener et al. 2006). Unfortunately, most researchers assess only one or two well-being variables and rarely include a broader range of concepts. In {{a review of the literature}} Diener and Seligman (2004)) found that 2, 158 publications discussed “positive affect” but only 93 of those mentioned “life satisfaction”. This has led to variable and piecemeal construct definitions and measures of well-being. Fortunately, there appears to be a growing consensus on variables that constitute the core of psychological or subjective well-being in the literature. Theorists seem to agree that definitions of subjective well-being should include life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect (Diener et al. 1999; Diener and Seligman 2004; DeNeve and Cooper 1998) as well as domain satisfaction which are “the judgments people make when evaluating major life domains such as physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health, leisure, social relationships and family” (Diener 2006). While there is no universal agreement on which life domains are central to well-being, national surveys tend to include, in addition to life satisfaction, subjective measures of physical <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> health, <b>financial</b> <b>stability,</b> personal safety, <b>and</b> work satisfaction, among others (Gallup, Inc. 2009; World Health Organization 1997; World Values Survey, 2011).|$|R

40|$|Recent <b>financial</b> crises <b>and</b> central banks’ {{interventions}} to ensure liquidity on the monetary markets {{around the world}} have shown that using interest rate as instrument of monetary policy can be insufficient. Using an aggregate dynamic macro-economic model, we study how to combine inflation targeting with monetary targeting to warrant macro-economic <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>stability.</b> A commitment to a long-run money growth rate corresponding to the inflation target could reinforce the credibility of central bank announcements and the role of inflation target as strong and credible nominal anchor for private inflation expectations. We show that, using Friedman’s k-percent money growth rule to help anchoring inflation expectations under inflation-targeting regime can generate dynamic instability in output, inflation, assets prices as well as real money demand. Alternatively, a well-specified monetary targeting rule that responds negatively to the evolution of expected inflation allows achieving macro-economic <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>stability.</b> inflation targeting, monetary targeting, stock prices, macro-economic <b>and</b> <b>financial</b> <b>stability,</b> Friedman’s k-percent money growth rule. ...|$|R
