25|$|Solar cell {{efficiencies}} {{vary from}} 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction concentrated photovoltaics. Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 14–22%. Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns (through <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens)</b> onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell. However, such {{concentrated solar power}} requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmoscopy or fundus photography: Ophthalmoscopy is an {{examination}} of the retina in which the eye care professional: (1) looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens</b> that provides a narrow view of the retina, or (2) wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time.|$|E

500|$|The American Chemical Society (ACS) {{has used}} the Joseph Priestley House {{as a place to}} mark special celebrations. On July 31 and August 1, 1874, [...] "seventy-seven chemists made a pilgrimage to the site to {{celebrate}} the centennial of chemistry". The date was chosen to mark the hundredth anniversary of Priestley's experiment producing oxygen by heating mercuric oxide with a <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens</b> and sunlight. These chemists came from 15 US states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school [...] "is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876". On September 5, 1926, about 500 ACS members met again at the home to dedicate the small brick museum and to celebrate the meeting 50 years earlier (two survivors of that first meeting were present).|$|E

The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidium (cystidia on the gill edge) {{are abundant}} and variable in structure, usually club-shaped with {{between two and}} five thick obtuse projections that arise from near the apex, sometimes more or less covered with numerous protuberances over the enlarged portion and the neck more or less contorted. They measure 26–38 by 8–13μm, and are hyaline. The gill flesh is made of greatly enlarged cells, and stains pale vinaceous (red wine color) in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a [...] which usually gelatinizes in potassium hydroxide or water mounts prepared for microscopy. The surface hyphae are covered with short rodlike projections.

500|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19mm (3/4inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens.</b> An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that [...] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|E

2500|$|During a British {{expedition}} to North Carolina's Outer Banks in the 1580s, astronomer and mathematician Thomas Harriot {{looked to the}} stars to determine why many of the natives that {{came in contact with}} the Europeans had died mysteriously. He determined that it was not the solar eclipse that he observed on their voyage to the new world nor the comet that appeared during his time on the island. His 1588 Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia hints that instead of finding the answer in the heavens, it was the cruel treatment of the English toward the natives. [...] He also mentioned a “perspective glass whereby we shewed manie strange sights.” This was most likely a <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens.</b> Harriot later {{became one of the first}} users of the telescope after returning to England and rendered a drawing of the moon four months before Galileo.|$|E

2500|$|Collecting {{samples to}} study, however, {{requires}} special consideration {{to ensure that}} the reproducibility of the samples is not compromised. [...] When taking a global sample of one area of the brain for example, proteins that are ubiquitous and relatively unimportant show up very clear in the SDS PAGE. [...] Other unexplored, more specific proteins barely show up and are therefore ignored. [...] It is usually necessary to divide up the plasma membrane proteome, for example, into subproteomes characterized by specific function. [...] This allows these more specific classes of peptides to show up more clearly. [...] In a way, dividing into subproteomes is simply applying a <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens</b> to a specific section of a global proteome’s SDS PAGE map. [...] This method seems to be most effective when applied to each cellular organelle separately. [...] Mitochondrial proteins, for example, which are more effective at transporting electrons across its membrane, can be specifically targeted effectively in order to match their electron-transporting ability to their amino acid sequence.|$|E
2500|$|The laser {{drilling}} process {{involves the use}} of an infrared laser (of surgical grade at a wavelength about 1064nm) to bore very fine holes (less than 0.2 millimeters or 0.005inches in diameter) into a diamond to create a route of access to a black carbon crystal inclusion. Because diamond is transparent to the wavelength of the laser beam, a coating of amorphous carbon or other energy-absorbent substance is applied {{to the surface of the}} diamond to initiate the drilling process. The laser then burns a narrow tube or channel to the inclusion. Once the location of included black carbon crystal has been reached by the drill channel, the diamond is soaked in sulfuric acid to dissolve the black carbon crystal. After soaking in sulfuric acid the black carbon crystal will dissolve and become transparent (colorless) and sometimes slightly whitish opaque. Under microscopic inspection the fine drill or bore holes can be seen, but are not distracting and do not affect sparkle or brilliance of the diamond. While the channels are usually straight in direction, from an entry point on the surface, some drilling techniques are drilled from within, using naturally occurring fractures inside the stone to reach the inclusion in a way that mimics organic [...] "feathers" [...] (This method is sometimes referred to as KM drilling which stands for special drilling in Hebrew). The channels are microscopic so that dirt or debris cannot travel down the channel. The surface-reaching holes can only be seen by reflecting light off of the surface of the diamond during microscopic viewing such as a jeweler's 10x <b>magnifying</b> <b>lens</b> or loupe and are invisible to the naked eye.|$|E
