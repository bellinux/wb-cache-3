40|$|The {{accuracy}} and precision of catalytic converter analysis using conventional analytical methodology such as fire assay, x-ray fluorescence, atomic absorption and ICP-AES are typically {{in the range of}} ± 7 - 10 % RSD. Due to the high cost of noble metals, methods of analysis with increased {{accuracy and}} precision are desired to evaluate the loading of noble metals onto converter bricks. The investigations described in this work have resulted in a better understanding of many of the inherent problems and have contributed new approaches for sample dissolution and analysis using array detector based Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). These methods are shown to be accurate and precise for the analysis of Pt, Pd, and Rh in catalytic converters. Catalytic converters are difficult to dissolve by conventional acid methodology. While carius, tubes have previously been employed to dissolve small weights of sample, complete dissolution of increased amounts of sample, as needed for high precision ICP-AES analysis, has been hindered by the insufficient oxidation potential of the acids in the carius tube. In this work, the addition of ferric chloride is shown to increase the dissolving power of the carius tube method and specifically targets Pt, Pd and Rh for dissolution.

40|$|Abstract — Two {{receivers}} that utilize <b>multichannel</b> (<b>array)</b> {{processing of}} asynchronous wideband direct-sequence CDMA signals are proposed: the symbol decision feedback (SDF) receiver and the chip hypothesis feedback (CHF) receiver. In the SDF configuration, receiver parameters are adapted at the symbol rate.

In the CHF configuration, the receiver parameters are adapted at the chip rate, and decision-feedback equalization is accomplished at chip resolution. At the price of increased computational complexity (linearly proportional to the modulation level) this receiver provides improved performance for systems where time variation cannot be neglected with respect to the symbol rate. Performance of the two receivers was demonstrated in a fouruser scenario, using experimental data obtained over a 2 km shallow water channel.

40|$|AbstractThe rodent {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (ACC) {{is critical}} for visceral pain and pain-related aversive response in chronic visceral hypersensitive (VH) state. Long-term potentiation (LTP), induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) in the medial thalamus (MT) -ACC pathway, is blocked in VH rats. However, the neuronal intrinsic firing characteristics and the MT-ACC connectivity have not been investigated in visceral pain. Using repetitive distension of the colon and rectum (rCRD) as a sensitization paradigm, we have identified that the spontaneous firing rates of ACC neurons and the CRD-stimulated neuronal firings were increased after repetitive visceral noxious stimulation. This correlates with increases in visceral pain responses (visceromotor responses, VMRs). Two <b>multichannel</b> <b>arrays</b> of electrodes were implanted in the MT and ACC. Recordings were performed in free-moving rats before and after repeated CRD treatment. Power spectral density analysis showed that the local field potential (LFP) recorded in the ACC displayed increases in theta band power (4 – 10 Hz) that were modulated by rCRD. Neural spike activity in the ACC becomes synchronized with ongoing theta oscillations of LFP. Furthermore, cross correlation analysis showed augmented synchronization of thalamo-ACC theta band LFPs, which was consistent with an increase of neuronal communication between the two regions. In conclusion, these results reveal theta oscillations and theta-frequency phase-locking as prominent features of neural activity in the ACC and a candidate neural mechanism underlying acute visceral pain...|$|R

Further studies reveal that the selected three metal ions (i. e., Ce 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Cu 2 +) could induce aggregation of the CDs, resulting in quenching of their fluorescence. However, disaggregation or further aggregation of the CDs metal ions ensembles occurs with the addition of phosphate anions. Consequently, fluorescence of the CDs is recovering or further quenching. On account of various numbers of phosphate group and steric hindrance effects of phosphate anions, their affinities to the sensor array can be distinguished through fluorescence changes of the CDs-metal ions ensembles.

Our results show that theperipheral nerve lesion causedadisruption inWMand inhippocampus spike activity and that this disruptionwas reversedby the systemic administration of the dopamine D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist quinpirole (0. 05 mg/kg). In SNI animals, the administration of quin-pirole restored both the performance-related and the task-related spike activity to the normal range characteristic of naive animals, whereas quinpirole in sham animals caused the opposite effect.
