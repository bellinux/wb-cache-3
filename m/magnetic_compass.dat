5|$|Researchers {{found out}} that very weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals {{are to blame for}} the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} regulations concerning seagoing ships, the larger ones can carry several hundred men, {{and the smaller}} ones may {{have more than a}} hundred men on board. One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass).</b> They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we are {{discussing}} {{the effect of the}} use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> on the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech researchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the ancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys were made by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> we can find the axes of the complexes deviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic declination that existed at the time the structures were built. Following this idea, here we discuss some examples of possible alignments obtained by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> concluding that the Chinese surveyors adopted, during the Ming dynasty, a method based on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses.</b> The architects of the antecedent Yuan Dynasty probably used an astronomical method.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{electronic}} navigation in the twentieth century, <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> gradually lost ground to gyro compasses and global positioning systems. Iver C. Weilbach & Co. A/S never engaged {{in the production of}} electronic, navigational systems, which was mainly based on know-how developed in the military industry. The company however continued to produce <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> until 2009-10 and employees of the company performed compass correction until the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{hourglass}} {{was one of}} the few reliable {{methods of}} measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} {{resident}} {{populations of the}} yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, {{it is for the}} most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May) it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year. The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of up to 1,000 or more birds. The groups can include other species such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird and silvereye. They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour. Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings point in New South Wales {{over the course of a}} single day in May 1965. The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields and uses them to navigate while migrating. Experiments where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed indicate that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and poles, rather than north and south. While their flight is in one general direction, it is not in a straight line as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges and detour around cities.|$|E
25|$|The heading {{indicator}} or directional gyro has an {{axis of rotation}} that is set horizontally, pointing north. Unlike a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass,</b> it does not seek north. When being used in an airliner, for example, it will slowly drift away from north and {{will need to be}} reoriented periodically, using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> as a reference.|$|E

25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> are {{influenced}} by any fields other than Earth's. Local environments may contain magnetic mineral deposits and artificial sources such as MRIs, large iron or steel bodies, electrical engines or strong permanent magnets. Any electrically conductive body produces its own magnetic field when it is carrying an electric current. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> are prone to errors {{in the neighborhood of}} such bodies. Some compasses include magnets which can be adjusted to compensate for external magnetic fields, making the compass more reliable and accurate.|$|R

25|$|Among the Four Great Inventions, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> {{was first}} invented as a device for divination {{as early as}} the Chinese Han Dynasty (since c. 206 BC), and later adopted for {{navigation}} by the Song Dynasty Chinese during the 11th century. The first usage of a compass recorded in Western Europe and the Islamic world occurred around the early 13th century.|$|E
25|$|In the Age of Exploration, {{from the}} 15th {{century to the}} 17th century, European cartographers both copied earlier maps (some {{of which had been}} passed down for centuries) and drew their own based on explorers' {{observations}} and new surveying techniques. The invention of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass,</b> telescope and sextant enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, Martin Behaim, a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Large ships {{typically}} {{rely on a}} gyrocompass, {{using the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> only as a backup. Increasingly, electronic fluxgate compasses are used on smaller vessels. However, magnetic compasses are still widely in use {{as they can be}} small, use simple reliable technology, are comparatively cheap, are often easier to use than GPS, require no energy supply, and unlike GPS, are not affected by objects, e.g. trees, that can block the reception of electronic signals.|$|E
50|$|Radionavigation aids {{located on}} the ground, such as VORs, are also checked and updated to keep them aligned with {{magnetic}} north to allow pilots to use their <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> for accurate and reliable in-plane navigation.|$|R
25|$|Just some of such {{instruments}} included chronometers, telescopes, sextants, microscopes, <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses,</b> thermometers, hygrometers, barometers, electrometers, and eudiometers.

50|$|The {{site was}} chosen during the 1960s for {{magnetic}} measurement due to Portland Bill's remoteness and magnetic cleanliness. As Portland stone is non-magnetic, {{as well as}} the site's remoteness, the site is free from any magnetic disturbance such as heavy traffic, and as a result, very small magnetic fields from equipment can be measured with a very high degree of accuracy. The site is used to magnetically assess any item, but mainly MCMV and EOD equipment. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> can also be tested. The unique facility is both notified and approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and is the only accredited centre for Type Approval of <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Compasses</b> and Binnacles in the United Kingdom.|$|R
25|$|There are {{legends of}} earlier south-pointing chariots, {{but the first}} {{reliably}} documented one {{was created by the}} Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200265 CE) of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms, about eight hundred years before the first navigational use of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass.</b> No ancient chariots still exist, but many extant ancient Chinese texts mention them, saying they were used intermittently until about 1300 CE. Some include information about their inner components and workings.|$|E
25|$|Since {{green sea}} turtles migrate long {{distances}} during breeding seasons, they have special adaptive systems {{in order to}} navigate. In the open ocean, the turtles navigate using wave directions, sun light, and temperatures. The sea turtles also contain an internal <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass.</b> They can detect magnetic information by using magnetic forces acting on the magnetic crystals in their brains. Through these crystals, they can sense the intensity Earth’s magnetic field {{and are able to}} make their way back to their nesting grounds or preferred feeding grounds.|$|E
25|$|The Earth {{inductor}} compass is {{a device}} for determining aircraft direction using {{the magnetic field}} of the Earth. The operation of the compass {{is based on the}} principle of electromagnetic induction with the Earth's magnetic field acting as the induction field for an electric generator. A variation generated voltage, thus allows the Earth inductor compass to determine direction. The earth inductor compass is an American invention. It was designed in 1924 by Morris Titterington at the Pioneer Instrument Company. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass,</b> the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.|$|E

50|$|While {{there are}} not {{maintained}} trails in the area, the peak, which is in Joshua Tree Wilderness, is listed by the Angles Chapter of the Sierra Club as a recommended outing. Magnetite formations near the summit are known to disrupt <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{geophysics}} {{was only}} {{recognized as a}} separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to ancient times. The first <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> were made from lodestones, while more modern <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> {{played an important role}} in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.|$|R
25|$|The earth {{inductor}} compass failed {{soon after}} takeoff and after {{an attempt to}} fix it, Hegenberger disregarded the instrument. At 7:45a.m. {{he picked up the}} Crissy beacon as planned, but within an hour the receiver failed. Hegenberger seemingly repaired the radio by switching out the batteries, but the signal was lost again after another thirty minutes, forcing Hegenberger to navigate by dead reckoning using the <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass</b> and driftmeter. As part of his pre-flight planning, Hegenberger had computed azimuth and altitude for the sun, as well as selecting stars for sighting, for various points along the route. He used these figures for celestial observations to supplement his dead reckoning.|$|E
25|$|A Hungarian team {{proposed}} that a sun compass artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings {{to guide their}} boats at night too. A type of crystal they called a sunstone can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship was used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it never goes completely dark. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast) a sunstone {{would have been a}} more reliable guide than a <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sailing from Argentia 14 January 1942, Jones joined Convoy HX 169, {{which was}} headed for Iceland. The convoy {{encountered}} a violent storm; heavy seas and winds of force 9 scattered its ships' convoy. Separated from the convoy, Jones steamed independently for Hvalfjörður, Iceland. Though hampered by a shortage of fuel, an inoperable gyro compass, an erratic <b>magnetic</b> <b>compass,</b> and the continuous pounding of the storm, Jones arrived on the 19th. Five days later, she escorted three merchant ships to Argentia. Once again heavy seas and fierce winds separated the ships, and Jones continued toward Argentia with one Norwegian merchantman. She detected and attacked another submarine 2 February 1942, but her depth charges yielded no visible results.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNavigating animals {{need to know}} {{both the}} bearing of their goal (the ‘map’ step), and how to {{determine}} that direction (the ‘compass’ step). Compasses are typically arranged in hierarchies, with magnetic backup {{as a last resort}} when celestial information is unavailable. Magnetic information is often essential to calibrating celestial cues, though, and repeated recalibration between celestial and <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> is important in many species. Most <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> are based on magnetite crystals, but others make use of induction or paramagnetic interactions between short-wavelength light and visual pigments. Though odors may be used in some cases, most if not all long-range maps probably depend on magnetite. Magnetitebased map senses are used to measure only latitude in some species, but provide the distance and direction of the goal in others...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} (specialised) <b>magnetic</b> <b>compasses</b> used by geologists to measure orientation of geological structures, as they map in the field, to analyse (and document) the geometry of bedding planes, joints, and/or metamorphic foliations and lineations.

5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently.

In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|R
