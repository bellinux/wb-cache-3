40|$|El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its {{relationships}} with <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters</b> comprise {{a very complicated}} and interrelated system. Traditional spatiotemporal techniques face great challenges in dealing with which, how, and where the <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters</b> in different zones help to drive, and respond to, ENSO events. Remote sensing products covering a 15 -year period from 1998 to 2012 were used to quantitatively explore these patterns in the Pacific Ocean (PO) by a prevail quantitative association rule mining algorithm, that is, a priori, within a mining framework. The <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters</b> considered were monthly anomaly of sea surface chlorophyll-a (CHLA), monthly anomaly of sea surface temperature (SSTA), monthly anomaly of sea level anomaly (SLAA), monthly anomaly of sea surface precipitation (SSPA), and monthly anomaly of sea surface wind speed (WSA). Four significant discoveries are found, namely: (1) Association patterns among <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters</b> and ENSO events were found primarily in five sub-regions of the PO: the western PO, the central and eastern tropical PO, {{the middle of the}} northern subtropical PO, offshore of the California coast, and the southern PO; (2) In the western and the middle and east of the equatorial PO, the association patterns are more complicated than other regions; (3) The following factors were found to be predicators of and responses to La Niña events: abnormal decrease of SLAA and WSA in the east of the equatorial PO, abnormal decrease of SSPA and WSA {{in the middle of the}} equatorial PO, abnormal decrease of SSTA in the eastern and central tropical PO, and abnormal increase of SLAA in the western PO; (4) Only abnormal decrease of CHLA in the middle of the equatorial PO was found to be a predicator of and response to El Niño events. These findings will help to improve our abilities to identify the marine association patterns in factors relating to ENSO events...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring {{of spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution of chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentrations in the aquatic milieu is always challenging and often interesting. However, the recent advancements in satellite digital data {{play a significant role}} in providing outstanding results for the <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> investigations. The present paper is aimed to review 'remote sensing research in Chinese seas' within the period of 24 years from 1978 to 2002. Owing to generalized distributional pattern, the Chl-a concentrations are recognized high towards northern Chinese seas than the southern. Moreover, the coastal waters, estuaries, and upwelling zones always exhibit relatively high Chl-a concentrations compared with offshore waters. On the basis of marine Chl-a estimates obtained from satellite and other field measured <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters,</b> we have further discussed on the applications of satellite remote sensing in the fields of harmful algal blooms (HABs), primary production and physical oceanographic currents of the regional seas. Concerned with studies of HABs, satellite remote sensing proved more advantageous than any other conventional methods for large-scale applications. Probably, it may be the only source of authentic information responsible for the evaluation of new research methodologies to detect HABs. At present, studies using remote sensing methods are mostly confined to observe algal bloom occurrences, hence, it is essential to coordinate the mechanism of marine ecological and oceanographic dynamic processes of HABs using satellite remote sensing data with in situ measurements of <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters.</b> The satellite remote sensing on marine environment and HABs is believed to have a great improvement with popular application of technology.

40|$|From {{multiple}} raster datasets to spatial association patterns, the data-mining {{technique is}} divided into three subtasks, i. e., raster dataset pretreatment, mining algorithm design, and spatial pattern exploration from the mining results. Comparison with the former two subtasks reveals that the latter remains unresolved. Confronted with the interrelated <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters,</b> we propose a Tree-based Approach for eXploring Marine Spatial Patterns with multiple raster datasets called TAXMarSP, which includes two models. One is the Tree-based Cascading Organization Model (TCOM), and the other is the Spatial Neighborhood-based CAlculation Model (SNCAM). TCOM designs the "Spatial node→Pattern node" from top to bottom layers to store the table-formatted frequent patterns. Together with TCOM, SNCAM considers the spatial neighborhood contributions to calculate the pattern-matching degree between the specified marine parameters and the table-formatted frequent patterns and then explores the marine spatial patterns. Using the prevalent quantification Apriori algorithm and a real remote sensing dataset from January 1998 to December 2014, a successful application of TAXMarSP to marine spatial patterns in the Pacific Ocean is described, and the obtained marine spatial patterns present not only the well-known but also new patterns to Earth scientists...|$|R

Sea water {{temperature in the}} top 400 [*]m increased {{at a rate of}} 0. 020 – 0. 030 °C[*]⋅[*]yr− 1, which was accompanied by the dissolved oxygen decline. Top 100 [*]m water layer became fresher with lower concentrations of phosphates and nitrates, while at subsurface layers (200 – 400 [*]m) both salinity and nutrients showed small increasing trend. Unlike phosphates and nitrates, silicate concentrations decreased in the entire water column. Shorter-term water temperature dynamics closely correlated with the El Nino events expressed as the Southern Oscillation Index which in turn was linked to the propagation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW). The variations of sea-ice extent matched well the changes in both air and water temperatures. In general, abundance of krill and salps showed opposite to each other trends. Due to large area considered in this study, no significant relationships between abiotic factors and both krill and salps were found. However, our analysis demonstrated that krill abundance was greater in years with lower sea water temperature, greater sea-ice extent and higher nutrient concentration, while salps showed the opposite pattern...|$|R

In this paper we seek to assess the correlations and consequently the potential of using shipborne remote sensing products to infer <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters.</b> Typical seawater parameters are chlorophyll–a (chl–a), colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), suspended particulate material (SPM), Secchi–disk depth (SDD), temperature, and salinity. These parameters and radiometric quantities were observed from a total of 60 stations covering German Bight, North Sea, Inner Seas, Irish Sea, and Celtic Sea. Bio-optical models developed {{in this study were}} used to predict the in situ measured parameters, with low mean unbiased percent differences and absolute percent difference less than 35 %. Our investigations show that the use of ocean color products namely the Forel–Ule Index to infer seawater parameters is encouraging. The constrained spatial and temporal span of measured in situ parameters does limit the accuracy of our models. Absorption coefficients of the main color producing agents CDOM, chl–a, and inorganic fraction of SPM (iSPM) were determined to estimate absorption budgets. During the field campaign, iSPM was the primary light absorber over the spectral range (400 – 700 nm) although variabilities were observed in the regional seas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multivariate general Pareto distribution (MGPD) method and builds {{a method for}} solving MGPD {{through the use of}} a Monte Carlo simulation for <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> extreme-value <b>parameters.</b> The simulation method has proven to be feasible in the analysis of the joint probability of wave height and its concomitant wind from a hydrological station in the South China Sea (SCS). The MGPD is the natural distribution of the multivariate peaks-over-threshold (MPOT) sampling method, and is based on the extreme-value theory. The existing dependence functions can be used in the MGPD, so it may describe more variables which have different dependence relationships. The MGPD method improves the efficiency of the extremes in raw data. For the wave and the concomitant wind from a period of 23 years (1960 – 1982), the number of the wave and wind selected is averaged to 19 per year. For the joint conditional probability of the MGPD, the relative error is rather small in the Monte Carlo simulation method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{offshore}} engineering design, it is considerably significant {{to have an}} adequately accurate estimation of <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters,</b> in particular, the extreme wind speed of tropical cyclone (TC) with different return periods to guarantee the safety in projected operating life period. Based on the 71 -year (1945 – 2015) TC data in the Northwest Pacific (NWP) by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) of US, a notable growth of the TC intensity is observed {{in the context of}} climate change. The fact implies that the traditional stationary model might be incapable of predicting parameters in the extreme events. Therefore, a non-stationary model is proposed in this study to estimate extreme wind speed in the South China Sea (SCS) and NWP. We find that the extreme wind speeds of different return periods exhibit an evident enhancement trend, for instance, the extreme wind speeds with different return periods by non-stationary model are 4. 1 %– 4. 4 % higher than stationary ones in SCS. Also, the spatial distribution of extreme wind speed in NWP has been examined with the same methodology by dividing the west sea areas of the NWP 0 °– 45 °N, 105 °E– 130 °E into 45 subareas of 5 °× 5 °, where oil and gas resources are abundant. Similarly, remarkable spacial in-homogeneity in the extreme wind speed is seen in this area: the extreme wind speed with 50 -year return period in the subarea (15 °N– 20 °N, 115 °E– 120 °E) of Zhongsha and Dongsha Islands is 73. 8  m/s, while that in the subarea of Yellow Sea (30 °N– 35 °N, 120 °E– 125 °E) is only 47. 1  m/s. As a result, the present study demonstrates that non-stationary and in-homogeneous effects should be taken into consideration in the estimation of extreme wind speed...|$|R

40|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of those {{post-mortem}} processes which affect organisms and their skeletons through biological, physical and chemical alterations. The taphonomic history of a fossil assemblage can provide a wide range of information concerning environmental conditions and ecological relationships of the living community including causes of death, biological and physical processes on the sediment surface, rates of transport, surface residence times before burial and diagenesis. Taphonomic analysis can ultimately reveal processes and patterns not readily recognizable by other palaeoecological or sedimentological approaches. A far as coral reefs are concerned, there has been the tendency to consider them as examples of preserved life assemblages. As a consequence, taphonomic approaches to the study of corals and coral reefs are relatively rare. Nevertheless, the development and demise of coral reef frameworks and the preservation potential of both in situ and rubble coral assemblages are strictly related to taphonomic processes such as, for example, physical disturbance (storm events and terrestrial run-off) and bioinfestation on both living and dead corals. Taphonomic signatures are especially significant in reconstructing environmental conditions associated to scleractinian-dominated turbid-water bioconstructions (TWBs) thriving in episodically or permanently turbid waters where <b>marine</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>parameters</b> often approach the threshold levels for tropical carbonate production. Coral assemblages from the Oligocene of the Piedmont Basin (NW Italy) and the Gornji Grad Beds (Slovenia) represent an example of “reefs” developed in nearshore deltaic turbid-water settings. Within these two case studies we present here preliminary results of a taphonomic approach using microfacies analysis as a tool to infer the incidence of controlling factors as terrigenous input, reduced light penetration and turbidity. Our analysis is particularly focused on primary processes occurring on coral remains before or during sedimentation, especially fragmentation and bioinfestation. Microfacies analysis shows: 1) generally low incidences of fragmentation; 2) low rates of abrasion of coral clast boundaries; 3) an inverse relationship between fragmentation and bioinfestation. Bioinfestation is a process involving both bioerosion and encrustation. In contrast to bioerosion, which represents a destructive process due to grazers and boring organisms (such as clionid sponges and boring bivalves), encrustation is a constructive and stabilizing process mainly represented in the studied material by coralline algae and encrusting foraminifera. This process can affect both living and dead substrates. With respect to bioinfestation: 1) Encrustation and bioerosion are typically sparsely distributed among coral clasts and also within the same coral fragment; 2) Bioerosion is inversely correlated with terrigenous input; 3) The degree of infestation by boring organisms is also dependent on coral morphology and skeletal architecture: in fact branching corals are more susceptible to bioerosion and among these, Stylophora is more susceptible than Acropora; 4) The dependence of encrustation on a specific controlling ecological factor is still unclear. Through this taphonomic approach it was possible to infer for both study areas a muddy environment with a generally low hydrodynamic regime, dominated at least occasionally by high turbidity and/or sedimentation. Sediment-resistants and fast-growing coral morphologies were promoted and the production of dead coral rubble was frequent, especially during phases of abundant terrigenous run-off from rivers. Nevertheless, the rate of transport for coral clasts was low, such that these assemblages were deposited almost in situ. Surface residence times of coral rubble before burial was very variable and was probably the main factor controlling incidences of bioinfestation, which is typically not homogenous...|$|R
