40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to assess the}} status of the higher education (HE) system. A monitoring system for HE in Russia is proposed using the indicative figures grouped in two units. In the first <b>methodological</b> <b>unit</b> entitled “The Conditions of Operation and Status of Infrastructure of the HE System ” are included indicators characterising the conditions of financing, human resources, the status of fixed assets and the learning environment in the HE institutions. The second <b>methodological</b> <b>unit</b> entitled “State Educational and Research Activities of the HE System ” includes indicators characterising research capacity, the effectiveness of faculty research activities and the educational and research capacity of students of the HE institutions. On the basis of the proposed methodological tools, {{the status of the}} HE system of the Ural Federal District is evaluated and classified. The calculations were based on primary statistical data from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service and the Ministry of Education and Science. The analysis conducted over a time period of 12 years has shown that, unfortunately, a direct correlation between the growth of investments and an increase in quality is not observed. The growth rate of financing of regional HE was in some cases several times higher in one region than another, increasing the visibility of the results. It is clear that the leaders in terms of financing and the leaders in terms of improving the quality of education are two different things. This demonstrates the need to reform regulation of HE, particularly with regard to prioritising its development and improving th...|$|E

ABSTRACTBioregionalists have championed the utility ofthe concept ofthe watershed as an organizingframeworkfor thought and action directed to understanding and implementing appropriate and respectful human interaction with particular pieces of land. In a creative analogue to the watershed, permaculturist Arthur Cetz has recently introduced the term "foodshed " to facilitate critical thought about where our food is coming from {{and how it is}} getting to us. We find the 'joodshed " to be a particularly rich and evocative metaphor; but it is much more than metaphor. Like its analogue the watershed, the foodshed can serve us as a conceptual and <b>methodological</b> <b>unit</b> ofanalysis that provides a frame for action as well as thought. Food comes to most of us now through a global food system that is destructive ofboth natural and social communities. In this article we explore a variety of routes for the conceptual and practical elaboration of the foodshed. While corporations that are the principal beneficiaries of a global food system now dominate the production. processing, distribution, and consumption offood. alternatives are emerging that together could form the basis for foodshed development. Just as many farmers are recognizing the social and environmental advantages to sustainable agriculture, so are many consumers coming to appreciate the benefits offresh and sustainabl...|$|E

The use of practices as key <b>methodological</b> <b>units</b> for research and governance is suggested as a way to avoid the pitfalls of the individualist and systemic paradigms that dominated the field of sustainable consumption studies for some decades. With the help of practice theory, environmental governance can be renewed in three particular ways: First, the role and responsibilities (not) to be assigned to individual citizenconsumers in environmental change can be specified. Secondly, objects, technologies and infrastructures can be recognized for their crucial contribution to climate governance without lapsing into technological determinism. Third, the cultural framing of sustainability can be enriched by looking into the forms of excitement generated in shared practices of sustainable consumption.

Thus this thesis is the first detailed and comprehensive study in the field of PM within the Italian context. To analyze the development of the PM professional project, I looked mainly at the three main PM professional associations that are active in this field: PMI, IPMA, and ISIPM.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of a technical system reflects significant design {{decisions about the}} system's organization and typically documents a description of key system elements (be they hardware or software), their composition, functioning, and interrelation. The process of creating a description of an architecture is called architecture modeling. In the telecommunication domain, the architecture level has always {{played an important role}} in the design and evolution of communication systems and networks. However, the way how telecommunication engineers describe their architectures is surprisingly rudimentary: They use natural languages and conceptual drawings, as a look into "old" as well as recent standards unveils. Even in the transition phase from standards to the early design phases of systems development, system designers do not go much beyond that level of informality. Therefore, as practice shows, in telecommunications, architecture modeling but not the understanding of architecture as such lacks (i) a suitable, consistent and formal modeling language, which is adapted to the needs of systems designers, and (ii) a methodology to support the modeling process. This work addresses these deficiencies. In this thesis, a systematic approach is presented for modeling architectures of virtually any telecommunication system. This includes a methodology, a modeling language, and a prototype implementation of the language. A major contribution of this work is the statement that such an approach can be based upon as few as three basic cornerstones for a networked system: the types of communication and the design principles of distribution and layering. The investigation distills fundamental insights for the design and construction of modern communication systems. The outcome can be summarized as follows: The aspect of control leads to the distinction of three elementary types of communication (control-oriented, data-oriented, and protocol-oriented communication) and provides the rational for grey-box architecture descriptions. The aspect of distribution can be manifested by the notion of a complex connector, which is the key concept to model connection-oriented, connectionless and even space-based communication networks including quality of service. Layering in telecommunication systems is different from the ordinary understanding of the term. Layers in a distributed communication system follow a generic form of refinement, namely communication refinement. Communication refinement constitutes a true abstraction hierarchy, which can be interpreted from two perspectives: from a node-centric and from a network-centric viewpoint. The viewpoint chosen has an important impact on the systems understanding. The foundation of this work is mathematical, its application is practical. The mathematics help giving precise definitions on the notions of distribution and layering; the resulting implications shape the methodology and the language. The language developed is based on ROOM (Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling), an object-oriented but also component-based language. Key language features of ROOM will be integrated in the forthcoming 2. 0 release of the Unified Modeling Language, UML. The extensions proposed to ROOM led to a careful redesign of the language and a prototype implementation. The accompanying methodology is organized in method blocks, each block being a self-contained <b>methodological</b> <b>unit</b> encompassing heuristics and architectural solution patterns. The thesis statement is supported by a real-life case study on the SIGTRAN (SIGnaling TRANsport) architecture. In the case study, first the understanding of architecture models as imposed by standards is presented. At the end of this work, it is shown that systematic architecture modeling is relatively easy and comes at little cost [...] the gains in terms of clarity, preciseness and expressiveness are remarkable...|$|E

A standardised method prescribed by the International Organisation for Standardization (BSI 2006), LCA, adopts a process-based modelling approach where a system is modelled using an inventory of processes representing inputs, outputs and potential environmental burdens of the system. The literature is abundant with studies that have used LCA to assess different food waste treatment options.

40|$|An {{attempt to}} build a global {{cognitive}} theory in Archaeology is proposed. The archaeological method {{is based on a}} three level concept : knowledge acquiring, structuring and modelling, inspired by the XIX century work of Peirce, renewed by recent developments of cognitive Sciences and used today in many fields of Social and Human Sciences, System Engineering, and recently proposed in Archaeology (DJINDJIAN 1993). The knowledge acquiring level A is the result of simultaneous and retroactive use of two mechanisms: several specific analogical processes in archaeology (contemporary analogy, ethnographical analogy, experimental analogy) and a cognitive process, general to Human Sciences. Logical objects used by archaeological reasoning are artefacts, set of artefacts (archaeological layer, dwelling structure, burial, etc.) and <b>methodological</b> objects (<b>unit,</b> sample, core, etc.). Such objects may deliver three categories of data: intrinsic data, extrinsic data and administrative data. Intrinsic data (named I) are a view of an object, resulting in the interaction between the archaeological artefact and the archaeologist who is perceiving and describing it. Intrinsic data is a knowledge of the artefact. Extrinsic data (named E) are data recording the various artefact contexts: spatial and stratigraphic localisation, links with neighbouring artefacts, environment, etc. Extrinsic data depends on the quality of archaeological excavation and recording. In all the cognitive processes, knowledge A must be associated with the archaeologist, ARCH, who is at the origin of the interaction artefact/archaeologist, the process of producing the knowledge, Pc, and the validation process Pv, controlling the reasoning: (A, ARCH, Pc, Pv). The structuring level, S, is discussed in relation with the question of enrichment of structures towards the emergence of a system, through a dedicated method called the systemic triple method (DJINDJIAN 1980) : 1. Definition of the system S; 2. Perception and description of intrinsic data I; 3. Recording of extrinsic data E; 4. Formalisation of the structuring process: intrinsic structuring (matrix artefact x intrinsic data, O x I), extrinsic structuring (occurrence or Burt matrix intrinsic data x extrinsic data, I x E); 5. Exploratory data analysis on O x I or I x E; 6. Retroactions on I and E; 7. Iterative enrichment by integration of new I and new E; 8. Validation (using another artefact system, a new E, etc.). The modelling level is then examined with a discussion of the limits of the formal logic in Archaeology: empirical-inductive, where “every structure is Culture”, or hypothetical-deductive methods, where “all the models are fitting well” falling in the weakness of so-called paradigmatic models. A new more restricting method is proposed, called the cognitive model method, CMM. The main features of CMM are: explicit, formalised, repetitive, stable, systemic, refutable, predictive, discursive and auditable. A general method {{to build a}} cognitive model is then given, in ten steps; some of them are already known and referenced, others are new and detailed: 1. Improving the knowledge A; 2. Discovering the structures S inside data; 3. Enrichment of structures S; 4. Systemic organisation in hierarchical subsystems; 5. Building models R; 6. Validating models R; 7. Retroactions for enrichment and stabilisation of the models R; 8. Model simulation for predictions; 9. Writing the archaeological discourse; 10. Auditing the discourse. The systemic organisation in hierarchical sub-systems is based on a five level system: 1. Technological know-how; 2. Economic activities: craft production, raw material supplying, subsistence resources, energy resources, buildings (dwellings, infrastructure), territory management, manufacturing, exchange and trading, etc.; 3. Social organisation: workflow, specialisation of professions, social groups, social hierarchies, family structures, community administration, defence, taxes, authority systems, etc.; 4. Symbolic sub-system: ideas and beliefs; 5. Global system. In conclusion, such approaches of methodological development are the most reliable but also the most difficult way to reach a real scientific status for Archaeology...|$|R
40|$|Rational Choice theory {{includes}} a broad {{body of research}} that attempts to account for how people act {{in a variety of}} contexts, including economic, political and even moral situations. By proposing, most generally, that individuals rationally pursue their self-interests regardless of the context, rational choice has had extensive theoretical and empirical success, on the one hand, and has also faced wide criticism when applied in a variety of disciplines, on the other hand. While there is disagreement over what the defining assumptions of rational choice theory are, in this dissertation I focus on three on which there is widespread agreement. These three features of rational choice theory are: its assumption of egoism or self-interest as the central motivation of individuals; its reliance on consequences as part of a comparative decision-making framework; and finally, its focus on the individual and not on groups as the <b>methodological</b> and normative <b>unit</b> of analysis. In correspondence to these three features, my dissertation is divided into three parts and explores the separate topics of (I) egoism and altruism; (II) consequentialism and ethical decision-making; and, (III) individualism and group identity. The dissertation is not an exercise in showing the extensive problems of rational choice theory, although there are many. The dissertation rather engages these three topics with differing results, some of which in fact attempts to revitalize rational choice, or at least features of rational choice. For the part on altruism, my goal is to demonstrate why the central assumption of egoism in rational choice theory is problematic. More broadly, I argue for a different way of defining genuine altruistic motivation. A result of my analysis there is that altruism appears to be more widespread than has been traditionally assumed and is more amenable to empirical examination. For my discussion on consequentialism, my aim is to re-characterize rational choice as a mode of moral decision-making. I argue that the moral agent is one who frequently compares her particular moral ends in a stable fashion and for this reason cost-benefit analysis is a fully moral framework, one that encourages the agent to genuinely care for her ends and values. For the topic of individualism and group identity, my objective is to show how a previously dismissed topic, once unpacked, is fully consistent with rational choice theory and ought to be of interest to the rational choice theorist. I show that if the liberal political theorist, including the rational choice theorist, is to value group identity, the commitment is only limited to valuing a form of group identity [...] particularized identity [...] that is individualist in character.

40|$|Researchers, {{scholars}} and scientists main business is scholarly communication. We communicate about our work to others, as we push {{the boundaries of}} what we know and the society knows. We question established notions and truths about science. We share our findings with others, and {{in a way that is}} popularly known as scholarly communication which emerged with the publication of first journal in 1665. However, the term gained popularity only in the 1970 s, as access to peer reviewed and scholarly communication became difficult. This module has four units covering introduction to scholarly communication, peer reviewed journals, electronica journals and databases and the Serials Crisis. At the end of this module, the learner is expected to be able to: - Explain philosophy, mission, and objectives of scholarly communication - Describe the process of scholarly communication - Identify different channels of scholarly communication - Discuss the dysfunction of the scholarly communication. In Unit 1, Introduction to scholarly communication, we have discussed different aspects of scholarly communication – particularly its genesis, importance and ethics of academic publishing, and different communication channels available in academic publishing. Some of these channels are commonly described as primary sources as they provide first-hand testimony or direct evidence concerning a topic under investigation. Historically, scientific journals were initiated by learned societies and other scholarly communities for reporting results of concluded research works or scientific discoveries. Now many for-profit publishers have started publishing research journals. Unit 2, Communicating with Peer Review Journals, covers two important academic publishing channels, namely peer reviewed journals, conferences and their proceedings. This Unit also highlights different methods and procedures of peer reviewing for publishing primary literature emanated from research studies. The peer reviewing is essential for validating quality of research findings conveyed by researchers, which are subject to fulfillment of ethical standards and appropriate research design, sampling and other <b>methodological</b> issues. In <b>Unit</b> 3, Electronic journals and databases, we have discussed the emergence of electronic journals in academic and research environment due to wide proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICT) in research communications and academic publishing. Scientific communities and scientific communications from the global South are getting substantive attentions through adaptation of electronic journals and electronic academic databases in the process of research communications. In Unit 4, the Serials Crisis, we discuss the cost of peer reviewed publications and the problems faced by researchers in developing countries. The focus of this unit is on highlighting the problems and discusses possible solutions including the emergence of open access as one of the solutions.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into the impact of entrepreneurship education in Ireland. It focuses on graduate entrepreneurship education (MBA) and endeavours to assess its impact on graduates’ entrepreneurial behaviour over the long-term. The work has evolved from significant research gaps and vulnerabilities identified within the literature and revolved around the following research question: ‘What influence does entrepreneurship education have on MBA graduates propensity to venture’. In addressing this question, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken. Firstly, various ways of studying and understanding the individual entrepreneur and the term entrepreneurship are explored. Next, a robust review of the entrepreneurship education literature was conducted. This reveals that despite the exponential international growth of the discipline over the last four decades, remarkably little empirical work has been conducted into the impact of courses and on the propensity of graduates to venture. Much of the research that has been conducted to date focuses on a single course or programme and its immediate impact. Furthermore, very few studies use ‘control groups’ which facilitate a comparison of those who have and have not taken entrepreneurship. Analysis of the literature pertaining to the impact of entrepreneurship education has resulted {{in the development of a}} conceptual model for the study. This encompasses a national study of MBA graduates in Ireland over the long-term and includes those who have taken entrepreneurship as part of their MBA programme and those who have not. The purpose of this thesis is exploratory in nature as it seeks to indicate and identify meaning within a little-understood situation (entrepreneurship education and graduate entrepreneurial behaviour). The theoretical background to the work resulted in the development of a number of hypotheses and sub-hypotheses. These were tested through a research design that accommodated a combination of both quantitative and qualitative measures (<b>methodological</b> triangulation). The <b>unit</b> of analysis is MBA graduates in Ireland. A mail survey was conducted and the quantitative data from this was supported by face-to-face interviews. The mail survey was distributed to a sample of 550 MBA graduates in Ireland and a valid response rate of 37. 8 % was achieved. The qualitative study comprises of six face-to-face interviews. The findings from this study indicate that there was no link established between exposure to entrepreneurship education and the consequential entrepreneurial behaviour of participating MBA graduates. This result conforms with other studies which have yielded similar findings. However, with few exceptions, the widespread popularity that entrepreneurship education now enjoys has not been matched with robust research deliberation into its outcomes and the differing research designs used make meaningful comparisons very difficult. This study underlines the need for more research to be conducted into the impact of entrepreneurship education. Such work must be completed using methodologies, survey instruments and statistical analysis that facilitate both collaboration and comparison. The thesis is not an end in itself but rather represents a platform or conduit on which future research can be buil...|$|R
