40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} shown that the {{capacity}} of a multiple-input multiple-output system increases linearly with the number of antennas, provided that the environment is rich scattering. However, this increase in the capacity is substantially degraded if the <b>multiple</b> <b>input</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>output</b> channels are correlated. In this paper, the capacity of correlated <b>multiple</b> <b>input</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>output</b> fading channel is investigated for laplacian and uniform angular energy distributions that implicitly represent two different scatterer distributions. The effect of the spatial correlation of a uniform circular antenna array is considered. Optimal power allocation is implemented to maximize the capacity. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, the results show that <b>multiple</b> <b>input</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>output</b> channel capacity {{is a function of the}} angle spread and antenna spacing. These two parameters play a major role in dictating the spatial correlation which in turn affects on the capacity. Large angle spread leads to lower correlation between the antenna elements and consequently higher capacity.
