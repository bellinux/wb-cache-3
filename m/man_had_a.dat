5|$|Despite {{its effects}} in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, only one person was directly killed from the storm there; a man drowned off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near Fort Morgan, Alabama. One indirect casualty also occurred in the area, when a <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> heart attack while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm. Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days, south and along I-10 in Mobile, south and central Choctaw, and Baldwin counties. Along the Fowl and Fish rivers, in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively, significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding. Most roads on Dauphin Island were flooded in over a foot of water. A few homes were close to falling into Mobile Bay, and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction. At {{the peak of the}} storm in Alabama, at least 44,000people were without power in Mobile and Baldwin counties. In rural Choctaw County, north of Mobile, several families were rescued from flooded roads and trapped cars. The majority of houses and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings from the western shore of Mobile Bay, and from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach, had roof damage. $ (1997USD, $ USD) in total property damage occurred in Alabama, in addition to pecan and pine tree damage costing $ (1997USD, $ USD).|$|E

25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was.

25|$|Lawson and Wooliscroft (2004) {{drew the}} link between human nature and the {{marketing}} concept, not explicitly biology, where they considered the contrasting views of Hobbes and Rousseau on mankind. Hobbes believed <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> self-serving nature whereas Rousseau was more forgiving towards the nature of man, suggesting them to be noble and dignified. Hobbes saw {{the need for a}} governing intermediary to control this selfish nature which provided a basis for the exchange theory, and also links to Mcgregor’s Theory of X and Y, relevant to management literature. He also considered cooperation and competition, relevant to game theory as an explanation of man’s motives and can be used for understanding the exercising of power in marketing channels. Pinker outlines why the nature debate has been suppressed by the nurture debate in his book The Blank Slate.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 {{he defended}} the title with success against Bobby Dykes, Gil Turner, and with Graham {{in a third}} {{encounter}} between the two. All those fights were won by decision in 15. He also had five non-title bouts, including three that {{were a part of}} an Argentinian tour. His third fight with Graham was his first world title defense in Havana and his fight with Dykes marked {{the first time that a}} black man and a white <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boxing fight in then-segregated Miami, Florida. In 1953, Gavilan retained the title by a knockout in ten against Chuck Davey, by a decision in 15 against Carmen Basilio and by a decision in 15 against Bratton. He had seven non-title bouts, losing to Danny Womber, but beating Ralph Tiger Jones. In 1954 Gavilan went up in weight. After two more points wins, he challenged world Middleweight champion Bobo Olson for the world title, but lost a decision in 15. Then, he went down in weight, and lost his world Welterweight championship, by a decision in 15 to Johnny Saxton. That same year, he appeared on a Telemundo Puerto Rico poster that promoted that country's first television transmission.|$|E
25|$|The revolt {{started on}} January 10, 1923. Arriving with trains to Kretinga and Tauragė, 1,090 volunteers (40 officers, 584 soldiers, 455 riflemen, 3 clerks, 2 doctors, 6 orderlies) {{crossed the border}} into the region. Among them were Steponas Darius and Vladas Putvinskis. They wore {{civilian}} clothes and had green armband with letters MLS for Mažosios Lietuvos sukilėlis or Mažosios Lietuvos savanoris (rebel/volunteer of Lithuania Minor). Each <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> rifle and 200 bullets; the rebels had a total of 21 light machine guns, 4 motorcycles, 3 cars, 63 horses. In hopes to negotiate a peaceful retreat of the French and to avoid any casualties, shooting was allowed {{only as a last}} resort of self-defense. Galvanauskas ordered perfect behavior (politeness, no plunder, no alcoholic drinks, no political speeches) and no Lithuanian identification (no Lithuanian documents, money, tobacco, or matchboxes). In the Klaipėda Region, these men were met by some 300 local volunteers, though Lithuanian historian Vygandas Vareikis disputed the accuracy of this assertion. More local men joined once the rebels reached cities. The rebels met little resistance, but struggled with cold winter weather, lack of transportation and basic supplies (they were not provided with food or clothes, but were given a daily allowance of 4000 German marks).|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} determinants of the wage is probably the amount of formal education. Women in our sample have on average more formal education than men. For example, 17.9  % of women and 13.7  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high school degree; 8.7  % of women and 7.8  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> university degree. However, there are relatively more women who have only compulsory education than men. In particular, 19.1  % of women and 13.8  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> compulsory schooling only, whereas 28.0  % of women and 48.7  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> completed <b>an</b> apprenticeship.|$|R

25|$|In 1959, Wurlitzer {{released}} an electro-mechanical drum machine called the Side Man, {{which was the}} first-ever commercially produced drum machine. The Side Man {{was intended as a}} percussive accompaniment for the Wurlitzer organ range. The Side Man offered a choice of 12 electronically generated, predefined rhythm patterns with variable tempos. The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10 preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a rotating wiper arm with contact brushes on it that swept around a phenolic panel with corresponding contacts arranged in a pattern of concentric circles across its face; these were spaced in certain patterns to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular rhythmic patterns of the day, e.g. waltzes, fox trots etc. These combinations were selected by a rotary knob {{on the top of the}} Side Man box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that increased the speed of rotation of the wiper arm. The Side <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> panel of 10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Side Man was housed in a mahogany cabinet that contained the sound-generating circuitry, amplifier and speaker.|$|E

500|$|During the Song dynasty, {{for those}} without formal education, {{the quickest way}} to power and the upper echelons of society was to join the military.

[...] Exam-drafted scholar-officials came mostly from prominent families and could rely on their clan status to advance their careers and place in society. Many Song military officers did not have this advantage, and owed their status in society to the advantage that military power granted them. [...] Many court eunuchs such as Tong Guan (1054–1126) were eager to enlist as officers in the central army since this was a means to elevate their position at court.|$|E

500|$|Rumours that Richard {{was still}} alive persisted, but never gained much {{credence}} in England; in Scotland, however, a man identified as Richard came {{into the hands of}} Regent Albany, lodged in Stirling Castle, and serving as the notionaland perhaps reluctantfigurehead of various anti-Lancastrian and Lollard intrigues in England. Henry IV's government dismissed him as an impostor, and several sources {{from both sides of the}} Border suggest the <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mental illness, one also describing him as a [...] "beggar" [...] by the time of his death in 1419, but he was buried as a king in the local Dominican friary in Stirling. Meanwhile, in 1413, Henry Vin an effort both to atone for his father's act of murder and to silence the rumours of Richard's survivalhad decided to have the body at King's Langley moved to its final resting place in Westminster Abbey. Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb, where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed.|$|E
500|$|Along the coastline, Barbara flooded {{roads and}} houses. Strong winds downed trees and power lines, leaving some cities {{isolated}} from communication. Some of the downed trees were large and {{had survived the}} Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944. The combination of winds and rainfall left some damage to crops and structures. The storm's impact along the coast was light to moderate, with monetary damage estimated around $1.3million (1953USD, $ USD), mostly from the crop damage. Four marines in the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were injured, as was a Coast Guard worker. One person died at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, after winds blew him off of a pier. A report on the cyclone by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicates {{that this is the}} only causality associated with Barbara. However, newspaper articles subsequent to the storm report several more fatalities, with one paper reporting a total of seven deaths; two of them were from electrocutions. The rainfall from Barbara was blamed for traffic accidents further north in New Jersey and New York City, causing four deaths. There was also an indirect death in New York when a <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> heart attack while securing his boat. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, there was damage to storefronts.
