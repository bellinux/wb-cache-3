5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
500|$|Lavelli {{attended}} the Browns' first {{training camp in}} 1946. Competition was fierce for {{a spot on the}} roster, but Lavelli was {{one of the men who}} made it. He was up against a number of National Football League veterans and former college stars. [...] "The toughest game I ever played in was the first intrasquad scrimmage game," [...] he said later. [...] "Nobody talked to each other for two days." [...] He joined an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, placekicker Lou Groza and fellow end Mac Speedie. Lavelli quickly became Graham's top passing target and led the AAFC in receiving as a rookie with 40 receptions and 843 yards. The Browns made it to the league championship that season, and Lavelli caught the game-winning touchdown in a 14–9 victory over the AAFC's New York Yankees. The victory [...] "didn't <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> then, but as time goes on, it builds," [...] Lavelli said in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Block {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure in television history, denounced by some, while praised by others. Journalist Earl Wilson had once dubbed Block [...] "a radio genius" [...] and Bob Hope called Block [...] "a great comedy writer.” Then, {{in his book}} What's My Line? TV's Most Famous Panel Show, Gil Fates wrote, [...] "You couldn't teach the meaning of good taste to Hal, any more than Star Kist could teach it to Charley the Tuna." [...] Assessing Block's contribution to What’s My Line? Fates summed it up as “Hal had served his purpose when the program was young.” However, writer and journalist Bob Considine wrote in 1969 that Block [...] "was to <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to the early success of television's What's My Line?" [...] What's My Line? was on the air for 17 years and became the longest running game show in U.S. primetime history, while Block returned to anonymity.|$|E
50|$|It has {{its name}} Nerpichye from the Russian word Нерпа (nerpa), which <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> like (fresh water) poetry. The Turkish word Kultuchnoye means lagoon.|$|R

60|$|There was {{something}} trusty and friendly in his voice; and I found myself gripping hands with him, in that hard, short shake that <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with English-speaking people.|$|R
2500|$|The {{trial began}} on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying {{on day one}} and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me {{over a long period}} of time. The closest you could come is to say, 'How do you feel about your children?'" [...] Rowling also revealed that the lawsuit has [...] "decimated her creative work" [...] over the prior month, causing her to cease work on a new novel. In his testimony, Vander Ark said that he too had had reserves about publishing the encyclopedia and that the publishing company had talked him into it. [...] "It's been difficult because there has been a lot of criticism, obviously, and that was never the intention. ... This has been an important part of my life for the last nine years or so," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|There was one {{of those}} swift, short silences that <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in a social gathering.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{still you}} must find it {{sometimes}} a dreadful strain, do you not? I <b>mean,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> brain work, {{and that sort}} of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{took his}} arm, leading {{him toward the}} dining-room. [...] "You'll love it, Bobby." [...] She stopped, wide-eyed. [...] "I hope you will. You must; you must love it. It <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me--he <b>means</b> <b>so</b> much." ...|$|R
60|$|I promise I'll {{never ask}} you {{anything}} again {{as long as}} I live if you'll only do this for me. It <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me. You don't know how much.|$|R
5000|$|It {{took over}} two years to compose the Kanon pokajanen, and the time [...] "we spent together" [...] was {{extremely}} enriching. That may explain why this music <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me.|$|R
60|$|The exultation in {{his voice}} was like a sweetish, {{poisonous}} drug to her. Did she then <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to him! She sipped the poison.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{at these}} ominous words, that might <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> or so little, the sweat started to my brow, and a shiver went down my back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was. There are two, you know. But {{they don't}} <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me now. You'd take them for natives anywhere. I {{have to talk}} to them in Samoan." ...|$|E
5000|$|Strings and Horns: David Vandepitt on [...] "Master of Love," [...] "Love Magnet"; Bruce Miller on [...] "Stares and Whispers," [...] "Feed Me Your Love," [...] "Loving You <b>Means</b> <b>So</b> <b>Much</b> to Me" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. In fact, if I {{were in your}} place, I think I'd be {{even more}} anxious. Meeting this Dunston Porter <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to you," [...] went on the senator's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to Shaggy's brother. He's dreadfully {{ashamed of}} himself, {{the way he}} is now, and you're to blame for it. Fact is, Ruggedo, you've done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> wickedness in your life that it won't hurt you to do a kind act now." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head slowly--feeling, with his letter there against his heart, such a new agility, almost such a new range of interest. [...] "I <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money--so {{extraordinarily}} much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you look}} so--so," [...] she faltered. [...] "Stay, Daren--and let me nurse you.... We {{have a little}} spare room, warm, cozy. I'll wait on you, Daren. Oh, it would <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me--now I am your wife." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the table}} sat Messer Ramiro, his head fallen forward and {{sideways}} upon {{his right arm}} which was outstretched and limp along the board. Before him lay a paper which I inferred to be the letter whose possession might <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{took the}} lead from Tony Stewart with four laps to go and held off a hard {{charging}} Jeff Gordon to score his first career win at Martinsville Speedway. “Oh, man, been trying to win here for so many years,” Earnhardt said. “Real emotional win. I can’t believe we won here. We’re going to {{drink a lot of}} beer tonight. It’s a real emotional win. This team on pit road was great and Steve (Letarte, crew chief) and the guys did a real good job all day. They gave me a great shot at it there with the call at the end to take tires. I can’t believe we won here. This <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to all of us. It’s just real emotional.” [...] "That <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to Hendrick Motorsports," [...] Gordon said. [...] "That's the best way you can possibly pay tribute to those that we lost 10 years ago. To have a 1-2 finish, that's pretty awesome. I {{would have loved to have}} gotten that win to move on to Homestead, but this is certainly a great start for us." [...] "I thought we had the car to beat," [...] Gordon said. [...] "Those last couple of laps were just wild. This <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to Hendrick Motorsports. It's the best way to pay tribute to everyone we lost 10 years ago. I would have loved to get that win to move on to Homestead. But I'm real happy for Dale. I know this <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Afterwards, as {{the hour}} for {{departure}} came near, she {{hoped they would}} not come. It was less difficult to say [...] "I'll see you again" [...] than to utter the curt [...] "good-bye" [...] which <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in Anglo-Saxon life.|$|R
60|$|You can understand, can't you? It <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me. It's {{helped me}} more than {{anything}} else in the world. It's the only thing that made these past weeks not intolerable. I'm satisfied to know he loves me. I want nothing more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Robespierre is my name," [...] was the answer, and to La Boulaye it {{conveyed}} no enlightenment, for {{the name}} of Maximilien Marie Isidore de Robespierre, which within so very short a time was to <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in France, as yet meant nothing.|$|E
6000|$|Appleby flushed a trifle. “I fancy I {{told you}} I was grateful,” he said. “The little kindnesses you have shown me <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to a man}} whose life is what mine has been. One gets very few of them, you see.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} ranting," [...] he said. [...] "I feel I've been--eloquent. You {{make me feel}} like an actor-manager, in a play by Capes.... You are the most {{difficult}} person for me to talk to in all the world--because you <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|She said it {{with that}} sort of {{repressed}} fieriness that <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> when a person's heart is in a thing. You could see the response in that nobleman's face; you could see his eye light up; there was sympathy there. He said, most earnestly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{be silly}} about this, Reginald dear," [...] she pleaded. [...] "If it <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to you to}} feel--I mean, if you look upon this money as really a tie between us--give me a little less, then--say three hundred a year, instead of six." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans {{believe in}} sentiment, and keep {{ourselves}} young mit it. Your English 'you' is so cold, say 'thou', heart's dearest, it <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me," [...] pleaded Mr. Bhaer, {{more like a}} romantic student than a grave professor.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. It's {{very kind}} of her. Daisy leads a dreadfully lonely life. It would <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to her if she knew one or two white women. If they take to one another, you won't try to crab it, will you? I fancy Daisy wants a friend rather badly.|$|E
6000|$|How is childlike wonder {{expressed}} {{in the first two}} stanzas? How is the difference between the speaker and his friend indicated? Why does the name of Shelley <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more to one than to the other? In the figure that follows, what do the moor and the eagle's feather stand for? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{thought her}} {{judgment}} would be just, {{if she had}} not already decided in his favor. Until he came to Scotland, he had never met people who could say so little and <b>mean</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Moreover, he imagined one could depend upon their standing by all that they implied. They were taciturn but staunch.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{glad that}} this book which <b>means</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to me is}} coming out again, under its proper title of [...] "The Nigger of the Narcissus" [...] and {{under the auspices of}} my good friends and {{publishers}} Messrs.

60|$|This {{made her}} laugh again.
