5000|$|The {{fermentation}} process {{has to be}} carefully monitored {{to ensure that the}} coffee doesn't acquire undesirable, sour flavors. For most coffees, <b>mucilage</b> <b>removal</b> through fermentation takes between 24 and 36 hours, depending on the temperature, thickness of the mucilage layer, and concentration of the enzymes. The end of the fermentation is assessed by feel, as the parchment surrounding the beans loses its slimy texture and acquires a rougher [...] "pebbly" [...] feel. When the fermentation is complete, the coffee is thoroughly washed with clean water in tanks or in special washing machines.|$|E
50|$|Water used in {{processing}} coffee leaves the coffee processing unit {{with high levels}} of pollution. The main component is organic matter, stemming from de-pulping and <b>mucilage</b> <b>removal.</b> The majority of organic material in the wastewater is highly resistant and COD values, the amount oxygen required to stabilize organic matter by using a strong oxidant, make up 80% of the pollution load, with values as high as 50 g/l. The BOD, the amount of oxygen required for the biological decomposition of organic matter under aerobic conditions at a standardized temperature and time of incubation, coming from biodegradable organic material can reach values of 20 g/l.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mucilage</b> <b>removal</b> {{has been}} done through a fermenting process, which takes between 14 and 18 hours, until the {{mucilage}} is degraded and can easily be removed with water. Washing fermented mucilage requires, in the best case, 5.0 L/kg of DPC. Scientists at Cenicafé developed a machine to remove the mucilage covering the coffee seeds. This machine, called Deslim (the initial letters of the Spanish demucilager, the mechanical washer and cleaner) removes more than 98% of the total mucilage (same as a well conducted fermentation) by exerting stress and generating collisions among beans, using only 0.7 L/kg of DPC. The resulting highly concentrated mixture of water, mucilage and impurities is viscous and {{is added to the}} separated fruit skin in a screw conveyor. In the screw conveyor the retention is greater than 60%, which means a 20% additional control of potential contamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{arising from}} {{pulp and paper}} mills is highly polluted {{and has to be}} treated before discharged into rivers. Coagulation –flocculation process is a widely used water and wastewater treatment method. This method is used in pulp and paper mills to remove the suspended solids in the wastewater produced from the production processes. This study is aimed to provide a clear understanding of the effects of pH,settling time,and coagulant dosage towards the removal of pollutants in the wastewater. Also,it is aimed to improve the removal of pollutants by adding Fenugreek mucilage. The experiments were done using jar tests. Settling times were set to 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. The pH values were adjusted to 3, 6, and 9. Aluminium Sulphate (Alum), Polyaluminium Chloride (PACl) and Fenugreek mucilage dosages were manipulated at the values 50, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg/L. The treated wastewater samples were tested for BOD, turbidity, and COD. The results showed the optimum pH for the research was 6,the optimum settling time was 30 minutes, and the optimum dosages of alum, PACl, and Fenugreek mucilage were 1000, 500, and 500 mg/L respectively. Through the research,it was deduced that Fenugreek <b>mucilage</b> improves pollutant <b>removal</b> when used with alum or PACl...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis thaliana {{accession}} Shahdara {{was identified}} as a rare naturally occurring mutant that does not liberate seed mucilage on imbibition. The defective locus was found to be allelic to the mum 2 - 1 and mum 2 - 2 mutants. Map-based cloning showed that MUCILAGE-MODIFIED 2 (MUM 2) encodes the putative b-D-galactosidase BGAL 6. Activity assays demonstrated that one of four major b-D-galactosidase activities present in developing siliques is absent in mum 2 mutants. No difference was observed in seed coat epidermal cell structure between wild-type and mutant seed; however, weakening of the outer tangential cell wall by chemical treatment resulted in the release of mucilage from mum 2 seed coat epidermal cells, and the mum 2 mucilage only increased slightly in volume, relative to the wild type. Consistent with the absence of b-D-galactosidase activity in the mutant, the inner layer of mucilage contained more Gal. The allocation of polysaccharides between the inner and outer mucilage layers was also modified in mum 2. Mass spectrometry showed that rhamnogalacturonan I in mutant mucilage had more branching between rhamnose and hexose residues relative to the wild type. We conclude that the MUM 2 /BGAL 6 b-Dgalactosidase is required for maturation of rhamnogalacturonan I in seed <b>mucilage</b> by the <b>removal</b> of galactose/galacta...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{studies on}} the {{extracellular}} polysaccharides elaborated by Beijerinckia mobilis, a tropical soil species of the group Azotobacteriacae, have been made and the component monosaccharides characterised. Fractionation of the total extracellular <b>mucilage,</b> after <b>removal</b> of contaminating protein, was effected by the precipitation of an acid fraction with quaternary ammonium salts. The uncomplexed neutral fraction (Mw = 2, 000) was further subdivided into a neutral polysaccharide (N 1) and a low molecular weight fraction (N 2) consisting of glucose, mannose and related oligosaccharides. The origin of this fraction is unknown but it is thought to arise either from incomplete metabolism by the organism {{at the time of}} harvesting, or from the presence of an enzyme in the medium which breaks down the polysaccharide. The neutral polysaccharide (N 2) is composed of glucose, mannose, and arabinose (1 : 1 : 1), and was found to have a low molecular weight and to be highly branched. The acid fraction is a high molecular weight polymer (Mw = 20 x 10 6) composed of L-guluronic acid (55 %) D-glucose (15 %) and D-glycero-D-manno-heptose (20 %), together with acetic and pyruvic acids. From the results of methylation, periodate oxidation and partial hydrolysis experiments the following repeating unit is proposed as a backbone for the polysaccharide: → 3) L-GulUA(1 → 3) L-GulUA(1 → 2) D-gly-D-Manhept(1 -. The remaining glucose and uronic acid residues were also found to be 1, 3 -linked and are thought to form separate side chains linked to C- 4 of the uronic acid residues in the backbone. Combined pyruvic acid was found to be in ketal linkage to C- 4 and C- 7 of about 25 % of the D-glycero-D-manno-heptose units. The similarities between this polysaccharide and that from the related species Azobacter indicum are discussed. In order to establish the linkages of the guluronic acid units it was necessary to prepare and characterise the methylated derivatives of gulose.

40|$|Fresh {{seeds of}} cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) {{are covered by}} {{a large amount of}} mucilage, which plays {{important}} ecological roles. However, for stored seeds, mucilage can adversely affect germination. This study investigated the effect of <b>mucilage</b> <b>removal</b> (demucilaging) and seed storage of freshly extracted cocoa seeds on seedling emergence and growth. The study showed that demucilaging cocoa seeds confers several advantages over mucilage intact seeds provided the seeds have been stored for at least three days before sowing. Demucilaging increased germination rate (T 50) and percentage germination and presence of mucilage increased days to seedling emergence and cessation of germination when seeds were stored for over two days. For up to 21 days of seed storage, there was generally no difference in many traits for demucilaged seeds. Demucilaged seeds had 80 – 100 % germination after 21 days of storage, and rate of germination increased with increasing duration of seed storage. Intact mucilage seeds maintained 80 – 100 % germination for only 2 days after seed extraction and rate of germination decreased with increasing seed storage duration. We conclude that (i) if seeds are sown on the day of extraction demucilaging before sowing would be superfluous and (ii) demucilaging and storage can provide advantages to smallholder farmers when environmental or socioeconomic conditions preclude immediate sowing...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} {{the effects of}} three coffee processing methods on aroma profiles and sensory quality of Ruiru 11 and SL 28 coffee varieties. The processing methods varied on stages of processing and method of <b>mucilage</b> <b>removal.</b> The green coffee beans obtained from the three processing methods were graded and roasted, ground and analyzed for the aroma profiles and sensory quality. Headspace Solid phase Microextraction fibre (SPME) technique {{were used for the}} extraction of aroma compounds from coffee samples and characterization of the compounds with use of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sensory quality were analyzed by an expert panelist. Various volatile aroma compounds were identified in roasted coffee and classified into their chemical classes involving furans, ketones, pyrazines ketones pyridines, pyrroles and acids. The intensity of aroma compounds were compared in terms of their peak areas and variations were noted between the processing methods with the ecopulper showing higher levels of pyrazines such as 2 -methylpyrazine, 2 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyrazine, and wet pulper showing higher levels of furans such as furfuryl formate and furfuryl alcohol, acetate. The hand pulper was high in the level of acids and esters such as acetic acid and propanoic acid, ethyl ester. Similar aroma compounds were identified in headspace of Ruiru 11 and SL 28 and there were variations in the intensities of aroma groups such as pyrroles and pyridines.
