40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} mesh editing, aimed at preserving shape and volume. We present two new developments: {{the first is a}} minimization of a functional expressing a geometric distance measure between two isometric surfaces. The second is a local volume analysis linking the volume of an object to its surface curvature. Our method is based upon the <b>moving</b> <b>frames</b> representation of meshes. Applying a rotation field to the <b>moving</b> <b>frames</b> defines an isometry. Given rotational constraints, the mesh is deformed by an optimal isometry defined by minimizing the distance measure between the original and the deformed meshes. The resulting isometry nicely preserves the surface details, but, when large rotations are applied, the volumetric behavior of the model may be unsatisfactory. Using the local volume analysis, we define a scalar field by which we scale the <b>moving</b> <b>frames.</b> The scaled and rotated <b>moving</b> <b>frames</b> restore the volumetric properties of the original mesh, while properly maintaining the surface details. Our results show that even extreme deformations can be applied to meshes, with only minimal distortion of surface details and object volume...|$|R

Henri Poincaré gave a physical interpretation to local time (to first order in v/c, the relative velocity of the two reference frames normalized to the speed of light) as the consequence of clock synchronization, under the assumption that the speed of light is constant in moving frames.
