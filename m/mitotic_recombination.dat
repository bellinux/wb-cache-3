The platinum co-ordination complex cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) ] is a highly effective anticancer drug whose activity derives from its ability to form adducts crosslinking neighbouring purine bases in DNA.

Thiosulphate, an agent used therapeutically to reduce nephrotoxic side effects of cisplatin in humans, greatly decreased both the lethality and recombinagenicity of cisplatin for C. albicans.

Here we report the isolation of a mouse homolog of the yeast RAD 51 gene. The amino acid sequence predicted from the gene shows 83 % and 55 % homology with those of the yeast RAD 51 and the E. coli recA product, respectively. The mouse gene complemented a rad 51 mutation of S. cerevisiae with sensitivity to methyl-methanesulfonate, which produces double-strand breaks of DNA.

5000|$|One basic {{mechanism}} {{which can}} produce mosaic tissue is <b>mitotic</b> <b>recombination</b> or somatic crossover. It was first discovered by Curt Stern in Drosophila in 1936.

Twin spot occurs only if the heterozygous genes are linked in repulsion i.e. trans phase. The recombination needs to occur between the centromere the adjacent gene.

5000|$|Mitotic {{crossover}} {{is known}} to occur in D. melanogaster, some asexually reproducing fungi and in normal human cells, where the event may allow normally recessive cancer-causing genes to be expressed and thus predispose the cell in which it occurs {{to the development of}} cancer. Alternately, a cell may become a homozygous mutant for a tumor-suppressing gene, leading to the same result. For example, Bloom's syndrome is caused by a mutation in RecQ helicase, which plays a role in DNA replication and repair. This mutation leads to high rates of <b>mitotic</b> <b>recombination</b> in mice, and this recombination rate is in turn responsible for causing tumor susceptibility in those mice.

Homologous recombination between these repeated elements can restore full-length EYFP coding sequence to yield a fluorescent phenotype, and the resulting fluorescent recombinant cells are rapidly quantifiable by flow cytometry. Analysis of genomic DNA from recombined FYDR cells shows that this mouse model detects gene conversions, and based on the arrangement of the integrated recombination substrate, unequal sister-chromatid exchanges and repair of collapsed replication forks are also expected to reconstitute EYFP coding sequence. The rate of spontaneous recombination in primary fibroblasts derived from adult ear tissue is 1. 3 ± 0. 1 per 106 cell divisions. Interestingly, the rate is ≈ 10 -fold greater in fibroblasts derived from embryonic tissue. We observe an ≈ 15 -fold increase in the frequency of recombinant cells in cultures of ear fibroblasts when exposed to mitomycin C, which is consistent with the ability of interstrand crosslinks to induce homologous recombination.

These phenomena have long been noticed, yet the mechanisms are poorly understood. High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are seed storage proteins encoded by Glu- 1 genes that only express in endosperm in wheat and its related species. Novel HMW-GS compositions have been observed in their hybrids. This research elucidated the molecular mechanisms by investigating the causative factors of novel HMW-GS changes in wheat-rye hybrids. HMW-GS compositions in the endosperm and their coding sequences in the leaves of F 1 and F 2 hybrids between wheat landrace Shinchunaga and rye landrace Qinling were investigated. Missing and/or additional novel HMW-GSs were observed in the endosperm of 0. 5 % of the 2078 F 1 and 22 % of 36 F 2 hybrid seeds. The wildtype Glu- 1 Ax null allele {{was found to have}} 42 types of short repeat sequences of 3 - 60 bp long that appeared 2 to 100 times.

The cloned mutant Glu- 1 Ax alleles were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the HMW-GSs produced matched the novel HMW-GSs found in the hybrids. The differential changes between the endosperm and the plant of the same hybrids and the data of E. coli expression of the cloned deletion alleles both suggested that <b>mitotic</b> illegitimate <b>recombination</b> between two copies of a short repeat sequence had resulted in the deletions and thus the changed HMW-GS compositions.
