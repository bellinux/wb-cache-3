5|$|To remain undetected, {{the player}} can perform {{techniques}} which <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> both Solid Snake's abilities and the environment, such as crawling under objects, using boxes as cover, ducking or hiding around walls, and making noise to distract enemies. An on-screen radar provides the player with location of nearby enemies and their field of vision. Snake can also <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> many items and gadgets, such as infra-red goggles and {{a cardboard box}} disguise. The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay, as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player.|$|E
