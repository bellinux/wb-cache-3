5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect in the murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E

Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, were <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> car accidents.

A legion was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (contubernia); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.|$|E

5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E
5|$|Halotus is {{primarily}} remembered for his suspected {{involvement in the}} conspiracy and poisoning of Emperor Claudius on 13 October (times of death are in dispute; see below) 54 AD. It is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, and the actual manner of the poisoning, in regards to which poison may have been used, in which food {{it could have been}} hidden, etc., remains unclear. It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was known to have been particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought to have been the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> instigated the murder or to have been the lead conspirator in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

5|$|The II./Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77; II Group Fighter Wing 77)—under {{the command}} of Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher—took off from Nordholz Airbase and intercepted No. 9 Squadron. Feldwebels Hans Troitzsch and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another. These {{aircraft}} from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to have been shot down by enemy fighters {{during the war and}} Troitzsch was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the first enemy pilot to shoot one down. Another four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery fire. The Germans believed their air defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack. Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{long history}} of {{painting}} candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E
5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E

5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit, or by poisoned gruel or an enema. Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E
5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> made the tracks.|$|E
