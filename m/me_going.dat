I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just <b>me</b> <b>going,</b> 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

At that time, Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, [...] ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything.

500|$|In {{spite of}} her success with Election, Witherspoon noted in an {{interview}} that she struggled to find work after completing the film, due to typecasting. [...] Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, [...] "I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than <b>me</b> <b>going</b> in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about." [...] In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in American Psycho and made a cameo appearance in Little Nicky. She also guest starred in season six of Friends as Rachel Green's sister Jill.|$|E
