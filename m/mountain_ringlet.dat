5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine plants have survived in {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
50|$|The small <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> or <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia epiphron) is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} mountainous regions of southern and central Europe.|$|E
50|$|Butler's ringlet is {{visually}} {{similar to}} the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> Percnodaimon pluto. The two species may be differentiated by where the individual in question is sighted. Butler's ringlet prefers to fly over vegetation, settling among snow-tussock, subalpine shrubs and herbaceous flowers, whereas the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> tends to congregate over rock and scree.|$|E
50|$|Erebia melampus, {{the lesser}} <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> {{is a member}} of the Satyrinae {{subfamily}} of the Nymphalidae family.|$|E
50|$|Its Māori name is pepe pouri, {{which means}} dark moth, and shares the name {{with the black}} <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> and the forest ringlet butterfly.|$|E
5000|$|Percnodaimon is a {{monotypic}} genus of satyrid butterflies in {{the family}} Nymphalidae. Its sole species, Percnodaimon merula, the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> is endemic to New Zealand. Its Māori name is pepe pouri, which means [...] "dark moth".|$|E

50|$|The adult female black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> {{deposits}} {{her eggs}} atop stones on the alpine slopes. When {{the sun is}} out it heats these stone's exposed surface, acting as an incubator for the eggs. This behaviour is unique among New Zealand butterflies and is only seen {{in a handful of}} butterfly species occupying the Himalayas and European Alps.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the RSPB leased two farms {{from the}} {{landowner}} United Utilities. The {{aim is to}} combine the improvement of wildlife habitats and water quality with running a viable sheep farm.Moorland and woodland habitats are being improved for birds {{as well as the}} rare small <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly. Measures include grip blocking, heather replanting, juniper woodland planting (especially in the ghylls).|$|E
50|$|Not much {{research}} has been conducted on the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet,</b> and although {{it is one of the}} few endemic species of butterfly New Zealand has, it is still a field where more can be learned from. Because they inhabit the intrepid Southern Alps, it is difficult to predict the exact distribution, but it is believed that they can be found through the mountain range.|$|E
50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the butterfly}} also {{plays an important}} physiological role. Its dark wings coupled with its large surface area acts as a black body, and absorbs the electromagnetic energy from the sun's rays. By absorbing and storing heat, {{the wings of the}} black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly essentially act like solar panels. This is another adaptation evolved for survival in the frosty conditions of the Southern Alps.|$|E
50|$|Galium saxatile is a {{perennial}} matt-forming herb, found on grassland, moors, heaths and woods. It can reach {{a height of}} 20 cm, and flowers in the UK from May to August. The stems are hairless and four sided. Its leaves are 8 - 25 mm long, with 6-8 per whorl, and are lanceolate or obovate in shape. The <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> butterfly uses the plant for nectar.|$|E
50|$|Larval colours {{can vary}} from dull grey to brown, but contain black {{anterior}} setae. The black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> larvae have five instars which take about a month each in pleasant summer temperatures, but {{can take up to}} eight months if it occurs over winter. For this reason the butterfly can stay in its larval stage for up to two years and can be found almost year round in an instar stage.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of {{pupation}} the black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> turns grey with brown speckles to match the surrounding stones. During the actual process however, the butterfly has another interesting strategy; the pupae suspend themselves horizontally (unlike most butterflies) against the under surface of a rock and hold themselves to the surface by a cremaster, a hook shaped protuberance near the abdominal area. Pupae have been found up to 3 {{feet away from the}} nearest food plant and emerge as adult butterflies emerge 2 to 3 weeks later.|$|E

50|$|It was {{reported}} that, the small grass, Poa colensoi was a food source for these larvae. This grass is common throughout the Southern Alps, {{but it appears}} that the larvae are present only where the grass grows adjacent to rocky areas. The black <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> larvae are known night feeders and have been spotted feeding on the tips of tussock blades. The larvae spend little time feeding, but instead choose to conceal themselves in nearby hiding spots. This is to prevent them being preyed upon by aerial predators, which can easily spot them atop tussock grass blades.|$|E
5000|$|Wingspan 16 - 22 mm. [...] "The typical {{form of this}} butterfly, epiphron, Knock, has the tawny bands {{unbroken}} on {{the fore}} wings, and almost so on the hind wings; the black dots on the hind wings of the female are often pupilled with white, and more rarely this is so in the male also. It has been stated that specimens occur in Perthshire which exhibit these characters. All the British examples of the small <b>mountain</b> <b>ringlet</b> that I have seen are referable to the form known as cassiope, Fab. (Plate 77). The tawny, or orange, bands are rarely so entire on the fore wings as in epiphron, and are generally rather narrower; and that on the hind wing is broken up into three or four rings. The black dots are usually smaller and without white pupils. The female is somewhat larger and the bands or rings paler. Variation in the markings is extensive. The bands on the fore wings become less and less complete, until they are reduced {{to a series of}} mere rings around the black dots. The black dots decrease in size and in number until they, together with the tawny marking, entirely disappear, and a plain blackish-brown insect only remains. This extreme form has been named obsoleta, Tutt. The earliest rings to vanish seem to be the third on the fore wings and the first on the hind wings. Similar modifications occur on the under side also, but there may be aberration on the upper side of a specimen, and not, or {{at least not in the}} same way, on the under side." ...|$|E
40|$|Parasitoids {{represent}} a diverse and little studied group of insects, employing variety of adaptations to utilize and kill their hosts. Among the unresolved {{issues related to}} the host-parasitoids interactions are responses of such interactions to global climate change, especially in cases specialized insect species adapted to cold environments such as alpine habitats. Example of such hosts are the Holarctic butterflies of the genus Erebia Dalman, 1986 (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) inhabiting mountains of Central Europe. The aim of this study was sampling caterpillars of lowland and mountain Satyrinae butterflies, rearing the caterpillars to determine the degree of infestation and determine the host specificity of parasitoids using combination of classical and molecular methods. I sampled 39 caterpillars of the Meadow Brown (Maniola jurtina), seven caterpillars of the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Ringlet</b> (Erebia epiphron) and four caterpillars of the Large Ringlet (Erebia euryale) at 14 habitats along the altitudinal gradient in Krkonoše Mountains. It was found more than a one-third parasitization by Ichneumon caloscelis among Maniola jurtina caterpillars and no parasitoids among the mountain species. It suggests the possibility of a higher rate of infestation among species living at lower altitudes than at higher altitudes. There are many factors affecting the parasitization's rate among butterflies. This issue requires further monitoring. This study demonstrates the time-consuming sampling of solitary living caterpillars on common plants. Molecular determination of parasitoids using DNA barcoding is possible without major problems, but with certain restrictions...|$|E
