Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|A beer that shares style {{characteristics}} {{with both}} <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> bitter. It sells 23,000 hectolitres annually. Sales {{are concentrated in}} the Tyneside region, and the beer is not found in Scotland. Production was moved from the Tyne Brewery in Newcastle upon Tyne to the Federation Brewery in Gateshead in 2005. The Federation Brewery was closed in 2010, and production of McEwan's Best Scotch was contracted to the Burtonwood Brewery near Cheshire, until it moved to Bedford following the Wells & Young's takeover.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen, a striking bright orange lichen that is very sensitive to air pollution. The climate is relatively <b>mild</b> <b>and,</b> because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 {{and ruled}} until 1143. John was a pious and {{dedicated}} Emperor who {{was determined to}} undo {{the damage to the}} empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius.|$|E

5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On {{account of}} his <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> just reign, he {{has been called the}} Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty—despite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, who gave him the name 'John the Good'. He was also an {{energetic}} campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.|$|E

5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|Findings on the {{frequency}} of each level of severity vary based on the definitions and methods used in studies. A World Health Organization study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head injuries that receive treatment are <b>mild,</b> <b>and</b> a US study found that moderate and severe injuries each account for 10% of TBIs, with the rest mild.|$|E

5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is <b>mild,</b> <b>and</b> the taste mild or slightly acidic. Field guides typically recommended to remove the slimy cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. The mushrooms are common in the diet of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park.|$|E
5|$|Polyozellus {{multiplex}} is edible, and {{is collected}} {{for sale in}} Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and China. In North America, it is sometimes collected recreationally, and commercially. The taste is described as <b>mild,</b> <b>and</b> the odor as mild or aromatic. Mycologist David Arora claims the flavor to be inferior to Craterellus. Fruit bodies may be preserved by drying.|$|E
50|$|The heat {{level of}} jalapeños varies even for fruit {{from the same}} plant; however some cultivars have been bred to be {{generally}} <b>milder,</b> <b>and</b> on the low side of the heat range, such as the TAM <b>Milds</b> <b>and</b> Dulcito, and others to be generally hotter, and on {{the high end of}} the heat range, such as Grande. As the peppers ripen their pungency increases, making red jalapeños to be generally hotter than green jalapeños, at least of the same variety. If the jalapeño plants were stressed by increased salinity in the water, erratic watering, temperature, light, soil nutrition, by insects, or illness this will increase the pungency of the produced jalapeños.|$|R

5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} <b>mild</b> <b>and</b> self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are <b>mild,</b> <b>and</b> do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
