50|$|Ken Tyler {{has had a}} {{formative}} {{influence on}} the art and science of printmaking for close to five decades. His contributions to printing technology were driven by his industrial background and his recognition that “most traditional printmaking methods, {{as well as some}} recent practices of the hand-printing crafts, were not compatible with the images of major contemporary artists. As a collaborator I left the ranks of this revival to aid the major artist in his search for new graphic expression and new work environments.” Tyler became renowned for printing works on paper that were massive in size and required the co-ordination of complicated mixed media and <b>multiple</b> <b>printing</b> matrices (Frank Stella’s The Fountain, for example, measures over 2 metres x over 7 metres, used hundreds of plates and was printed on a specially constructed press). Tyler also custom-designed paper and equipment to his own specifications; built his own paper mill, which contributed to a resurgence in the use of handmade papers among printmakers; and travelled to Japan to investigate traditional printing and papermaking methods.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Moran {{began his}} artistic {{career as a}} teenage {{apprentice}} to the Philadelphia wood-engraving firm Scattergood & Telfer. Moran found the engraving process [...] "tedious" [...] and spent his free time working on his own watercolors. [...] By the mid-1850s he was drawing the firm's illustrations for publication rather than carving them. At that time, he encountered illustrated books that included examples {{of the work of}} British artist J. M. W. Turner, who was to be a lasting influence on Moran's work. He also began studying with local painter James Hamilton. Moran traveled to England in 1862 to see Turner's work. From that point on, he emulated Turner's use of color, his choice of landscapes, and was inspired by his explorations in watercolor, a medium for which Turner was particularly well-known. During the 1870s and 1880s, Moran's designs for wood-engraved illustrations appeared in major magazines and gift oriented publications. Although he mastered <b>multiple</b> <b>printing</b> media including wood-engraving, etching, and lithography, which he learned from his brothers, he received renown for his paintings in oil and in watercolor. The height of his career coincided with the popularity of chromolithography, which Moran used to make color prints of his works, so that they could be widely distributed. He {{was also one of the}} leaders of the etching revival in the United States and Great Britain. [...] Moran was married to Scottish born Mary Nimmo Moran (1842-1899), an etcher and landscape painter. The couple had two daughters and a son. His brothers Edward (1829-1901), John (1831-1902) and Peter (1841-1914), as well as his nephews Edward Percy Moran (1862-1935) and Jean Leon Gerome Ferris (1863-1930) were also active as artists. He died in Santa Barbara, California on August 26, 1926.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Resistance of {{the front}} {{electrode}} is the highest proportion of the ingredients of the series resistance in crystalline silicon solar cell. While resistance {{of the front}} electrode is decreased with larger area, it induces the optical loss, causing the conversion efficiency drop. Therefore the front electrode with high aspect ratio increasing its height and decreasing is necessary for high-efficiency solar cell in considering shadowing loss and resistance of front electrode.

The resistivity of inkjet printed line is 7. 6 × 10 - 6 Ω·cm when using triangular nanoplates ink with 10 percent content, while it is necessary to use more than 15 percent content for spherical nanoparticles.

As this technique is based on metallisation pastes, pad printed contacts are compatible with present industrial solar cell production.

40|$|Aerosol jet {{printing}} is investigated {{as a new}} deposition {{method for}} a current collecting grid in indium tin oxide (ITO) free organic solar cells with an inverted layer sequence. In this device configuration, the ITO layer which usually serves as the hole contact {{is replaced by a}} transparent highly conductive poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer in combination with a silver grid deposited by aerosol jet printing. Since the cells are illuminated from the grid side, the optimisation of the grid design is a trade-off between area coverage and conductivity of the grid lines. These factors have been controlled by the printing parameters such as chuck temperature, printing speed and the number of printing passes. In this paper, we demonstrate that continuous, conductive grid lines with a minimum line width of 58 mu m can be processed {{on the top of the}} PEDOT:PSS layer. For single pass printing the area coverage varied from 5. 8 % to 11. 9 % with corresponding effective sheet resistances ranging from 8. 9 Omega to 1. 5 Omega.

40|$|Fibre Bragg {{gratings}} (FBGs) are {{key components}} for {{a vast number}} of applications in optical communication systems, microwave photonics systems, and optical sensors, etc. The main topic of this thesis is fibre Bragg grating fabrication and applications in direct microwave optical filtering, high speed switching and switchable dual-wavelength fibre lasers. First, a brief overview is given about the photosensitivity in optical fibre, basic FBG fabrication techniques, the popular coupled-mode theory for describing fundamental characteristics of FBGs and the Transfer Matrix method for the numerical simulations of complex-structured FBGs. An advanced FBG fabrication system based on the technique of <b>multiple</b> <b>printing</b> in fibre (with a continuous-wave source) has been used to write complex FBGs incorporating phase shifts, apodization and chirp.       A single double-peaked superimposed grating working in reflection can be employed as a direct optical filter for millimetre-wave signals. Bit error rate measurements confirmed that the filter exhibited nearly on-off behaviour in the passband with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 2 GHz for a central frequency of 20 GHz, as expected from the optical spectrum reflection. The presented technique can be used in radio-over-fibre systems or simultaneous up-conversion of ultra-wide band signals and filtering. This thesis focused mostly on the research of two 4 -cm long Hamming-apodized gratings written in side-hole fibres with internal electrodes. The temperature dependence measurements showed that the birefringence of the component increased with the temperature. Dynamic measurement has shown nanosecond full off-on and on-off switching. During the electrical pulse action, the grating wavelength was blue-shifted for the x-polarization and red-shifted for the y-polarization due to the mechanical stress. Both peaks subsequently experienced a red-shift due to the relaxation of mechanical stress and the increasing core temperature transferred from the metal in many microseconds. All the wavelength shifts of the two polarizations depend quadratically on the electrical pulse voltage and linearly on the pulse duration. Numerical simulations gave accurate description of the experimental results and were useful to understand the physics behind the birefringence switching. Finally, two switchable dual-wavelength erbium-doped fibre lasers based on FBG feedback were proposed. In one method, an overlapping cavity for the two lasing wavelengths and hybrid gain medium in the fibre laser were introduced. Dual-wavelength switching was achieved by controlling the Raman pump power. The other method employed an injection technique and the dual-wavelength switching was controlled by the power of the injection laser. The switching time was measured to be ~ 50 ms. Detailed characteristics of the dual-wavelength switching in the two fibre lasers were experimentally studied and corresponding principles were physically explained. QC 2010092...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Comparisons {{were made}} of the {{abilities}} of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus diacetilactis bacteriophages to endure various laboratory isolation and storage treatments. Neutralization of Cottage cheese whey containing phages offered no survival advantage over unneutralized samples, refrigeration of neutral and acid whey samples increased the survival of only the S. diacetilactis phage. About 50 percent of the phages could be recovered from milk coagulated by addition of lactic acid to provide casein-free, clear, phage-containing whey. Sterilization of phage lysates by membrane filtration allowed collection of 92 to 99 percent of the phages; Seitz filtration allowed collection of a maximum of 24 percent. Whey samples containing phages could be concentrated by removing water using polyethylene glycol. Lyophilization decreased phage titers at least 50 percent. Cross reaction patterns of phages for strains of lactic streptococci revealed that similar strains were present in cultures supplied by several companies. For example, phages which were lytic for strains isolated from one brand of commercial mixed strain starter cultures would lyse strains isolated from {{as many as three}} different brands of starter cultures. The lytic patterns of 60 bacteriophage races toward 100 single lactic streptococcal strains allowed the establishment of eight phage groups, A through H. The phages within a particular group were generally species specific. However several exceptions were noted. Group A phages attacked primarily strains of S. diacetilactis. Groups B through H phages mainly attacked strains of S. lactis and S. cremoris. Groups G and H consisted of one phage that attacked only the homologous host. Lytic reactions determined by <b>multiple</b> <b>printing</b> of phages on lawns seeded with possible hosts were employed for selecting strains to be used in mixed-strain starter cultures. A computer was used in selecting strains for blending into mixed-strain cultures with resulting maximum protection against phage. The strains selected by the computer were arranged in a sequence or rotation system suitable for use in dairy plant fermentations. Protection from phage infection as determined by a resistance index remained high for six successive cultures, but the addition of the seventh culture to the rotation system increased the likelihood of phage attack significantly. Neutralization of representatives of each host range phage group by standardized rabbit antisera prepared against four different phages revealed similarity among several groups. However the neutralization of phages was not constant within each group. Electron photomicrographs of a phage for S. diacetilactis revealed a tadpole-shaped particle. The head width and length were each about 60 mμ, the tail width was about 10 mμ and the tail length was about 170 mμ. There also were suggestions for a polyhedral head structure in enlarged (84, 000 X) pictures of the viruses. Chemical compositional studies of the phage studied by electron microscopy revealed that phosphorus represented 4. 45 percent of the phage dry weight. Nitrogen was found to constitute 12. 8 percent of the phage protein. A ratio of phage phosphorus to phage protein nitrogen of 2. 7 was determined. Bacteriophages prepared in broth medium were recovered by differential centrifugation and purified in cesium chloride density gradients. An amino acid analysis revealed the following mole percentages for the amino acids quantitated: lysine, 8. 1; histidine, 1. 7; arginine, 3. 8; aspartic acid and asparagine, 10. 0; threonine, 7. 5; serine, 6. 8; glutamic acid and glutamine, 12. 1; proline, 3. 4; glycine, 9. 0; alanine, 9. 5; valine, 8. 7; methionine, 1. 1; isoleucine, 7. 9; tyrosine, 2. 2 and phenylalanine, 2. 8. The nucleic acid of the phage was determined to be double-stranded DNA with a thermal melting point of 84. 3 °C, indicating an average base composition of 35. 7 percent guanine plus cytosine. Calculated values for percentage DNA and protein composition of the phage were 44 and 56 percent respectively. The density of the phage was calculated to be 1. 47 g/cc...|$|E
40|$|At {{this point}} in time, 3 D-printing {{techniques}} in general, but especially applied for the building industry, still are in a phase of early experiments. One of the experimental attempts is to print a full-scale, three-story high, house in Amsterdam, using an up scaled version of a FDM-printer that is able to print blocks of 1. 8 x 1. 8 x 3. 0 meters using printable polymers. The paper focuses on answering the initial structural question that appears around this project, which is a research to {{the behavior of the}} currently applied printing material. The outcome of this research will be used to give recommendations for the structural design of printable geometries. The material research emphasis on obtaining the material properties that are most essential to be known for this particular printing material and the application of the material within this particular building project. These basically are the mechanical (strength) properties of the material and its thermal behavior. Since the FDM-printer lays down the material layer by layer, the hypothesis was that the material would show anisotropic behavior. Therefore the strength properties are researched in different orientations relative to the direction of the printed lines. Furthermore, it was expected that the strength properties would differ for the horizontal plane and vertical plane in which there can be printed, as the resolutions in both planes differ as well. For the vertical printing plane, the material indeed shows clear anisotropic behavior, as the tensile, shear and flexural strength values and the failure modes parallel and perpendicular to the printing direction differ significantly. Material that is printed within the horizontal printing plane shows more isotropic behavior than material that is printed in the vertical plane, due to more and better adhesive connections between the different layers. For the compressive strength it holds that not much difference is noticed between the different orientations, especially because the tested samples are composed of multiple printed layers in both the horizontal and vertical plane. This result leads to an important recommendation to compose printable building-blocks out of 3 D-elements instead of only 2 D-plate elements, which so far has been the case. This actually leads to a stronger, more isotropic, more homogeneous and therefore better predictable material behavior. Throughout the research this recommendation is further confirmed by outcomes of the absorption test, geometry tests and insulation requirements. The absorption test shows that the material becomes watertight in case <b>multiple</b> <b>printing</b> layers are applied in the horizontal direction. The performed bending and pressure tests on printed geometries demonstrate that geometries, which are build up by a single layer, fail due to local effects: they either fail on local buckling or local bending of an individual member of the geometry or they fail at the location of local inaccuracies, which often occur within printed geometries. The stress level at which these failure modes take place can be significantly increased by composing individual geometry members out of multiple printed layers. Finally, to meet the requirements for heat and sound insulation, a certain wall and floor thickness is required which only can be achieved by printing multiple layers within the horizontal printing direction. The performed temperature-strength test and DSC-test show that current thermal behavior of the material is the most important point of concern regarding the applied printing material. The material is applied in the rubber phase, it softens at 60 degrees Celsius and at a surface temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, the material has lost already about 70 % of the material strength it has at room temperature. It is obvious that further research on the improvement of the temperature behavior of the building material is essential to make printable polymers suitable for structural applications. Also the comparison with general structural materials and polymers applied in the construction practice, confirms that the printing material in its current form, is not structurally applicable. Furthermore, the comparison shows that the stiffness of the material needs to be improved, as the Young’s Modulus is relatively low. Although the essence of further research should lie on the improvement of the printing material, it still can be valuable to continue the structural design process parallel to the material development. Based on the performed material research, recommendations are given for design improvements. These recommendations {{can be used as a}} starting point for a possible future study to the structural design of printable geometries, chambers and complete houses.
