5|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the {{original}} <b>multi-track</b> tape, there had never been an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from the original mono master—as the <b>multi-track</b> vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E
5|$|They {{recorded}} Primary Colours {{over the}} night of 3 August 2007 {{and part of the}} following day, in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra on an 8-track, a form of <b>multi-track</b> recording. The process of recording it took 24hours and cost $1500. The day after recording finished, the band and their engineer, Lachlan Wooden, added overdubs to the tentracks. After recording, Eddy Current Suppression Ring toured the US for three weeks, after which Eddy Current, the band's guitarist, mixed the album during November and December 2007. The four members self-produced Primary Colours.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a <b>multi-track</b> mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E
50|$|Ross Snyder (1920-2008) was an American {{engineer}} {{best known}} for his contribution to recording techniques, most notably <b>multi-tracking</b> and early stereo recording. In his time with Ampex (1952-1957) as Audio Product Planning Manager he introduced stereo to American commercial recording and in collaboration with Les Paul developed <b>multi-tracking.</b>|$|R

25|$|Free-leaning <b>multi-track</b> {{vehicles}} must {{be balanced}} by countersteering before turning. <b>Multi-track</b> leaning vehicles that are forced-tilted, {{such as the}} Carver, are tilted without countersteering the control and are not balanced by the operator. Later versions of the Carver introduced automatic countersteer to increase tilt speed and reduce the force required to tilt the vehicle. Other forced-tilted vehicles may incorporate automatic countersteering. A prototype tilting <b>multi-track</b> free leaning vehicle was developed in 1984 that employs automatic countersteering and does not require any balancing skills.|$|E

25|$|The 1970s {{recording}} {{scene was}} dominated by large format consoles feeding <b>multi-track</b> tape machines manufactured by companies such as MCI and Studer. Both the equipment and the environment they were used in were expensive to source and maintain making studio recording a high entry cost business. A series of developments have slowly eroded this position.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} {{figure of}} the field in Israel, Josef Tal, was first exposed to electronic music in the late 1920s in Germany. The founding of the Israel Center for Electronic Music {{was the result of}} a six-month UNESCO research fellowship on which Tal toured major international electronic music studios, in 1958. It was a meeting with Milton Babbitt at The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center that pointed Josef Tal to the technology he needed to found the first electronic music studio in Israel. He learned from Vladimir Ussachevsky, about a new invention by Canadian inventor Hugh Le Caine, called the <b>Multi-track.</b> First built in 1955, this device could replay six independent magnetic tapes, with the speed and direction of each tape separately controllable. Le Caine's idea was to design an instrument to facilitate composition in the Parisian musique concrète tradition of Pierre Schaeffer. Following a successful fund-raising by Shalheveth Freier the <b>Multi-track</b> which was built for Tal's studio was completed and delivered to Jerusalem in 1961. It required a trip by Le Caine to set it up correctly.|$|E
25|$|A near-complete release {{came on the}} Film Score Monthly label (FSM) on April 1, 2001 and was {{produced}} by Lukas Kendall and Nick Redman. FSM's was an almost completely expanded version remixed from album masters at Warner Bros. archives and the <b>multi-track</b> 35mm magnetic film stems at 20th Century Fox. Placed into chronological order and restoring action cues, it {{became one of the}} company's biggest sellers; only 4000 copies were pressed and it is now out of print.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive <b>multi-tracking</b> of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The <b>multi-tracking</b> on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of <b>multi-tracking,</b> stating [...] "You might respond, 'Lyrics? Yo, I can't even understand half the shit that D'Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium'. And I'd say, 'You're right. Neither can I. But I am drawn {{to figure out what it}} is that he's saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me'". Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|R

50|$|Voices is {{the sixth}} album by English singer-songwriter Claire Hamill, {{released}} in 1986. The title {{refers to the}} fact that the album's mostly-instrumental music is entirely a capella, created by sampling and <b>multi-tracking</b> Hamill's voice.|$|R
25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} European {{producers}} to fully exploit the possibilities of using <b>multi-track</b> recording facilities to create dramatic production effects and treatments that acted as musical and rhetorical elements in their own right, rather than mere gimmicks. He favoured sometimes harsh-sounding effects and contrasting audio spaces for each element in the mix. His best work stands in stark opposition to the smooth, 'evened-out' sound that predominated in most commercial pop and rock at that time.|$|E
25|$|In late 1980, {{the group}} signed with IRS Records {{subsidiary}} Faulty Products and recorded their second album, Wild in the Streets, released in 1982. The title track was a cover {{version of a}} song by Garland Jeffreys. Faulty Products ceased operations several months after its release, forcing Circle Jerks to seek their third record deal in as many years. While they regained the copyright to Wild in the Streets, the original stereo master tape was lost, forcing the band to remix it from the <b>multi-track</b> tapes when they reissued the album in 1988.|$|E
25|$|A lifelong and ardent fan of {{the newest}} and most {{experimental}} techniques in recording, Stokowski {{saw to it that}} most of the music for Fantasia was recorded over Class A telephone lines laid down between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and Bell Laboratories in Camden NJ, using an early, highly complex version of <b>multi-track</b> stereophonic sound, dubbed Fantasound, which shared many attributes with the later Perspecta stereophonic sound system. Recorded on photographic film, the only suitable medium then available, the results were considered astounding for {{the latter half of the}} 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Greenberg of AllMusic {{gave the}} album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "He sings {{contemporary}} jazz {{with a strong}} sense of respect for the classics, but quietly puts hip-hop instrumentation behind his vocals, and <b>multi-tracks</b> himself for accentuation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{album is}} taken from the {{original}} <b>multi-tracks,</b> where they exist, which is in 95% of the cases. We remixed them exactly as they were, without taking any liberties, except for the occasional song appearing in stereo for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Wallinger cites {{influences}} such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, Junior Walker, Neil Young and Prince.

25|$|On October 3, 2011, Sony Music Entertainment {{announced}} that over 40 of Jackson's original recordings were redesigned and reimagined by the Justin Timberlake and Rihanna producer Kevin Antunes throughout a year-period {{work in the}} studio with original <b>multi-track</b> master recordings. Hence it's expected that Immortal will continue a similar mixing production to the soundtracks to previous Cirque du Soleil's shows: 2006's Love, with the remixed music of The Beatles (to the show of the same name), and 2010's Elvis Presley-themed remix soundtrack Viva Elvis (to the show of the same name).|$|E
25|$|Sanders {{developed}} the SL4000 A Series console in 1975. Two were built. This {{was followed by}} the SL4000 B Series with the first SSL Studio Computer, which debuted in 1977; six were made. The concept was further refined as the hugely successful SL4000 E Series, on which the company's fortunes were built. Paul Bamborough, who {{developed the}} Studio Computer, added the Total Recall system and studios across the world started to standardise on the SL4000 E Series Master Studio System, which refined in-line mixing console architecture and effectively integrated the <b>multi-track</b> tape recorder.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Maus {{left his}} {{hometown}} of Austin, Minnesota to study experimental music at the California Institute of the Arts. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Rosenberg (Ariel Pink), he took a greater interest in pop music. Much of his initial lo-fi work was created using a cassette <b>multi-track</b> recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. It {{was not until the}} success of his third album, We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves (2011), that he grew more widely accepted as an outsider artist. On stage, he is known for his intense displays of emotion while performing.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the first}} Frank Zappa album {{recorded}} on 16-track equipment {{and one of the}} first albums to use this technology. Machines with 16 individual tracks allow for much more flexibility in <b>multi-tracking</b> and overdubbing than the professional 4 and 8-track reel-to-reel tape recorders that were standard in 1969.|$|R
25|$|With many {{of their}} new {{relationships}} being the result of broken ones, Brandy and Timbaland were inspired to experiment {{with a number of}} sounds and influences to create a unique, individualized sound that was distinct from other R music. The result was an organic, mellow contemporary R album that experimented with the New York-based illbient style, which infuses eccentric hip-hop breakbeats, ambient soundscapes, and the unorthodox sampling of indie rock and various film scores. Brandy also continued to experiment with her singing, opting to use more technical applications of counterpoint and <b>multi-track</b> recording toward her vocal arrangements. An autobiographical album, the songs feature intimate lyrics which discuss the singer's personal struggles with codependency, monogamy, misplaced loyalty, and professional anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Ormandy {{recorded}} for RCA Victor in Minneapolis (in 1934 and 1935), and continued with the label until 1942, when an American Federation of Musicians ban on recordings caused the Philadelphia Orchestra {{to switch to}} Columbia, which had reached {{an agreement with the}} union in 1944, before RCA did so. Among his first recordings for Columbia was a spirited performance of Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Ormandy conducted his first stereophonic recordings in 1957; these were not the orchestra's first stereo recordings because Leopold Stokowski had conducted experimental sessions in the early 1930s and <b>multi-track</b> recordings for the soundtrack of Walt Disney's 1940 feature film Fantasia. In 1968, Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra returned to RCA; among their first projects was a new performance of Tchaikovsky's Sixth symphony, the Pathetique.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to create techno, but the {{majority}} will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or producers, rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based MIDI sequencer, enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable <b>multi-track</b> arrangement has been produced.|$|E
50|$|Auto-Tune is {{available}} as a plug-in for professional audio <b>multi-tracking</b> suites used in a studio setting and as a stand-alone, rack-mounted unit for live performance processing. Auto-Tune has become standard equipment in professional recording studios. Instruments like the Peavey AT-200 guitar are seamlessly using the Auto Tune technology for real time pitch correction.|$|R
