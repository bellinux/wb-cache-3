5|$|In a {{practical}} implementation, the variables {{used to represent}} the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If the <b>midpoint</b> of the span is calculated as (L + R) / 2, then the value of L + R may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the <b>midpoint,</b> even if L and R are within the range. If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the <b>midpoint</b> as L + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E

5|$|As shown above, E. coli {{can grow}} with {{reducing}} agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger {{the difference in}} <b>midpoint</b> potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its <b>midpoint</b> potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate {{can be reduced to}} succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in Alsace of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the <b>midpoint</b> between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E
5|$|From the hydride {{electron}} pair, one electron {{is transferred}} to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The <b>midpoint</b> potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.|$|E
40|$|Fast and {{accurate}} detection of circle is a challenging computer vision problem [1]. This paper takes fully advantages of circle good symmetry {{to calculate the}} <b>midpoints</b> of adjacent edge points in the horizontal direction. Based on the sine function reflected by the y coordinate values of <b>midpoints</b> and distance value l from the <b>midpoints</b> to the origin O and the cosine function reflected by the x coordinate values of <b>midpoints</b> and l, the <b>midpoints</b> are projected to parameter space. The main contributions of our work are threefold. 1) The problem of circle detection is formulated as sine curve and cosine curve detection. 2) The abundant phase information carried by trigonometric functions avoids the large amount calculation of Hough Transform. 3) A probabilistic scheme to recognize phase range is applied to circle detection. 1548 - 7741 /Copyright © 2015 Binary Information Pres...|$|R

5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26.

The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the <b>midpoint</b> of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in reality the Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the assumption}} that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the <b>midpoint</b> figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
