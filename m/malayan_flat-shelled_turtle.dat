40|$|Sexual dimorphism, allometry, and {{vertebral}} scute morphology {{were studied}} in the <b>Malayan</b> <b>flat-shelled</b> <b>turtle,</b> Notochelys platynota (Gray, 1834). Adult males (mean CL = 238. 29 ± 50. 68 mm, range 130. 5 - 282. 0, n = 16) were, on average, larger than adult females (mean CL = 203. 48 ± 52. 50 mm, range 125. 3 - 330. 0, n = 44). The five largest individuals in the study, however, were females (283 - 330 mm CL). The SDI value for this species was calculated as - 1. 17. Sexual dimorphism of the shell was not evident when examined by ANCOVA. The regression slopes {{of males and females}} differed significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in only one of 26 characters examined. Allometric growth of the shell, however, was evident in N. platynota. Shell shape changed as CL increased proportionally more than shell width, shell height and plastral length (18 / 26 characters). This allometric growth pattern yields adults with relatively narrower and flatter shells than juveniles. Of 127 specimens examined, 3. 9...|$|E
