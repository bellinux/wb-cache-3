40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method of}} measuring axial <b>magnetic</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> in an operational hydropower generator. Axial <b>magnetic</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> is the <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> {{at the ends of}} a rotating generator, which goes through the stator parallel to the rotor axis. This flux can cause circulating currents in the stator iron, giving rise to losses, and can in the worst case overheat a generator, causing it to melt down. To measure the axial flux, and how it affects the generator temperature, a measurement system was constructed on behalf of Vattenfall. The system consists of search coil sensors and a signal-processing unit with amplifiers and active filtering.   To confirm the behaviour of the axial <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> and the functionality of the measurement system, a test installation was made. The result from the measurement shows how the <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> increases when the generator runs in underexcited operation...|$|R

40|$|The spoke type rotor {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> {{concentration}} in permanent magnet machines. This allows the air gap <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> density to exceed the remanent flux density of the permanent magnets but gives problems with <b>leakage</b> <b>fluxes</b> in the <b>magnetic</b> circuit.

The measurements are performed in the end regions of a 12 kW prototype generator for a vertical axis wind turbine. The simulations are made using three dimensional finite elements to calculate the magnetic field distribution in the end regions of the machine. Also two dimensional finite element simulations are performed and the impact of the two dimensional approximation is studied. It is found that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> in the end regions of the machine is equal to about 20 % of the flux in the permanent magnets. The overestimation of the performance by the two dimensional approximation is quantified and a curve-fitted expression for its behavior is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Motors for Dual Clutch Transmission {{system are}} {{required}} to minimize its size because of limited space on transmission. Characteristics, low cost and high productivity are essential to DCT motor for competitiveness of mass production. Hence, concentrated flux type ferrite magnet motor is suggested {{to meet the needs}} of DCT motor. Because concentrated flux type permanent magnet motor has a high torque density, it is possible for ferrite magnet motor to achieve air-gap flux as high as a rare earth magnet motor. The most important thing for the design of concentrated flux type motor is to reduce <b>flux</b> <b>leakage.</b> Increase of <b>magnetic</b> reluctance of <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> path is necessary to reduce the <b>flux</b> <b>leakage.</b> Accordingly, segmented rotor core is required for the size reduction of motor. In case of segmented rotor core type, it is necessary to have complex mechanical structure to maintain circular rotor shape and fix to shaft.

50|$|Short-circuit {{inductance}} is the inductance {{when one}} of the primary winding or the secondary winding of the transformer is short-circuited and measured from the other winding. This value is often called informally as leakage inductance of the transformer. But the term leakage inductance which is in the electromagnetic literature is defined as an inductance caused by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> (<b>leakage</b> flux) which is interlinked with one winding of a primary winding or a secondary winding and does not interlink with the other winding.

5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> (،TFI) is a {{magnetic}} method of nondestructive testing {{that is used}} to detect corrosion and pitting in steel structures, most commonly pipelines and storage tanks.

One possible quality feature of transformers is a uniform distribution of the windings along the circumference (low stray field). The insulation between the various windings can be solved quite differently. In case of covering windings, a film is applied after the first winding to achieve good stray field characteristics. This film needs to be wound to cover the whole circumference. For this, also toroidal winding machines with special magazines can be used.|$|E

For efficient motors, many research methodologies and propositions have been given by researchers in past. Various parameters like as stator/rotor slot variation, {{size and shape of}} stator/rotor slots, stator/rotor winding configuration, choice of core material etc. have momentous impact on machine design. Core material influences the motor performance to a degree. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> linkage and <b>leakage</b> preliminary depends upon the magnetic properties of core material and air gap. The analysis of effects of core material on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> distribution and the performance of {{induction motor}} is of immense importance to meet out the desirable performance. An increase in the air gap length will result in the air gap performance characteristics deterioration and decrease in air gap length will lead to serious mechanical balancing concern.

5000|$|Given {{the fact}} that <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> is a vector {{quantity}} and that a hall sensor can only measure in one direction, three sensors must be oriented within a sensor head to accurately measure the axial, [...] and circumferential components of an MFL signal.

The circumferential component of the vector signal can be measured by mounting a sensor perpendicular to this field. Earlier MFL tools recorded only the axial component but high-resolution tools typically measure all three components. To determine if metal loss is occurring on the internal or external surface of a pipe, a separate eddy current sensor is utilized to indicate wall surface location of the anomaly. The unit of measure when sensing an MFL signal is the gauss or the tesla and generally speaking, the larger the change in the detected magnetic field, the larger the anomaly.|$|E

Accurate assessment of pipeline anomalies can improve the decision making process within an Integrity Management Program and excavation programs can then focus on required repairs instead of calibration or exploratory digs. Utilizing the information from an MFL ILI inspection is not only cost effective but, as well, can also prove to be an extremely valuable building block of a Pipeline Integrity Management Program.|$|E
