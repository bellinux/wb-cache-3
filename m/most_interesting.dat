5|$|Chotiner was in {{many ways}} the <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> {{personality}} in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging his area of operation. Painted in sinister colors by the press, he was both a public relations problem for Nixon and an invaluable campaign strategist.|$|E

5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> and {{surprising}} results occur when i>n. The first such surprise was {{the discovery of}} a mapping called the Hopf fibration, which wraps the 3-sphere S3 around the usual sphere S2 in a non-trivial fashion, and so is not equivalent to a one-point mapping.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> {{aspects of}} Irish phonotactics {{revolve around the}} {{behavior}} of consonant clusters.

50|$|In {{accordance}} with the custom {{of the members of}} the Moravian Church at the time, she wrote her autobiography. Her autobiography from 1787 is regarded as being among the <b>most</b> historically <b>interesting</b> of contemporary Swedish works of that kind.|$|R
50|$|Pear Valley is {{a one-room}} yeoman's cottage and {{prime example of}} vernacular {{architecture}} in Eastville, Virginia.

50|$|The fourth battle {{resulted}} in greater casualties for both sides, {{as a percentage}} of total forces, than any other battle in the Sengoku period, and is, according to Turnbull, one of the <b>most</b> tactically <b>interesting</b> battles of the period as well.|$|R

5|$|Wallace is {{grateful}} for an involuntary stop in Bali, which he finds {{one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> places of his trip, as Hindu customs and religion are still practised, while on Lombok he finds Australian birds such as cockatoos, observing {{that this is the}} most westerly point of that family's range.|$|E
5|$|As an author, Soeman wrote stories which {{emphasized}} suspense and humour, {{drawing on}} Western detective and adventure fiction {{as well as}} classical Malay literature. His written Malay, with a vocabulary heavily influenced by his east Sumatran background, flowed readily and avoided excessive verbosity. Soeman's most popular work was his novel Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan (1932), whereas his short story collection Kawan Bergeloet (1941) has been considered his <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> from a literary perspective. Though considered a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period, Soeman has been recognized with an eponymous library and his books have been taught at schools.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech {{had entered}} into {{the main part of}} its {{schedule}} after three dominating wins. Upcoming engagements with Vanderbilt, Pittsburgh, and Centre were said to determine the season's outcome. Pittsburgh and Centre–but Pittsburgh especially, were the biggest opponents. Vanderbilt was seen as the warm up act to these two, for it was far superior to any of Tech's prior games. The first game of the year to have direct implications for the Southern championship, it was cited by some as the <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> southern contest of the week.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011 Elba, {{known at}} the time for playing Stringer Bell in The Wire, {{reportedly}} joined the cast of Prometheus in an undisclosed role. When the film was released he described Janek's background, and the character's career as a longshoreman and sailor motivate him to maintain the well-being of his crew. Roger Ebert praised Elba's performance, calling Janek's evolution the <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> in the film.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} <b>most</b> <b>interesting.</b> It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E

5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry. Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes it one of the <b>most</b> <b>interesting,</b> rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest.|$|E
5|$|Unfamiliar with Miami culture, Aki Narula {{spent time}} there before filming began {{to learn how}} Miamians dressed and gave Bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours. According to the designer, the <b>most</b> <b>interesting</b> parts of his styling were the {{matching}} scarves, which resembled extended shirt collars. Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and sunglasses. The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{continued}} charting the Rio Negro {{for four}} years, collecting specimens and making {{notes on the}} peoples and languages he encountered {{as well as the}} geography, flora, and fauna. On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig Helen. After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last two, and <b>most</b> <b>interesting,</b> years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.|$|E
