50|$|A {{coffee plant}} usually starts to produce flowers {{three to four}} years after it is planted, and it is from these flowers that the fruits of the plant (commonly known as coffee cherries) appear, with the first useful harvest {{possible}} around five years after planting. The cherries ripen around eight months after the emergence of the flower, by changing color from green to red, and it is at this time that they should be harvested. In most coffee-growing countries, there is one <b>major</b> <b>harvest</b> a year; though in countries like Colombia, where there are two flowerings a year, there is a main and secondary crop, the main one April to June and a smaller one in November to December.|$|E

40|$|Seasonal and {{geographic}} studies of transmissible sarcoma in Maryland softshell clams, Mya arenaria, {{were carried out}} from 1984 to 1988. Three major epizootics occurred in our sampling location during this time, resulting in prevalences as high as 90 %, with comparable mortalities in other high prevalence areas. The disease invaded populations of large adult clams first, later spreading to the small juvenile clam populations. An apparent 2 -year cycle was noted with varying seasonal effects. Affected sites tended {{to be in the}} main stem of Chesapeake Bay north of Tangier Sound, primarily in the areas where the <b>major</b> <b>harvesting</b> occurs. Several sites, mostly in upstream locations, were consistently free of disease. The epizootiological study supports the interpretation that the disease is infectious exclusively to this species.

50|$|The Roamers {{originated}} from the Kanaka, {{the last of}} the eleven generation ships to leave Earth. Originally intended to arrive on a planet and become colonists, they instead became the Roamers. This was brought about soon after the Ildirans brought their ancestors to the fertile planet, Iawa; during their first <b>major</b> <b>harvest,</b> the colonists' crops were all but annihilated by a virus that attacked Terran-based plant life. With their food reserves rapidly dwindling, the people decided to take their chances in space (where they had thrived), and so they all boarded the still intact Kanaka and set out into the vast galaxy once again. Eventually they re-established contact with the people they had left at the Meyer rubble belt, and all banded together to find a new way of life amongst the stars.|$|E
50|$|ULF did not {{participate}} in the 1924 strike mobilized by SLF. However, in 1925 ULF organized a <b>major</b> <b>harvest</b> strike of its own, with epicentre in Kungsängen. Sjölander emerged as the main leader of the strike. But whilst Sjölander had urged his followers to desist from violence, clashes erupted between striking labourers and scabs (brought in from Stockholm). In Bro scabs were forced to flee head over heels, in fights that resulted in jail terms for striking labourers. The outcome of the strike eventually resulted in a backlash for ULF and Sjölander, was they were unable to achieve a favourable bargaining deal. The 1925 strike figures in several literary works, such as the novel En natt i juli by Jan Fridegård and the novel collection Statarna by Ivar Lo-Johansson. En natt i juli was made into a movie in 1946, titled När ängarna blomma.|$|E

5000|$|Charles Eaves {{was born}} in Liverpool, England on February 21, 1908. His mother, Amy Elizabeth (née Potts), died at his birth. His father, Frank Albert Eaves, a marine {{engineer}} specializing in propeller design, died following a workplace injury shortly thereafter. Eaves' guardians placed the sickly 2 year old {{in the country with}} the family of a gentle basket weaver. During the First World War, at age 8, he was sent to boarding school - a move he found difficult. However, there he discovered a fondness for music, poetry and theatre - and roles in school plays made classes bearable. Eaves graduated from school at age 14, but unable to find work his guardians insisted he go 'on the dole'. This instilled a lifelong empathy for others in need. Later, as a junior shipping clerk, he entered a Canadian Pacific Steamship office where a striking poster beckoned [...] "Public School Boys Wanted - to learn farming in Canada". In March 1926, after a rough Atlantic crossing, 18-year-old Eaves entered Macdonald College of McGill University, where {{he fell in love with}} Canadian optimism. He learned numerous farming methods and completed the 2 year diploma course in 1928.

40|$|This {{sounds like}} a broken record, but {{we are looking at}} yet another harvest driven by weather {{extremes}} and combinations that are hard to predict. The major events were the extremely late planting in very wet soils, followed by an almost complete turnaround in many places to a steadily growing drought condition. In July, the market believed that our <b>major</b> <b>harvest</b> risk would be very wet and late crops vulnerable to even an average frost.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{frequency and}} precision for surveys of wildlife populations represent a trade-off between survey cost {{and the risk}} of making suboptimal management decisions because of poor survey data. The commercial harvest of kangaroos is primarily regulated through annual quotas set as proportions of absolute estimates of population size. Stochastic models were used to explore the effects of varying precision, survey frequency and harvest rate on the risk of quasiextinction for an arid-zone and a more mesic-zone kangaroo population. Quasiextinction probability increases in a sigmoidal fashion as survey frequency is reduced. The risk is greater in more arid regions and is highly sensitive to harvest rate. An appropriate management regime involves regular surveys in the <b>major</b> <b>harvest</b> areas where harvest rate can be set close to the maximum sustained yield. Outside these areas, survey frequency can be reduced in relatively mesic areas and reduced in arid regions when combined with lowered harvest rates. Relative to other factors, quasiextinction risk is only affected by survey precision (standard error/mean × 100) when it is > 50 %, partly reflecting the safety of the strategy of harvesting a proportion of a population estimate...|$|E
40|$|Mangoes {{can express}} several skin {{disorders}} following important postharvest treatments. Responses are often cultivar specific. This paper reports {{the responses of}} two new Australian mango cultivars {{to some of these}} treatments. 'Honey Gold' mango develops "under skin browning" early during cold storage. This is thought to be partly caused by a discolouration of the latex vessels which then spreads to the surrounding cells. The symptoms appear to be worse in fruit from hotter production areas and that have been cooled to temperatures below 18 C soon after harvest. Current commercial recommendations are to cool fruit to 18 C, which limits postharvest handling options. Recent trials have confirmed that delayed or slowed cooling after harvest can reduce under skin browning. The defect may also be associated with physical injury to the skin during harvesting and packing. Irradiation is potentially an important disinfestation treatment for fruit fly in Australian mangoes. The 'B 74 ' mango cultivar develops significant skin damage following irradiation, mainly due to discolouration of the cells surrounding the lenticels. Recent results confirmed that fruit harvested directly from the tree into trays without exposure to water or postharvest chemicals are not damaged by irradiation, while commercially harvested and packed fruit are damaged. Several <b>major</b> <b>harvest</b> and postharvest steps appear to increase lenticel sensitivity to irradiation. Further work is required to develop commercially acceptable protocols to facilitate 'Honey Gold' and 'B 74 ' mango distribution and marketing...|$|E

30|$|In Romania, forest {{management}} has been {{strongly influenced by}} the nationalization of all forests in 1952 when they went under state ownership. The necessity to pay the war reparations to USSR during the period 1946 – 1956 has led to <b>major</b> <b>harvests,</b> often in form of large-scale clear cuts and plantings. The harvests still exceeded allowable cut frequently (1951 – 1955; 1962 – 1975; 1976 – 1979; 1980 – 1984), and the cuttings were concentrated mainly on accessible forests (Popescu et al. 2004). Excessive harvests occurred despite fairly restrictive technical norms of management implemented through management plans that had been renewed every 10  years in all forests {{since the end of}} the 1950 ’s. In 1987, in reaction to over-harvesting, a new forest law was issued (Law nr. 2 / 1987) implementing low thinning, long rotations -exceeding 100  years for all main forest species with associated large tree dimensions- and prohibiting large-scale clear-cuts. Romania currently implements a “cut and leave” management with little care at an early age, slow individual growth due to overcrowding, and a final clear cut at a very advanced age (Schulze et al., 2014). The forest law adopted in 2008 (Forest Code 2008) and modified later in 2015 did not bring important changes in this sylvicultural system, but some new rules were adopted to stimulate the realisation of thinnings in the earlier stages of the stands.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) {{and related}} species {{represent}} {{one of the}} most important commercial fisheries targeted within the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean regions. This important fishery extends from Florida (USA) to Brazil. The longlived, pelagic larval stage within the life cycle of spiny lobster reveal this species to be a resource truly shared amongst virtually all the harvesting nations within the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region. The high demand for this seafood product results in spiny lobster lobster products being shipped worldwide. This study seeks to describe the trade patterns that exist for spiny lobster products among the <b>major</b> <b>harvesting</b> nations in the region, and the major consuming nations worldwide. The trade patterns are expressed in terms of volume and, where possible, value by product type (fresh, frozen). Trade data were obtained from several sources, include UN Comtrade and FAO. The trade patterns are described over a multi-year period and highlight changes in import and export patterns within the region by country. Where possible, trade patterns are compared to harvest trends by country. This study will provide insight into how the harvest levels, trade patterns and market shares by country have changed, as the demand for spiny lobster products has increased. Such information will be be useful for any future co-management plans that may be developed for this regionally shared and important fishery...|$|R
