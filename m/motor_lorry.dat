25|$|From the {{departure}} of the Australian Mounted Division steps were taken to make it appear that the valley was still fully garrisoned. These included building a bridge in the valley and infantry were marched into the Jordan Valley by day, driven out by <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> at night, and marched back in daylight over and over again and 15,000 dummy horses were made of canvas and stuffed with straw and every day mules dragged branches up and down the valley (or the same horses were ridden backwards and forwards all day, as if watering) to keep the dust in thick clouds. Tents were left standing and 142 fires were lit each night.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the convoys {{bringing}} {{food and}} water from Beersheba to the 53rd (Welsh) Division lost their way. The camel convoy carrying the water arrived at 04:30, by which time some of the mules from one battalion had been 53 hours without a drink. Although a <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> column brought some water forward, the infantrymen and their animals were on short supplies. While the artillery bombardment began at 05:00, the 160th Brigade was forced to begin their attack 15 minutes later on empty stomachs. Some progress was made on the lower slopes of Hill 1706. However, not long afterwards, supplies of artillery ammunition almost ran out, and the attack was terminated. Another attack planned for {{later in the day}} was postponed by Chetwode's direct order until 6 November, when a general attack was planned.|$|E
500|$|The 4th Cavalry Division {{had ridden}} [...] (the first [...] over sandy soil) and fought two actions, in 34 hours. The 13th Brigade of the 5th Cavalry Division covered [...] in 22 hours. On {{its way to}} Jenin, the Australian Mounted Division rode , with its 3rd Light Horse Brigade riding [...] in less than 25 hours. These cavalry {{divisions}} had started the advance with three days rations, so {{they were on their}} last day's supplies when their brigade transport and supply companies arrived. These divisional trains had been supplied from <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> convoys, one of which arrived at Jenin during 21 September. The Australian Mounted Division motor ambulance transport, also rejoined their division at Jenin on 21 September, after the main road had been cleared.|$|E
50|$|Goods traffic too was {{in decline}} from about 1924 {{due to the}} {{competition}} from <b>motor</b> <b>lorries.</b>|$|R

500|$|These {{large numbers}} of {{evacuations}} to Jericho, eight to ten hours away, travelled mostly in <b>motor</b> <b>lorries.</b> <b>Motor</b> ambulances were reserved for the most severe cases. The trip was broken about [...] south of Es Salt, where the Welsh Field Ambulance fed the patients and rested them for two hours before they resumed their journey. One group of motor ambulances drove between Amman and the Welsh Field Ambulance, and a second group drove from the Welsh Field Ambulance to Jericho. <b>Motor</b> <b>lorries</b> and some cars of No. 35 Motor Ambulance Convoy evacuated the sick from the Anzac Mounted Division receiving station near Jericho to the casualty clearing station at Jerusalem.|$|R
500|$|At Beisan, the 4th Cavalry Division {{was well}} in advance of their rations transport, which did not catch up until the next day, when lorries {{delivered}} rations. Until then, the division had the remains of their two days' special emergency ration, which had been carried in sandbags on their saddles. Ration transport had been [...] behind the division; 'A', 'B' Echelons, the Divisional Transport Train, and Ammunition Column bivouacking for the night at Shellalif on 19 September. The special camel convoy had been unable to keep up, and its provisions were distributed elsewhere. By the evening of 20 September rations had also been delivered to the 5th Cavalry Division at Aujah by <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> via the Musmus Pass, while 'A' Echelon and the Divisional Transport Train were bivouacked at Qaqun.|$|E
500|$|On {{learning}} of the crash at nearby Seven-Mile Beach employees of Australian National Airways raced from Cambridge aerodrome to lend assistance. [...] About 11:15pm the rear fuselage came to the surface a short distance off-shore. Donald Butler, one of the employees, feared the air hostess might still be trapped in her seat {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. [...] He took a length of rope, swam out to the floating piece of structure, attached the rope to the tailwheel and then swam back to the beach. [...] A <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> was used to drag the rear fuselage ashore but there was no-one inside. The right tailplane, elevator and trim tab were almost undamaged. [...] The elevator trim tab was still set appropriately for a shallow climb after take-off.|$|E
2500|$|A strong rearguard was {{encountered}} defending Dier es Saras {{which was}} charged mounted, when several defenders were [...] "run through" [...] with swords. [...] "B" [...] Squadron, 10th Light Horse Regiment attacked and captured the rearguard. One troop had dismounted while the remaining troops {{in single file}} due to the rough country, moved round the flank mounted. They attacked and captured the position, 12 German, 41 Ottoman prisoners, one field gun, one machine gun, one <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> and an ammunition dump. Shortly before dawn the brigade arrived at Deir es Saras; [...] "B" [...] Squadron rejoining the regiment at 08:00 on 28 September.|$|E
50|$|The already limited traffic {{had been}} further reduced by <b>motor</b> <b>lorries</b> and buses since the 1930s and closure to {{passengers}} became inevitable; {{it took place}} in September 1952. A very limited goods service continued, but the line was closed completely in October 1966.|$|R
50|$|In 1902, Robert Holt {{commenced}} a parcels delivery {{service in}} the Rochdale area using a pony and cart. In 1904, Holt went into partnership with his younger brother Ernest and they established themselves as carriers trading as Messrs Holt Brothers. Additional ponies and carts were purchased, later followed by steam and <b>motor</b> <b>lorries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The undertype designs {{have the}} engine under the chassis (although the boiler - usually a {{vertical}} type - {{remains in the}} cab), and generally resemble <b>motor</b> <b>lorries</b> rather than traction engines.

2500|$|Ice {{began to}} be {{delivered}} daily by <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> from Jerusalem to treat the bad cases of malignant malaria; it travelled in sacks filled with sawdust, and with care lasted for 12 hours or more. Patients in the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance were as a result, given iced drinks which to them, appeared incredible. When a serious case arrived with a temperature of [...] ice wrapped in lint was packed all round his body to practically freeze him; his temperature was taken every minute or so and, in about 20 minutes, when his temperature may have dropped to normal he was wrapped, shivering in a blanket, when the tent temperature was well over , and evacuated by motor ambulance to hospital in Jerusalem, before the next attack.|$|E
2500|$|A segment shelter {{manufactured}} by the Stanton Ironworks, Ilkeston, Derbyshire. [...] The shop producing spun-concrete lighting columns ceased production {{and turned over}} to concrete air-raid shelters, of which 100,000 tons were manufactured, principally for the air ministry. Reinforced concrete proved an ideal material for air-raid shelters, being strong and resistant to shock with no deterioration {{with the passing of}} time. This type of segment shelter was of simple design and of low costâ€”any length of shelter could be built up from the pre-cast steel reinforced concrete segments. The segments were 20inches wide; a pair of them formed an arch 7 feet high and transverse struts were provided to ensure rigidity. These fitted into longitudinal bearers which were grooved to receive the foot of each segment. Each pair of segments was bolted together at the apex of the arch and each segment was also bolted to its neighbour, the joints being sealed with a bituminous compound. The convenient handling of these segments enabled them to be transported onto sites where close access by <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> was not possible. Partly buried in the ground, with a suitably screened entrance, this bolted shelter afforded safe protection against blast and splinters.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pursuit, the supply route ran from Haifa, to Nazareth and on to Tiberias and Samakh, but by the time Desert Mounted Corps reached Damascus the corps had outrun its supply columns. The main problems were damage to the railway from Haifa to Samakh, which was repaired by 30 September, and the very bad condition of a [...] stretch of road from Jisr Benat Yakub towards Quneitra. The stretch of [...] "less than a mile leading up from the crossing of the Jordan at Jisr Benat Yakub", took on average a day to {{a day and a half}} to negotiate. It took three days by <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> to travel the [...] from Semakh to Damascus. [...] "There was only one narrow and winding road, running to the south-west and crossing a narrow bridge which broke down several times and was only wide enough for one vehicle. Most of the troops were camped along this road, on the outskirts of the town, and, since it was the only route by which they and the motor supply lorries from Semakh railhead could reach the town, it was frequently blocked." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{supply of}} <b>motor</b> <b>lorries</b> was {{insufficient}} for {{the evacuation of}} sick and wounded {{as well as the}} evacuation of prisoners. There were over 10,000 prisoners in the Damascus area who put great pressure on the food supply. [...] "Eventually it was arranged that returning ammunition lorries, available only at very irregular intervals, should be used for the sick and wounded, and supply-lorries for the prisoners of war." ...|$|R
5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, {{but most of it}} was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and <b>motor</b> <b>lorries,</b> much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|R
2500|$|In the First World War the Mk I gun could {{fire the}} early 60 lb (27.3kg) 2 c.r.h. shell 10,300 yd (9.4km), and the later more {{streamlined}} 8 c.r.h. shell to [...] Weighing 4.4 tonnes, the 60-pounder required {{a team of}} 8 horses to tow it, with a maximum of 12 possible in difficult conditions.

50|$|The Great Western Railway {{operated}} a pioneering road passenger connection to Mullion and the Lizard from 17 August 1903, and a Porthleven connection was added in 1909, and surrounding villages were also served. There {{was also an}} extensive van service for goods traffic {{to and from the}} railway, developed into a <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> service from about 1925.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{approved}} in October 1914 and was issued on Mk I high angle mounting, usually {{mounted on a}} <b>motor</b> <b>lorry.</b> The Mk I mounting had an additional recuperator housing mounted directly above the normal recuperator to facilitate gun runout at high angles. Hence the appearance was of a gun barrel with 2 slightly shorter tubes of similar diameter above it.|$|E
50|$|The canal {{ceased to}} be used in 1928. Since the {{terminus}} was next to a main road, the advent of the <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> resulted in its closure. The basin was briefly used by a company building yachts in 1954, but they resorted to sending the completed boats to Teignmouth by lorry, and moved to Brixham soon afterwards. A wall was constructed around the lock in 1955 after high tides in the estuary broke through and flooded Newton Abbot Racecourse.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge over}} the Haddington branch was made {{sufficient}} for double track, unlikely though {{it was that the}} line would once again be doubled. In fact the Great North Road, which became the A1, was progressively improved, and later in the 1930s buses started to run at fifteen-minute intervals, and <b>motor</b> <b>lorries</b> became popular carriers. By now there were no through trains to Edinburgh from Haddington (except the Friday market train) further worsening the railway's competitive position.|$|R
50|$|In the First World War the Mk I gun could {{fire the}} early 60 lb (27.3 kg) 2 c.r.h. shell 10,300 yd (9.4 km), and the later more {{streamlined}} 8 c.r.h. shell to 12300 yd.

50|$|In 1923 also bus {{services}} {{started in}} earnest in the locality. The Anstruther line was meandering and its stations were mostly remote from their communities, and trains were infrequent {{compared with the}} bus offerings. <b>Motor</b> <b>lorries</b> too showed their superiority in door to door transits over the railways. The decline in income was serious and in 1929 the LNER announced the closure of Kingsbarns, Boarhills, Stravithie and Mount Melville stations to passengers; this took effect on 22 September 1929.|$|R
50|$|Kielpa {{once had}} a school and a post office, however neither remains. The bulk grain silos by the railway line are still in use for barley. Kielpa was {{proposed}} as the junction for a branch railway line to Campoona and Mangalo, and the railway was authorised by parliament {{to be built in}} 1916, however it was never constructed, and by 1929, the Public Works Committee determined that wheat could be more efficiently transported by <b>motor</b> <b>lorry</b> than by building this line.|$|E

25|$|The diesel railcars were {{an attempt}} to carry light {{passenger}} traffic at lower cost, but since 1918 competition from road transport had severely reduced the line's income; <b>motor</b> <b>lorries</b> abstracted goods traffic and omnibuses reduced passenger carryings.
