500|$|In early 1965, {{while they}} were his guests for dinner, Lennon and Harrison's dentist {{secretly}} added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: [...] "It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned {{for a month or}} two." [...] He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that [...] "it opened my eyes" [...] and [...] "made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better,</b> more honest, more tolerant member of society".|$|E
500|$|Initially {{reluctant}} to try LSD, McCartney eventually {{did so in}} late 1966, and took his second [...] "acid trip" [...] in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, [...] "It opened my eyes... made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better,</b> more honest, more tolerant member of society." [...] He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, {{along with the other}} Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.|$|E

500|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, ordered {{an invasion of}} the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on Rio Grande do Sul. The invasions resulted in an alliance between Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Following the resignation of Caxias's government in 1862, successor cabinets were headed by the Progressive League, the rival of the Conservative Party. As a Conservative, Joaquim Inácio found himself largely sidelined. He humorously commented that the Progressives [...] "have not lifted my excommunication by giving <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> ration of soup , thus I shall remain on a diet". In October 1865, Joaquim Inácio {{was sent to the}} north of Brazil, charged with recruiting volunteers, but soon resigned that commission and opted to devote his time to the Holy House of Mercy.|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He criticized {{the characterization of}} Andy {{and said that the}} character had [...] "hit a plateau when his fist went through that wall in season three" [...] and represented [...] "a grinning puppet who can be imbued with some of Michael Scott's leftover tics and remind people he went to Cornell". However, Adams enjoyed the episode's subplots and wrote that the episode really [...] "gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> picture of what makes Andy's girlfriend tick." [...] Furthermore, he praised many of her lines and her acting ability. Damon Houx of ScreenCrush said that the episode was a [...] "surprisingly strong Erin episode" [...] and that [...] "Dwight acting crazy was also well used". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "a nice enough holiday episode". He was critical of the episode's Jim and Pam subplot, saying that it could have [...] "been left on the cutting room floor." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White awarded the episode a 7.9 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. She wrote that while the story had its limitations, [...] "Little lines and bits ... helped elevate 'Here Comes Treble.|$|E

2500|$|Although Brach {{began writing}} the {{screenplay}} in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a film adaptation of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos {{in order to}} research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the American Humane Association, Annaud stated: [...] "Each time I was fascinated with the tigers, {{to a point that}} I thought to do a movie called The Tiger instead of The Bear. In those days I felt that the bear, because they're so often vertical, would give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers." [...] The finished script was presented to Berri in early 1983.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Horton {{was signed}} by Zimbabwean side Matabeleland Tuskers. He {{described}} {{his role in the}} squad as [...] "...to get runs in all forms of the game and also bring an approach and a dedication to the game that rubs off {{on the rest of the}} squad. To have that added responsibility on my shoulders can only make <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> person and a better cricketer in the forthcoming season for Lancashire." [...] In a match against the Mountaineers in November, Horton scored his first T20 half-century, beating his previous best of 44. He set another personal best two months later in a match against Southern Rocks; Horton scored his maiden first-class double-century. The innings of 209 beat his previous highest score of 173.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{addition}} of Howard and Nash, Bryant insisted he remained {{the leader of the}} Lakers. Nash agreed that it was Bryant's team, but added the team needed to provide support. Bryant looked forward to Nash running the team's offense. Bryant envisioned that after he retired, Howard would assume the role of team leader. Howard anticipated Bryant being tough on him. [...] "So, I'll take all the heat that he's going to give me because I know {{at the end of the}} day that's going to make <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> player and a better person and it's going to make this team better", Howard said.

2500|$|Gordon is a {{born again}} Christian. He {{has talked about}} how in the early-1990s he got curious and {{followed}} some drivers to the weekly chapel one week, which is how he first started {{to learn more about}} God. During this time, Gordon kept verses of the Bible taped to his steering wheel. In 2004, Gordon stated he [...] "has a difficult time focusing on one particular faith." [...] When asked again in a 2015 Sports Illustrated magazine interview, he claimed: [...] "I wasn't brought up [...] It was something I got introduced to when I came into the Cup Series. I explored it and learned a lot from that experience. I feel it's helped make <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> person, but I choose to do it more privately now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", {{but it was}} something he looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility on my shoulders is something I relish. It will make <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>better,</b> more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains why he was so tired." ...|$|E
