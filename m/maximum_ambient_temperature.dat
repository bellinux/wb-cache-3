This experiment was conducted in Guadeloupe (West French Indies, latitude 16 °N, longitude 61 °W) between February 2007 and January 2008. Two seasons were distinguished a posteriori from climatic measurement variables continuously recorded in the farrowing room. The average minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> and average daily relative humidity for the warm season were 20. 5 and 28. 2 °C, and 93. 8 %, respectively. The corresponding values for the hot season were 22. 7 and 29. 4 °C, and 93. 7 %, respectively. The dietary experimental treatments were a normal protein diet (NP), a low protein diet (LP), and a NP diet (NP+) supplemented with essential AA. The NP and LP diets supplied the same levels of standardized digestible Lys (i. e., 0. 80 g/MJ of NE), and the NP+ diet supplied 0. 95 g/MJ of NE. No interaction between season and diet composition was noted on any response variable evaluated. The ADFI was decreased (P 0. 08). In conclusion, the hot season in humid tropical climates, which combines high levels of temperature and humidity, has a pronounced negative impact on performance of lactating sows.

Oecologia 181 : 1101. doi: 10. 1007 /s 00442 - 016 - 3630 - 5 analyzed the effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on the habitat selection of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Alberta, Canada. They concluded that temperature {{played a significant role}} in bear habitat selection and that it was unlikely that human activity introduced biases to the habitat selection of bears. However, Pigeon et al. did not consider variables related to human activities in their analyses. They also misinterpreted previous research that has accounted for temperature in the habitat selection of brown bears. There is much literature published on the negative effects of human disturbance on wildlife in general and on bears in particular. Downplaying the role of human disturbance could have important negative consequences if, in fact, human disturbance were a more important factor than thermoregulation. Indeed, dismissing the importance of human influence, in the face of contradictory evidence, could tempt managers to disregard an important factor that is difficult and often unpopular to deal with in their conservation plans.
