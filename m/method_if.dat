Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment <b>method.</b> <b>If</b> NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

The <b>IF</b> <b>method</b> is capable of handling specific nonlinear and non-stationary signals with less mathematical regularity.

2500|$|Limitation of single-sideband {{modulation}} {{being used}} for voice signals and not available for video/TV signals leads to the usage of vestigial sideband. A vestigial sideband (in radio communication) is a sideband that has been only partly cut off or suppressed. [...] Television broadcasts (in analog video formats) use this <b>method</b> <b>if</b> the video is transmitted in AM, due to the large bandwidth used. It may also be used in digital transmission, such as the ATSC standardized 8VSB. The Milgo 4400/48 modem (around 1967) used vestigial sideband and phase-shift keying to provide 4800bit/s transmission over a 1600Hz channel.|$|E

Hence the efficiency of the haploid method is high when the number of genes concerned is large.|$|E

2500|$|The size {{distribution}} of {{gravel and sand}} particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put {{into the top of}} a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. [...] Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective <b>method.</b> <b>If</b> {{there are a lot of}} fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and clods through.|$|E
