5|$|During 1929, most of {{the major}} European filmmaking {{countries}} began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: The Clue of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made <b>much</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a rodent in {{the genus}} Oryzomys of family Cricetidae from {{interior}} western Mexico, {{in the states}} of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán. First described in 1901 as a separate species, it was later lumped under O.couesi and the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) until it was reinstated as a species in 2009.
