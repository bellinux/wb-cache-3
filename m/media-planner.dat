40|$|A {{multiple}} objective {{linear programming}} (MOLP) method utilizing interval criterion weights {{is applied to}} the problem of media selection. Using this technique, it is possible to analyze a problem more explicitly in terms of the several objectives inherent in many media selection situations. In order to illustrate the interval criterion weights approach, a multiple objective hierarchical media selection model is presented and its computer results discussed. In addition to being able to deal more directly with different decision criteria, a distinguishing feature of the mathematical analysis applied here is that its output enables the <b>media-planner</b> to be presented with a small cluster of candidate media schedules (rather than just one). Then, from this list, the <b>media-planner</b> should {{be in a position to}} qualitatively make a final choice as a close approximation to his optimal solution. ...|$|E
