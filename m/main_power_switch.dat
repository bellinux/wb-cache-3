They operate with high switching frequencies {{to reduce the size}} of the converters 2 ̆ 7 inductors, transformers and capacitors. Such high switching frequency operation, however, increases the amount of power that is lost due to switching losses and thus reduces <b>power</b> converter efficiency. <b>Switching</b> losses are caused by the overlap of switch voltage and switch current during a switching transition. If, however, either the voltage across or the current flowing through a switch is zero during a switching transition, then there is no overlap of switch voltage and switch current so in theory, there are no switching losses. Techniques that ensure that this happens are referred to as soft-switching techniques in the power electronics literature and there are two types: zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS). For pulse-width modulated (PWM) Dc-Dc converters, both ZVS and ZCS are typically implemented with auxiliary circuits that help the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>switches</b> operate with soft-switching. Although these auxiliary circuits do help improve the efficiency of the converters, they increase their cost. There is, therefore, motivation to try to make these auxiliary circuits as simple and as inexpensive as possible. Three new soft-switching Dc-Dc PWM converters are proposed in this thesis. For each converter, a very simple auxiliary circuit that consists of only a single active switching device and a few passive components is used to reduce the switching losses in the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>switches.</b> The outstanding feature of each converter is the simplicity of its auxiliary circuit, which unlike most other previously proposed converters of similar type, avoids the use of multiple active auxiliary switches.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, static power {{converters}} have become {{widely used in}} various applications. They {{can be found in}} domestic applications, railways, urban and ship transport, and even in several industrial systems. Some of these applications require a high or medium voltage power supply that is easily adjustable while providing good spectral performances. To overcome the maximum blocking voltage limits of the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>switches,</b> multilevel techniques and other new power conversion topologies have been developed. They are series/parallel associations of existing power semiconductors, and allow generating an output voltage with many levels. The number of power semiconductors needed in these topologies increases as the number of levels increases. The power converter circuit becomes more complex and its reliability decreases. This thesis focuses on three-phase multilevel converters based on a series connection of single phase inverters (partial cells) in each phase. It's shown that, feeding partial cells with unequal DC-voltages (asymmetric feeding), increases the number of levels of the generated output voltage without any supplemental complexity to the existing topology. Voltage resolution is increased through interpolating the generated output voltage phasor (three phase voltage in α-β frame). This is achieved by seeking the non redundant switching states of the <b>power</b> <b>switches.</b> The resultant converter can generate a very high resolution voltage phasor up to the possible maximum resolution. This approach is generalized for any number of partial cells. Each partial cell is fed through a three-phase diode rectifier, fed itself through the windings of a multi-secondary low frequency power transformer. From analytical expressions in continuous and discontinuous current conix duction modes, it is shown that, from a supply network point of view, a symmetrical multilevel converter has a smaller total harmonic distortion than an asymmetrical multilevel converter with the same number of partial cells per phase. An asymmetrical multilevel converter is not more interesting than a classical three-phase converter, but its total harmonic distortion is compatible to the recommended IEEE std 519 - 1992. It is also shown that the advantages of an asymmetric multilevel converter from a load point of view (generation of a high resolution voltage phasor, possibility to choose the number of redundant switching states, reduction of the number of power semiconductors for the same voltage resolution, flexibility for the DC-voltage feeding choice) and the advantages of a symmetrical multilevel converter from a supply network point of view (smaller total harmonic distorsion) can be combined.
