This sparks ruminations on why she, Clarissa, was not invited to lunch and again towards thoughts of the worth of her life. In her mind, she is [...] "only a wife" [...] (p94). Clarissa tries {{to be grateful for}} the moment she is inhabiting, cutting the stems off roses at the kitchen sink. She thinks of the holiday she had when she was eighteen with Louis and Richard, a time when [...] "it seemed anything could happen, anything at all" [...] (p95). She thinks of kissing Richard, a dramatic reversal of the kiss Woolf's Clarissa Dalloway shares with a girl when she was young. Clarissa (Vaughan) realizes without that holiday and the house where she, Richard and Louis spent it, so many events would not have occurred, including this moment now, standing in a kitchen cutting flowers for her best friend, Richard's, party. She remembers telling herself at the time she was not betraying Louis by sleeping with Richard, it was the free-wheeling 1960's, Louis was aware of what was going on. She wonders what might have happened if she had tried to remain with Richard. She imagines that other future, [...] "full of infidelities and great battles; as a vast and enduring romance laid over friendship so searing and profound it would accompany them to the grave...She could have had a life as potent and dangerous as literature itself." [...] "Or then again maybe not," [...] Clarissa thinks. She realizes that <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing equal to the recollection of having been young. She catalogues the moment she and Richard kissed for the first time, by a pond's edge at dusk. [...] "It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than thirty years, to realize that it 'was' happiness...Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other." ...|$|E

"Look, Friedel," [...] said Ebbo, sinking his voice, [...] "I {{shall not}} lightly yield my freedom to king or Kaiser. <b>Maybe,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no help for it; but it irks {{me to think}} that I should be the last Lord of Adlerstein to whom the title of Freiherr is not a mockery.

Oh no, it is not right that we should look at their faces.|$|E

[...] "If you {{had come}} back to me, Marcia, in rags and in want, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} in my heart would have gone, and I'd have taken you and we'd have found a home somewhere far away. But to see you sitting there, soft and well-spoken, speaking of your success, pleased with your life, turns that very hatred you spoke of into fury! You and your learning and your writing of books! Why, you're ignorant, woman, more ignorant than the insects about you. You don't know right from wrong." ...|$|E

Had I slain thee {{as well as}} her, yet should he love me, Holly, {{because he could not}} save himself from therefrom any more than thou couldst save thyself from dying, if by chance I slew thee, oh Holly. And yet <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> truth in what thou dost say; for in some way it presseth on my mind. If it may be, I will spare this woman; for have I not told thee that I am not cruel for the sake of cruelty? I love not to see suffering, or to cause it. Let her come before me--quick now, before my mood changes," [...] and she hastily covered her face with its gauzy wrapping.|$|E
6000|$|With true {{masculine}} wiles he {{not only}} convinced himself that she had injured him but, by the loudness of his voice and the brutality of his attack, he convinced her also, and presently he had her apologizing for his having spent the evening with Tanis. He went up to bed well pleased, not only the master but the martyr of the household. For a distasteful moment after he had lain down {{he wondered if he}} had been altogether just. [...] "Ought to be ashamed, bullying her. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> her side to things. Maybe she hasn't had such a bloomin' hectic time herself. But I don't care! Good for her to get waked up a little. And I'm going to keep free. Of her and Tanis and the fellows at the club and everybody. I'm going to run my own life!" ...|$|E
60|$|It was a quaintly {{beautiful}} little place, with its mixture of French and German ideas; its old bridge and gentle-minded river, between the cultivated hills. The sand-bagged cellar doors, the ruined houses, and {{the holes in}} the pavement looked as unreal as the violences of a cinema against that soft and simple setting. The people were abroad in the streets, and the little children were playing. A big shell gives notice enough for one to get to shelter, if the shelter is near enough. That appears to be as much as any one expects in the world where one is shelled, and that world has settled down to it. People's lips are a little firmer, the modelling of the brows is a little more pronounced, and, <b>maybe,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a change in the expression of the eyes; but nothing that a casual afternoon caller need particularly notice.|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{connection}} between the kind of goal a user pursues and the preference of one communication style over another, personality traits may also affect such preferences. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some users that would consider the critical-aggressive-demeaning style as quite effective, but are not able to handle that kind of interaction.|$|R

5000|$|Byrkit {{answered}} one interviewer: [...] "Twilight Zone, for sure. Primer wasn't {{really an}} influence {{so much as}} it was a sign to us that <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an audience for this kind of movie. The actual movie itself is so different than ours that it wasn't as much of an influence as, say, Carnage by Roman Polanski, or other non-sci-fi movies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] I admitted. [...] "In {{the book}} the wild young man drinks without ever getting drunk. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{difference}} between life and the book. In the book you enjoy your fun, but contrive somehow to escape the licking: in life the licking is the only thing sure. It was the wild young man of fiction I was looking for, who, a fortnight before the exam., ties a wet towel round his head, drinks strong tea, and passes easily with honours. He tried the wet towel, he tells me. It never would keep in its place. Added to which it gave him neuralgia; while the strong tea gave him indigestion. I used to picture myself the proud, indulgent father lecturing him for his wildness--turning away {{at some point in the}} middle of my tirade to hide a smile. There was never any smile to hide. I feel that he has behaved disgracefully, wasting his time and my money." ...|$|E

50|$|In the 1991 Blade Runners {{documentary}} Jayne says: “I didn’t like Revolution {{at first}} because I’m not an aggressive person, so it was good that he pushed it because it brought out another side of me - another character that I could portray”. Chris {{then goes on to}} explain the theme of the piece, and explains how it leads into imagine and why the perform the two pieces together: “the idea is of it’s a young couple that have been married for a few years and it’s not that fairytale life of happiness. Which happens {{to a lot of people}} - that something goes wrong and tension builds and anger grows within that. And I wanted to put that onto the ice - this raw aggression - and overstate it - so that, for people sitting right the way back, it becomes literal though body. But it follows on in a sort of resolve - not necessarily a happy ending - it then goes into Imagine. <b>Maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something else, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a compromise or at least an understanding of their situation. They may not get back together or it may not be resolved but they’ve analysed that they have a problem and <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something to work towards and achieve a happier solution”.|$|E

60|$|The latter {{sensation}} {{was strong}} in Honor herself, {{as she walked}} into the room between her beautiful pair, and contrasted Lucilla with her contemporary, a formed and finished young lady, all plaits, ribbons, and bracelets--not half so pleasing an object as the little maid in her white frock, blue sash, and short wavy hair, though <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something quaint in such simplicity, to eyes trained by fashion instead of by good taste.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theory is}} no longer popular as {{analysis}} of data shows little evidence that the method works.

5000|$|Back at home, Sarah allows Chuck time {{to review}} his file on the disk before confiscating it. In it, Fleming {{is about to}} record an {{interview}} with Chuck when Bryce enters and reveals that Chuck never got the message. Fleming says that Chuck is ideal for the Omaha Project, and touts his high rate of retention of subliminal information; he further states that, because of the promise Chuck shows, Chuck will be drafted rather than recruited {{and he will be}} [...] "in, no matter what." [...] Bryce fears that Omaha, a military project, would destroy his friend and that he's too good a person to be forced into that life. With no other options, Bryce requests that Fleming help him falsify records to show Chuck cheated on his exams, invalidating his test scores and sparing him from recruitment. Chuck realizes Bryce sacrificed his friendship with Chuck to save him, and that, if Bryce got him expelled to protect him, <b>maybe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a reason for him destroying the Intersect as well.
