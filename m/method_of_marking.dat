5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
500|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has evolved}} a mutualistic {{relationship}} with mountain treeshrews (Tupaia montana) {{in order to}} collect their droppings. [...] The inside of the reflexed lid exudes a sweet nectar. The distance from the pitcher mouth to the exudate {{is the same as}} the average body length of the mountain treeshrew. [...] These proportions also hold true for N.lowii and N.macrophylla. [...] As it feeds, the treeshrew defecates, apparently as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> its feeding territory. [...] It is thought that in exchange for providing nectar, the faeces provide N.rajah with the majority of the nitrogen it requires. In N.lowii, N.macrophylla and N.rajah, the colour of the lower lid surface corresponds to visual sensitivity maxima of the mountain treeshrew in the green and blue wavebands, making the lid underside stand out against adjacent parts of the pitcher. Of the three species, N.rajah shows the tightest 'fit', particularly in the green waveband.|$|E

2500|$|In North America John James Audubon and Ernest Thompson Seton were pioneers {{although}} their <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> birds {{was different from}} modern ringing. In order {{to determine if the}} same bird would return to his farm, Audubon tied silver threads onto the legs of young eastern phoebes in 1803, while Seton marked snow buntings in Manitoba with ink in 1882. Ringing of birds for more extensive scientific purposes was started in 1899 by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, a Danish schoolteacher, using aluminum rings on European starlings (Mortensen had tried using zinc rings as early as 1890 but found these were too heavy). The first banding scheme was established in Germany by Johannes Thienemann in 1903 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory on the Baltic Coast of East Prussia. This was followed by Hungary in 1908, Great Britain in 1909 (by Arthur Landsborough Thomson in Aberdeen and Harry Witherby in England), Yugoslavia in 1910 and the Scandinavian countries between 1911 and 1914. [...] Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution is credited with the first modern banding in the U.S.: he banded 23 black-crowned night herons in 1902. Leon J. Cole of the University of Wisconsin founded the American Bird Banding Association in 1909; this organization oversaw banding until the establishment of federal programs in the U.S. (1920) and Canada (1923) pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1918.|$|E

40|$|A <b>method</b> <b>of</b> heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording (HAMR) potentially suitable for probe-based storage systems is characterized. Magnetic marks were formed by a {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) -based thermal magnetic mechanism on a perpendicular CoNi/Pt multilayered film. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) was applied to display those marks. The MFM signal is dependent of the lift-height during MFM scanning: smaller lift-height leads to higher resolution of the MFM image and a double-peak signal line, while higher lift-height leads to lower resolution and a single-peak signal line. Theoretical calculation of the magnetic field from the mark was executed. It agrees well with experiments, and demonstrates the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>mark</b> size measurement in perpendicular media: full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the measured MFM signal. ...|$|R
