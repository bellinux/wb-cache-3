5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. murinus), golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{starts in}} November for Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> at Kirindy Forest; the estrous cycle runs {{approximately}} 22days, while estrus lasts {{only a day}} or less. The mating season in this southern population {{is limited to a}} few weeks, whereas the northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). The northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed, but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are nocturnal lemurs of {{the genus}} Microcebus. Like all <b>lemurs,</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are native to Madagascar.|$|R
500|$|Though giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are {{relatively}} small cheirogaleids, they are {{more than three times}} larger than the smallest members of the family, the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> Their body weight averages [...] At around , their bushy and long tail is longer than their head-body length, which averages [...] Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs (with an intermembral index of 70), a trait shared with <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> The skull {{is similar to that of}} dwarf and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> and the auditory bullae are small.|$|R
500|$|Like other cheirogaleids, {{the dental}} formula for giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> is {{on each side}} of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36teeth. Their upper teeth {{converge}} towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> The first upper premolar (P2) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P3). Unlike <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> and more like dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> have a prominent anterior lower premolar (P2). Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M1–2) have a more anterior hypocone that sits opposite the metacone, compared to the mouse lemurs' more posterior hypocone, which is presumably a symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait. Also on M1 and M2, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small cuspules. In all other dental characteristics, giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are noticeably similar to both dwarf and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before the {{recognition}} {{of more than one}} species, differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> was found in lower densities than the northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> The former range between 30 and 210individuals per square kilometer (250acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086individuals per km2. However, {{in the case of the}} northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced cashew and mango help sustain these higher populations.|$|E
5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} was found with a half-eaten gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> {{are about}} three times larger than <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal <b>lemurs.</b> Giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the anogenital scent gland.|$|R

He has also helped describe three <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus) in 2006 and two more <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> in 2008. He is {{one of the authors of}} Lemurs of Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal <b>lemurs,</b> such as <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> and dwarf lemurs, usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos {{described}} {{a new species}} of giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> the northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.zaza). Their studies compared the morphology, behavioral ecology, and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of specimens from both Kirindy Forest in central-western Madagascar and around Ambato in northwestern Madagascar, part of the Sambirano valley. Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, sociality, and breeding, as well as sufficient genetic distance to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description {{was based on a}} southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{assessed}} both Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and {{the northern}} giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> as endangered. Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. Also, they are both hunted for bushmeat. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests {{were not included in}} the protected area due to existing concessions for mining activities.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{placed in}} the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs), the giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> was moved to its own genus, Mirza, in 1985 due to its larger size, {{morphological}} differences, dental characteristics, and behavior.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are {{considered}} cryptic species - {{with very little}} morphological differences between the various species, but with high genetic diversity. Recent evidence points to differences in their mating calls, which is very diverse. Since <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are nocturnal, {{they might not have}} evolved to look differently, but had evolved various auditory and vocal systems.|$|R
5|$|The gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is {{considered}} one of Madagascar's most abundant small native mammals, found in seven national parks, five special reserves, the Berenty Private Reserve, and other privately protected forests within the Mandena Conservation Zone.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{into its}} own genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E

50|$|Both brown <b>lemurs</b> and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> were {{initially}} divided {{into a small}} number of species, either with no distinguishable subspecies (in the case of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs)</b> or with several distinguishable subspecies (in the case of brown lemurs). With molecular research suggesting a more distant split in both genera, these subspecies or undistinguished populations have been promoted to species status.|$|R

5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gray}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with mouse lemurs, such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|In the aye-aye, the sublingua is not {{shaped like}} a brush like it is in most lemurs. Instead, there is a {{thickened}} area along the plica mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> has a distinct plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have adapted}} to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since making their way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{vary greatly}} in size. They include the {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently {{range in size from}} about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates reproductive schedules {{of brown}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> at Ranomafana, using intensive trapping techniques. The reproductive condition of female <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> was recorded {{on the basis}} of vaginal morphology, vaginal smears, body mass gain profiles and nipple development. Testis size was measured in males throughout the reproductive season. The timing of the first seasonal estrus was determined in frequently captured females over multiple years and it showed individual periodicities close to 365 days, consistent with endogenous regulation and entrainment by photoperiod. The timing of estrus did not correlate with female age or body mass. Males showed testicular regression during the rainy season, although there was high interindividual variation in testes size at any given point during the reproductive season. Furthermore, some individuals completed testicular regression earlier than others. Implications for polyestry are discussed. ^ For comparative purposes, <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> were also trapped at two study sites in the Tsinjoarivo area: one in a forest fragment and the other within continuous forest. These forests are higher in altitude than the main study area at Ranomafana. Trapping success for <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> was lower at Tsinjoarivo than Ranomafana. Albeit preliminary, data from Tsinjoarivo suggest that females have lower reproductive success than do females at Ranomafana. Nevertheless, <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> in the Tsinjoarivo forest fragment {{did not appear to be}} in “poorer” condition than those in the continuous forest. It had been reported in the literature that western gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> captured in secondary forests have lower body masses and lower recapture rates than those captured in primary forest; in fact, the opposite was true of the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> at Tsinjoarivo. ^ I additionally collected data on a larger member of the family Cheirogaleidae, the dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus), which live in sympatry with Microcebus at Ranomafana and Tsinjoarivo. I analyzed the patterns of growth, development and reproduction in Cheirogaleus and Microcebus and compared dwarf and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> to other similarly-sized prosimians which do not undergo torpor or hibernation. These comparisons draw attention to the unusual reproductive and metabolic strategies employed by cheirogaleids to cope with Madagascar’s unpredictable environments, which ultimately define their very unique life histories. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are {{suggested}} to represent promising novel non-human primate models for aging research. However, standardized and cross-taxa cognitive testing methods are still lacking. Touchscreen-based testing procedures have proven high stimulus control and reliability in humans and rodents. The {{aim of this}} study was to adapt these procedures to <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> thereby exploring the effect of age. We measured appetitive learning and cognitive flexibility of two age groups by applying pairwise visual discrimination (PD) and reversal learning (PDR) tasks. On average, <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> needed 24 days of training before starting with the PD task. Individual performances in PD and PDR tasks correlate significantly, suggesting that individual learning performance is unrelated to the respective task. Compared to the young, aged <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> showed impairments in both PD and PDR tasks. They needed significantly more trials to reach the task criteria. A much higher inter-individual variation in old than in young adults was revealed. Furthermore, in the PDR task, we found a significantly higher perseverance in aged compared to young adults, indicating an age-related deficit in cognitive flexibility. This study presents the first touchscreen-based data on the cognitive skills and age-related dysfunction in <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> and provides a unique basis to study mechanisms of inter-individual variation. It furthermore opens exciting perspectives for comparative approaches in aging, personality, and evolutionary research...|$|R
