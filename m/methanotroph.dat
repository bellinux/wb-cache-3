50|$|The Methylocystaceae are {{a family}} of {{bacteria}} {{that are capable of}} obtaining carbon and energy from methane.

50|$|In {{functional}} terms, <b>methanotrophs</b> {{are referred}} to as methane-oxidizing bacteria, however, methane-oxidizing bacteria encompass other organisms that are not regarded as sole <b>methanotrophs.</b> For this reason methane-oxidizing bacteria have been separated into four subgroups: two methane-assimilating bacteria (MAB) groups, the <b>methanotrophs,</b> and two autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB).|$|R

40|$|Sedge-dominated {{wetlands}} on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau are {{methane emission}} centers. <b>Methanotrophs</b> at these sites {{play a role}} in reducing methane emissions, but relatively {{little is known about the}} composition of active <b>methanotrophs</b> in these wetlands. Here, we used DNA stable isotope probing to identify the key active aerobic <b>methanotrophs</b> in three sedge-dominated wetlands on the plateau. We found that Methylocystis species were active in two peatlands, Hongyuan and Dangxiong. Methylobacter species were found to be active only in Dangxiong peat. Hongyuan peat had the highest methane oxidation rate, and cross-feeding of carbon from <b>methanotrophs</b> to methylotrophic Hyphomicrobium species was observed. Owing to a low methane oxidation rate during the incubation, the labeling of <b>methanotrophs</b> in Maduo wetland samples was not detected.

40|$|The soluble MMO (sMMO) gene {{clusters}} {{from group}} I <b>methanotrophs</b> were characterized. An 8. 1 -kb KpnI fragment from Methylomonas sp. strain KSWIII and a 7. 5 -kb SalI fragment from Methylomonas sp. strain KSPIII which contained the sMMO gene clusters were cloned and sequenced. The sequences {{of these two}} fragments were almost identical. The sMMO gene clusters in the fragment consisted of six open reading frames which were 52 to 79 % similar to the corresponding genes of previously described sMMO gene clusters of the group II and group X <b>methanotrophs.</b> The phylogenetic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of sMMO demonstrated that the sMMOs from these strains were closer to that from M. capsulatus Bath in the group X <b>methanotrophs</b> than to those from Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b and Methylocystis sp. strain M in the group II <b>methanotrophs.</b> Based on the sequence data of sMMO genes of our strains and other <b>methanotrophs,</b> we designed a new PCR primer to amplify sMMO gene fragments of all the known <b>methanotrophs</b> harboring the mmoX gene.

40|$|Microorganisms that oxidize {{atmospheric}} methane in soils {{were characterized}} by radioactive labelling with 14 CH 4 followed by analysis of radiolabelled phospholipid ester-linked fatty acids (14 C-PLFAs). The radioactive fingerprinting technique {{was used to compare}} active <b>methanotrophs</b> in soil samples from Greenland, Denmark, the United States, and Brazil. The 14 C-PLFA fingerprints indicated that closely related methanotrophic bacteria were responsible for the oxidation of atmospheric methane in the soils. Significant amounts of labelled PLFAs produced by the unknown soil <b>methanotrophs</b> coeluted with a group of fatty acids that included i 17 : 0, a 17 : 0, and 17 : 1 ω 8 c (up to 9. 0 % of the total 14 C-PLFAs). These PLFAs are not known to be significant constituents of methanotrophic bacteria. The major PLFAs of the soil <b>methanotrophs</b> (73. 5 to 89. 0 % of the total PLFAs) coeluted with 18 : 1 and 18 : 0 fatty acids (e. g., 18 : 1 ω 9, 18 : 1 ω 7, and 18 : 0). The 14 C-PLFAs fingerprints of the soil <b>methanotrophs</b> that oxidized atmospheric methane did not change after long-term methane enrichment at 170 ppm CH 4. The 14 C-PLFA fingerprints of the soil <b>methanotrophs</b> were different from the PLFA profiles of type I and type II methanotrophic bacteria described previously. Some similarity at the PLFA level was observed between the unknown soil <b>methanotrophs</b> and the PLFA phenotype of the type II <b>methanotrophs.</b> <b>Methanotrophs</b> in Arctic, temperate, and tropical regions assimilated between 20 and 54 % of the atmospheric methane that was metabolized. The lowest relative assimilation (percent) was observed for <b>methanotrophs</b> in agricultural soil, whereas the highest assimilation was observed for <b>methanotrophs</b> in rain forest soil. The results suggest that <b>methanotrophs</b> with relatively high carbon conversion efficiencies and very similar PLFA compositions dominate atmospheric methane metabolism in different soils. The characteristics of the methane metabolism and the 14 C-PLFA fingerprints excluded any significant role of autotrophic ammonia oxidizers in the metabolism of atmospheric methane...|$|R
5000|$|Forest soils act as good sinks for {{atmospheric}} methane because {{soils are}} optimally moist for <b>methanotroph</b> activity, {{and the movement}} of gases between soil and atmosphere (soil diffusivity) is high.

50|$|A {{particular}} {{strain of}} M. scandinavica called SR5 was isolated and characterized. M. scandinavica is a Gram-negative bacterium that exhibits pink, rod-shaped colonies. They possess a single, polar flagellum used for motility. This species of Methylomonas is an obligate <b>methanotroph.</b> It is also psychrophilic.

40|$|<b>Methanotrophs</b> {{were present}} in 48 of 225 stone samples which were removed from 19 {{historical}} buildings in Germany and Italy. The average cell number of <b>methanotrophs</b> was 20 CFU per g of stone, and their activities ranged between 11 and 42 pmol of CH 4 g of stone− 1 day− 1. Twelve strains of methane-oxidizing bacteria were isolated. They belonged to the type II <b>methanotrophs</b> of the genera Methylocystis, Methylosinus, and Methylobacterium. In masonry, growth substrates like methane or methanol are available in very low concentrations. To determine if methane could be produced by the stone at rates sufficient to support growth of <b>methanotrophs,</b> methane production by stone samples under nonoxic conditions was examined. Methane production of 0. 07 to 215 nmol of CH 4 g of stone− 1 day− 1 was detected in 23 of 47 stone samples examined. This indicated {{the presence of the}} so-called “mini-methane”-producing bacteria and/or methanogenic archaea. <b>Methanotrophs</b> occurred in nearly all samples which showed methane production.

40|$|Methane-utilizing {{bacteria}} (<b>methanotrophs)</b> are {{a diverse}} group of gram-negative bacteria that are related to other members of the Proteobacteria. These bacteria are classified into three groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other physiological and morphological features. The type I and type X <b>methanotrophs</b> are found within the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria and employ the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II <b>methanotrophs,</b> which employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, form a coherent cluster within the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous. The growth of type II bacteria appears to be favored in environments that contain relatively high levels of methane, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and limiting concentrations of combined nitrogen and/or copper. Type I <b>methanotrophs</b> appear to be dominant in environments in which methane is limiting and combined nitrogen and copper levels are relatively high. These bacteria serve as biofilters for the oxidation of methane produced in anaerobic environments, and when oxygen is present in soils, atmospheric methane is oxidized. Their activities in nature are greatly influenced by agricultural practices and other human activities. Recent evidence indicates that naturally occurring, uncultured <b>methanotrophs</b> represent new genera. <b>Methanotrophs</b> that are capable of oxidizing methane at atmospheric levels exhibit methane oxidation kinetics different from those of <b>methanotrophs</b> available in pure cultures. A limited number of <b>methanotrophs</b> have the genetic capacity to synthesize a soluble methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the rapid oxidation of environmental pollutants including trichloroethylene...|$|R
5000|$|Methylotrophs are {{a diverse}} group of {{microorganisms}} that can use reduced one-carbon compounds, such as methanol or methane, as the carbon source for their growth; and multi-carbon compounds that contain no carbon bonds, such as dimethyl ether and dimethylamine.

[...] These organisms {{should not be confused with}} methanogens which on the contrary produce methane as a by-product from various one-carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide.Some methylotrophs can degrade the greenhouse gas methane, and in this case they are called methanotrophs.

50|$|Methanobactin (mb) is a {{class of}} Mcopper-binding and {{reducing}} uchromophoric peptides initially identified in the <b>methanotroph</b> Methylococcus capsulatus Bath - and later in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b - during {{the isolation of the}} membrane-associated or particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). It is thought to be secreted to the extracellular media to recruit copper, a critical component of methane monooxygenase, the first enzyme in the series that catalyzes the oxidation of methane into methanol. Methanobactin functions as a chalkophore, similar to iron siderophores, by binding to Cu(II) or Cu(I) then shuttling the copper into the cell. Methanobactin has an extremely high affinity for binding and Cu(I) with a Kd approximating ~1020 M−1 at pH 8. Additionally, methanobactin can reduce Cu(II), which is toxic to cells, to Cu(I), the form used in pMMO. Moreover, different species of methanobactin are hypothesized to be ubiquitous within the biosphere, {{especially in light of the}} discovery of molecules produced by other type II methanotrophs that similarly bind and reduce copper (II) to copper (I).|$|E
50|$|In June 2006 Kalyuzhaya et al. {{published}} a paper (“Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization-Flow Cytometry-Cell Sorting-Based Method for Separation and Enrichment of Type I and Type II <b>Methanotroph</b> Populations”) detailing more precise methods for separating organisms of interests within a natural sample. Their experiment focused on separating Type I and Type II Methanotrophs using combined techniques of FISH/FC (fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry) and FACS (fluorescence-activated FC analysis and cell sorting). FISH/FC employs oligonucleotide attached to florescein, or Alexa for targeting 16S rRNA. The fluoresced microbe {{can then be}} subjected to analysis and cell sorting. The detection phase involves putting the detected sample to “functional gene analysis to indicate specific separation using 16S rRNA, pmoA (encoding a subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase), and fae (encoding formaldehyde activating enzyme) genes.” The data indicate that FISH/FC/FACS is a method that can “provide significant enrichment of microbial populations of interest from complex natural communities.” Lastly, Kalyuzhaya et al. tested the reliability of whole genome amplification (WGA) using limited numbers of sorted cells. They found that WGA would give more “specific” results if a rough threshold number of 10^4 or more cells are in a sample. Having proven FISH/FC/FACS’ effectiveness to detect microbial populations, Kalyuzhay et al. used mixed samples of M. flagellatus along {{with other members of}} the methylotrophs genus to test their method’s effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of methane produced during decomposition of landfill waste can be oxidized in landfill cover soil by methane-oxidizing bacteria (<b>methanotrophs)</b> thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The identity of active <b>methanotrophs</b> in Roscommon landfill cover soil, a slightly acidic peat soil, was assessed by DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP). Landfill cover soil slurries were incubated with (13) C-labelled methane and under either nutrient-rich nitrate mineral salt medium or water. The identity of active <b>methanotrophs</b> was revealed by analysis of (13) C-labelled DNA fractions. The diversity of functional genes (pmoA and mmoX) and 16 S rRNA genes was analyzed using clone libraries, microarrays and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. 16 S rRNA gene analysis revealed that the cover soil was mainly dominated by Type II <b>methanotrophs</b> {{closely related to the}} genera Methylocella and Methylocapsa and to Methylocystis species. These results were supported by analysis of mmoX genes in (13) C-DNA. Analysis of pmoA gene diversity indicated that a significant proportion of active bacteria were also closely related to the Type I <b>methanotrophs,</b> Methylobacter and Methylomonas species.

40|$|<b>Methanotrophs</b> are a {{group of}} phylogenetically diverse {{microorganisms}} characterized by their ability to utilize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. Early studies suggested that growth on methane could be stimulated {{with the addition of}} some small organic acids, but initial efforts to find facultative <b>methanotrophs,</b> i. e., <b>methanotrophs</b> able to utilize compounds with carbon–carbon bonds as sole growth substrates were inconclusive. Recently, however, facultative <b>methanotrophs</b> in the genera Methylocella, Methylocapsa, and Methylocystis have been reported that can grow on acetate, as well as on larger organic acids or ethanol for some species. All identified facultative <b>methanotrophs</b> group within the Alphaproteobacteria and utilize the serine cycle for carbon assimilation from formaldehyde. It is possible that facultative <b>methanotrophs</b> are able to convert acetate into intermediates of the serine cycle (e. g. malate and glyoxylate), because a variety of acetate assimilation pathways convert acetate into these compounds (e. g. the glyoxylate shunt of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the ethylmalonyl‐CoA pathway, the citramalate cycle, and the methylaspartate cycle). In this review, we summarize the history of facultative methanotrophy, describe scenarios for the basis of facultative methanotrophy, and pose several topics for future research in this area...|$|R

Correlation analysis between soil abiotic parameters (total C, N, NH 4 +, NO 3 - and water content) and distribution of methanotrophs revealed a lack of conclusive evidence for any distinct correlation pattern between measured abiotic parameters and <b>methanotroph</b> community structure, suggesting that complex interactions of several physico-chemical parameters shape <b>methanotroph</b> diversity and activity in landfill cover soils...|$|E

A diagnostic microarray based on the particulate methane monooxygenase gene coupled with geostatistics was used to analyze spatial patterns of <b>methanotrophs</b> in the littoral wetland of a eutrophic boreal lake (Lake Kevätön, Eastern Finland). The wetland had a hydrology gradient with mean water table varying from − 8 cm to − 25 cm.

We used the pmoA gene as marker for <b>methanotroph</b> diversity in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, microarray and pyrosequencing approaches. We could observe a significant increase of -diversity with geographical distance across continents (12000 km).

Furthermore, we performed an in-depth analysis of type II <b>methanotroph</b> pmoA distribution at the sequence level. We used ordination analysis to project sequence dissimilarities into a three-dimensional space (multidimensional scaling). The ordination suggests that type II methanotrophs in paddy fields can be divided into five major groups.

Three Gleysols were incubated under different mixing ratios of 13 C-labelled methane to examine 13 C incorporation into phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Phospholipid fatty acids typical of type II <b>methanotrophs,</b> 16 : 0 and 18 : 17 c, were labelled with 13 C in all soils after incubation under an atmosphere containing 30 ppmv of methane. Incubation under 500 ppmv of methane resulted in labelling of additional PLFAs besides 16 : 0 and 18 : 17 c, suggesting that {{the composition of the}} active methanotrophic community changed in response to increased methane supply. In two soils, 16 : 1 PLFAs typical of type I <b>methanotrophs</b> were strongly labelled after incubation under the high methane mixing ratio only. Type II <b>methanotrophs</b> are most likely responsible for atmospheric methane uptake in these soils, while type I <b>methanotrophs</b> become active when methane is produced in the soil. ...|$|R
