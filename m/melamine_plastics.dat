40|$|The {{opinion is}} a review {{examines}} {{the health risks}} {{associated with the use}} of melamine-formaldehyde plastics for the manufacture of products intended for contact with foodstuffs – table ware and kitchen utensils. As a result of incomplete course of polycondensation processes in the production of polymer, as well scratches the surfaces during the technology of the products, the use of these utensils is often accompanied by increased migration of melamine and formaldehyde in food. The review traces the influence of various factors (temperature, time, pH of the medium, unproper use, surface roughness, wear, etc) on possible migration of both monomers in food products stored or contact with such ware. Information is provided about existing health risk when using poor quality melamine products or use them in unsuitable conditions. Chemical and toxicological characteristics of two monomers are also discussed. The opinion reports the results of the first survey of the Bulgarian market on the migration of formaldehyde and melamine from Chinese melamine-ware. For 3 years samples have been tested to see whether the Specific Migration Limits (SML) for formaldehyde and melamine are being observed. The food simulant 3 % aqueous acetic acid was used as this is the most aggressive simulant towards <b>melamine</b> <b>plastics.</b> The test conditions used depended on the labeling but mainly were repeated exposure to the simulant for 2 hours at 70 °C. Migration of formaldehyde was detected in 2011 in 53 % from the samples and the levels were clearly above the legal maximum at 2 - 10 times the SML...|$|E

40|$|Comparability {{of results}} is an {{important}} feature of the measurements carried out for official controls purposes. In the area of food contact materials and articles comparability of results {{is dependent on the}} availability of samples representative of the consignment, the type of exposure and the test conditions used {{as well as on the}} performance of the method of analysis. These guidelines contain practical information on sampling, migration testing and methodologies for the analytical determination of primary aromatic amines and of formaldehyde. These guidelines were developed specifically in the context of the Regulation 284 / 2011 laying down specific conditions and detailed procedures for the import of polyamide and <b>melamine</b> <b>plastic</b> kitchenware originating in or consigned from [the] People's Republic of China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Union Reference Laboratory in collaboration with its EU official Network of National Reference Laboratories and have been endorsed by the European Commission competent service DG Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) and its network of Member State Competent Authorities. They are primarily addressed to official control laboratories, national reference laboratories and third party laboratories for providing certificates of compliance.

5000|$|In March 2007, after {{numerous}} animals {{fell ill}} and died during quality-control tests, the company recalled over 60 million containers of food. Subsequent to the recall, the Animal Health Laboratory at the University of Guelph in Ontario, identified contaminants {{in some of}} the recalled food: aminopterin (a chemical used as rat poison), <b>melamine</b> (a <b>plastic</b> precursor that may also be used as a fertiliser), and cyanuric acid (which is commonly used to stabilise chlorine in swimming pools). If consumed by themselves, isolated doses of melamine or cyanuric acid should not cause health issues in pets. However, when these two chemicals are mixed together, an insoluble crystal is formed, that can rapidly obstruct the kidneys and cause renal failure. The incident has been labelled [...] "one of the largest consumer-product recalls in North American history".|$|R

The eggs contained 4.7 ppm (part per million) of melamine, compared to the government imposed legal limit of 2.5 ppm for melamine in food. It is thought that the eggs became contaminated after the chickens which laid them were fed tainted feed. Melamine is commonly added to food to increase the apparent protein content. The practice is illegal.|$|R
5000|$|Wright {{designed}} several popular {{lines of}} Melmac <b>melamine</b> resin <b>plastic</b> dinnerware {{for the home}} and did early research on plastic Melmac dinnerware for restaurant use. Wright's first Melmac line of plastic dinnerware for the home, called [...] "Residential" [...] was manufactured by Northern Plastic Company of Boston, MA beginning in 1953. [...] "Residential" [...] received the Museum of Modern Art Good Design Award in 1953. Also [...] "Residential" [...] {{was one of the}} most popular Melmac lines with gross sales of over $4 million in 1957. The line remained popular for many years continuing in production by Home Decorators, Inc. of Newark, NY. Wright introduced his Melmac dinnerware line called [...] "Flair" [...] in 1959. One of the patterns of [...] "Flair", called [...] "Ming Lace" [...] has the actual leaves of the Chinese jade orchid tree tinted and embedded inside the translucent plastic. As with his ceramic dinnerware, Wright began designing his Melmac only in solid colors, but by the end of the 1950s created several patterns ornamented with decoration, usually depicting plant forms.|$|R

The new library and academic learning centre, {{designed by}} Shore Tilbe Irwin + Partners and named after Mississauga's mayor, Hazel McCallion, opened October 8, 2006, and the new Recreation, Athletics and Wellness Centre, also by Shore Tilbe, opened less than a month previous to that. The new library consists of four floors with a mixture of group study tables and individual silent study space.|$|R
40|$|The {{resistive}} plate chamber (RPC) {{has good}} time and position resolution; these factors (coupled to its simple construction) make it an attractive candidate for muon trigger systems at future colliders. However, operated in spark mode, the RPC has severe rate problems that make it unusable above 10 Hz/cm*. We have previously published our results concerning {{the operation of the}} RPC in spark and in avalanche mode; we have shown that the rate limit can be increased to 150 Hz/cm 2 if the RPC is operated in avalanche mode. Here, we discuss the performance of chambers with 6 and 8 mm gas gaps (compared to the more usual 2 mm gap). We outline the reasons for this choice, and also discuss anode versus cathode strip readout. We have measured the efficiency versus flux, and also show that an enhanced rate limit can be obtained if only a small region of the chamber is exposed to the beam (spot illumination). Finally we have tested the performance of chambers constructed with other materials for the resistive plate and compare it to chambers constructed with our preferred <b>plastic,</b> <b>melamine</b> laminate. 1...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{design of}} noise control {{treatments}} can have significant positive impacts {{not only on}} the acoustical performance of the treatment, but also in terms of optimizing cost and weight. A key component in the efficient design of a treatment is a clear understanding of the acoustical performance of the treatment components: i. e., the acoustic impedance of not only the absorbent material, but also of any facings applied and the mounting method employed. As <b>melamine</b> foam, and <b>plastic</b> foams in general, are commonly used in a range of noise control applications, from building treatments to aircraft fuselage liners, a detailed understanding of the acoustical performance of these poroelastic materials is important to the design of noise control treatments. Models based on the Biot theory have been widely applied to predict the acoustical properties of poroelastic materials: i. e., materials consisting of an elastic matrix (the frame) forming pores that are filled with an interstitial fluid. Over the years, many authors have provided improvements to terms in the Biot theory which allow for more accurate prediction of acoustical properties through improved representation of the oscillating fluid flow through microstructures of complicated geometry. However, though it is widely known that plastic foams exhibit viscoelastic behavior when subject to static and dynamic loading, the solid phase properties, namely the shear modulus, typically employed in Biot-based poroelastic models are assumed to be linear elastic with the damping represented by a hysteretic loss factor which has no explicit frequency dependence. In this work, the influence of a foam 2 ̆ 7 s solid phase properties on the acoustical performance is explored through model predictions using both linear elastic and viscoelastic definitions for the shear modulus. These predictions are then compared to standing wave tube measurements of melamine foam samples subject to a range of boundary conditions which represent different facing and mounting conditions for the foam that are typically used in noise control treatments. It was found that the boundary condition configurations serve to change the relative influence of the solid and fluid phases in terms of intensity distribution. For boundary condition configurations where the majority of the intensity is carried by the fluid phase, model predictions tended to match fairly well with measurements. However, for boundary condition configurations where the intensity is carried largely by the frame, not only is prediction accuracy diminished, but measurements also become much more sensitive to factors such as sample fit in the impedance tube. The modification of the stiffness term from a linear elastic to a viscoelastic form does {{have an effect on the}} predicted absorption coefficients, but only in boundary condition configurations where the bulk of the wave motion is carried by the solid phase rather than the fluid phase. ...|$|R
