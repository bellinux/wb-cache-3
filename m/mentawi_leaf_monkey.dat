40|$|Hose’s <b>leaf</b> <b>monkey</b> Presbytis hosei is {{endemic to}} Borneo and occurs only in tall forest. In recent decades Borneo {{has lost a}} large part of its forest cover, mostly in low-lying coastal regions. Large intact tracts of forest remain in the interior, but these are by and large {{inhabited}} by tribes that subsist in part by hunting. The combined effects of habitat disturbance and hunting on the densities and biomass of Hose’s <b>leaf</b> <b>monkey</b> were studied in Kayan Mentarang National Park in Borneo’s far interior. Over four months, data on densities and hunting were collected by transect walks in four forest types. Hose’s <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> were hunted to deter crop-raiding, for their meat, and to obtain bezoar stones (visceral secretions used in traditional medicine). Hose’s <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> occurred in single male groups of 7 - 8 individuals in densities from 0. 8 to 2. 3 groups km- 2. Densities of Hose’s <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> were positively correlated with certain vegetation characteristics, e. g. tree height and height of first bough, and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest village. Biomass of Hose’s <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> declined considerably as a result of habitat disturbance and hunting from 92 kg km- 2 in primary hill forest inside the reserve to 38 kg km- 2 in old secondary forest and 31 kg km- 2 in young secondary forest near villages.

40|$|Numerous morphology-based {{classification}} schemes {{have been}} proposed for langurs and <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> of South Asia but {{there is very little}} agreement between them. An incorrect classification scheme when used as a basis for biogeographic studies can support erroneous hypotheses. Further, lack of taxonomic resolution will also confound conservation efforts, given that conservation biologists use traditional morphology-based-classification schemes to prioritize species for conservation. Here, I have revisited recent molecular phylogenetic studies done on langurs and <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> of South Asia. Results from these studies are in turn used to derive a rational and scientific basis for prioritizing species for conservation. Molecular data support the classification of langurs of the Indian subcontinent-Hanuman, Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs-in the genus Semnopithecus, whereas Phayre's <b>leaf</b> <b>monkey</b> along with other Southeast Asian <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> form another distinct clade (Trachypithecus). The phylogenetic position of capped and golden langurs remains unresolved. Molecular data suggest that they are closely related to each other but this group might have evolved through past hybridization between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. Additionally, genetic data also support the splitting of the so-called Hanuman langurs into at least three species. The scores for taxonomic uniqueness of langurs and <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> of South Asia were revised using this molecular phylogeny-based classification. According to the revised scores, Phayres <b>leaf</b> <b>monkey</b> and golden langur are priority species for conservation followed by capped and Nilgiri langurs...|$|R

40|$|A recent phylogenetic {{study of}} langurs and <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> of South Asia {{suggested}} a reticulate evolution of capped and golden <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> through ancient hybridization between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. To test this hybridization scenario, I analysed nuclear {{copies of the}} mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (numts) from capped, golden and Phayre's <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys.</b> These numts were aligned with mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of various species belonging to the genera Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. In the phylogenetic tree derived from this alignment, the numts fell into three distinct clades (A, B and C) suggesting three independent integration events. Clade A was basal to Semnopithecus, and clades B and C were basal to Trachypithecus. Among the numts in clades A and C were sequences derived from species not represented in their respective sister mitochondrial groups. This unusual placement of certain numts is taken as additional support for the hybridization scenario. Based on the molecular dating of these integration events, hybridization is estimated to have occurred around 7. 1 to 3. 4 million years ago. Capped and golden <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{might have to be}} assigned to a new genus to reconcile their unique evolutionary history.

The main objective is to investigate the daily activity budget of T. obscurus in the field. Scanning sampling was employed as the observation method from June 2006 to December 2006. Behavioral observation of 18 individuals were conducted for 8 hours per day, from 0700 h to 1630 h. On average, T. obscurus spent most of their time on feeding (40. 02 %), followed by the resting (23. 96 %), moving (22. 51 %), autogrooming (6. 52 %), vocalization (3. 89 %), allogrooming (1. 33 %), allomothering (0. 97 %) and the least in playing (0. 80 %).

40|$|Diet {{and habitat}} {{overlaps}} were studied for the <b>leaf</b> <b>monkey</b> (Presbytis rubicunda) and bornean white-bearded gibbons (Hylobates albibarbis) in tropical forest of Cabang Panti Research Station (CPRS), Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan. Systematic data on feeding and ranging behaviour {{were collected from}} August 2009 up to February 2010 for the three groups of two sympatric primate species that shared two neighbouring patches. Our results showed that seven types of habitat in CPRS were affected to both primates, particularly in plant utilization for feed {{and the use of}} vertical space patterns. If the <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> were present in the same forest patch, the Bornean white-bearded gibbons showed a reduced within-group dispersal and significantly less foraging time in a given forest patch. This might be due to the bornean white-bearded gibbons were more selective in their diet selection. When fruits were scarce, bornean white-bearded gibbons spent most of their foraging time in many types of forest ecosystem, while <b>leaf</b> <b>monkey</b> foraged within one or two types of forest ecosystem. At this period, diet and habitat overlaps between the two species were low. When the availability of fruits increased, <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> shifted their foraging range and both species became confined to the forest habitat. Consequently, the overlaps of diets and habitats were increased while the peak {{was at the end of}} the fruit season...|$|R

40|$|The two {{recently}} proposed taxonomies of the langurs and <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Subfamily Colobinae) provide different implications to {{our understanding}} of the evolution of Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs. Groves (2001) [Groves, C. P., 2001. Primate Taxonomy. Smithsonian Institute Press, Washington], placed Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs in the genus Trachypithecus, thereby suggesting disjunct distribution of the genus Trachypithecus. [Brandon-Jones, D., Eudey, A. A., Geissmann, T., Groves, C. P., Melnick, D. J., Morales, J. C., Shekelle, M., Stewart, C. -B., 2003. Asian primate classification. Int. J. Primatol. 25, 97 – 162] placed these langurs in the genus Semnopithecus, which suggests convergence of morphological characters in Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs with Trachypithecus. To test these scenarios, we sequenced and analyzed the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and two nuclear DNA-encoded genes, lysozyme and protamine P 1, from a variety of colobine species. All three markers support the clustering of Nilgiri and purple-faced langurs with Hanuman langur (Semnopithecus), while <b>leaf</b> <b>monkeys</b> of Southeast Asian (Trachypithecus) form a distinct clade.
