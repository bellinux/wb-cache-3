40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, through {{investigating}} {{a series of}} liquid, glassy, and crystalline samples with ultrafast multiple-mode 2 D IR and IR transient absorption methods, we demonstrated that the signal anisotropy of vibrational relaxation-induced heat effects is determined by both relative <b>molecular</b> <b>orientations</b> and <b>molecular</b> rotations. If the relative <b>molecular</b> <b>orientations</b> are randomized or molecular rotations are fast compared to heat transfer, the signal anisotropy of heat effects is zero. If the relative <b>molecular</b> <b>orientations</b> are anisotropic and the molecular rotations are slow, the signal anisotropy of heat effects can be nonzero, which {{is determined by the}} relative orientations of the energy source mode and the heat sensor mode within the same molecule and in different molecules. We also demonstrated that the correlation between the anisotropy value of heat signal and the relative <b>molecular</b> <b>orientations</b> can be quantitatively calculated. 1...|$|R

Here, we propose “constrained single-particle tomography” as a general strategy for 3 D structure determination in cryo-EM. A key component of our approach is the effective use of images recorded in tilt series to extract high-resolution information and correct for the contrast transfer function. By incorporating geometric constraints into the refinement to improve orientational accuracy of images, we reduce model bias and overrefinement artifacts and demonstrate that protein structures can be determined at resolutions of ∼ 8  Å starting from low-dose tomographic tilt series...|$|R

5000|$|Just as bulk second {{harmonic}} generation, surface SHG arises {{out of the}} second-order susceptibility tensor χ(2). While the χ(2) tensor contains 27 elements, many of these elements are reduced by symmetry arguments. The exact nature of these arguments depends on the application. When determining <b>molecular</b> <b>orientation,</b> {{it is assumed that}} χ(2) [...] is rotationally invariant around the z-axis (normal to the surface). The number of tensor elements reduces from 27 to the following 7 independent quantities: χZZZ, χZXX = χZYY, χXZX = χYZY, χXXZ = χYYZ, χXYZ = -χYXZ, χXZY = -χYZX, χZXY = -χZYX. Second Harmonic Generation further restricts the independent terms by requiring the tensor is symmetric in the last two indices reducing the number of independent tensor terms to 4: χZZZ, χZXX (equivalently χZYY), χXXZ (equivalently χXZX, χYZY, χYYZ), χXYZ (equivalently χXZY, -χYXZ, -χYZX). In order for χZXY = -χZYX to hold under this final condition, both terms must be 0. The four independent terms are material dependent properties and can vary as the external conditions change. These four terms give rise to the {{second harmonic}} signal, and allow for calculation of material properties such as electronic structure, atomic organization, and <b>molecular</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E
