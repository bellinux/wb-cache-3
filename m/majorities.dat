5|$|Two {{governors}} {{who have}} vetoed NPVIC legislation, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Linda Lingle of Hawaii, both in 2007, {{objected to the}} compact {{on the grounds that}} it could require their states' electoral votes to be awarded to a candidate who did not win a majority in their state. (Both states have since enacted laws joining the compact.) Supporters of the compact counter that under a national popular vote system, state-level <b>majorities</b> are irrelevant; in any state, votes cast contribute to the nationwide tally, which determines the winner. The preferences of individual voters are thus paramount, while state-level <b>majorities</b> are an obsolete intermediary measure.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive <b>majorities,</b> (although in 1955 his government received barely more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E

50|$|Either of the Condorcet loser {{criterion}} or {{the mutual}} <b>majority</b> criterion implies the <b>majority</b> loser criterion. However, the Condorcet criterion {{does not imply}} the <b>majority</b> loser criterion, since the minimax method satisfies the Condorcet but not the <b>majority</b> loser criterion. Also, the <b>majority</b> criterion is logically independent from the <b>majority</b> loser criterion, since the plurality rule satisfies the <b>majority</b> but not the <b>majority</b> loser criterion, and the anti-plurality rule satisfies the <b>majority</b> loser but not the <b>majority</b> criterion. There is no positional scoring rule which satisfies both the <b>majority</b> and the <b>majority</b> loser criterion, but several non-positional rules, including many Condorcet rules, do satisfy both criteria.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, {{federal courts}} could not {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate <b>majorities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pablo and Mandel {{aimed to}} counter the {{opposition}} of the <b>majorities</b> inside the British Revolutionary Communist Party and French Internationalist Communist Party. Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out their leaderships. They supported Gerry Healy's opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including Pierre Frank and Marcel Bleibtreu, opposed to the new leadership of the PCI albeit for differing reasons.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on his belief in the {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution. He came to see the actions of the anti-New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess; in his view, the Court was improperly overturning legislation that had been passed by large <b>majorities</b> in Congress.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{statistics}} of 1889, there were 57.8% Lithuanians, 19.1% Poles, and 3.5% Belarusians in the Suwałki Governorate. It is {{generally agreed that}} Lithuanians formed the majority population in the northern Suwałki Governorate, while Poles were concentrated in south. But, Lithuanian and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over {{the location of the}} line that separated the Lithuanian from the Polish <b>majorities.</b> Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by Lithuanians, while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite. The German census of 1916 showed that 51% of Sejny population was Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} <b>majorities</b> {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, {{attempted}} to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
50|$|In the Senate, the <b>majority</b> whip is the third-highest ranking {{individual}} in the <b>majority</b> party (the party with the most seats). The <b>majority</b> whip is outranked by the <b>majority</b> leader and, unofficially, the president pro tempore; because the office of president pro tempore is largely honorific and usually given to the longest-serving senator of the <b>majority,</b> the <b>majority</b> whip is in reality the second-ranking senator in the <b>majority</b> conference in terms of actual power. Similarly, in the House, the <b>majority</b> whip is outranked by both the <b>majority</b> leader and the speaker. Unlike the Senate's presiding officer, the Speaker {{is the leader of}} his or her party's caucus in the House.|$|R

5|$|Barkley won the August 6 {{election}} {{by a vote}} of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of Kentucky's 120 counties, with large <b>majorities</b> in western Kentucky, the city of Louisville, and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, the {{economic}} climate {{in the state}} had improved significantly. Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old Court support, {{two of the four}} New Court justices resigned. Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals, all of whom ignored or rejected them. John Telemachus Johnson finally accepted the appointment in April 1826, and the New Court met with only three justices during its 1826 term. In the August 1826 elections, the Old Court Party won <b>majorities</b> of 5644 in the House and 2216 in the Senate. Desha again encouraged the legislators to compromise to resolve the court impasse. The Old Court <b>majorities</b> in both houses, however, completely repudiated the New Court, passing a bill to restore the Old Court and overturn all legislation related to the New Court. Desha vetoed the bill, and scolded the legislators for passing a blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure. The General Assembly overrode Desha's veto on January 1, 1827. In a conciliatory move, the Senate confirmed Desha's appointment of George M. Bibb, a New Court partisan, to a position on the re-empowered Old Court after John Boyle resigned to accept a federal judgeship in November 1826.|$|E
5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress from the Democrats {{for the first time}} since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican <b>majorities</b> – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary {{issue in the}} campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, while Sampson opposed it. A political machine known as the Jockey Club backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small <b>majorities.</b> The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote swapping had occurred to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|The Tories {{had last}} governed Canada under R.B. Bennett, {{who had been}} elected in 1930. Bennett's {{government}} had limited success {{in dealing with the}} Depression, and was defeated in 1935, as Liberal William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had previously served two times as Prime Minister, was restored to power. The Liberals won five consecutive <b>majorities</b> between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked closely with the civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} annexation of Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple <b>majorities</b> in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E

5|$|The {{passage of}} the Act in the Irish Parliament was {{ultimately}} achieved with substantial <b>majorities,</b> having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes. Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at Westminster in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by Robert Emmet's failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.|$|E

5|$|After his {{election}} to parliament in 1934, Davies was a consistent {{advocate for the}} interests of Merthyr Tydfil and the Welsh mining community. Largely indifferent to party discipline, he defied official Labour policy by championing such causes as disarmament and Welsh nationalism. His persistence in doing so brought him several suspensions from the party, and he was never offered ministerial office. An immensely popular figure locally, he was regularly returned at general elections with large <b>majorities.</b> In 1966, after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan {{with the loss of}} 144 lives, Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe. He had not reported his suspicions, for fear that an inquiry would cause the closures of local pits. Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph, Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more.|$|E
