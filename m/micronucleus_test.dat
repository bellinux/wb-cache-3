50|$|The <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests</b> provide {{important}} {{information about a}} chemical's ability to interfere with chromosome structure and function. For instance, many known human carcinogens test positive in mammalian <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests.</b> In these tests, organisms are treated with a chemical and the resulting frequency of micronucleated calls is measured. If there is a marked {{increase in the number}} of cells with micronuclei, it can be concluded that the chemical induces structural and/or numerical chromosomal damage. Since <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests</b> must be performed on actively dividing cells, bone marrow stem cells and the erythrocytes they produce through cell divisions are ideal candidates. These cells experience constant, rapid turnover and the lack of a true nucleus in erythrocytes makes micronuclei easily visible under a microscope.|$|R
40|$|The {{genotoxic}} effect of methyl parathion, an organophos-phorus insecticide commercially available as Metacid 50, was studied in Swiss albino mice using bone marrow and peripheral blood <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests.</b> Single acute oral {{doses of the}} insecticide at concentrations of 75. 0, 37. 5, 18. 75 and 9. 375 mg/kg body weight, equivalent to 1 / 2 LD 50, 1 / 4 LD^, 1 / 8 LD 50 and 1 / 16 LD^, administered to female mice, elicited positive responses in bone marrow and peripheral blood <b>micronuclei</b> <b>tests.</b> Statistically significant increases {{in the frequency of}} micronuclei were observed at higher doses in both the tests performed. The data obtained for our experiments suggest that methyl parathion is a potent mutagen and so it is also likely to have a {{genotoxic effect}} in humans...|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analyses}} were performed using SAS JMP version 11.0 (SAS Institute). Mortality and hatching rates in the FET were analyzed by Cox’s proportional hazards analysis. The developmental failure rate of zebrafish embryos at 96  hpf (hours post-fertilization) was analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. The significance level was set to α =  0.05. To correct for multiple testing, the Holm–Bonferroni method was applied to adjust the significance levels. Data from the <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests</b> were tested with a paired t test.

40|$|The high {{toxicity}} of diesel components makes oil spills {{a threat to}} the biota in coastal marine environments. The genotoxic effect of the diesel water-soluble fraction (DWSF) on Hippocampus reidi (Ginsburg, 1933) was assessed. Fish were exposed to three different DWSF dilutions for up to 96 hours, and genotoxicity was analyzed using the <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test</b> and the comet assay. The <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test</b> revealed no significant differences between any of the DWSF dilutions and the control in the 24 -hours period; however, micronuclei increased in fish exposed to 1 : 500 and 1 : 100 DWSF dilutions for 96 hours. For all dilutions, there was an increase in micronuclei in fish exposed for 96 hours when compared to those exposed for 24 hours. The tested dilutions increased frequencies of cell classes 2 (medium damage) and 3 (large damage) in the comet assay after 24 and 96 hours. Fish exposed to DWSF 1 : 100 exhibited a higher frequency of class 4 (apoptosis) cells in the 96 -hours period. All dilutions increased the comet score when compared to the control at 24 and 96 hours. The <b>micronuclei</b> and comet <b>tests</b> were efficient in detecting DWSF genotoxic effects in H. reidi...|$|R
40|$|A {{report is}} {{presented}} on {{the advantages of}} the rapid interphase chromosome assay (RICA) and the difficulties that may be met while implementing this method for application in biological dosimetry. The RICA test can be applied on unstimulated human lymphocytes; this is an advantage in comparison with the dicentric chromosomes or <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests.</b> In the former two tests, stimulated lymphocytes are examined and hence, 48 h more are needed to obtain cells traversing the cell cycle. Due to the use of unstimulated nondividing cells, higher numbers of cells are available for RICA analysis than for dicentric chromosomes or <b>micronuclei</b> <b>tests.</b> Moreover, the method can be applied after exposure to ionizing radiation doses in excess of 5 Gy. Such doses cause a significant cell cycle delay or result in the loss of G 2 phase and mitotic cells because of apoptosis. Therefore, the traditional biodosimetry based on the evaluation of the incidence of damage to chromosomes is very difficult to carry out. This is {{due to the lack of}} an adequate number of mitotic cells for analysis. RICA is free of this disadvantage. An automatic microscope can be used to retrieve cell images; automatic image analysis can also be used...|$|R

Samples from locally collected Cyprinus carpio, Hypostomus punctatus, Rhamdia quelen and Oreochromis niloticus gave evidence of a mean increase in micronuclei frequency from 6. 21 to 13. 78 in 1, 000 erythrocytes, a clear indication of the genotoxic potenciality of pesticide residues in regional dams, and their significant contribution to local environmental contamination...|$|R
50|$|In {{normal people}} {{and many other}} mammals, which do not have nuclei in their red blood cells, the {{micronuclei}} are removed rapidly by the spleen. Hence high frequencies of micronuclei in human peripheral blood indicate a ruptured or absent spleen.

Those that did survive had increased chromosomal instability in a <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> and numerous skeletal abnormalities by radiography.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the mutagenicity of several traditional detergents and that of newer more biodegradable detergents, by using a bacterial test (Ames test), a plant cell <b>test</b> (Allium cepa <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test)</b> and a human leucocyte test (Comet test). All tests were conducted using a wide range of doses (1 - 2000 mg/l). None of the examined detergents induced mutations in S. typhimurium. One traditional detergent showed a genotoxic effect with the A. cepa test, while all newer detergents and one traditional detergent were shown by the Comet test to be capable of inducing DNA damage...|$|R
40|$|Genotoxicity {{assessment}} {{is carried out}} on freeze dried powder of cultured probiotics containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus LCR 177, Bifidobacterium adolescentis BA 286, and Pediococcus acidilactici PA 318. Ames tests, in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay, and <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests</b> in mouse peripheral blood are performed. For 5 strains of Salmonella Typhimurium, the Ames tests show no increased reverse mutation upon exposure to the test substance. In CHO cells, the frequency of chromosome aberration does not increase {{in responding to the}} treatment of probiotics. Likewise, the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes in probiotics-fed mice is indistinguishable from that in the negative control group. Taken together, the toxicity assessment studies suggest that the multispecies probiotic mixture does not have mutagenic effects on various organisms...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the <b>micronuclei</b> <b>test</b> (MNT) {{was applied}} in exfoliated cells of buccal mucosa, {{in order to}} {{evaluate}} the genotoxic risk associated with occupational exposure of mechanics, storage battery renovation workers, and car painters. For each individual, 3000 exfoliated buccal cells were analyzed. There was a significantly higher frequency of micronucleated cells (MNC) in the exposed workers than in controls. Smoking and drinking habits, age, and working time did not represent significant factors in terms of increasing the production of micronuclei (MN), when the control and the exposed groups were compared. These results allowed {{to conclude that the}} studied individuals belong to a risk group and should periodically undergo biological monitoring and proper care...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> {{is a test}} used in {{toxicological}} {{screening for}} potential genotoxic compounds. The assay is now {{recognized as one of}} the most successful and reliable assays for genotoxic carcinogens, i.e., carcinogens that act by causing genetic damage and is the OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals.

Males additionally displayed an increase in eating behavior.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} {{in vitro testing}} is to {{determine}} whether a substrate, product, or environmental factor induces genetic damage. One technique entails cytogenetic assays using different mammalian cells. [...] The types of aberrations detected in cells affected by a genotoxic substance are chromatid and chromosome gaps, chromosome breaks, chromatid deletions, fragmentation, translocation, complex rearrangements, and many more. The clastogenic or aneugenic effects from the genotoxic damage will cause an increase in frequency of structural or numerical aberrations of the genetic material. [...] This is similar to the <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> and chromosome aberration assay, which detect structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{waters are}} {{increasingly}} utilized for drinking water because groundwater sources are often polluted. Several monitoring studies have detected {{the presence of}} mutagenicity in drinking water, especially from surface sources due to the reaction of natural organic matter with disinfectant. The study aimed to investigate the genotoxic potential of the products of reaction between humic substances, which are naturally present in surface water, and three disinfectants: chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid. Commercial humic acids dissolved in distilled water at different total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were studied in order to simulate natural conditions of both ground water (TOC= 2. 5 mg/L) and surface water (TOC= 7. 5 mg/L). These solutions were treated with the biocides at a 1 : 1 molar ratio of C:disinfectant and tested for genotoxicity using the anaphase chromosomal aberration and <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests</b> in Allium cepa, and the Vicia faba and Tradescantia <b>micronucleus</b> <b>tests.</b> The tests were carried out after different times and with different modes of exposure, and at 1 : 1 and 1 : 10 dilutions of disinfected and undisinfected humic acid solutions. A genotoxic effect was found for sodium hypochlorite in all plant tests, at both TOCs considered, while chlorine dioxide gave positive results only with the A. cepa tests. Some positive effects were also detected for PAA (A. cepa and Tradescantia). No relevant {{differences were found in}} samples with different TOC values. The significant increase in all genotoxicity end-points induced by all tested disinfectants indicates that a genotoxic potential is exerted even in the presence of organic substances at similar concentrations to those frequently present in drinking wate...|$|R

50|$|These systems {{check for}} large scale {{changes to the}} {{chromosomes}} and may be used with cell culture or in animal test. The chromosomes are stained and observed for any changes. Sister chromatid exchange is a symmetrical exchange of chromosome material between sister chromatids and may be correlated to the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of a chemical. In <b>micronucleus</b> <b>Test,</b> cells are examined for micronuclei, which are fragments or chromosomes left behind at anaphase, and is therefore a test for clastogenic agents that cause chromosome breakages. Other tests may check for various chromosomal aberrations such as chromatid and chromosomal gaps and deletions, translocations, and ploidy.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} animals {{underwent}} a standardized phenotypic screen {{to determine the}} effects of deletion. Twenty four tests were carried out on mutant mice and ten significant abnormalities were observed. A viability at weaning study found less homozygous mutant animals were present than predicted by Mendelian ratio. Homozygous mutant animals of both sexes were sub-fertile and homozygous females had a reduced body weight, body length, heart weight, platelet count and lean mass. Homozygotes of both sex had abnormal eye sizes, narrow eye openings, skeletal defects (including scoliosis and fusion of vertebrae), and displayed an increase in DNA instability as shown by a <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test.</b> This and further analysis revealed the mouse phenotype to model the human genetic illness, Fanconi anemia. The association was confirmed when patients with the disease were found to have mutations in their SLX4 gene.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose for}} {{in vivo testing}} is to {{determine}} the potential of DNA damage that can affect chromosomal structure or disturb the mitotic apparatus that changes chromosome number; the factors that could influence the genotoxicity are ADME and DNA repair. It can also detect genotoxic agents missed in in vitro tests. The positive result of induced chromosomal damage is an increase in frequency of micronucelated PCEs. [...] A micronucleus is a small structure separate from the nucleus containing nuclear DNA arisen from DNA fragments or whole chromosomes that were not incorporated in the daughter cell during mitosis. Causes for this structure are mitotic loss of acentric chromosomal fragments (clastogenicity), mechanical problems from chromosomal breakage and exchange, mitotic loss of chromosomes (aneugenicity), and apoptosis. The <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> in vivo is similar to the in vitro one because it tests for structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, especially in rats' blood cells.|$|E

50|$|A {{micronucleus}} is the erratic (third) nucleus that {{is formed}} during the anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. Micronuclei (the name means 'small nucleus') are cytoplasmic bodies having {{a portion of}} acentric chromosome or whole chromosome which was not carried to the opposite poles during the anaphase. Their formation results in the daughter cell lacking a part or all of a chromosome. These chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes normally develop nuclear membranes and form as micronuclei as a third nucleus. After cytokinesis, one daughter cell ends up with one nucleus and the other ends up with one large and one small nucleus, i.e., micronuclei. There is a chance {{of more than one}} micronucleus forming when more genetic damage has happened.The <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> is used as a tool for genotoxicity assessment of various chemicals. It is easier to conduct than the chromosomal aberration test in terms of procedures and evaluation. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes targeted to the centromere region, it can be determined if a whole chromosome, or only a fragment is lost.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to extend the <b>micronucleus</b> <b>test</b> to Xenopus laevis to screen water for {{potential}} mutagens. Up to now, the most commonly used methods for screening fresh water are the bacterial tests (Ames tests).
