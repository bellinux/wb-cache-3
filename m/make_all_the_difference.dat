The Shiba Inu is best in a home without other small dogs or young children, but consistent obedience training and early socialization can <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> The breed also interacts fairly well with cats.|$|E
25|$|Death of a {{child can}} {{take the form of}} a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention and comforting support can <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E
25|$|In {{the series}} opener, Joe Kelly was rocked for 7 earned runs in 3 innings, leaving the Red Sox {{in a big}} hole due to Josh Donaldson's grand slam, but Brock Holt would hit a grand slam {{of his own and}} the Sox would win the game after a furious {{comeback}} effort. The next day, the Red Sox tagged knuckleballer R.A. Dickey for 7 runs to improve to 3-1. However, the Sox lost the third game of the series as two runs given up by Steven Wright in the first inning proved to <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> as the Red Sox failed to score 6+ runs in a game {{for the first time this}} season.|$|E

25|$|In United's next match, {{home cooking}} seemed to <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference,</b> {{as the team}} won 3–2 on their return to RFK for United's first home match in 5 weeks. Playing at home in front of over 19,000 fans was {{probably}} a boost to the team, but an even bigger boost {{might have been the}} sight of the team's new striker tandem of Espindola and Saborio. The game started horribly for the home side as the Philadelphia Union scored in the first and fourth minute to take what might have seemed a commanding 2–0 lead. United began to claw their way back into the game as Saborio scored on his United debut, with a 37th minute volley of a Korb cross. The game was tied midway through the second half when Nick DeLeon finished a rebound of an Espindola shot. D.C. United finally went ahead on an Espindola header, with Chris Korb getting his second assist of the match. DeLeon's goal was his first in over a year in a regular season match.|$|E
2500|$|Half-Life 2 {{begins as}} the G-Man speaks to Gordon in a dreamlike scene, after keeping him [...] "in stasis far from Earth, thought, and time itself" [...] {{for nearly two}} decades, during {{which he did not}} {{physically}} age. He comments that [...] "the right man in the wrong place can <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the world." [...] Gordon is then [...] "point inserted" [...] into a train bound for City 17, to the (mild) surprise of the other passengers. Freeman quickly learns that Earth has been conquered and occupied by the trans-dimensional Combine empire, with a military force powerful enough to have subdued the entirety of Earth's nations within a period of 7 hours. He soon meets up with Barney Calhoun and Alyx Vance, and joins the resistance against the Combine.|$|E
2500|$|With urban {{generation}} {{from the}} turn of the twentieth century picking up, economists forecast that globalization and the powers of multinational corporations would shift the balance of power away from nation states towards individual cities, which would then compete with neighboring cities and cities elsewhere for the most lucrative modern industries, and which increasingly in major Western Europe and U.S.cities did not include manufacturing. Thus cities set about [...] "reinventing themselves", giving precedence to the value given by culture. Municipalities and non-profit organizations hope the use of a Starchitect will drive traffic and tourist income to their new facilities. With the popular and critical success of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank Gehry, in which a rundown area of a city in economic decline brought in huge financial growth and prestige, the media started to talk about the so-called [...] "Bilbao Effect"; a star architect designing a blue-chip, prestige building was thought to <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in producing a landmark for the city. Similar examples are the Imperial War Museum North (2002), Greater Manchester, UK, by Daniel Libeskind, the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland, by Steven Holl, and the Seattle Central Library (2004), Washington state, United States, by OMA.|$|E

2500|$|Caledonian's short-haul re-equipment {{effort to}} replace the {{remaining}} obsolete piston and turboprop airliners in its fleet, initially focused on Boeing's 737. It intended {{to place an order}} for three series 200 aircraft before the end of 1967. The aircraft were to be delivered by spring 1969 to accomplish the transition to an all-jet fleet ahead of the 1969 summer charter season. As the 737 was an all-American aircraft like the previously ordered 707, Caledonian needed to approach the BOT once more to request an import tax exemption. Predictably, the BOT opposed this. It threatened to withdraw the tax concession it had granted the airline to import brand-new 707s free of duty if 737s were selected instead of One-Eleven 500s. Caledonian did not favour the One-Eleven 500 because it could not match the 737-200's range, which was reckoned sufficient to fly British holidaymakers non-stop from the UK to the Canary Islands and to destinations in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as lower costs per seat mile {{as a result of the}} latter's wider fuselage accommodating a greater number of passengers seated six (rather than five) across. In the cut-throat short-/medium-haul charter airline business these were important cost and marketing advantages that could <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between profit and loss. In addition to the risk of losing the BOT's tax concession to import new 707s duty-free into the UK outweighing the 737-200's range and cost advantage over the One-Eleven 500, sterling's devaluation together with increases in Boeing's basic sales price had made ordering One-Elevens more attractive financially. Based on an order for four aircraft valued at £7.5 million, buying an equivalent number of 737s was £1-1.5 million more expensive. Another factor swinging Caledonian's short-haul re-equipment decision in favour of the British aircraft was the manufacturer's ability to offer the Scottish airline a high-density, 109-seat version featuring an increased range of [...] (compared with [...] for the baseline 97-seat, single-class One-Eleven 500 ordered by BEA). This brought most of the Mediterranean and North Africa within range. These considerations resulted in Caledonian placing an order for three One-Eleven 500s for delivery in 1969. It also took out an option on a fourth aircraft, which was to be delivered in 1970 if confirmed.|$|E
