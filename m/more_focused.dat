5|$|During this period, {{the club}} {{may have been}} <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on {{building}} the Palladium, for which construction began in July 1994. In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Yashin and Daigle led the club in points again, although their point totals declined. The 1994–95 Senators team record declined also from the previous season, finishing with nine wins and 23 points (this was over only 48 games), to finish last in the League again.|$|E
5|$|Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos {{originally}} recruited Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy {{to work on}} {{a progressive}} metal album. When keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore (founder of Chroma Key and former Dream Theater member) joined the project, the musical direction of the album changed to become <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on soundscapes and composition than musicianship. Sean Malone (of Cynic and Gordian Knot) and Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) also performed on the album.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, PepsiCo {{spun off}} its {{restaurants}} division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which {{changed its name}} to Yum! Brands in 2002. Yum has proved a <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> owner than Pepsi, and although KFC's number of outlets have declined in the US, the company has continued to grow in Asia, South America and Africa. The chain has expanded to 18,875 outlets across 118 countries and territories, with 4,563 outlets in China alone, KFC's largest market.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} three 2012 presidential {{election}} debates took place on October 3, in Denver. Media figures and political analysts widely viewed Romney as having delivered a stronger and <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> presentation than did President Obama. That initial debate overshadowed Obama's improved presentation {{in the last two}} debates later in October, and Romney maintained a small advantage in the debates when seen as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household. The result was a household <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E

5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be boring. As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually {{moved away from the}} dating theme and became <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, Leslie's self-absorbed and underachieving subordinate. While {{he is an}} {{employee}} at the parks department, he cares little about his job, and is instead <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on his entrepreneurial ambitions. He takes great pride in his appearance and regularly pursues women despite being married. During the season it is revealed that his marriage to his wife Wendy is a green card marriage, and he and Wendy go through a divorce after she obtains her citizenship. This affects Tom greater than he anticipated, as he realizes that he actually did harbor feelings for Wendy.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E

5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch to create a <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> welding arc {{and as a result}} is often automated.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E

Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|Player created digital walkthroughs are {{typically}} designed to assist other players in accomplishing certain feats within {{video games and}} are similar to text-based or telephony-based walkthroughs, except {{they can also be}} solely for entertainment purposes.

Let's Play videos are a special type of walkthrough generally <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on entertaining rather than informing the viewer through humorous commentary given by the video's host as they complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish and Swedish militaries {{engaged in}} wide-ranging co-operation, {{but it was}} <b>more</b> <b>focused</b> on the {{exchange}} of information and defence planning for the Åland islands than on military exercises or materiel. The Finnish objective was to commit the Swedes by establishing a military-political joint venture in the Åland: if the Swedes would undertake to assist Finland in fortifying the islands, then an important and useful precedent might be set. The Government of Sweden {{was aware of the}} military co-operation, but carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy.|$|E
