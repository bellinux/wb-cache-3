40|$|The Wadden Sea {{is located}} in the southeastern part of the North Sea forming an {{extended}} intertidal area along the Dutch, German and Danish coast. It is a highly dynamic and largely natural ecosystem influenced by climatic changes and anthropogenic use of the North Sea. Changes in the environment of the Wadden Sea, natural or anthropogenic origin, cannot be monitored by the standard measurement methods alone, because large-area surveys of the intertidal flats are often difficult due to tides, tidal channels and unstable underground. For this reason, remote sensing offers effective monitoring tools. In this study a multi-sensor concept for classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea has been developed. Basis for this method is a combined analysis of RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data coupled with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> and sediments. The classification of the vegetation and <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> is based on a decision tree and a set of hierarchically structured algorithms which use object and texture features.

First results show that we are able to identify vegetation and <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> with the use of multi-sensor remote sensing. The classification of the sediments in the tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and <b>mussel</b> <b>beds.</b> The results demonstrate that the sediments cannot be classified with high accuracy by their spectral properties alone due to their similarity which is predominately caused by their water content...|$|R
40|$|Mussel {{bottom culture}} is an {{extensive}} type of aquaculture; {{it depends on}} natural resources for feed, seed and space. It consists of the translocation of seed from natural beds to designed culture areas, where mussel farmers try to improve production efficiency. Production efficiency {{is measured by the}} relative biomass production (RBP) expressed as units of biomass harvested from one unit of biomass seeded, it increases with mussel growth and decreases with mussel mortality. Mussel bottom culture makes use of nature and also depends on nature. Cultured mussels are subject to similar environmental factors that influence growth and mortality on natural <b>mussel</b> <b>beds,</b> with additional effects of anthropogenic factors. In this thesis we focus on dynamics of <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> and the impact and effectivity of culture activities on mussel production yield. The major objectives are stated as: (1) to better understand the population dynamics of subtidal mussel populations, (2) to analyze what factors determine production efficiency in mussel bottom culture and how this can be improved. On natural <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> <b>mussels</b> organise in patterns that enhance food delivery and resilience of the bed. On culture plots mussels are seeded in concentric seeding patterns. Seeding techniques concentrate mussels locally within the culture plot area, resulting in high local mussel densities; this increases competition and limits the spatial re-organisation of <b>mussels</b> in the <b>bed.</b> Consequently, seeding on culture plots is followed by a large size and density dependent seeding loss that ranges from about 40 % for seed from fishery to 69 % for smaller SMC seed. This loss was the major factor in determining the maximum RBP. Losses in the grow-out stage were substantially lower, a subsequent density dependent loss was found for smaller mussels ( 30 mm). Shore crab predation is an important factor contributing to the higher losses at seeding. The effect of shore crab predation on mussel biomass production is higher than expected from previous studies. In an experiment on an intertidal culture plot in the Oosterschelde (NL), we observed that shore crab predation peaks directly after seeding and accounted for 33 % of the total losses within five weeks after seeding. Spatial patterns in the survival rates of natural <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> in the Wadden Sea show better seed survival in areas with intermediate salinity (mean annual salinity 17. 5 - 22. 5 mg l- 1). This suggests that mussel survival is negatively related to sea star distribution, which is largely controlled by salinity. Natural beds that escape predation are found at lower salinities and <b>mussels</b> on these <b>beds</b> showed low growth rates, also because of a lower food quality in these areas. Mussel culture strongly affects the population dynamics of the subtidal mussel population, through relaying of mussels from natural <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> to culture plots. Culture plots are located in more saline regions of the Wadden Sea (mean annual salinity 25. 8 mg l- 1), compared to natural <b>mussel</b> <b>beds.</b> This activity increased mussel growth and survival because food quality on culture plots is high and predation is prevented. As a result, average biomass production is higher on culture plots than on natural <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> and this difference increases over time. A more efficient seed use on the available area, that can be obtained by reducing seeding losses will increase RBP, maximum biomass production and increases maximum profit. Our results suggest that this can be achieved by seeding homogeneously in low densities...|$|R
50|$|Blue mussels {{occasionally}} form clumps, or aggregates, {{of individuals}} when population density is low.The mussels attach {{to one another}} via collagenous protein strands called byssal threads. The aggregates are observed mostly in Mussel fields, which are short-lived populations of Mussels, usually exhibiting a clumped distribution pattern. It is hypothesized that the mussels form these aggregates to increase reproductive success in low density populations. This hypothesis, however, {{has yet to be}} conclusively proven. Alternative possible reasons for the behavior include resisting wave action and increasing water flow through the siphons of the mussel. The significance of the behavior is its relation to the formation of <b>mussel</b> <b>beds</b> from <b>mussel</b> fields. <b>Mussel</b> <b>beds</b> are persistent, dense <b>mussel</b> populations. <b>Beds</b> generally form from fields that persist long enough to establish a dense population. Thus in areas where blue mussels are threatened, such as the Wadden Sea, it is of great importance to enhance the survival of mussel fields, of which mussel aggregates are the primary component.|$|R
