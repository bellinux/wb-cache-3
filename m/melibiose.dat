This enzyme induced at 30 ℃ hydrolyzed colorimetric substrate, α-ONPG at 30 ℃ and 37 ℃. On the other hand, lactose induced α-galactosidase at both temperatures. These findings suggested that the temperature sensitivity of <b>melibiose</b> metabolism was not due to the induction and/or function of α-galactosidase. Thus, the effect of temperature on induction and function of the <b>melibiose</b> transport system was examined.

40|$|Transport of [3 H]melibiose, {{prepared}} from [3 H]raffinose, {{was investigated}} in Escherichia coli.

40|$|<b>Melibiose</b> {{transport}} in Salmonella typhimurium was investigated. Radioactive <b>melibiose</b> {{was prepared}} and the <b>melibiose</b> transport system was characterized. Na+ and Li+ stimulated transport of <b>melibiose</b> {{by lowering the}} Km value without affecting the Vmax value; Km values were 0. 50 mM {{in the absence of}} Na+ or Li+ and 0. 12 mM in the presence of 10 mM NaCl or 10 mM LiCl. The Vmax value was 140 nmol/min per mg of protein. <b>Melibiose</b> was a much more effective substrate than methyl-beta-thiogalactoside. An Na+-melibiose cotransport mechanism was suggested by three types of experiments. First, the influx of Na+ induced by <b>melibiose</b> influx was observed with melibiose-induced cells. Second, the efflux of H+ induced by <b>melibiose</b> influx was observed only in the presence of Na+ or Li+, demonstrating the absence of H+-melibiose cotransport. Third, either an artificially imposed Na+ gradient or membrane potential could drive <b>melibiose</b> uptake in cells. Formation of an Na+ gradient in S. typhimurium was shown to be coupled to H+ by three methods. First, uncoupler-sensitive extrusion of Na+ was energized by respiration or glycolysis. Second, efflux of H+ induced by Na+ influx was detected. Third, a change in the pH gradient was elicited by imposing an Na+ gradient in energized membrane vesicles. Thus, it is concluded that the mechanism for Na+ extrusion is an Na+/H+ antiport. The Na+/H+ antiporter is a transformer which converts an electrochemical H+ gradient to an Na+ gradient, which then drives <b>melibiose</b> transport. Li+ was inhibitory for the growth of cells when <b>melibiose</b> was the sole carbon source, even though Li+ stimulated <b>melibiose</b> transport.

In the resulting derivative carriers, we measured the transport of <b>melibiose,</b> determined the effect of the hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS), on transport in intact cells and inside out vesicles, and examined the ability of <b>melibiose</b> to protect the carrier from inactivation by the sulfhydryl reagent. We found a set of seven positions in which the reaction with the sulfhydryl reagent caused partial or complete loss of carrier function measured in intact cells or inside-out vesicles. The presence of <b>melibiose</b> protected five of these positions from reaction with PCMBS. The reaction of two additional positions with PCMBS resulted in the partial loss of transport function only in inside-out vesicles. <b>Melibiose</b> protected these two positions from reaction with the reagent. Together, the PCMBS-sensitive sites and charged residues assigned to helix 2 form a cluster of amino acids that map in three rows with each row comprised of every fourth residue. This is the pattern expected of residues that are part of an α-helical structure and thus the rows are tilted at an angle of 25 ° to the helical axis.
