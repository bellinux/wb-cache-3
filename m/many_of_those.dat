5|$|Except for his autobiography, MalcolmX left no {{published}} writings.

5|$|Adrian Grenier, Simon Baker, and Tracie Thoms {{play key}} {{supporting}} roles. Wendy Finerman produced and David Frankel directed the film, which was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Streep's performance drew critical acclaim and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, {{as well as}} the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Blunt also drew favorable reviews and nominations for her performance, as did <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> involved in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the dry climate, timber—a main {{component}} in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; homes are instead constructed of adobe. The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in {{attendance}} had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> involved in the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards extreme length, the vaults of English cathedrals are low compared with <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{found in other}} countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E
5|$|Dreamtime {{opens with}} the premise that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> accused of {{witchcraft}} in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys {{with the aid of}} a hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by the Christian authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess Diana, and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic vagina and was used for birth rituals.|$|E

5|$|During Marostica's {{first months}} in the position, he helped lead Colorado's effort to keep Frontier Airlines jobs in Denver {{following}} its merger with Republic Airways; ultimately, Frontier moved several hundred jobs, and Frontier's headquarters, to Wisconsin and Indiana, which offered greater tax and econonmic incentives. When legislators proposed eliminating business tax credits in late 2009 to help balance the states budget, Marostica publicly defended <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> credits, but he did support limited cuts to tax credits in Governor Ritter's proposed 2010–2011 budget.|$|E

The court strips Sideshow Bob of his position and sends him back to prison, while Mayor Quimby regains his job as mayor.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in {{the protest}} {{movements}} were young {{children at the}} time of the invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent {{around the country to}} encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|Martello {{defended the}} growing rise of feminists in Wicca during the 1970s, criticizing what he {{deemed to be}} the continual {{repression}} of women within the Pagan movement.

He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and black magic, commenting that it had racial overtones and that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> advocating such a view were racist.|$|E

Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled.|$|E
