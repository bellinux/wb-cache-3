5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|By {{late on the}} 19th, Austrian and French {{soldiers}} had been skirmishing at outposts for more than 30 hours, with the action growing increasingly intense. In {{the early hours of}} the 21st, General Lefebvre informed Jourdan that the Austrians were attacking all his positions, and that the general engagement would begin shortly. After 24hours of fighting, Austrian forces pushed Lefebvre and Saint Cyr's troops back to the Pfullendorf heights. Although sappers blew up the primary bridge over the Ostrach river, the Austrians managed to ford the stream anyway. They nearly outflanked General Saint Cyr's forces on the right flank, did outflank Lefebvre's forces in the center, and cut off a portion of the southern flank from the main body. Saint Cyr's troops barely <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> back before being fully cut off. Finally, General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, marching north with 10,000men, from Feldkirch, threatened Ferino's First Division from the south.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Unity approaching, Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As the Unity pulled closer, Moore opened fire. The Unity crew managed to avoid damage and pulled {{alongside}} the Margaretta. Led by Joseph Getchell and O'Brien's brother, John, the Unity crew stormed on board. Both sides exchanged musket shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity. Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a musket shot to the chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> along the other side of Moore's ship. With the combination of both crews, they were able to overwhelm the Margaretta.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to pick out a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball {{to the side of the}} Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E

5|$|The ground {{offensive}} in Glina commenced {{with a single}} SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station. This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe {{that they were being}} fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at the police station. The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene. Following consultations with Vasiljković, the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards Viduševac, where they shot at a number of civilian buildings including a school and a church, before turning to approach the police station from a different direction. The assault, supported by mortar fire, continued until the following day. The police station was captured on 27 July at 11:08. According to SAO Krajina military reports, 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting. Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others, as well as the deaths of two civilians, including a German journalist killed by sniper fire. The killed journalist, Egon Scotland, a reporter of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a clearly marked car, when he was fatally wounded. The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out of Glina to Viduševac.|$|E

25|$|Mulroney's {{approval}} ratings declined and by 1993 opinion polls showed that his Progressive Conservative Party {{would almost certainly}} be defeated by the Liberals under Chrétien in the election due that year.
