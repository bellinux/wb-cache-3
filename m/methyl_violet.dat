40|$|SUMMARY: Glutamine {{synthesis}} by Staphylococcus aureus is inhibited by {{the basic}} triphenylmethane dyes crystal <b>violet,</b> <b>methyl</b> green, fuchsin, pararosaniline, brilliant green and malachite green. In the pH range 6. 5 - 8. 5, the inhibitory action of crystal violet {{is independent of}} pH, whilst with fuchsin, brilliant green and malachite green, the degree of inhibition is increased by increasing the hydrogen ion concentration of the medium. At pH 7. 5, inhibitory activity increases in the order: brilliant green, fuchsin, malachite green, <b>methyl</b> green, crystal <b>violet.</b> The effectiveness of a basic triphenylmethane dye as an inhibitor of glutamine synthesis can be correlated with the basic dissociation constant of the dye. During studies {{of the effects of}} various antibacterial agents on the uptake of glutamic acid by Streptococcus faecalis Gale & Mitchell (1947) found that certain basic triphenylmethane dyes, e. g. crystal violet, caused an increased accumu-lation of the amino acid inside the cells. Since the dyes did not affect the rate at which glutamic acid passed into the cells, the increased accumulation was apparently due to the inhibition of a metabolic pathway which normall...|$|R

Three organic dyes were used as test analytes namely crystal <b>violet,</b> <b>methyl</b> orange and methylene blue. Analysis of the organic dyes was performed using ultravioletvisible spectroscopy. Optimum extraction conditions was achieved using 50 min extraction time, 240 rpm stirring rate, ultrasonic aided desorption for 15 min using 3 mL methanol and sample solution at pH 4 with addition of 5 % (w/v) NaCl. The sol-gel hybrid MPTMOS-MTMOS showed better extraction efficiency (based on absorbance) for the selected organic dyes compared to commercial ethylene-glycol/silicone Twister™ stir bar. Limit of detection obtained was in the range 0. 34 - 0. 75 μg mL- 1 (S/N = 3) and linear range achieved was 10 order of magnitude (1. 0 - 10 μg mL- 1).

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{decoloration}} of water. Adsorptivity of moderate density fiberboard saw dust (MDFSD) for different dyes has been tested. Continuous as well as batch systems were {{used to evaluate the}} adsorptivity of three different dyes (crystal <b>violet,</b> <b>methyl</b> blue and brilliant green). Breakthrough times of the three dyes were compared. Crystal violet was chosen for more detailed studies. The adsorption kinetics and the saturation equilibrium were studied using batch system {{as a function of the}} related parameters. Adsorption isotherms were established and compared. Breakthrough plots were obtained beside the three isotherms. The breakthrough times were found as CV>MB>BG. These results were compatible to the adsorptivity estimated from the isotherms. It was found through this study that adsorption of CV followed pseudo-first order kinetics, the adsorption rate constant increases with increasing temperature, adsorbent concentration, MDFSD dose and pH. The adsorption equilibrium was shifted toward higher adsorption capacity by increasing the substrate concentration, temperature and pH. The adsorption data fit Freundlich, Langmuir, but attained a better correlation with the Langmuir model. Langmuir and freundlich constants, activation enthalpy of adsorption and the adsorption thermodynamic parameters were obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abst rac ts-The {{colloidal}} state (stable, coagulated, or gel-like) and the theological properties of Na-rich montmorillonite (Wyoming) dispersions are {{strongly influenced by}} organic cations. This effect is shown for homologous organic cations: alkyl trimethylammonium ions, paraquat, diquat, alkyl bispyridinium ions, and the triphenylmethane dyes crystal <b>violet,</b> <b>methyl</b> green, and tris (tri-methylammonium phenyl) methane chloride. The critical coagulation concentrations, cK, are small (often < 1 mmol/L) because the cations are enriched in the Stern layer and influence the solvent structure near the surface. The strong adsorption of the counterions at the clay-mineral surface causes CK values to increase with the solid content. Charge reversal (recharging) of the particles was observed with the longer chain alkyl trimethyl-ammonium ions, dodecyl bispyridinium ions, and crystal violet. Other cations reduced the electrophoretic mobility to zero but positive particle charges were not observed. The plastic viscosity increased sharply at the critical coagulation concentration and showed a minimum slightly below cK, which {{was caused by the}} electroviscous effect. Yield values were developed at con-centrations above CK. In most cases, yield values reached a plateau where the amount of organic cations was- 0. 5 mmol/g, i. e., about half of the cation-exchange capacity. The cK values decreased with increasing hydrophobicity of homologous compounds, but the yield value showed maxima at intermediate chain lengths.

40|$|A {{total of}} eight dyes from the triphenylmethane, azo and polymeric/heterocyclic dye group were decolourized by enzyme {{cocktail}} extracted from five month old spent compost of Pleurotus sajor-caju with lignin peroxidase {{as the main}} enzyme. The percentage of decolourisation for tryphan blue, amido black, remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR) and bromophenol blue ranged between 80 - 90 % after 4 h reaction. However, the percentage of decolourisation for crystal <b>violet,</b> <b>methyl</b> green and congo red was lower than the other dyes from the same dye group with only 60 - 65 % after 12 h. Methylene blue exhibited the least decolourisation with only 43 % after 24 h indicating that this dye is a poor substrate for the enzyme. The rate of decolourisation for crystal violet, tryphan blue, amido black, congo red and RBBR dyes by enzymes from spent mushroom compost (SMC) were also calculated. The rate of decolourisation for all the dyes was positively affected by the initial dye concentration, pH between 4. 0 - 4. 5 and temperature range of 30 - 35 C. The optimum concentration of veratryl alcohol as redox mediator was between 0 - 2 mM for all the dyes except for RBBR. The optimum veratryl alcohol concentration for RBBR was 4 mM. Based {{on the effect of}} hydrogen peroxide on the rate of decolourisation of each dye, the dyes could be divided into two groups. From {{the results of the present}} study, it could be concluded that the enzymes extracted from the spent compost of P. sajor-caju offers an economical advantage of obtaining industrially important enzymes, which have potential in the bioremediation of synthetic dyes. Furthermore, the utilization of spent compost for the extraction of enzymes can also offer a possible solution for the problem posed due to the disposal of large amounts of spent mushroom compost...|$|R
