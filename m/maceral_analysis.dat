40|$|The {{spread of}} coal {{deposits}} in Indonesia is quite large, most of coal basin {{is located in}} Sumatra and Kalimantan. One of the basin that produce economical coal deposit with value of calories more than 6. 000 kal/g in Tanjung Formation is Asam-Asam Basin (Darlan etc, 1999). PT Anugerah Lumbung Energi {{is one of the}} coal mining companies with mining working area on Asam-asam basin. Research area is located in Kintap field, Tanah Laut Regency, South Kalimantan. The aim of this research is to find out about coal quality using <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> with vitrinite reflectance method on well AL 25 and spread direction of coal seam at the research area. Methods of research are descriptive and analysis. Based on these methods, done the stage of the analysis and interpretation with data supporting are stratigraphical data and laboratory data. Activities performed such as geological mapping, <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> with vitrinite reflectance methods and coal quality interpretation on well AL 25. The software used to support this undergraduate thesis are the Arcgis,Autocad X 5 and Corel Draw. In Undergraduate Thesis, the author has divided into five phases, such as lithology description, cropline withdrawal based on strike and dip, <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis,</b> coal quality interpretation and results correlation of <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis,</b> rank and coal quality on the well AL 25. Based on the result of analysis data, it can be interpreted that lithology at the research area are sandstones, siltstone, claystone and thin layer of coal. The direction of seam coal (cropline) at the research area is southeast - northwest based on strike / dip. The results of the <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> for each seam produce rank between Lignite to High Volatile bituminous B, whereas the results of the quality analysis for each seam produces a caloric value ranging from 12040. 35 to 13786. 69 Btu/lb or ranged from High Volatile Bituminous C to High Volatile Bituminous B. Based on the result of <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis,</b> rank and coal quality, it can be concluded that there are a mutual relation between maceral, rank and coal quality.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} the relationship between organic material and thermal maturity during the process of evaluation of hydrocarbon potential. Samples studied include Miocene high volatile bituminous coal and coaly shale collected from outcrops and exploration wells in Hsinchu-Miaoli area, NW Taiwan, density centrifuge separated macerals, bituminous coal and anthracite from China, in addition toWoodford and Green River oil shale from the United States. <b>Maceral</b> composition <b>analysis,</b> elemental analysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement and Rock-Eval pyrolysis were performed for evaluation. The results of study show that: 1) coal samples from the Shiti Formation (middle Miocene) exhibit more vitrinite and less mineral matter contents than samples from the Nanchuang Formation (upper Miocene); H is increased in exinite-enriched maceral mixtures with density < 1. 25 g cm- 3, after density centrifuge separation. 2) A positive linear correlation between Tmax and Ro illustrates both Rock-Eval pyrolysis and vitrinite reflectance can be used as indicators of thermal maturity. 3) From the plot of H/C ratio vs. vitrinite reflectance, even though the depositional environments were different in Taiwan and China, their organic micelles exhibit a similar trend in the process of thermal maturation. As a whole, the curve has a turning point at Ro = 0. 5 and H/C = 0. 1 (atomic ratio 1. 2) in this study. 4) Arather good correlation between S 2 and TOC of samples studied indicates the contribution of S 2 from TOC. 5) The highest HI occurred in certain maturities (Tmax and Ro) of samples studied, and not in the stages of less maturity or over-maturity. 6) Two different linear trends were observed in the cross plot of S 1 vs. S 2. Field outcropped shale or C-shale exhibits a steeper slope compared to that of coal samples which can be attributed to the compositional difference in their organic material. 7) Arather strong positive correlation for H vs. S 2 illustrates the contribution of H-containing macerals, especially exinite. As a result of this study, we expect to promote evaluation techniques for HC exploration; for instance, the development or improvement of evaluation methods for source rocks, reservoirs, structural evolution, and thermal maturity.

30|$|During {{the present}} study, coal samples were {{collected}} from Derra underground coal mines following the pillar coal sampling method. Coal {{samples were collected}} from Karharbari Top seam and Karharbari Bottom seam. Their megascopic characterization was performed by using the scheme proposed by Diessel (1965) and macroscopic seam profiles were constructed. For the microscopic study coal samples were crushed to 18 mesh size (< 1  mm size particles). The polished particulate coal mounts were prepared by using cold mounting epoxy resin without pressure. The study was carried out on an advanced petrological microscope equipped with MSP 200 photometry system and fluorescence attachment. The maceral nomenclature applied, followed the ICCP system (1971, 1998, 2001). For the microlithotype analysis, a 20 point Kötter graticule was used. The line to line and {{point to point distance}} was maintained 0.4  mm for both <b>maceral</b> and microlithotype <b>analysis.</b> The <b>maceral</b> and microlithotype counting was done simultaneously. The reflectance measurement was carried out as per the ISO standard (ISO 7404 - 5 1994). For the precise assessment of liptinite and dark vitrinite microscopic examination of macerals was carried out both under the white incident light as well as under blue light excitation. The International Committees for coal Petrology (1971) devised certain rules for the characterization of maceral association. According to which, the minimum dimension of a band to be called a microlithotype, should be 50  ×  50  mm, and the 5  % rule. The 5  % rule demonstrates that a microlithotype can have 5  % accessory macerals due to the very fact that neither the monomaceral nor the bimaceral microlithotypes are constituted exclusively of the macerals of one group or two groups respectively. Therefore, they can have 5  % accessory macerals which will have no role in their nomenclature or characterization. ICCP recommendation has been followed during the characterization of microlithotype. All the coal samples were subjected to proximate (BIS 2003) and petrographic analysis.|$|R

40|$|The Permian coals of the South Walker Creek area, with a {{vitrinite}} reflectance (Rvmax) of 1. 7 to 1. 95 % (low-volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite), {{are one of}} {{the highest}} rank coals currently mined in the Bowen Basin. Studies of the mineralogy of this coal seam have identified unusual mineralogical assemblages in the vertical sequence, with illite-chlorite assemblages resembling a metamorphic association {{in some parts of the}} seam and kaolinite rich assemblages of more normal sedimentary origin in others. A range of analytical techniques, namely XRD, XRF, coal geochemistry, polished section petrology, SEM-EDS, and 3 D X-ray tomography, have been used to investigate the nature of this mineralogical variation, including the effects of geological process on several aspects of coal petrology and geochemistry, and especially the impact of rank advance and other post depositional process on the mineralogical variation within the main coal seam of the South Walker Creek area. The South Walker Creek coal occurs in a single seam 10. 5 to 14 m in thickness, split in places, and is dominated by dull and bright (40 - 60 % bright), and dull with numerous bright bands (10 - 40 % bright) lithotypes, along with minor dull (< 1 % bright) coal. The duller lithotypes are mostly associated with a high proportion of inertinite as seen from organic petrology studies. Overall, the coal seam is dominated by inertinite (mainly semifusinite) with minor vitrinite, together with a small proportion of liptinite (exudatinite and bituminite) <b>macerals.</b> X-ray diffraction <b>analysis</b> shows that the mineral matter of the coal is dominated by kaolinite and interstratified illite/smectite in the top and bottom of the seam, along with typically a small proportion of quartz. In the middle of the seam, however, this is replaced by an NH 4 illite-chlorite assemblage, with no quartz. Diaspore also occurs in some parts of the mid-seam interval. Some carbonate minerals (calcite and ankerite) and other minerals, namely rutile, anatase and apatite, have varying abundance in the vertical sequence, but another carbonate, siderite, and also apatite, appear to be most abundant near the top and bottom of the seam. Correlation of borehole sections shows that the kaolinite-rich intervals at the top and bottom of the seam and the illite-rich zone in the middle can be traced along strike through the deposit. Intervals with abundant diaspore in the non-carbonate mineral matter, however, appear to have a more restricted distribution, bounded by faults and seam splits and limited to the structurally lower parts of the mine area. Local changes, such as assemblages with paragonite, dickite and increased proportions of I/S also appear to be associated with fault zones. The minerals in the coal represent three phases of mineralization, syngenetic, diagenetic and epigenetic. Quartz, siderite, kaolinite and I/S occur as syngenetic phases, mainly derived input of detrital sediment into the peat swamp during organic matter accumulation. Some minerals, namely chlorite, illite, phosphates, diaspore and rutile or anatase, may have formed as early diagenetic phases. Epigenetic minerals such as calcite and ankerite, as well as dickite, and nacrite, along with additional kaolinite, illite, chlorite, diaspore, phosphates and rutile or anatase, were precipitated in cleats and fractures at a later stage as a result of epigenetic activity, probably associated with fluid movement in the coal seam strata after compaction and (possibly) rank advance. The mineralogical assemblage in the seam varies both vertically and laterally, partly controlled by the presence of faults and related structural features. Integration of these and other observations suggest that the mineralogical variation within the seam resulted from a combination of processes, including the sediment input to the peat swamp during deposition, changes associated with rank advance or metamorphism, and changes associated with hydrothermal effects due to late-stage fluid migration through the coal...|$|R

In the shelf area, sediments may contain up to 99 % terrigenous OM. Freshwater algae occur directly north of the river mouths, reflecting the strong fluvial influence. Relatively high amounts of marine OM (20 - 40 %) are restricted to the upper continental slope, the Vilkitsky Strait and west of the New Siberian Islands, explained by increased surface-water productivity due to increased fluvial nutrient supply, open-water conditions, and phytoplankton blooms at the ice-edge...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{particulate}} organic matter (OM) in Arctic Ocean sediments from the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene (IODP Expedition 302) has revealed detailed information about the aquatic/marine OM fluxes, biological sources, preservation and export of terrestrial material. Here, we present detailed data from <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis,</b> vitrinite reflectance measurements and organic geochemistry. During the Campanian/Paleocene, fluxes of land-derived OM are indicated by reworked and oxidized macerals (vitrinite, inertinite) and terrigenous liptinite (cutinite, sporinite). In the Early Eocene, drastic environmental changes are indicated by peaks in aquatic OM (up to 40 - 45 %, lamalginite, telalginite, liptodetrinite, dinoflagellate cysts) and amorphous OM (up to 50 % bituminite). These events of increased aquatic OM flux, similar to conditions favoring black shale deposition, correlate with the global d 13 C events "Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum" (PETM) and "Elmo-event".

The outcrop and Sann # 1 well data on the Sembar Formation reveals poor, fair, good and very good quality of the TOC, type II–III kerogen, immature–mature organic matter and an indigenous hydrocarbon generation potential. The outcrop and Sann # 1 well data on the Chiltan Formation show a poor–good quality of TOC, type II–III kerogen, immature–mature source rock quality and having an indigenous hydrocarbon generation potential. The vitrinite reflectance [Ro (%)] values and Maceral types [fluorescent amorphous organic matter, exinite, alginite and inertnite] demonstrate that maturity in both Sembar and the Chiltan formation at surface and subsurface fall in {{the oil and gas}} generation zone to cracking of oil to gas condensate zone. Recurrence of organic rich and poor intervals within the Sembar and Chiltan formation are controlled by the Late Jurassic thermal uplift preceding the Indo-Madagascar separation from the Afro-Arabian Plate and Early Cretaceous local transgressive–regressive cycles.

This study attempts to re-evaluate the discrepancies in past investigations based on the prospective value and characterization of the Campano-Maastrichtian source rocks and their hydrocarbon potential taking cognizance of the interactions between source rocks and their prevailing paleodepositional environment. Fifteen (15) shale and five (5) coal samples collected from outcrops within the study area were subjected to Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Sulphur Content (TSC), and Soluble Organic Matter (SOM) analyses. Other standard analysis such as inorganic geochemical (Major and Trace Element Abundance), Organic Petrographic (Maceral) and granulometric (grainsize) analyses were also carried out. The TOC contents, ranging between 0. 65 to 1. 82 wt % in shale and 18. 35 to 19. 12 wt % in the coal samples, exceed the minimum threshold value of 0. 5 wt%.

40|$|Central Tertiary Basin (CTB) coals from {{a variety}} of palaeogeographic {{conditions}} within the Longyear and Verkhnij seams, were sampled to assess the relationship between the petroleum present, the remaining generation potential and coal geochemistry in order to improve the spatial predictability of petroleum resources within the basin. Vitrinite reflectance (VR) values from the CTB coals {{have been shown to be}} suppressed (Marshall et al., 2015 b). This study attempts to quantify and correct for this suppression effect by applying the Lo (1993) method (LoVR), which uses Hydrogen Index (HI) values to modify VR data, and the coal Rank(Sr) scale of Suggate (2000, 2002), a technique not affected by suppression. In addition, the oil generation and expulsion thresholds for the CTB coals were investigated, with discussions on oil potential versus marine influence upon the mires in which the coals formed. A pseudo-van Krevelen diagram shows that the majority of the coals plot on the Type II kerogen line, while the remainder plot between the Types II and III kerogen lines, with HI between 151 and 410 mg HC/g TOC; however, <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> shows that Type III kerogen predominates. This is attributed to the presence of abundant fluorescing (oil-prone) vitrinites. The LoVR, Tmax and Rank(Sr) parameters all show that maturity increases from basin margins towards basin centre (i. e. from Bassen to Lunckefjellet, to Breinosa and Colesdalen) and indicate that all the coals are within the oil generation window. The marginal samples at Bassen are within the early mature stage of the oil window (i. e. 0. 7...|$|E
40|$|Two sets {{of mature}} coals have been {{collected}} at outcrop on two dipping coal seams in the Alès Carboniferous coalfield (Massif Central, France). Visual examination, petrographic observations, and Rock-Eval pyrolysis studies unequivocally suggest that these coals have been weathered, the intensity of this alteration increasing progressively towards the soil. According to the reflectance (Rr) values of 1. 7 – 1. 8 %, these coals have reached low volatile bituminous rank. In contrast to the reflectance, which does not exhibit any marked variation along the studied sections, Tmax, although classically considered as a rank parameter, increases progressively with decreasing distance from the surface. This Tmax increase {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in the hydrogen index (HI) and with an increase in oxygen index (OI). All these changes are undoubtedly consequential to weathering. Thus in the present case, Tmax must not be considered as a maturity indicator, but as an oxidation parameter like OI and the O/C atomic ratio. This conclusion is also supported by the positive correlation between Tmax and proportion of oxidised vitrinites (i. e. bearing oxidation marks) provided by <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis.</b> This peculiar behaviour of Tmax in response to the weathering of mature coals is in total contrast with its invariance during low-mature coal alteration. This finding obliges us to moderate or even to revise the conclusions of a previous work on mature coals sampled at outcrop [Int. J. Coal Geol. 44 (2000) 49] where higher Tmax than expected from Rr values, were supposed to have been necessarily caused by warm (and oxidizing) fluids...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in Geramat District of Lahat Regency, South Sumatra. An evaluation of the geological condition of the research area shown that the coal deposits were found in Muara Enim Formation as a coal-bearing formation. The method used was literature study, field observation and the laboratory work includes proximate and petrography analysis. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the environmental condition of coal based on the change of total sulphur content and to know the relation between ash content to calorific value.  As the result of proximate analysis conducted on five samples of coal, the research area obtained total sulphur (0, 21 - 1, 54 % adb), ash content (3, 16 - 71, 11 % adb) and gross calorific value (953 - 5676 cal/g. adb). Based on the result of <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> showed the maceral percentage of coal in research area composed by vitrinite (77, 8 - 87, 4 %), liptinite (0, 6 %), inertinite (8, 0 – 17, 6 %) and mineral matter concentration in the form of pyrite (1, 6 - 4, 6 %). The average reflectance value of vitrinite (Rv) of coal in the research area (0. 54 %). the results analysis shows that the coal in Muara Enim Formation on the research area is in the transitional lower delta plain depositional environment phase. Any changes in the sedimentary environment affected by sea water will be followed by changes in total sulphur and the higher ash content, on the contrary, the lower calorific value of the coal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSantonian–Paleocene marls {{and fine}} grained carbonates have been sampled in Hasbayya locality, south Lebanon, {{in order to}} {{evaluate}} their organic matter (OM) content, petroleum source rock potential, and assess their depositional environment. Methods included total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total sulphur (TS), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic and inorganic petrography, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and Curie-point-pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (CP-Py-GC–MS). TOC, Rock-Eval, and vitrinite reflectance (VRr) results reveal excellent immature petroleum source rocks within the Campanian–lower Maastrichtian interval with TOC up to 11. 6 wt%, hydrogen index (HI) up to 872 mg/gTOC, Tmax up to 433 °C and VRr average of 0. 36 %. Biomarker ratios and <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> suggest a marine depositional environment with a dominance of algal as well as submicroscopic OM. Original sediment composition and redox sensitive geochemical parameters suggest deposition of the OM rich intervals under an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that was emplaced and controlled by primary productivity and nutrient supply. Pyrolysate composition shows an important content of organic sulphur compounds (thiophenes) increasing with TOC and thus indicating the presence of Type II and Type IIS kerogen in the analysed sample set, {{which is consistent with}} the presence of immature solid bitumen in the Hasbayya region. The data produced in this study, coupled with regional correlations, allow us to construct a conceptual depositional model for the Upper Cretaceous OM rich rocks of the eastern Mediterranean suggesting deposition under a productivity belt localized along the inner and outer shelf leading to a decrease in source rock quality and a shift in kerogen type toward the deeper parts of the Levant Basin...|$|E
40|$|Core {{samples of}} coal and rock were {{obtained}} from the HQ- 1 environmental test well at the Pricetown I, Underground Coal Gasification Test Site. A comprehensive analytical program was performed to characterize the coal samples. The rocks associated with the coals are composed of clay size material containing low amounts of organic matter and hydrocarbon gas relative to the coal seams. The fine grained sediment above and below the coal seams appear to be an effective gas seal. The coals were encountered in two intervals of 1 foot and 6 feet thickness separated by 2 feet of shale. The coals are classified as high volatile A or B bituminous based on vitrinite reflectance, fixed carbon, and calorific value. Coal <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> shows that the coal is heterogeneous in petrographic properties. The vitrinite group is the predominant maceral constituent. Fusinite, semi-fusinite, massive micrinite, and sporinite are present in varying amounts. The distribution of porous fusinite layers within the coal seams may be important in the reverse linkage stage of the gasification process. The coal in the bottom seam contains an average of 45. 6 standard cubic feet of free methane per ton of coal. This methane may assist in initiating the gasification process. Thermal Conductivity and Laser Thermal Diffusivity experiments were also performed on selected coal samples as well as on samples of the grout used in the instrumentation wells. While the thermal conductivity values were influenced by the tars and oils generated during the heating of the coal, the laser thermal diffusivity values were obtained at sufficiently low temperatures to minimize the influence of the tars and oils...|$|E

Preliminary results include mass accumulation rates of organic carbon at Site 679 and characteristics of the organic facies for sediments from Sites 679, 681, and 684. Organic-carbon contents are high, with few exceptions. Particularly high values were determined in the Pliocene interval at Site 684 (4 %- 7. 5 %) {{and in the early}} Pliocene to Quaternary section of Hole 679 D (2 %- 9 %). Older sediments at this site have distinctively lower organic-carbon contents (0. 2 %- 2. 5 %). Mass accumulation rates of organic matter at Site 679 are 0. 02 to 0. 07 g carbon/cm 2 /k. y. for late Miocene to early Pliocene sediments and higher by a factor of 5 to 10 in the Quaternary sediments. The organic matter in all samples has a predominantly marine planktonic and bacterial origin, with minor terrigenous contribution. Organic particle sizes are strikingly small, so that only a minor portion is covered by visual <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis.</b> Molecular organic-geochemical data were obtained for nonaromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons (including sulfur compounds), alcohols, ketones, esters, and carboxylic acids. Among the total extractable lipids, long-chain unsaturated ketones from Prymnesiophyte algae strongly predominate among the gas chromatography (GC) amenable components. Steroids are major constituents of the ketone and free- and bound-alcohol fractions. Perylene is the most abundant aromatic hydrocarbon, whereas in the nonaromatic hydrocarbon fractions, long-chain n-alkanes from higher land plants predominate, although the total terrigenous organic matter proportion in the sediments is small...|$|E
40|$|The Sunnyside Member of the Upper Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation in the Book Cliffs {{of eastern}} Utah is {{composed}} of coal-bearing coastal-plain strata and wave-dominated shoreface deposits. The member includes a thick (up to 6 m), laterally extensive coal seam, which formed in a large ombrotrophic raised mire, parallel to the shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway. The petrographic composition of the Sunnyside coal was investigated by means of <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis</b> and telovitrinite reflectance determinations of closely spaced samples taken from seven vertical sections through the seam. Sampling {{was carried out in}} a combination of outcrop and underground mine sites, using lithotype logging to determine sample spacing. The excellent exposure in the study area enables accurate stratigraphic correlation between sampling localities, which are spread over more than 30 km of depositional dip and 50 km of depositional strike. The correlation of petrographic trends between the seven sampled sections demonstrates the reproducibility of the results and Suggests that they represent regional-scale accommodation changes, as opposed to localised variation in the mire. On this basis, we are able to identify a high-resolution record of accommodation change throughout the deposition of the Sunnyside coal, spanning two cycles of increasing and decreasing accommodation. We are also able to identify a marine flooding surface within the coal, which can be traced down depositional dip into the time-equivalent shallow-marine strata, where it represents a parasequence boundary. The proportion of detrital minerals is used as the main discriminator of accommodation trends within the coal. Other useful indicators of conditions in the mire include semifusinite, pyrite, and isometamorphic variations in telovitrinite reflectance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The lignite samples were put together to form composite bands on the basis of similar megascopic characteristics and each composite band is taken as one composite sample and has been given unique sample number. The lignite samples were crushed, and reduced in quantity through quartering and coning, and subjected to various analyses. The - 18 -mesh samples were used for preparation of polished lignite mounts for petrography.

40|$|Introduction Maceral {{is a term}} to {{introduce}} organic components visible under a microscope (Stopes, 1935). The physical and chemical characteristics of macerals such as elemental composition, moisture content, hardness, density and petrographic characteristics differ. The differences in the physical and chemical characteristics of macerals are reflected in their industrial behavior. (Parkash, 1985). Petrographic analysis provides information on the various physical components of coals (Suwarna and Hemanto, 2007) and determination of quality of coal, coalification rate, composition and characteristics of coke and paleoenvironmental deposition (Taylor et al., 1998). Sampling and methodology Coal samples were collected from freshly mined coal from 11 coal seams of 4 active coal mines (Cheshlagh, Zemestan Yourt, Narges Chal and Cheshmehsaran) for organic petrography in the Gheshlagh coal deposits. All samples were collected and stored in plastic bags to prevent contamination and weathering. Samples were prepared for microscopic analysis by reflected light following ASTM Standard procedure D 2797 - 04. For microscopic study, coal samples were crushed to 1 -mm size fraction (18 mesh size), mounted in epoxy resin and polished. Three polished samples were prepared for each coal seam. The petrographic composition was obtained by maceral analyses under standard conditions (ISO 7404 / 3, 2009, for <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis).</b> Maceral point counting (based on 400 points) analyses were performed using an Olympus BX 51 reflected light microscope. The terminology used to identify and describe the organic matter particles is the one proposed by the International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology (ICCP, 1998; ICCP, 2001; Scott and Glasspool, 2007; Taylor et al., 1998; Stach et al., 1982; Hower et al., 2009; Hower and Wagner, 2012).

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifteen samples of Cenomanian–Turonian sediments from the Senegal margin basin, {{believed}} to be the main source rocks in the area, have been characterised to determine their organic facies and their oil-generating potential. The samples have been subjected to detailed organic petrographic studies (palynofacies, <b>maceral</b> <b>analysis,</b> vitrinite reflectance measurements) combined with Rock-Eval and Leco determinations. Total organic carbon values comprised between 0. 3 and 3. 5 % indicate poor to moderate primary bioproductivity and/or unfavourable organic matter (OM) preservation. Rather high C/N ratio values supported by the presence of well preserved ligno-cellulosic debris and of collotelinite suggest a notable contribution of terrestrial OM. This is supported by hydrogen and oxygen index values that testify to type III OM. S/C ratio values lower than 0. 36 together with the presence of abundant reworked organic particles indicate that the studied sediments were deposited in a transitional and mixing zone, between a coastal area with well oxygenated waters and a fully marine environment with more or less pronounced anoxia. The rather low marine productivity and poor OM preservation are here strongly reinforced by a very marked dilution of the OM by mineral inputs. In addition to these combined factors indicating that the OM is mainly of the gas prone-type, a moderate maturity is shown by Tmax and vitrinite reflectance values ranging from 435 to 445 °C and 0. 4 to 0. 9 %, respectively. The reservoir facies consisting of sandstones interbedded with shales, are characteristic of prograding fluvio-deltaic formations developed during Maastrichtian regression. Faults and ‘rollover' structures most probably constitute the main migration pathways and traps for hydrocarbons, respectively. Overall, the characteristics of the studied formations highlight the importance of local factors in OM accumulation, even during the so-called global Cenomanian–Turonian anoxic event...|$|E
