My flat's nothing special – two rooms – and I live as frugally as I possibly {{can to make sure}} I can campaign. I'm not trying to make myself out to be a martyr because this is my choice.|$|E
500|$|In February 1984, King briefly joined Dave Mustaine's new band Megadeth. Hanneman {{was worried}} about King's decision, stating in an interview, [...] "I guess we're gonna get a new guitar player." [...] While Mustaine wanted King to stay on a {{permanent}} basis, King left after five shows, stating Mustaine's band was [...] "taking too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time." [...] The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two bands.|$|E
500|$|Wolters did {{not attend}} the Nuremberg trial (he later {{described}} it as a [...] "victor's court" [...] and as a [...] "show trial") but wrote to Speer in January 1946, during the trial: [...] "I stand by you in misfortune as in the good days. [...] I believe as before in your lucky star." [...] On August 10, as the trial approached its conclusion, Speer, anticipating the likelihood of a death sentence, wrote to Wolters asking him to [...] "collect my work together for later ages and to recount <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. [...] I think it will be honored one day." [...] Despite his forebodings, Speer did not receive the death sentence, but on October 1, 1946, was given a sentence of twenty years in prison, [...] and on July 18, 1947, was transferred to Spandau Prison to serve it.|$|E

500|$|Benbow {{signed a}} three-year lease on Sayes Court in June 1696, a house {{belonging}} to diarist John Evelyn. Six months later, Evelyn {{wrote to a}} friend complaining, [...] "I have let my house to Captain Benbow, and have the mortification of seeing everyday <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> former labours and expenses there impairing {{for want of a}} more polite tenant." [...] In January 1698, Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship. He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, {{in order to be able}} to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with [...] "much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed". Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it [...] "entirely ruined". Benbow lost [...] "twenty fine paintings" [...] and [...] "several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea" [...] from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £350 9s. 6d. in compensation.|$|E
500|$|Teenage {{and adult}} fans have shown {{interest}} in clothing with {{images from the}} show; Erin Comella, brand manager for My Little Pony, said that these fans are [...] "literally dressed in the brand". Hasbro has been providing its licensed clothing vendors such as Hot Topic with My Little Pony-themed shirts and other apparel for all genders and multiple age groups. In part of the older fanbase, Hasbro has come to consider My Little Pony as a [...] "lifestyle" [...] brand, and , has arranged over 200 licenses across fifteen categories of products. According to Julie Duffy, Hasbro's vice president of global brand publicity, while their primary market is the young demographic, [...] " [...] found ways to strike the right balance by working with licensees to offer [...] adult fans exciting merchandise geared just for them". Though Hasbro has not revealed how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony product sales are bolstered by the brony fandom, Caitlin Dewey of The Washington Post suggests that the continued success of the franchise four years after its introduction is tied in part to bronies' interest in the show and products, and Hasbro's williness to market products towards the adult audience.|$|E
500|$|In {{the false}} {{breaking}} news story, Lester Holt references the 2007 monster movie Cloverfield. After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she saw him on The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit! I could have sworn you watch The Early Show on CBS", to which Liz replies, [...] "The Early Show? What am I, in a hospital?". Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|E

500|$|In a {{study of}} a working-class lesbian {{community}} in Buffalo, New York, in the 1940s and 1950s, The Well of Loneliness was the only work of lesbian literature anyone had read or heard of. For many young lesbians in the 1950s, {{it was the only}} source of information about lesbianism. The Wells name recognition made it possible to find when bookstores and libraries did not yet have sections devoted to LGBT literature. As late as 1994, an article in Feminist Review noted that The Well [...] "regularly appears in coming-out stories– and not just those of older lesbians". It has often been mocked: Terry Castle says that [...] "like many bookish lesbians I seem to have spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> adult life making jokes about it", and Mary Renault, who read it in 1938, remembered laughing at its [...] "earnest humourlessness" [...] and [...] "impermissible allowance of self-pity". Yet it has also produced powerful emotional responses, both positive and negative. One woman was so angry at the thought of how The Well would affect an [...] "isolated emerging lesbian" [...] that she [...] "wrote a note in the library book, to tell other readers that women loving women can be beautiful". A Holocaust survivor said, [...] "Remembering that book, I wanted to live long enough to kiss another woman." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Cody was {{impressed}} with the production design team's creation of the set from only a few sentences in her script, calling Juno's bedroom [...] "a very emotional set for [...] because it reminded me so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own little habitat when I was a teenager." [...] The walls of Juno's room are covered with posters of bands, while Leah's room includes a mural of older men whom she finds attractive, and Paulie's room is designed to be overly childlike to indicate his innocence. Production designer Steve Saklad designed Mark and Vanessa's house with the assumption that [...] "Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what's in them as best she could." [...] Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the [...] "Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film" [...] category. She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were [...] "simple and very tasteful" [...] but with an [...] "anal-retentive quality," [...] while dressing Mark in conservative clothing that complements Vanessa's taste. It was Page's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater-vests. Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back, as well as a third [...] "real" [...] belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts. The footage displayed on Juno's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post-production.|$|E

2500|$|Tutu had {{announced}} he would retire from public life when he turned 79 in October 2010.

2500|$|In any case, Price {{was pleased}} with the result, writing that Lovecraft [...] "was right of course in {{discarding}} all but the basic outline. I could only marvel that he had made so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> inadequate and bungling start." [...] The story appeared under both authors' bylines in the July 1934 issue of Weird Tales; Price's draft was published as [...] "The Lord of Illusion" [...] in Crypt of Cthulhu No. 10 in 1982.|$|E

And looking back now it still frightens me a little bit to think that so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life was totally devoted to Star Trek and almost nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taupin on his art: [...] "I don’t feel {{brighter}} colors necessarily constitute upbeat feelings although without contradiction {{they can}} accomplish the job if the emotion {{is one of}} simple joy. However, in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work darker colors such as blacks and deep blues might convey the depth of musical genres such as the Blues and Jazz or old school Folk and Country. These musical forms are the blueprint of much of what I create {{so it could be}} said that their emotion and passion, which is exhilarating, brings a deeper style of muted exuberance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've not <b>much</b> control <b>of</b> <b>my</b> thoughts, but I'll do my best," [...] said Isabel. Henrietta {{gazed at}} her, in silence, {{for a period}} which tried Isabel's patience, so that our heroine added at last: [...] "Do you mean that you're going to be married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Myrtle, hesitatingly, [...] "I {{am quite}} wrong, {{and the strange}} man had no {{intention}} of doing himself an injury.

60|$|On {{gaining a}} clear place and looking round me, I found to my delight {{that in spite}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> adventures I had not been <b>much</b> out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> way.

It has been many years since I last visited Greece. My last employment was as a clerk at a government office under the Ministry of Public Works of Egypt. I know English, French, and a little Italian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eliot {{also made}} {{significant}} contributions to the field of literary criticism, strongly influencing the school of New Criticism. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a [...] "by-product" [...] of his [...] "private poetry-workshop" [...] But the critic William Empson once said, [...] "I do not know for certain how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own mind [...] invented, let alone {{how much of it is}} a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Johnson, {{creating}} the book involved [...] "9 years of writing, 16 drafts, [...] 3 deletion attempts [...] " [...] While working on Pym, Johnson also finished three critically acclaimed graphic novels – Hellblazer: Papa Midnite (2005), Incognegro (2008), Dark Rain: A New Orleans Story (2010) – and a fourth, as yet unnamed graphic novel scheduled {{for publication in}} 2012. In an interview with Mike Emery, Johnson stated {{that there were many}} times when he thought that Pym [...] "was taking too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> time, and it was taking me in the wrong direction". He credits his wife, journalist Meera Bowman Johnson (to whom he dedicated Pym), and friends with persuading him to continue with the novel.|$|E
