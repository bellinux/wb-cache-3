40|$|The Monetary Control Act of 1980 {{requires}} the Federal Reserve System to provide payment services to depository institutions through the twelve Federal Reserve Banks at prices that fully reflect the costs a private-sector provider would incur, including {{a cost of}} equity capital (COE). Although Fama and French (1997) conclude that COE estimates are “woefully” and “unavoidably” imprecise, the Reserve Banks require such an estimate every year. We examine several COE estimates based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and compare them using econometric and <b>materiality</b> <b>criteria.</b> Our {{results suggest that the}} benchmark CAPM applied to a large peer group of competing firms provides a COE estimate that is not clearly improved upon by using a narrow peer group, introducing additional factors into the model, or taking account of additional firm-level data, such as leverage and line-of-business concentration. Thus, a standard implementation of the benchmark CAPM provides a reasonable COE estimate, which is needed to impute costs and set prices for the Reserve Banks’ payments business.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} audit materiality {{in regard to the}} disclosure of environmental matters in financial reports. Its purpose is to reveal auditors’ views and practices when judging the materiality of environmental matters. It also highlights implications for how environmental matters are audited and for the reliability of financial reporting by firms whose activities may generate adverse environmental effects. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-seven senior public and private sector financial auditors in New Zealand. The findings reveal that auditors’ interpretations of <b>materiality</b> <b>criteria</b> tend to preclude them from considering environmental matters in their audits. This contributes to a ‘type II audit expectation gap’ – i. e. a gap between the expectations of standards setters and the practices of auditors (Specht and Waldron, 1992) – which impedes the achievement of appropriate, independent assurance on environmental matters in financial reports. This paper is the first to draw on interview evidence from auditors to examine how they deal with the issue of materiality in regard to this important, emerging aspect of audit practice. This study was conducted in a New Zealand context only. However, since auditors’ duties are similar the world over, the findings point to general avenues for promoting improved practice in regard to the audit of environmental matters...|$|E

30|$|Three of {{the four}} {{criteria}} of GRI (GRI 2016, 9 – 18) {{are consistent with those}} from Wang and Strong (1996) as found in Table  2 Materiality is exclusive to GRI and provides recommendations for the prioritization of topics in reports (GRI 2016, 11 f). At first sight, this might suggest a trade-off with the criterion of completeness. Yet, it is not, as completeness has to be understood as scope, boundary, and time of the report incorporating the measure of prioritization as well as the practices of information collection (GRI 2016, 12 f and 17). Therefore, it is a prioritization principle that is applied when compiling the measures to include in the report. It does not affect the information quality of the reported measures once they have been selected. Hence, we refrained from including <b>materiality</b> as a <b>criterion.</b>|$|R
40|$|The studies {{carried out}} on {{disclosure}} {{in the last two}} decades have created great interest in the narrative section of corporate reporting. However, despite the undoubted effects of disclosure on the efficiency of the capital markets, as empirical research has shown, the significant increase in information in corporate reporting and the lack of adequate regulation have contributed to incrementing the complexity, subjectivity and unreliability of disclosure. There is a strong consensus in the financial community on the essential role of disclosure in corporate financial reports, with the result that many standard setters have increased their efforts to develop a framework for disclosures. Among others, in July 2012, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group published a Discussion Paper, “Towards a Disclosure Framework for Notes”, and in October 2012, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published the Discussion Paper “Thinking about disclosure in a broader context” that aimed to address the underlying principles and content of corporate disclosure to assist standard setters in developing disclosure requirements on a more consistent basis using a set of agreed principles. From an interpretative and critical perspective of qualitative analysis, this paper examines the main characteristics of the two kinds of disclosure and compares them in order to verify how they fit in with the necessity to rationalize and simplify the current disclosure regime and to create a Framework that may lead to an equilibrium between costs/benefits and providing entity-specific information/comparability. The analysis presented here is supported by an examination of the vast literature on the subject with the aim of highlighting how the two papers in question respond to the issues arising from studies on disclosure. The results of the analysis show that the two Disclosure Frameworks apply different approaches with few similarities. This situation could create various initiatives that complicate the debate on disclosure framework and the identification of disclosure requirements on a more consistent basis of agreed principles. Additionally, the critical analysis underlines the gap between the EFRAG and FRC discussion papers and the features of high quality disclosure identified by the main studies on disclosure. Finally, it presents some reflections about the identification of the key principles for a better disclosure such as user’s needs, placement <b>criteria,</b> <b>materiality</b> and comparability starting from the Conceptual Framework of financial statement. This paper encourages debate on the narrative part of the financial statement and the importance of finding a framework for disclosure that would eliminate the tendency to present a boilerplate lacking in relevance and comparability...|$|R
