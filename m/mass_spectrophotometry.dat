50|$|From the {{laboratory}} reconstructions of ancient RNases, it is shown {{that each of}} these traits was absent in the most recent common ancestor of seminal and pancreatic RNase and a bit later arose in the seminal lineage after the divergence of the above two protein families. The RNase genes from all taxa in a true ruminant phylogenetic tree that was constructed by parsimony analysis were analyzed by the researchers, and they revealed that early after the gene duplication, pancreatic RNases and seminal RNases separated at about 35 million years ago (MYA). Several marker substitutions, including Pro 19, Cys 32 and Lys 62, have been introduced in seminal RNase genes which made them to be recognized as different from their pancreatic cousins. Based on this, the seminal RNase family includes the taxa called saiga, sheep, duiker, kudu and cape buffalo, while peccary has been excluded from it. Later on, from the sequence analyses, <b>mass</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> and western blotting studies on taxa that comes under the seminal RNase gene family, it has been revealed that they are consistent with the model which assumes that immediately after duplication the seminal RNase gene gained a physiological function and this function has been continued throughout the divergent evolution (each copy of gene gets evolved independently) and later on it was lost in all other species including modern kudu and cape buffalo except in modern oxen. This would require, however, that this function was lost independently multiple times in different lineages.|$|E

Two new {{phosphorus}} complexes, potassium trichlorothiocyanophosphate (III) (PTCTCP; K[PCl 3 (SCN) ]) {{and potassium}} trichlorocyanophosphate (III) (PTCCP; K[PCl 3 (CN) ]) were synthesized from {{the reaction of}} KSCN and KCN, respectively, with PC^. The chemical formulas and compositions of these compounds were determined by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods, such as phosphorus- 31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (31 P-NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and <b>mass</b> <b>spectrophotometry.</b> All of the theoretical calculations and determinations of the properties of these compounds were performed {{as part of the}} Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program. Excitation energies were assessed using time-dependent perturbation density functional theory (TD-DFT). In addition, the molecular geometry was optimized and the frequencies and excitation energies were calculated using standard Slater-type orbital (STO) basis sets with triple-zeta quality double plus polarization functions (TZ 2 P) for all of the atoms. The assignment of the principal transitions and total densities of state (TDOS) for orbital analysis were performed using the GaussSum 2. 2 program. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} artificial pigments in the food industry, imposed by the international market, have increased the importance of raw materials containing natural pigments. Of those natural substances with potential applications turmeric rhizomes (Curcuma longa L), {{are one of the most}} important natural sources of yellow coloring. Three different pigments (curcumin, desmetoxycurcumin, and bis-desmetoxycurcumin) constitute the curcuminoids. These pigments are largely used in the food industry as substitutes for synthetic dyes like tartrazin. Extraction of curcuminoids from tumeric rhizomes with supercritical CO 2 can be applied as an alternative method to obtain curcuminoids, as natural pigments are in general unstable, and hence degrade when submitted to extraction with organic solvents at high temperatures. Extraction experiments were carried out in a supercritical extraction pilot plant at pressures between 25 and 30 MPa and a temperature of 318 K. The influence of drying pretreatment on extraction yield was evaluated by analyzing the mass transfer kinetics and the content of curcuminoids in the extracts during the course of extraction. The chemical identification of curcuminoids in both the extract and the residual solid was performed by <b>spectrophotometry.</b> <b>Mass</b> transfer within the solid matrix was described by a linear first-order desorption model, while that in the gas phase was described by a convective mass transfer model. Experimental results showed that the concentration profile for curcuminoids during the supercritical extraction process was higher when the turmeric rhizomes were submitted to a drying pretreatment at 343 K...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop 3 -acyl prodrugs of the potent {{analgesic}} morphine- 6 -sulfate (M 6 S). These {{are expected to have}} higher potency and/or exhibit longer duration of analgesic action than the parent compound. M 6 S and the prodrugs were synthesized, then purified either by recrystallization or by semi-preparative HPLC and the structures confirmed by <b>mass</b> spectrometry, IR <b>spectrophotometry</b> and by detailed 1 - and 2 -D NMR studies. The lipophilicities of the compounds were assessed by a combination of shake-flask, group contribution and HPLC retention methods. The octanol-buffer partition coefficient could only be obtained directly for 3 -heptanoylmorphine- 6 -sulfate, using the shake-flask method. The partition coefficients (P) for the remaining prodrugs were estimated from known methylene group contributions. A good linear relationship between log P and the HPLC log capacity factors was demonstrated. Hydrolysis of the 3 -acetyl prodrug, {{as a representative of the}} group, was found to occur relatively slowly in buffers (pH range 6. 15 - 8. 01), with a small buffer catalysis contribution. The rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of the 3 -acyl group in 10 % rat blood and in 10 % rat brain homogenate were investigated. The prodrugs followed apparent first order hydrolysis kinetics, with a significantly faster hydrolysis rate found in 10 % rat brain homogenate than in 10 % rat blood for all compounds.

40|$|The {{flavonoids}} {{represent an}} important group of pigment {{that occurs in}} the plant kingdom. The flavones, one of the flavonoids, possess interesting biological actions. The antioxidant activity of flavones {{is reported to be}} associated with those bearing hydroxyl functions. In the present study, several steps of reaction have been carried out to synthesize the derivatives of luteolin, which are polyhydroxyl flavones. The first step of the reaction was the methylation of 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyacetophenone with methyl iodide to afford 2 -hydroxy- 4, 6 -dimethoxyacetophenone. On aldol condensation of 2 -hydroxy- 4, 6 - dimethoxyacetophenone with 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde yielded 3, 4, 4, 6 - tetramethoxychalcone. This was followed by the oxidative cyclisation of chalcone with SeO 2 to give 3, 4, 5, 7 -tetramethoxyflavone. The protection of hydroxyl functions of 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyacetophenone and 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde with methoxy methyl chloride to form 2 -hydroxy- 4, 6 -bis(methoxymethyloxy) -acetophenone and 3, 4 -bis (methoxymethyloxy) -benzaldehyde was carried out. Both compounds were reacted via the aldol condensation to form 3, 4, 4, 6 -tetrakis(methoxymethyloxy) -chalcone. Treatment of 3, 4, 4, 6 -tetrakis(methoxymethyloxy) -chalcone with excessive sodium acetate afforded us 3, 4, 5, 7 -tetrahydroxyflavanone or eriodictyol (39) as a single product in high yield. The free radical scavenging activity of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical by synthesized flavonoids using the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique and UV spectrophotometry method showed that 3, 4, 5, 7 - tetrahydroxyflavanone is a strong antioxidant. Compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques, i. e. infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV) <b>spectrophotometry,</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR and 13 C NMR) ...|$|R
