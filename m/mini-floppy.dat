50|$|A 3.5 inch 1.44MB <b>mini-floppy</b> {{diskette}} contains 80 tracks, 8 sectors per track, and 512 bytes per sector.This technique {{refers to}} formatting an 80-track 1.44MB diskette as a 40-track 720KB diskette.|$|E
50|$|The 88/MS (Mass Storage) was {{a cabinet}} housing dual, 8-inch (full size) floppy drives. It was {{available}} with either single- or double-sided disk drives, both using double-density recording on hard-sectored media. The 88/MS {{could be added}} onto either an 8813 or 8810 system. The largest Poly configurations would contain three <b>mini-floppy</b> drives and four full-size drives, with drive numbers from 1 to 7.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a series of “Health Awareness” programs in Applesoft BASIC for a 32 K APPLE II computer. These include one program emphasizing risk factors for coronary heart disease, two on weight and weight control, and two on more general life habits which influence health. These five programs, {{an introduction to the}} APPLE keyboard, and a program menu reside on one APPLE <b>mini-floppy</b> disk...|$|E
40|$|A very efficient, very precise, {{economical}} {{and compact}} Airgun Shotmark Recording System (ASR- 80 R) was developed. The purpose of ASR- 80 R {{system is to}} gain origin times of airgun or explosion for seismic reflection/refraction study using an ocean bottom seismometer. The system using a microprocessor can save approximately 340 of airgun firing time within ± 2 miliseconds precision. The maximum recording time is 3 hours for 30 seconds airgun firing interval time by digital form. On shipboard, the firing times are stored in IC memory, and then these are loaded on an audio cassette tape by 1, 200 Baud-rate. The loading time is very short: approximately 30 seconds. The data obtained on shipboard using the above system are transferred from IC memory of the ASR- 80 R to <b>mini-floppy</b> disk in the IDS- 8000 Z microcomputer system at a land-based laboratory...|$|E
