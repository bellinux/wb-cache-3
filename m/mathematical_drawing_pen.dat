50|$|In the 17th century, a stylus {{that could}} {{draw a line}} with a {{specific}} width called a ruling pen was developed. The stylus had two curved metal pieces which were joined by a screw. Ink was trickled between the blades, from which it flowed evenly across the paper. The basic model was maintained for a long time, with minor modifications, until the 1930s when the German technical <b>drawing</b> <b>pens</b> came to the market.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Virtual physics environments are {{becoming}} increasingly popular as a teaching tool for high school level mechanical physics. While useful, these tools often offer a complex user interface, lacking the intuitive nature of the traditional whiteboard. Furthermore, the systems are often too advanced {{to be used by}} novice students for further experimentation. In this paper we describe a physics learning environment using multicolour sketch recognition techniques on digital whiteboards. The recognition system is based on a combination of Support Vector Machines and rule based methods. By assigning the various drawing modes to different physical <b>drawing</b> <b>pens,</b> we can resolve several ambiguities appearing in single pen sketching interfaces. Moreover, we argue that we can reduce the cognitive load of the user by exploiting the physical realisation of drawing modes in the form of <b>drawing</b> <b>pens,</b> instead of using textual descriptions of the modes on the screen. The system was tested using a constructive interaction method, with users completing a set task; first in a multi-pen drawing environment, and then for comparison purposes in a singlepen equivalent.

His father, Gerardus Cornelis Adolfs, was an architect and a versatile amateur (painter, photographer, piano and violin player {{as well as}} a pole vaulter). Adolfs studied architecture in Amsterdam. After graduating, he was drawn back to Java, where he designed houses in Yogyakarta, Surakarta and Surabaya. But soon he swapped the <b>drawing</b> <b>pen</b> for the dry-point, pencil and brush and from then on dedicated his whole life to painting.|$|R

Flatly and freely painted in brilliant colors, his works have often been executed on a grand scale, as in the outdoor wall painting, Woman with bicycle, at West Houston and MacDougal Streets in Manhattan. He mostly creates painting, sculpture and wall paintings using media such as acrylic, collage, fresco, ink <b>drawing</b> (<b>Pen</b> and Ink), mixed media/multimedia, and oil.|$|R

50|$|In drawing, plastic's {{specific}} {{advantages over}} translucent paper are higher mechanical strength and dimensional accuracy; plastic does not, unlike paper, shrink or stretch with changing air humidity. Plastic is {{also as a}} surface completely flat, while the surface of paper is relatively rough. Plastic is suitable for both pencils and <b>drawing</b> <b>pens.</b> However, the surface tends to wear the pen tips, which must be made of hard-metal alloy. Ordinary ink is not absorbed into the plastic at all, so the lines can easily be removed with an eraser. Photocopier marks can be removed by scraping.|$|R
