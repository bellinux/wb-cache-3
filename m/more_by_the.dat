5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Paul Due (1835–1919) and his son, Paul Armin Due (1870–1926). Original stations between Stjørdal and Levanger were designed by Paul Due, while those from Rinnan to Byafossen, as well as Hell Station, were designed by Paul Armin Due. The designs are characterized by the transition period between Dragestil and Art Nouveau, with early stations dominated <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> former and later stations <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> latter. Norway went through a nationalistic period during the construction, and Paul Due chose to replace his older buildings' foreign elements with traditional Norwegian elements. Røra and Byafossen were the only stations not custom designed, while Sunnan was designed by Peter Andreas Blix—as it was originally built at Hell in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of this century.|$|E

5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, the {{battalion}} continued patrolling operations beyond the Waitavalo–Tol area but no further contact was made. On 21 March {{when they were}} relieved once <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 19th Battalion. A week later, on 28 March, the 13th Brigade began to relieve the units of the 6th Brigade, and over the following fortnight the transition took place. On 12 April {{the battalion}} returned to Kalai where they received the news {{that they were being}} returned to Australian for rest and re-organisation in preparation for further operations. On 7 May 1945 they embarked upon the troopship Duntroon, arriving in Brisbane a week later.|$|E
5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa {{is quite different}} from what is commonly understood by violence. The violence is defined <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E

5|$|In January 1954, Muong Khoua was re-occupied by Laotian forces, {{which were}} {{subsequently}} overrun once <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 316th Division of the Viet Minh. The Laotian commander, {{who lived in}} the village itself with his wife, was killed in his home before the attack. Battalions of the French Foreign Legion and Laotian forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.|$|E
5|$|The Conventional Enhancement Modification (CEM) program {{gave the}} B-52H a more {{comprehensive}} conventional weapons capability, adding the modified underwing weapon pylons used by conventional-armed B-52Gs, Harpoon and Have Nap, and the capability to carry new-generation weapons including the Joint Direct Attack Munition and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser guided bombs, the AGM-154 glide bomb and the AGM-158 JASSM missile. The CEM program also introduced new radios, integrated Global Positioning System into the aircraft's navigation system and replaced the under-nose FLIR with a more modern unit. Forty-seven B-52Hs were modified under the CEM program by 1996, with 19 <b>more</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of 1999.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{began to}} {{increase}} earlier than forecast models anticipated, causing the storm to weaken into a minimal tropical storm later that morning. Around 1830UTC, {{the center of}} Erika passed over the island of Guadeloupe with winds of 40mph (65km/h) as the storm entered the eastern Caribbean Sea. The circulation later became elongated and began to degenerate into a trough of low pressure. The NHC noted that due to the large size of the overall system, the center of Erika could reform elsewhere and restrengthen. Following a brief increase in convective activity, the storm slightly intensified before succumbing to wind shear once <b>more.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of September3, the center of Erika was fully devoid of convection and the NHC downgraded it to a tropical depression. Shortly after, the system degenerated into a remnant low, coinciding with the issuance of the final advisory from the NHC. The following day, the remnants approached the southern coast of Puerto Rico, producing heavy rainfall across the island. The system was last noted later on September4 as it dissipated roughly 80mi (140km) south of Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|The {{aesthetics}} {{of the new}} rave scene {{are similar to those}} of the original rave scene, being mostly centred on psychedelic visual effects.

Trash Fashion lead singer, Jet Storm, and Electro heroine Uffie, have been described as the scene's very own pin ups. Nevertheless, the use of electronic instruments, a musical fusion of rock and dance styles, and a particular anarchic, trashy energy are certainly key elements.|$|E
