And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth.

500|$|Knowing that {{prosecutors}} {{were about to}} publicly disclose her past addiction, McCain preemptively revealed the story to reporters, saying that she was doing so willingly: [...] "Although my conduct {{did not result in}} compromising any missions of AVMT, <b>my</b> <b>actions</b> were wrong, and I regret them ... if what I say can help just one person to face the problem, it's worthwhile." ...|$|E

500|$|Besides 3D effects, {{the filmmakers}} also used 2D artwork and {{drawings}} for specific elements and sequences in the film, including Elsa's magic and snow sculptures, {{as well as}} freezing fountains and floors. The effects group created a [...] "capture stage" [...] where the entire world of Frozen gets displayed on monitors, which can be [...] "filmed" [...] on special cameras to operate a three-dimensional scene. [...] "We can take this virtual set that's mimicking all of <b>my</b> <b>actions</b> {{and put it into}} any one of our scenes in the film," [...] said technology manager Evan Goldberg.|$|E
500|$|In his {{petition}} to Huckabee, Clemmons wrote {{he came from}} [...] "a very good Christian family" [...] and was [...] "raised much better than <b>my</b> <b>actions</b> speak". Clemmons claimed he had just moved from Seattle, Washington, to Arkansas as a teenager, and {{because he had no}} friends he gave in to peer pressure and [...] "fell in with the wrong crowd" [...] to be accepted by his young peers, which led him to commit his crimes. Although he apologized for his actions, Clemmons also complained that he received overly harsh sentences. He also claimed to have changed and expressed regret that his mother had recently died without seeing him turn his life around. Clemmons' clemency application was supported by Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Marion Humphrey, who argued the cumulative sentence was excessive and cited Clemmons' young age at the time he committed the crimes.|$|E
500|$|Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did {{not have}} a major film success. She {{appeared}} in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion is that because of <b>my</b> <b>actions</b> against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E

500|$|In March 2015, Gonzalez {{pleaded guilty}} to two felonies: [...] "entering or {{remaining}} in a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly weapon", and [...] "assaulting a federal officer". In May 2015, Gonzalez {{pleaded guilty to}} the counts of evading police and possessing a sawed-off shotgun in Virginia. He was sentenced to a 15-year suspended sentence and 10 years of supervision. On June 16, 2015 District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sentenced him to a 17-month prison sentence {{to be followed by}} three years of probation. Collyer also ordered Gonzalez to stay out of Washington, D.C., give the secret Service access to his medical records, and give up his firearms and weapons. She addressed Gonzalez directly, saying [...] "No more guns, no more machetes, no more knives, no more tomahawks. Got it?" [...] Gonzalez said [...] "I would like to apologize. I am sorry for <b>my</b> <b>actions.</b> I never meant to harm anyone. I want to commit to maintain my treatment that started at the prison." [...] Prosecutor Vincent Cohen, who had recommended 18 months in prison, stated [...] "Mr. Gonzalez is now paying the price for his foolish decision to jump the fence and run inside the White House. The prison sentence imposed by the court should deter others from taking actions that needlessly put the First Family and White House employees at risk." ...|$|E
