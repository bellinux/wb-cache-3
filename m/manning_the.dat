5|$|Executions in England were public until 1868. That {{year the}} law changed, mandating executions {{would take place}} privately and inside the prison. In 1868 Calcraft carried out the last public and first private executions.

5|$|However, {{this plan}} only applied to men <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> {{walls of the}} fort, not the artillerymen who would be serving the fort's guns. To man the guns of Fort Greble and those of Washington's other forts, Barnard {{designated}} three crews for each gun. These crews would be permanently located at the fort, unlike the men assigned to {{the walls of the}} fort.|$|E

5|$|On {{the early}} morning flight to Fornebu, Lent engaged and shot down a Norwegian Gloster Gladiator.

With Kubisch <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.|$|E
5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first.

5|$|The {{departure}} of regular units under Ramorino and Łubieński depleted {{the forces of}} the defenders, further weakening the crew <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> first line of defence. The garrison dropped to 28,000 regular soldiers and 10,000 fresh troops, poorly trained and often armed only with scythes.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were {{supposed}} to be <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E

5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and the High Road. It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal <b>Manning.</b> <b>The</b> heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904.

5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding the {{trenches}} at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> trenches even as they were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli's first premiership was {{dominated}} by the heated debate over the Church of Ireland. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with Archbishop <b>Manning</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a Roman Catholic university in Dublin foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the Liberals under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.|$|E

Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division <b>manning</b> <b>the</b> second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
