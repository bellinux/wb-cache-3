5|$|Scientists {{have so far}} {{recognized}} {{only one}} class of geological feature on Umbriel—craters. The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and Titania. It shows the least geological activity. In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> craters than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers {{at the low end}} to 210kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo. All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks, but no crater has rays.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} Test, too, Ring's batting made <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> than his bowling. A wet pitch led to 22 wickets {{falling on the}} first day, and {{temporary}} Australian captain Arthur Morris rejigged his batting order {{at the end of}} the day, opening the second innings with Ian Johnson and Gil Langley, sending Geff Noblet in when Johnson was out and then Ring as a second nightwatchman when Noblet was out. Ring lasted into the second day when conditions were easier, and top-scored for the Australian team with 67, which remained his best score in Tests. He took three of the four wickets that fell as West Indies successfully chased a target of 233 on Christmas Day.|$|E
5|$|Observations have {{detected}} {{more than ten}} times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as {{is present in the}} Solar System. Since December 2012, there has been evidence of possibly five planets orbiting Tau Ceti, with two of these being potentially in the habitable zone. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> events than Earth. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, similarity and relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and it appears in some science fiction literature.|$|E

5|$|When {{the script}} was ready, Meiyappan's sons and the film's {{co-producers}} M. Saravanan, M. Kumaran and M. Murugan narrated it to Ganesan at his residence, Annai Illam. Ganesan initially rejected {{it as he}} felt the character of Dr. Gopal had <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> than the main character, Raju, and sought to film the portions involving Dr. Gopal in four days. However, on Meiyappan's insistence, Ganesan {{played the role of}} Raju. The role of Dr. Gopal went to S. A. Ashokan and Ganesan assisted him for acting in the scene where Dr. Gopal dies of a heart attack. S. V. Ramadoss was cast as Raju's father Sankaralingam, Major Sundarrajan as Raju's classmate, Vanishree as Raju's wife Parvathi, Sowcar Janaki as Raju's cousin Vimala, Sivakumar as Raju's son Sathyamurthy, and V. S. Raghavan portrayed Sathyamurthy's uncle Murugan.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
25|$|There are {{approximately}} twelve <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> craters/basins larger than 300km on the Moon, five on Mercury, and four on Mars. Large basins, some unnamed but mostly smaller than 300km, {{can also be}} found on Saturn's moons Dione, Rhea and Iapetus.|$|E
50|$|Factors {{affecting}} coverage density include: {{number of}} impacts (shot flow), exposure time, shot properties (size, chemistry), and work piece properties. Coverage is monitored by visual examination {{to determine the}} percent coverage (0-100%). Coverage beyond 100% cannot be determined. The number of individual impacts is linearly proportional to shot flow, exposure area, and exposure time. Coverage is not linearly proportional because of the random nature of the process (chaos theory). When 100% coverage is achieved, with an exposure time of 1T, locations on the surface have been impacted multiple times. At 150% coverage (1.5T), 5 or <b>more</b> <b>impacts</b> occur at 52% of locations. At 200% coverage (2T), 5 or <b>more</b> <b>impacts</b> occur at 84% of locations.|$|R
30|$|Even in {{the absence}} of visible particles, {{precipitation}} of furosemide led to a drug loss estimated at between 10 % and 15 %. Furosemide is <b>more</b> <b>impacted</b> by interaction because the pH of the mixture is acid and this form is poorly soluble in an aqueous solution.|$|R
50|$|Population {{confined}} to one geographic location {{does not have}} a simple option of migration- such as animals that live in cold regions at the tops of low-lying mountains. These animals are in habitats that will run out as climate change increases and global warming becomes <b>more</b> <b>impacted.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the West, several predators of youngling painted turtles {{have been}} {{introduced}} into waters where they never roamed before: bass, snapping turtles, and bullfrogs. Examination of bullfrogs and bass in Montana shows they are consuming few painted turtles. Snapping turtles may have <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> and, in Oregon, aggressive trapping {{has been done to}} remove them.|$|E
25|$|Though Magoon was obscure, Ballard {{would have}} <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> via the I Am {{movement}} he established. In 1935, Ballard claimed that, several years earlier, he and over 100 others witnessed {{the appearance of}} 12 Venusians in a cavern beneath Mount Shasta. The Venusians played music for the audience, said Ballard, then showed the crowd a large mirror-like device that displayed images of life on Venus. The Venusians then allegedly reported that the earth would suffer through an era of tension and warfare, followed by worldwide peace and goodwill.|$|E
25|$|Deming made a {{significant}} contribution to Japan's reputation for innovative, high-quality products, and for its economic power. He is regarded as having had <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> on Japanese manufacturing and business than any other individual not of Japanese heritage. Despite being honored in Japan in 1951 with the establishment of the Deming Prize, he was only just beginning to win widespread recognition in the U.S. {{at the time of his}} death in 1993. President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Technology in 1987. The following year, the National Academy of Sciences gave Deming the Distinguished Career in Science award.|$|E

50|$|The crater {{floor is}} more smooth {{and has a}} darker albedo in the western half, and {{gradually}} grows lighter and <b>more</b> <b>impacted</b> toward the east.

25|$|Giger's {{original}} {{design for the}} facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around {{the outside of the}} astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realised that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's faceplate with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger faceplate to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.|$|E

500|$|Along with feminist theory, {{the work}} of Michel Foucault, {{influenced}} by structuralism and post-structuralism, has {{had a significant impact}} on the study of gender in classical antiquity. [...] Foucault has been praised for looking at gender through the lens of social systems. [...] According to Lin Foxhall, his approach has [...] "had <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> on the scholarship of gender than anything since second-wave feminism" [...] and is [...] "virtually canonical in some quarters". [...] However, Foucault's work has been criticised for its [...] "shallow discussion of women as historical subjects".|$|E

50|$|Evolutionary {{psychologists have}} {{suggested}} {{that there is a}} gender difference in sexual jealousy driven by men and women's different reproductive biology. For men it is felt as a threat to his relationship's future because he could be cuckolded into raising children that are not his own. For women they can lose their relationship and all the benefits that entails to another. Research has shown that men are <b>impacted</b> <b>more</b> by sexual infidelity, while women are <b>more</b> <b>impacted</b> by emotional infidelity.|$|R
500|$|Ball based Lester's {{story on}} {{aspects of his}} own life. Lester's {{re-examination}} of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid-30s; like Lester, Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect. Scenes in Ricky's household reflect Ball's own childhood experiences. Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. Fitts, a man who [...] "gave up his chance to be himself". Ball said the script's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional, but that it came unconsciously from his own outlook on life. He said the juxtaposition produced a starker contrast, giving each trait <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> than if they appeared alone.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the failure}} of The Pioneer, Lowell {{continued}} {{his interest in the}} literary world. He wrote a series on [...] "Anti-Slavery in the United States" [...] for the Daily News, though his series was discontinued by the editors after four articles in May 1846. He had published these articles anonymously, believing that they would have <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> if they were not known to be the work of a committed abolitionist. In the spring of 1848, he formed a connection with the National Anti-Slavery Standard of New York, agreeing to contribute weekly either a poem or a prose article. After only one year, he was asked to contribute half as often to the Standard to make room for contributions from Edmund Quincy, another writer and reformer.|$|E
500|$|God Hates Us All was {{originally}} intended to be named Soundtrack to the Apocalypse. However, Araya suggested that the title would be better used for a box set, which the band released in 2003. The phrase God Hates Us All originates from the song [...] "Disciple", during which the line is repeated over the chorus. The lyrics are in reference to God's allowance of acts such as suicide and terrorism, while seemingly doing nothing to prevent them (see problem of evil). A member of the heavy metal band Pantera suggested using [...] "God Hates Us All" [...] for a shirt design after King played the song to the band. King agreed, although he thought the phrase would have <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> as the album title.|$|E

500|$|Antarctica is {{colder than}} the Arctic for three reasons. First, {{much of the}} {{continent}} is more than [...] above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have <b>more</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E
500|$|John Buchanan, {{who coached}} Australia {{during most of}} Gilchrist's {{international}} career, predicted that Gilchrist's retirement would have <b>more</b> <b>impact</b> than the previous year's retirements of Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne and Justin Langer and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd asked Gilchrist to reconsider. Gilchrist later revealed that he chose to retire after dropping VVS Laxman during the first innings, and realising {{that he had lost}} his [...] "competitive edge." [...] He played out the summer's ODI series, before ending in disappointment when India beat Australia 2–0 in the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series finals. Gilchrist managed only seven and two in the finals. His highlight of the series was his scoring 118 and being named Man of the Match in his final match at his adopted home in Perth on 15 February 2008, against Sri Lanka. He ended his final series with 322 runs at 32.20.|$|E
