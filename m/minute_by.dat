5|$|Before {{the start}} of extra time Cardiff made their first {{substitution}} of the match, goalscorer Mason was replaced by Filip Kiss. Liverpool had the first chance to score in extra time, but Suárez's header was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared to be playing for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team behind the ball and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had another chance in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his header was wide of the Cardiff goal. Immediately after the attack Carroll was replaced by Dirk Kuyt. Just {{before the end of the}} first half of extra time Liverpool had another chance.

5|$|Diaby {{began the}} 2010–11 season scoring a goal and issuing an {{assist in the}} team's second match of the season against Blackpool; a 6–0 win. During a match against Bolton at the Emirates Stadium on 11 September, he was injured after a {{challenge}} by Paul Robinson. Diaby was replaced in the 72nd <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Denílson in a 4–1 win. Due to the injury, he missed two weeks {{and return to the}} team in its 3–2 loss to West Bromwich Albion. Diaby featured primarily as a substitute after returning from the injury. On 5 February 2011, he was sent off after being adjudged to have committed violent conduct on opposing midfielder Joey Barton in a league match away to Newcastle. Prior to Diaby's expulsion, Arsenal had been leading the match 4–0. The team went on to concede four unanswered goals while playing with ten men, which resulted in the club leaving St James' Park with only a point. On 10 April, Diaby scored his second goal of the season in a 3–1 win against Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|Due to Milan {{winning the}} UEFA Champions League, Gourcuff was {{included}} in the squads that competed in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup and the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, though he didn't appear in the former match and appeared infrequently in the latter competition. In the 2007–08 Serie A season, Gourcuff struggled for playing time as he was in direct competition with the Brazilian international and 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year winner Kaká. Gourcuff's development and attitude at the club was also questioned by manager Carlo Ancelotti who critically stated that the player had psychological issues. Gourcuff only appeared in 15 league matches for the club starting only four. He scored his only goal of the season on 31 October 2007 in a 5–0 hammering of Sampdoria. On 24 February 2008, after appearing as a half-time substitute, Gourcuff assisted on the game-winning goal scored in the 90th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Filippo Inzaghi in Milan's 2–1 win over Palermo. In the final nine matches of the season, Gourcuff was an unused substitute in seven of them.

5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting tangled with Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbow– a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on Van Den Hauwe, by tackling the player without intent. Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance saved in the 75th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E
5|$|In late 1916 he was {{approached}} by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, who was arrested by the Ottomans, like he did for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli's refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli's life was saved at the last <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> fellow inmate, al-Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more months in jail, before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, {{who served as a}} deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience in jail and the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria.|$|E

After the unexpected defeat, the team faced the Chinese club, and Asian champion, Guangzhou Evergrande in the third place match, which it won 32 with an injury time goal. The Copa Libertadores victory also ensured the club a berth in the 2014 edition of the competition. In that season, Atlético was drawn in Group 4, together with Paraguay's Nacional, Venezuela's Zamora, and Santa Fe. The team finished the group in first place, with three wins and three draws, and advanced to the knockout stages, where it faced Colombian club Atlético Nacional. Atlético Mineiro lost the first leg 10 in Medellín and scored 10 in the second leg at home, but a goal in the 87th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Atlético Nacional meant elimination. Atlético also took part in the 2014 Recopa Sudamericana its first appearance in the competition, contested between the champions of the Libertadores and the Sudamericana. The club again faced Lanús in a continental final, and won the first leg 10 in Argentina. Despite scoring first in the second leg at the Mineirão, Atlético suffered a comeback, and the aggregate score was 33 after 90 minutes.

They reached {{the final of}} the 1995 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, coming up against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the fourth time in a row in this competition, and Al-Talaba won with a single goal scored by Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail, achieving their third Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup success. After Al-Zawra'a achieved a double in the 1993–94 season, the Iraq FA chose the FA Cup runners-up, Al-Talaba, as Iraq's representative in the 1995 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. Under the management of Ayoub Odisho, they defeated Al-Gharafa in the first leg in Doha 5–3 and lost in the second leg 1–0 at the Al-Shaab Stadium. In the second round, they came up against Yangiyer and lost 2–1 in Tashkent before they turned it around to win 2–0 in Baghdad with goals from Muhannad Mohammed and Qahtan Chathir. In the quarter-finals, Al-Talaba won their first leg against Bahman in Tehran 1–0 with a goal by Sabah Jeayer. At the Al-Shaab Stadium, Bahman won 1–0 for a 1–1 draw on aggregate. The match went to a golden goal decider which was scored by Chathir. Al-Talaba had now qualified for the semi-finals where they were drawn to meet Kazma SC of Kuwait but Kazma withdrew from the tournament, refusing to play against Al-Talaba because of political tensions between Iraq and other Persian Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, {{in the aftermath of the}} 1991 Gulf War. The AFC directed Al-Talaba to play against Al-Riyadh of Saudi-Arabia but they too withdrew for the same reason, and that meant Al-Talaba had a walkover through the semi-finals. In the final, Al-Talaba faced Bellmare Hiratsuka in Kanagawa where they were beaten 2–1 after the winning goal was scored in the 81st <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Hidetoshi Nakata.|$|E

Halliday made his senior debut in this match, and was named man of the match with an impressive performance at right back, before his loan was extended until 17 January 2015. Cameron Murray was loaned to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Frickley Athletic, where he made only one start during a one-month period. York went 2–0 down after 62 minutes when playing away against Bury, but fought back to draw 2–2 with Hyde scoring a header from a Coulson cross before Summerfield equalised with a 20-yard free kick. York achieved their first home win of the season by beating Accrington Stanley 1–0, meaning the club record of most home consecutive matches without a win, set at 14 in 1981–82, was not equalled. The winning goal was scored in the 35th <b>minute</b> <b>by</b> Lowe with a header from Coulson's cross. This was followed by a 3–0 away victory over Carlisle United, marking the first time York had achieved successive wins in 2014–15.
