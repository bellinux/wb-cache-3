5|$|In the meantime, the Oceanside Development Agency {{recommended}} that the new highway be extended west to Pacific Street to aid in redeveloping the downtown area. The San Diego Regional Coastal Commission disagreed with constructing the highway, among other development proposals for downtown Oceanside, due to concerns about destroying habitat along {{the river and the}} <b>marsh</b> <b>areas.</b> Soon after, in October1980, the California Coastal Commission recommended removing the realignment of the freeway from plans entirely, on environmental grounds.|$|E
5|$|The first Europeans {{to come to}} {{the area}} in the {{vicinity}} of Darby Creek were the Dutch, though they did not establish any permanent settlements. In 1643, Swedish colonists led by Johan Printz established New Sweden near the confluence of Darby Creek and the Delaware River. The settlement they established served as the seat of government for the Swedes in North America for 12 years. They may have built impoundments in the creek to isolate <b>marsh</b> <b>areas.</b> Dutch settlers conquered the Swedish villages in 1655. In 1664, the Dutch surrendered the Darby Creek drainage basin to the English, who began settling the area after William Penn was issued a charter in 1681. The Darby Creek Ferry House, near the site of Printz's headquarters, was erected in 1694.|$|E
25|$|The New England {{salt marsh}} {{is subject to}} strong tidal {{influences}} and shows distinct patterns of zonation. In low <b>marsh</b> <b>areas</b> with high tidal flooding, a monoculture of the smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora dominate, then heading landwards, zones of the salt hay, Spartina patens, black rush, Juncus gerardii and the shrub Iva frutescens are seen respectively. These species all have different tolerances that make the different zones along the marsh best suited for each individual.|$|E

25|$|Wakodahatchee Wetlands is a {{wetlands}} park {{open to the}} public.

The site {{is part of the}} South section of the Great Florida Birding Trail and offers many opportunities to observe birds in their natural habitats. Over 151 species of birds have been spotted inside the park, including pied-billed grebe, snowy egrets, and black-bellied whistling ducks. The park is also home to turtles, alligators, rabbits, frogs, and raccoons.|$|E
25|$|The {{steep slopes}} of Copeland Creek have a {{predominant}} occurrence of Goulding clay loam soils, with a typical soil depth of only 16to 20inches (41to 51centimeters). These are generally areas of 15to 45percent slopes that support dense mixed oak woodland, with large percentages of California laurel and Bigleaf maple. On the higher drier slopes, there are terraces of Raynor clay, which {{are associated with}} seeps and higher moisture retention known to the Turtle Pond and Cattail <b>Marsh</b> <b>areas</b> of the Preserve. Both soil types are known to support grazing when woodlands are cleared. In the late 19th century, the site was used for sheep and cattle grazing and the woodlands were cut for firewood, which was taken by wagonload down the mountain to Petaluma.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} {{surrounding}} 1900, {{at the behest}} of local political officials and following Congressional orders, the US Army Corps began dredging the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the deep channels of San Francisco Bay. This work has continued without interruption ever since an enormous federal subsidy to San Francisco Bay shipping. Some of the dredge spoils were initially dumped in the bay shallows (including helping to create Treasure Island on the former shoals to the north of Yerba Buena Island) and used to raise an island in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The net effect of dredging has been to maintain a narrow deep channel—deeper perhaps than the original bay channel—through a much shallower bay. At the same time, most of the <b>marsh</b> <b>areas</b> have been filled or blocked off from the bay by dikes.|$|E

25|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the San Francisco garter snake is a densely vegetated pond near an open hillside {{where it can}} sun, feed, and find cover in rodent burrows; however, markedly less suitable habitat can be successfully used. Temporary ponds and other seasonal freshwater bodies are also appropriate. This subspecies avoids brackish <b>marsh</b> <b>areas</b> because its preferred prey, the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), cannot survive in saline water. Emergent and bankside vegetation such as cattails (Typha spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus / Schoenoplectus spp.), and spike rushes (Juncus spp. and Eleocharis spp.) apparently are preferred and used for cover. The zone between stream and pond habitats and grasslands or bank sides is characteristically utilized for basking, while nearby dense vegetation or water often provide escape cover. The subspecies occasionally uses floating algal or rush mats, when available.|$|E
500|$|Around 6million {{people moved}} to South Florida between 1940 and 1965. With a {{thousand}} people moving to Miami each week, urban development quadrupled. As the human population grew rapidly, the problem of exotic {{plant and animal species}} also grew. Many species of plants were brought into South Florida from Asia, Central America, or Australia as decorative landscaping. Exotic animals imported by the pet trade have escaped or been released. Biological controls that keep invasive species smaller in size and fewer in number in their native lands often do not exist in the Everglades, and they compete with the embattled native species for food and space. Of imported plant species, melaleuca trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) have caused the most problems. Melaleucas grow on average [...] in the Everglades, as opposed to [...] in their native Australia. They were brought to southern Florida as windbreaks and deliberately seeded in <b>marsh</b> <b>areas</b> because they absorb vast amounts of water. In a region that is regularly shaped by fire, melaleucas are fire-resistant and their seeds are more efficiently spread by fire. They are too dense for wading birds with large wingspans to nest in, and they choke out native vegetation. Costs of controlling melaleucas topped $2million in 1998 for Everglades National Park. In Big Cypress National Preserve, melaleucas covered [...] at their most pervasive in the 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|The University's Nature Preserve is [...] {{located on}} the {{southern}} end of campus and {{is referred to as the}} largest laboratory on campus. Students have actively worked to make sure the space remains untouched. The preserve features approximately 10 miles(16km) of maintained paths, a large lake, <b>marsh</b> <b>areas,</b> vernal pools, tall hills and a hill-top meadow. A popular hang-out spot is the long wooden boardwalk constructed across one of the marshes, overlooking the lake. For several years, there had been much controversy and discussion over the management of deer population that was rapidly growing. The decision to conduct a deer cull was made in 2011 in order to restore an ecologically balanced preserve. However, subsequent community opposition to the plan, for varied reasons, placed the planned culling on hold for the present time.|$|E
2500|$|The Hayward {{fault is}} {{considered}} to be particularly dangerous due to the poor soil conditions in the alluvial plain that drops from the East Bay Hills to the eastern shoreline of San Francisco Bay. At the lower elevations near the bay the soil is mostly water saturated mud and sand, placed in the early 20th century as fill in <b>marsh</b> <b>areas.</b> This soil tends to [...] amplify the effects of an earthquake and so producing significantly greater ground motion. Additionally, the soil itself can fail, turning into a liquid mud from the agitation, a mud unable to support buildings erected upon once-firm soil. This region is also covered with dense low-rise urban development, most of which was built soon after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and long before even moderately earthquake resistant construction practices had been developed in the late 1920s.|$|E
