40|$|It {{is shown}} that <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> as {{the sources of}} moving metric type 4 bursts are not {{responsible}} for the development of geomagnetic storms, despite the fact that shock waves producing type 2 bursts are the sources of the interplanetary shock waves, which produce SSC's on the geomagnetic field. These <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles,</b> in general, tend to move in the solar envelope with the speed of several hundred Km/sec at most, which is much slower than that of the motion of type 2 radio sources...|$|R
40|$|Using {{observed}} data for wide-band type IV solar radio bursts, the onset time {{differences between the}} microwave and metric frequencies and the peak flux intensities of the metric component were analyzed {{as a function of}} the longitudinal position of associated flares on the solar disk. It is shown that this time difference is dependent on the position of associated flares and that the peak flux intensity reaches maximum when a flare occurs in the region 10 to 40 deg west of the central meridian of the solar disk. These results are explained by taking into account the eastward expansion of <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> which trap mildly relativistic electrons responsible for type IV bursts. Discussion is also made of the relation between these <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> and shock waves which excite type II radio bursts...|$|R
40|$|Shock {{waves are}} {{indirectly}} observed {{as the source}} of type II radio bursts, whereas <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> are identified {{as the source of}} moving metric type IV radio bursts. The difference between the expansion speeds of these waves and bottles is examined during their generation and propagation near the flare regions. It is shown that, although generated in the explosive phase of flares, the bottles behave quite differently from the waves and that the bottles are generally much slower than the waves. It has been suggested that the waves are related to flare-associated interplanetary disturbances which produce SSC geomagnetic storms. These disturbances may, therefore, be identified as interplanetary shock waves. The relationship among <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles,</b> shock waves near the sun, and flare-associated disturbances in interplanetary space is briefly discussed...|$|R

Upon striking matter of sufficient density, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottle</b> ruptures and releases the plasma, which causes the target's temperature to increase by 10,000 degrees F in under 0.1 seconds.

The coronal magnetic field used for comparison is calculated from potential theory; the influence of solar activity upon the potential theory field is discussed with reference to observations of the Faraday rotation of a microwave signal from Pioneer 6 as it was occulted by the solar atmosphere. Evidence has been found suggesting the existence of expanding <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> located at 10 solar radii above flaring active regions. The dynamics of these events is discussed.

A simplified theoretical treatment of this experimental effect is provided by considering momentum distributions. Comment: 4 page...|$|R
40|$|Union began, {{independently}} and in secret, research {{to harness the}} energy process of the Sun. Success came quickly, {{in the form of}} the hydrogen bomb, but producing controlled thermonuclear reactions, or nuclear fusion, as it is now more commonly called, has remained elusive. Many, if not most, of the basic approaches to achieving fusion were postulated in rudimentary form during the 1950 s. ” * based on well-known principles of electromagnetic theory and nuclear physics. Nuclei carry positive charge and can be guided by magnetic fields. Since the repulsive (Coulomb) force between two nuclei increases with the product of the charge on the nuclei, fusion would be most easily achieved, it was reasoned, between singly charged isotopes of hydrogen. Two nuclei approaching each other, however, are about a thousand times more likely to be scattered than to fuse, even when traveling at high speed. Consequently, some means is needed to confine the nuclei for a sufficient time to allow many attempted collisions. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>bottles,</b> of various shapes, seemed the ideal solution. The high-temperature, ionized hydrogen gas (called “plasma”) turned out to be much more difficult to contain in the various <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> than scientists originally hoped would be the case.

Consequently, the magnetic moment remains nearly constant even for changes at rates approaching the gyrofrequency. When μ is constant, the perpendicular particle energy is proportional to B, so the particles can be heated by increasing B, {{but this is a}} 'one shot' deal because the field cannot be increased indefinitely.

5000|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottle</b> has {{the same}} {{structure}} as Helmholtz coils, but with the magnets separated further apart so that the field expands in the middle, trapping charged particles with the diverging field lines.

50|$|A <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>bottle</b> is two magnetic mirrors placed close together. For example, {{two parallel}} coils {{separated by a}} small distance, carrying the same current {{in the same direction}} will produce a <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottle</b> between them. Unlike the full mirror machine which typically had many large rings of current surrounding the middle of the magnetic field, the bottle typically has just two rings of current. Particles near either end of the bottle experience a magnetic force towards the center of the region; particles with appropriate speeds spiral repeatedly {{from one end of the}} region to the other and back. Magnetic bottles can be used to temporarily trap charged particles. It is easier to trap electrons than ions, because electrons are so much lighter This technique is used to confine the high energy of plasma in fusion experiments.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles</b> and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|R

Here we apply it to multipole fields and to the bowl-type field configuration used for the Los Alamos UCNτ experiment. In all cases considered the spin flip loss calculated exceeds the Majorana estimate by many orders of magnitude but can be suppressed sufficiently by applying a holding field of appropriate magnitude to allow high-precision neutron lifetime measurements, provided other possible sources of systematic error are under control...|$|R

This partially recovers questions analyzed in a different context by the authors around the question of the so called <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles.</b> Our aim is to analyze the former results, to treat them in a more systematic way and to improve them by giving sharper estimates of the remainder. In particular, we improve significantly the lower bounds and as a by-product we solve a conjecture proposed by Bernoff–Sternberg concerning the localization of the ground state inside the boundary in the case with constant magnetic fields...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{here the}} classical problem of charge trapping by strong nonuniform magnetic fields (Van Allen belts, <b>magnetic</b> <b>bottles),</b> and study it {{by means of}} the averaging methods of classical perturbation theory. At variance with the usual cases, this problem has three (in place of two) different time scales, which are associated to the Larmor rotation around field lines (fast motion), to the motion along field lines (intermediate scale motion), and to the drift across field lines (slow motion). Such time scales get well separated for strong magnetic fields, so that Nekhoroshev-Neishtadt perturbation methods can be applied. As a result, one finds that the system admits two adiabatic invariants (namely, the magnetic moment and a second quantity, related to the energy of the motion along the field lines), which turn out to be preserved for time scales growing exponentially with the field intensity. In fact, the system can be given an integrable form, up to an exponentially small remainder...|$|R
