5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia {{came to a}} speedy end, {{partly because of the}} ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia. It was later revealed that a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> against Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović, then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency. Jović published his diary containing the information and repeated it in his testimony at the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E

25|$|In March 2012, a Reuters/Ipsos poll {{revealed}} {{that a majority of}} Americans, 56%, would support military action against Iran, even if it led to increased gas prices, if there was evidence demonstrating that Tehran was building nuclear weapons. 39% said that they opposed a <b>military</b> <b>strike,</b> while 62% of Americans said that they'd support Israel striking Iran over its nuclear program.|$|E

25|$|Through the machinations of an A.I. {{satellite}} called Brother Eye, a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> {{was made}} against Themyscira {{in an attempt}} at Amazon genocide. A large swarm of OMAC units {{were sent to the}} island and began to attack the Amazons as part of the events of Infinite Crisis. Because of this, as well as the many previous attacks against the island since Diana had become Wonder Woman, it was decided by Artemis and Philippus that the entire island of Themyscira and all of its inhabitants (sans Diana) would be transported to a hidden dimension via the Olympian and Bana-Mighdallian goddesses. Artemis and the remaining Amazons thrive in this dimension for a year's time in peace.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Obama, who had {{previously}} demanded the resignation of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, said {{that the use of}} chemical weapons by the Assad government would be crossing a red line and would entail U.S. military action. After reports on 21 August 2013 about the usage of chemical weapons in Syria, the Obama administration formally blamed the incident on the Syrian government and sought Congressional approval for military action in Syria. Besides, Obama sought support from Britain and France for an attack in Syria. The Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel approved plans for a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missile strikes to have those called off by Obama in September. On 11 September 2013, Obama put a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> or combat operations on hold and achieved an agreement with Russia and the Syrian government to destroy all chemical weapons in Syria.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{intelligence}} intercepts {{and analysis}} carried {{out during the}} 2008 Mumbai attacks, Indian planners had assessed that the ongoing attack was likely a deliberate attempt by the ISI sponsored terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba to provoke an Indian <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> on Pakistan; the objective being to entice other Islamist Pakistani militant groups that were engaged in armed conflict with the Pakistani state to redirect their attacks away from the Pakistani state and instead unify against an external threat, namely India. [...] Consequently, in order to defeat the strategic goals of the Pakistani planners of the Mumbai massacre, India decided to hold off launching a punitive <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> on Pakistan. This assessment was later verified by interrogations and court testimony {{of one of the}} Pakistani planners of the massacre, David Headley while in custody of US and Indian authorities.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{warned of}} [...] "severe consequences" [...] if an attack like this {{were to be}} {{successful}} and traced back to Pakistan.

2500|$|A CNN/ORC International {{poll was}} {{released}} on September 9, 2013 with data about U.S. attitudes towards Syria {{and the possibility of}} U.S. military intervention. The poll revealed that a [...] "strong majority" [...] of citizens do not want Congress to authorize a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> against the Assad government. [...] Over 70% of respondents did not believe that a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> would achieve US goals, and a similar percentage do not believe it is in the United States' national interest to intervene. [...] According to the poll, even if Congress were to authorize military action, 55% of Americans would still oppose airstrikes. [...] When asked about a plan that limited military action to 90 days and prohibited the use of ground troops, like S.J.Res 21 would authorize, 59% still opposed it. [...] The poll also indicated that President Obama's approval rating on foreign policy was at its lowest point ever and that only 3 in 10 approved of how he is handling Syria.|$|E

[...] In a speech to the U.S. House on October 8, 2002, invoking St. Augustine's Just War Thesis, the Minutemen, and the Framers of the U.S. Constitution, Rep. Hostettler revealed his conclusion that: ...Iraq indeed poses a threat, but it does not pose an imminent threat that justifies a pre-emptive <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> at this time.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} in 2007 that Iran's nuclear program had spurred interest in establishing nuclear power programs {{by a number}} of neighboring countries, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt. According to the report, [...] "roughly a dozen states in the region have recently turned to the IAEA in Vienna for help in starting" [...] nuclear programs. The article also described neighbouring states as very hostile to any nuclear weapons program Iran might embark on, stating [...] "many diplomats and analysts say that the Sunni Arab governments are so anxious about Iran's nuclear progress that they would even, grudgingly, support a United States <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> against Iran." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis of}} this article argues that while the use of {{preemptive}} <b>military</b> <b>strikes,</b> now adopted by the United States against non-state actors and rogue states, appears to be justified under international law, such a military exercise must be subject to well defined and clearly stated international legal rules...|$|R
50|$|Precision-guided munitions were {{heralded as}} key in {{allowing}} <b>military</b> <b>strikes</b> {{to be made}} {{with a minimum of}} civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs.

2500|$|The al-Fakhura School {{incident}} was an Israeli <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> {{that took place}} during the Gaza War on 6 January 2009 near a United Nations-run school in the Jabalia Camp in the Gaza Strip. According to UN and several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), more than 40 people were killed, most of them civilians. Israel reported the death toll as 9 Hamas militants and 3 noncombatants with senior IDF officers stating that the death toll published by Hamas was [...] "grossly exaggerated". Israel stated it fired on the school in response to militant gunfire believed to be coming from al-Fakhura. A UN inquiry revealed that there was no firing from within the school and there were no explosives within the school.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 July 2009, Israel’s Defence Minister Ehud Barak {{during a}} press conference with Robert Gates, the US Defense Secretary, in Jerusalem, warned Iran that a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> on its nuclear {{facilities}} was still an option: [...] "We clearly believe that no option should {{be removed from the}} table. This is our policy; we mean it. We recommend to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone." [...] The same day, Israel's Ambassador to US, Gabriela Shalev, during a special UN Security Council session held to discuss the situation in the Middle East, called Iran the [...] "biggest supporter of terrorism." [...] The Islamic Republic's nuclear program and its support of terrorism pose a threat to the entire Middle East." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, a {{year before}} Stuxnet was discovered, Scott Borg of the United States Cyber-Consequences Unit (US-CCU) {{suggested}} that Israel might prefer to mount a cyber-attack rather than a <b>military</b> <b>strike</b> on Iran's nuclear facilities. And, in late 2010 Borg stated, [...] "Israel certainly {{has the ability to}} create Stuxnet and there is little downside to such an attack because it would be virtually impossible to prove who did it. So a tool like Stuxnet is Israel's obvious weapon of choice." [...] Iran uses P-1 centrifuges at Natanz, the design for which A. Q. Khan stole in 1976 and took to Pakistan. His black market nuclear-proliferation network sold P-1s to, among other customers, Iran. Experts believe that Israel also somehow acquired P-1s and tested Stuxnet on the centrifuges, installed at the Dimona facility that is part of its own nuclear program. The equipment may be from the United States, which received P-1s from Libya's former nuclear program.|$|E
