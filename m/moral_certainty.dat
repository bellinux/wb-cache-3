25|$|The term connotes that {{evidence}} establishes a particular {{point to a}} <b>moral</b> <b>certainty</b> which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It {{does not mean that}} no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no reasonable doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of <b>moral</b> <b>certainty,</b> where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, i.e., when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a <b>moral</b> <b>certainty</b> every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.|$|E

After Thomas Carlyle dismissed the head as [...] "fraudulent moonshine", and after {{the emergence of a}} rival claimant to the true head of Oliver Cromwell, scientific and archaeological analysis was carried out to prove the identity.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} analyse the {{shift away from}} the <b>moral</b> <b>certainties</b> of the Cold War epoch and of {{humanitarian}} interventions in the 1990 s, to suggest that ‘evil’ plays a very different role in politics and international relations today. In current constructions of the world – as much more global, complex and non-linear – the past certainties of liberal internationalism {{appear to be a}} symptom of problematic moral hubris. Rather than the transcendental <b>moral</b> <b>certainties</b> of good and evil, globalization and complexity seem to suggest a more immanent perspective of emergent causality, eliciting a reflexive ethics of continual work on ‘good’ public modes of being. In which case, ‘evil’ is no longer considered to be an exception but becomes normalized as an ethical learning resource. The 2011 case of the mass killings by Norwegian Anders Breivik will be highlighted as an example of this process. This article suggests that this ‘democratization’ of evil is problematic in articulating evil as a revealed or emergent truth in the world that requires social and personal self-reflexivity, thereby suborning moral choice to onto-ethical necessity...|$|R

This orientation challenges a separation between the market and development, situating fair trade within global processes that incorporate agrarian histories of social change and conflict. Reframing crisis {{as a condition of}} agrarian life, rather than emphasizing its cyclical manifestation within the global economy, reveals how market-driven development encompasses the material conditions of peoples' existence in ambiguous and contradictory ways. Drawing on the case of coffee production in Nicaragua, experiences of crisis demonstrate that greater attention needs to be paid to the socioeconomic and political dimensions of development within regional commodity assemblages to address entrenched power relations and unequal access to land and resources. This questions <b>moral</b> <b>certainties</b> when examining the paradox of working in and against the market, and suggests that a better understanding of specific trajectories of development could improve fair trade's objective of enhancing producer livelihood...|$|R

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} Bachelor thesis "An {{individual}} on {{the verge}} of chaos in Dostoyevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov" is to analyse an individual in search of one's identity in the chaotic world of the second half in the XIX century Russia. The good and the evil collide in the souls of the characters who feel lost in the world of sudden changes of <b>moral</b> <b>certainties,</b> various philosophical streams and influences which emerge. The introductory part of the thesis is focused on defining the contradictory period of {{the second half of the}} XIX century. Following that, the conception of chaos is defined and explored both from the perspective of the external chaos in the world as well as the internal one which in the works of Dostoyevsky manifests itself in the individual's intense suffering leading to a complete degradation of personality. The main part of the thesis concentrates on the analyses of different approaches by which the protagonists of the novel try to reach an internal harmony. The final chapter is dedicated to the youngest of the three brothers, Alexey, in whose faith and the unconditional love for his homeland and everyone around him, Dostoyevsky finds the firm ground for achieving true personal fulfilment and harmony...|$|R
40|$|This thesis interrogates a {{well-established}} {{consensus that the}} mass killings that erupted in Rwanda in 1994 upon the aerial assassination of President Habyarimana {{were the result of}} a planned and controlled genocide of Tutsis by Hutu extremists. It concludes that this dominant narrative is flawed and argues instead that the killings had a ‘bottomup’ character, were neither planned nor controlled, and were conducted in anarchic conditions. An historical background addresses the question of how ethnic identity formation relates to the 1990 - 1994 war. The war is reconstructed by means of a logical chronological narrative. Interviews of key individuals involved, checks of court records, and a critical survey of English and French literature has yielded, it is hoped, a more rigorous, reflective and nuanced approach toward the dynamics of the war. Claims for genocide planning and implementation are shown to be problematic. In place of a conspiracy of Hutu extremists, the thesis emphasises linkages between RPF strategy and conduct with various forms of Western intervention as salient forces generating conditions conducive to civilian slaughter. The material and ideological links between the protagonists of the Rwandan war and regional and international actors are situated {{within the context of the}} immediate post-Cold War period. A comparative study of genocide concludes that the number of genocides in the twentieth century should be restricted to three: the Nazi holocaust, the genocide of the Armenians, and the genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples in German South-West Africa. As a critique of the normative approach toward international relations, this thesis demystifies the dynamics of the tragedy and challenges the <b>moral</b> <b>certainties</b> that the dominant narrative seeks to establish in relation to the Rwandan war and its tragic outcome. This has important implications concerning the legitimacy of the current Rwandan regime and the international support that sustains it. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} is {{a qualitative}} {{inquiry into the}} vexed state of public education reform in the contemporary United States. It focuses on the introduction of charter schools as reform instruments, {{the emergence of a}} widely-celebrated chain of college preparatory charters, and internal conflicts within the Texas charter school community that were enacted in 2007 with a proposed piece of charter school reform legislation, Senate Bill 4. Drawing on interviews with administrators, observations of schools and association meetings, analysis of media and policy documents and public testimony from the Texas legislature, it describes contemporary cultural anxieties about the competencies of present and future citizens. The dissertation is structured in the form of four observational essays. The method involved in the writing is to enter into dialogue with the cultural discourses preceding, produced by, or trailing along {{in the wake of the}} public debate over SB 4. It works to tease out the implications and interconnections gathered in the field, including representations produced for other, more straightforwardly informative purposes, in order to provoke new ways of thinking about them. The first essay is based on interview-based research I conducted with school administrators in San Antonio. It begins with an assessment of a similar study of public school reform conducted by anthropologists in North Carolina that is more straightforwardly informed by critical theory and an oppositional moral stance to neoliberalism and offers in the place of critique a more humble account of my own fieldwork in San Antonio that was not motivated by clear cut <b>moral</b> <b>certainties.</b> The second is based on media representations of charter schools, educational assessments, and the widely-celebrated and discussed KIPP network of schools and seeks to situate the debate over SB 4 within a broader national context of public debate on the problem of education reform. The third essay continues to probe the sources of KIPP's broad popular appeal through observations of daily activities of one of its middle school campuses. The final essay returns to the public testimony on SB 4 to problematize what appear to be simple solutions to immensely complicated problems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} interplay between mythos (story) and ethos (ethical character) in {{contemporary}} children’s fantasy fiction. In recent decades, this relationship has been complicated by two contradictory, but related, ethical tendencies. Postmodernism characteristically resists unitary accounts of morality, celebrating pluralism. Within the last twenty years, however, {{there has been a}} groundswell of interest in rethinking ethics and retrieving values from endemic moral uncertainty, often referred to as an ethical turn. This thesis contends that children’s fantasy fiction has evolved into a literature that creatively engages with this contradiction, simultaneously refusing <b>moral</b> <b>certainties</b> and demanding unflinching ethical values. This evolution is explored by comparing a selection of children’s fantasy fiction published from 1995 to 2012 with earlier exponents of this genre as well as other literary texts. The analysis is conducted through a framework of expanding ethical horizons, starting with a focus on personal contexts and then progressing to the social, political, and ideological. The thesis employs an inter-textual method. Ethical concepts are teased out by bringing literary texts into dialogue with each other and exploring links between them. Ideas from critical theory are then used to extend the trajectory of the ethical themes suggested by the fictions. Through this method, themes and texts are woven into an ethical narrative about children’s fantasy. This thesis approaches storytelling as a portal into the imagination where writers, readers and protagonists actively forge moral meaning. Traditionally, stories rich in symbol not only entertained their audiences, but also encapsulated their societies’ moral values. When society is presented metaphorically, familiar assumptions are estranged, enabling readers to see the world anew and imaginatively reconstruct their worldviews. In recent children’s fantasies, both child protagonists and child readers are required to be moral thinkers. This demonstrates a shift, not only in how ethical dilemmas are contended with today, but, by addressing children as ethical subjects, in how much moral agency is attributed to children. Children’s fantasy is a rich and layered genre particularly suited to engaging with contemporary ethical dilemmas and uncertainties. This thesis affirms its role in exploring ethical meaning and action and transmitting positive values in a climate of moral uncertainty. Emerging from this fiction, and incongruous to both postmodern consumerist society and postmodern suspicion of categorical moral imperatives, is an ethics of self-transcendent love...|$|R
50|$|Catholics {{recognize}} that a certainty of faith is ascribed to St. Paul (2 Cor 12,9) and speculate that the Virgin Mary also probably possessed it. Jesus Christ as man, however, {{did not need to}} believe since he knew it. Ludwig Ott argues that a high <b>moral,</b> human <b>certainty</b> of having sanctifying grace is possible, on the grounds that one is not conscious of an unforgiven grave sin, but by no means faith which is believing with divine certainty and that with some probability one can locate positive signs of predestination, which does not mean that their lack be a sign of reprobation: He lists persistent action of the virtues recommended in the Eight Beatitudes, frequent Communion, active charity, love for Christ and the Church and devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Moreover, and especially, a Catholic can, and should, have certain hope for eternal salvation, which does not rest chiefly on a grace already received, but rather on prospective future forgiveness by God's omnipotence and mercy. The point in question is that however certain, the hope must retain its proper name and not be confused with faith. If together with a determination for sin, this hope is in danger of giving way to presumption.|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{examine a}} form of deception that I refer to as certainty posing, or exaggerating one’s degree of certainty. People are often expected to convey certainty {{in their ability to}} know the truth or forecast the future. As I argue, this expectation can motivate them to deliberately exaggerate their degree of certainty. In the first chapter of this dissertation, I find support for this assertion across a series of six experiments. Specifically, I find evidence that certainty posing is motivated by impression management concerns to appear knowledgeable and credible—particularly in situations where people can attribute uncertainty to inadequate knowledge. Additionally, I document that this behavior has the potential to bias consumers of advice. In the second chapter of this dissertation, I consider the <b>moral</b> acceptability of <b>certainty</b> posing and argue that people should perceive it as more morally acceptable than other forms of deception documented in the literature. I find limited evidence for this proposition: While certainty posing is perceived as more morally acceptable than blatant deception (telling the polar opposite of the truth), it is not perceived as any more acceptable than feigning uncertainty. Overall, this research makes two primary contributions to the literature. First, it documents that impression management motives can cause people to engage in strategic displays of overconfidence. Second, it establishes that individuals’ motivation to engage in these displays is largely determined by the source to which they can attribute their uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Un(touched) is a diptych that explores {{intimacy}} and separation as simultaneous events. The audience {{are invited to}} inhabit two separate but related sculptures incorporating glass, ﬂuorescent tubes and steel mesh. Our question is how can division allow for intimate encounters? The project encompasses two distinct but related works. Each explores simultaneous experiences (and contradictions) of {{intimacy and}} distance. Both implicate the audience in the experience in differing ways. For the ﬁrst work Nathaniel has created a corridor- like structure that allows for multiple viewing points from outside, within, and through. The glass becomes either transparent or reﬂective depending on the sequencing of ﬂuorescent lights attached to the steelwork shifting the accent abruptly from a conversation with another to the isolation with ones’ own reﬂection. Performers and viewers together {{become part of a}} visual schema. There is a sense of voyeurism and distanced views, which become checked in the gaze of others seeing you or you viewing others being viewed. The sense of dialogue is replicated and layered. The dancers can only relate to each other through the glass and this division remains a constant. Paradoxically the surface that divides allows for greater risk in their increasingly intimate relationship. Despite this drive to achieve intimacy it can never be realised. The second work presents a platform onto which the viewers are invited to walk. Submerged beneath are the two same performers, whose presence is revealed depending on the shifting light, and viewed by the audience from above. This displacement re- articulates the relationship between the performers and audience. The work takes inspiration from South Korean artist Do Ho Suh’s piece 'Floor' (1997) where the visitor is invited to walk on a glass surface under which there are many small ﬁgures. This act on the work highlights a dialectic between abused power and the power of human collective action. We re-imagine this dialogue as a live event where the vulnerability of the skin’s surface elevates the body, and where a sense of precariousness is derived from the situation in which all those present ﬁnd themselves. The reality of separation suggests a touch that has no consequences, and yet the act of touch or walking over the surface of a body triggers affecting notions of power, control, and <b>moral</b> (un) <b>certainty.</b> The re - orientation of the vertical plane in the ﬁrst work to the horizontal plane in the second is intended to provoke and calls to attention to the viewer the ethics implicit in this new positioning that in turn desires a physical response...|$|R

In every case the lady maintained stoutly that she knew nothing about it, that she had never written a letter to any man whatever, and had received none previous to the one that happened to fall into the wrong hands. In three or four instances I was deceived myself, but there is no telling with women. When a man tells a lie, he either hesitates or stumbles, or he says it off {{as if it were a}} lesson he had got by heart, or else he is sulky over it, and you have to get it out of him bit by bit, just as if, though he had made up his mind to lie, he did not wish to tell more lies than necessary.

Sometimes she is indignant, sometimes she is plaintive; but, anyhow, she is so natural that she would deceive Old Nick himself.
