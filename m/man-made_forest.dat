2500|$|One of Lahore's nicknames is the [...] "City of Gardens." [...] Many gardens were {{established}} in Lahore during the Mughal era, some of which still survive. The Shalimar Gardens were laid out {{during the reign of}} Shah Jahan and were designed to mimic the Islamic paradise of the afterlife described in the Qur'an. The gardens follow the familiar charbagh layout of four squares, with three descending terraces. The Lawrence Garden was established in 1862 and was originally named after Sir John Lawrence, late 19th-century British Viceroy to India. The many other gardens and parks in the city include Hazuri Bagh, Iqbal Park, Mochi Bagh, Gulshan Iqbal Park, Model Town Park, Race Course Park, Nasir Bagh Lahore, Jallo Park, Wild Life Park, and Changa Manga, a <b>man-made</b> <b>forest</b> near Lahore in the Kasur district.

40|$|Abstract: A simple {{device for}} {{estimating}} snow settling force on tree branches {{was used to}} determine the distribution of snow settling force at various heights in a snowy mountainous region in Japan. A trapezoidal distribution of snow settling force was found to exist at all sites tested. It is thought that a zoning scheme based on the damaging potential of snow on young <b>man-made</b> <b>forests</b> would become possible, with the acquisition of CrvDtomeria D. Don. (Japanese cedar) Fig. 1. The types of snow damage to Cryptomeria [Iwatsubo and Nitta 19871 are shown in Fig. 2. Straight stems have much higher market value than crooked stems. Therefore in field survey, the aurhors classify every cryptomeria tree to One of the largest problems in Japanese forestry lies in the low survival rate of young <b>man-made</b> <b>forests</b> in the heavy snow areas. It is rare to see a beautiful conifer plantation where snow reaches over 4 m in depth because of mechanical damage caused by large snow pressure. Both on flat locations and gentle slopes, snow settlement causes branch and stem deformation which often brings fatal breakage. To decrease such unsuccessful plantings much basic data for forest zoning are indispensable. Out of such necessity the authors have devised and set new snow poles in mountains to obtain tree-deforming factors such as maximal snow depth and snow settling force without batteries or power Supply. The data from the new snow poles explain to us how severely snow loads work on young trees...|$|R
