Prior Work: This is the reason why we have chosen this topic and the analysis of the typology to which such an obligation adapts and, of course, the correlative right to which it gives birth. Approach: In our current system of law there are provided different forms of exercising this obligation, preserving, improving, but also innovating, in some aspects, the previous regulation. Specifically, we will relate in this study to a brief analysis of all types of maintenance obligations, generated by two distinct sources: the law and the will of the parties (contract), in this case we are speaking of an obligation based on the law or a contractual obligation. The angle from which we are analyzing this type of obligational relationship between the maintenance creditor and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>debtor</b> also allows us to recall both the passive or active patrimonial side, and also the analysis of the legal characters that it presupposes each of the two above-mentioned generic types of maintenance obligations. Value: Starting from the conceptualization of the maintenance obligation, the present study will be oriented towards the analysis in the current legal context of the doctrinal points of view expressed in the specialized literature, using as a method the documentary research, the interpretative method and the comparative method...|$|E

Complaints about the system ranged from the treatment, attitudes and facilities encountered at maintenance courts by complainants, to the seeming impunity with which <b>maintenance</b> <b>debtors</b> manage to evade their legal duty to maintain their dependents, even where maintenance orders were in force. In response to the problems encountered with the 1963 Maintenance Act and to fulfil South Africaâ€™s international and constitutional obligations, the Maintenance Act 99 of 1998 was introduced. As the bulk of the Maintenance Act would have been in operation for exactly ten years on 26 November 2009, the government thought it appropriate to obtain a ten year review of the Act. I was subsequently instructed to compile a report, of which this article is an abbreviated version. Private La...|$|R

In cases where both parties share a nationality and the law of that nationality as well as the law of the debtor's habitual residence would not lead to <b>maintenance,</b> a <b>debtor</b> may also contest to use of the law of the creditor's habitual residence, provided it is not a case relating to child support. In cases not concerning child support (for children below 18) or vulnerable adults, both parties my choose the law governing the maintenance, choosing from: ...|$|R
