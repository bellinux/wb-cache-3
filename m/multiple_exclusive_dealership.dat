A vertically separating firm trades off fixed contracting costs against the strategic benefit of writing a (two-part tariff, <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealership)</b> contract with its retailer. Equilibrium coexistence emerges when observable and non-renegotiable contracts are offered to downstream Cournot oligopolists that supply close substitutes. The scope for equilibrium coexistence diminishes when assumptions on contract observability and commitment are relaxed...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a pricing competition problem in some special competing supply chains in which differentiated but substitutable products are sold {{into the same}} market. These competing supply chains often consist {{of only a few}} upstream manufacturers, each of which distributes its products through exclusive downstream outlets who usually carry only one product line. This <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealership</b> is not uncommon in industries like petrol, automobiles, some electronic products, softdrinks, fastfoods, and so on. For instance, a petrol gas station often retails gasolines from some certain oil producer, and a 4 S store usually carries some certain car brand or cars from a specific manufacturer. For convenience, we use “manufacturer” to represent the upstream firm and “retailer” to the downstream channel participant in the following discussion.|$|R

We show that if the manufacturer associates a positive cost with sales variance, a stair-step incentive, with a positive bonus, is superior to the scheme without a bonus.

We model the effect of such incentives in two specific scenarios: an <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealership</b> selling products for only one manufacturer and a non-exclusive dealership selling products for multiple manufacturers. For an exclusive dealer we show that a threshold contract, with a positive bonus on crossing the threshold value, not only increases the expected sales, but more importantly, decreases the variance of the orders placed by the dealer. We show that if the manufacturer associates a positive cost with sales variance, a threshold-based incentive, with a positive bonus, is superior to other schemes without a bonus offering. We then show that manufacturers continuing to offer such incentives to non-exclusive dealers may experience increase in variance {{and a decrease in}} expected profits. This implies that when manufacturers must compete for dealer effort, threshold-based incentives can hurt manufacturers. In such instances it may be beneficial to switch to a constant margin incentive scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on switching costs by considering what happens when retailers and manufacturers are separate entities and some customers are locked in with retailers. This separation introduces a dynamic inconsistency problem as manufacturers face the problem of extracting too much surplus from the retailer {{in which case the}} retailer has no incentive to build a subscriber base. It is shown that different trading relationships arise according to the nature and magnitude of switching costs. When switching costs are high, then integrated structures are always predicted (or <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealerships</b> in case vertical integration is banned). Vertical integration should be allowed as it provides high-powered incentives to acquire market shares. I am grateful to Jonathan Hamilton (the Editor), two anonymous referees, Pedro Pita Barros, Patrick Rey, John Sutton, seminar participants in Lisbon, London, Milan, Stockholm, Toulouse, and conference participants at the This paper examines the endogenous formation of vertical contractual arrangements between producers and retailers when consumers face switching costs.

5000|$|The {{first major}} {{decision}} under Article 101 (then Article 85) {{was taken by}} the Commission in 1964. They found that Grundig, a German manufacturer of household appliances, acted illegally in granting <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealership</b> rights to its French subsidiary. In Consten & Grundig 1966 the European Court of Justice upheld the Commission's decision, expanded the definition of measures affecting trade to include [...] "potential effects", and generally anchored its key position in Competition Law enforcement alongside the Commission. Subsequent enforcement of Art 101 of the TFEU Treaty (combating anti-competitive business agreements) by the two institutions has generally been regarded as effective. Yet some analysts assert that the Commission's monopoly policy (the enforcement of Art 102) has been [...] "largely ineffective", because of the resistance of individual Member State governments that sought to shield their most salient national companies from legal challenges. The Commission also received criticism from the academic quarters. For instance, Valentine Korah, an eminent legal analyst in the field, argued that the Commission was too strict in its application of EC Competition rules and often ignored the dynamics of company behaviour, which, in her opinion, could actually be beneficial to consumers and to the quality of available goods in some cases.|$|R

Most companies have joint ventures with Indian partners and have entered {{the market in the}} last two years. The number of n w entrants over a narrow time window of two years is unprecedented. Demand forecasts vary and analysts expect anywhere between 2 and 3. 5 million cars to be sold in the next five years. Equity holding for the international partner is usually over 50 % and they retain significant managerial control. Most of them have introduced cars in the $ 13, 500 to $ 33, 000 price range, which is viewed as a luxury segment in India. Automobile companies have also chosen to establish <b>exclusive</b> <b>dealerships.</b> Initially, companies have chosen to import completely knocked down (CKD) kits and assemble them in India. However, this strategy is not effective n the long run since such imports attract 50 % duty.

40|$|We {{consider}} the incentives for oligopolistic manufacturers to adopt exclusive dealing. Manufacturers producing differentiated brands {{can choose to}} distribute through <b>exclusive</b> retail <b>dealerships</b> or nonexclusive dealerships. With nonexclusive dealing, manufacturers face an interbrand externality because brand-enhancing investments made by one manufacturer may benefit the brands of other manufacturers. Although exclusive dealing eliminates this externality, oligopolistic manufacturers may not choose exclusive dealing. Exclusive dealing enhances the incentive to invest, but the promotional investments are a form of competition between manufacturers. Thus, manufacturers might earn higher profits with nonexclusive dealing making lower promotional investments. We find cases in which nonexclusive dealing is a dominant strategy. We also find cases in which some, but not all, manufacturers adopt exclusive dealing. Moreover, even if adoption of exclusive dealing by all manufacturers is the equilibrium, it can arise from a prisoner's dilemma in that each manufacturer would prefer nonexclusive dealing. ...|$|R

Many well-known decision theories have been defined to help people either to make rational decisions or to interpret people's behaviors, such as expected utility theory, regret theory, prospect theory, and so on.

The basic elements in classic expected utility theory are kept in the new decision theory, but the influences from mutually exclusive decisions will also be modeled into the evaluation process. This may sound like regret theory, but the new approach is designed to fit <b>multiple</b> mutually <b>exclusive</b> decision scenarios, and it does not require a definition of probability weighting function.
