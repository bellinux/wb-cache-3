40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the cardiac autonomic dysfunction and the cardiac arrhythmia risk using heart rate variability parameters in subjects with vitamin D deficiency and low cardiovascular risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred five consecutive individuals, 54 patients with low vitamin D status and 51 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The overall cardiac autonomic tone was quantified by using various heart rate variability parameters included mean RR interval, mean Heart Rate, <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> deviations <b>of</b> intervals for 24 hours (SDNN), <b>standard</b> deviation <b>of</b> averages <b>of</b> intervals (SDANN), <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> deviation <b>of</b> intervals for 5 minutes (SDNNI), root <b>mean</b> square <b>of</b> difference of successive intervals (rMSSD) {{and the proportion of}} intervals differing more than 50 ms (pNN 50) values. The 12 -lead ECG was recorded from each participant, and QT intervals were measured. RESULTS: Baseline demographic profiles were similar between two groups. The heart rate variability parameters such as mean RR interval, mean HR, SDNN, SDANN, SDNNI, rMSSD and pNN 50 (%) values were not significantly different in patients with low vitamin D status compared to control group. The electrocardiography analysis revealed only slight but significant prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) intervals in the control group. CONCLUSION: HRV variables were not significantly altered in patients with vitamin D deficiency in low cardiovascular risk profile group. Further studies evaluating these findings in other cohorts with high cardiovascular risk are required...|$|R
