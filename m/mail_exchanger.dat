25|$|The {{domain name}} system {{supports}} wildcard DNS records which specify names that start with the asterisk label, '*', e.g., *.example. DNS records belonging to wildcard domain names specify rules for generating resource records within a single DNS zone by substituting whole labels with matching components of the query name, including any specified descendants. For example, in the following configuration, the DNS zone x.example specifies that all subdomains, including subdomains of subdomains, of x.example use the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> (MX) a.x.example. The A record for a.x.example is needed to specify the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> IP address. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, an additional MX record for the subdomain a.x.example, {{as well as a}} wildcarded MX record for all of its subdomains, must also be defined in the DNS zone.|$|E
5000|$|A related {{technique}} is [...] "call forwards", {{in which a}} secondary or firewall <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> can verify recipients at the primary <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> for the domain in order {{to decide whether the}} address is deliverable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{receiving}} {{mail server}} verifies the sender address, by verifying both {{parts of the}} sender address - the domain name (part after the @ character), and the local part (part before the @ character). The {{first step is to}} establish a successful SMTP connection to the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> for the sender address. The <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> is found by looking up the MX records in the domain's DNS zone. The second step is to query the exchanger, and make sure that it accepts the address as a valid one. This is done {{in the same way as}} sending an email to the address, however the process is stopped after the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> accepts or rejects the recipient address. These are the same steps the receiving mail server would take to bounce mail back to the sender, however in this case no mail is sent. The SMTP commands sent out are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Some regular <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers</b> do {{not give}} useful results to callbacks: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{addresses}} {{found in}} the header fields of an email message are not directly used by <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers</b> to deliver the message. An email message also contains a message envelope that contains the information for mail routing. While envelope and header addresses may be equal, forged email addresses are often seen in spam, phishing, and many other Internet-based scams. This has led to several initiatives which aim to make such forgeries easier to spot.|$|R
50|$|The name uucp was a pseudo-domain-style suffix {{used in the}} 1980s when {{identifying}} a hostname not connected directly to the Internet, but possibly reachable through other inter-network gateways. The suffix was appended to a UUCP bang path separated with a dot, e.g., host1!host2!host3.uucp.The suffix prevented messages from being routed via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers,</b> and it indicated that the hostname preceding it was reachable by UUCP networking. It was not a top-level domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) root.|$|R
50|$|The terms mail server, <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger,</b> and MX host {{may also}} {{refer to a}} {{computer}} performing the MTA function. The Domain Name System (DNS) associates a mail server to a domain with an MX record containing the domain name of the host(s) providing MTA services.|$|E
50|$|DNS serves other {{purposes}} {{in addition to}} translating names to IP addresses. For instance, mail transfer agents use DNS {{to find the best}} mail server to deliver e-mail. The domain to <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> mapping provided by MX records may present an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.|$|E
50|$|The field record {{data may}} consist {{of one or}} more {{information}} elements, depending on the requirements of each record type. For example, an address record only requires an address, while a <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> record requires a priority and a domain name. Such information elements are separated by white space.|$|E
5000|$|Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is {{a simple}} email-validation system {{designed}} to detect email spoofing by providing a mechanism to allow receiving <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers</b> to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators. The list of authorized sending hosts for a domain is published in the Domain Name System (DNS) records for that domain {{in the form of}} a specially formatted TXT record. Email spam and phishing often use forged [...] "from" [...] addresses, so publishing and checking SPF records can be considered anti-spam techniques.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} types of records {{stored in the}} DNS {{database}} are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers</b> (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although {{not intended to be}} a general purpose database, DNS can store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list. [...] The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured zone file.|$|R
40|$|Domain Name System (DNS) is {{a network}} {{database}} which relates a hostname to corresponding administrative {{information such as}} an IP address or a <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger's</b> location. Since DNS data had considered public for long years, no efforts for hiding the data have made. However, bad attempts using DNS data have emerged. While some developments to protect. DNS data on the DNS server have progressed, {{there is still no}} action against zone data theft via wire tapping. In this paper, we propose some alternatives to achieve secure communications between DNS clients and servers. We also show that prototype architecture of proposed alternatives and evaluate those performances...|$|R
50|$|One {{special case}} in RFC 1123 are {{gateways}} from or to other networks like UUCP and NetNews, {{where the first}} sending MTA cannot reach the final receiver directly with TCP. It is solved by MX records and if necessary rewriting foreign addresses at the gateway. MX is an acronym for <b>Mail</b> <b>eXchanger.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{domain name}} system {{supports}} wildcard DNS records which specify names that start with the asterisk label, '*', e.g., *.example.

50|$|When {{delivering}} email, a {{mail server}} uses the {{domain name system}} (DNS) to look up the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> record (MX record) for the recipient's domain (the part of the email address {{on the right of}} @). The returned MX record contains the name of the recipient's mailserver. The MTA next connects to this server as an SMTP client.|$|E
5000|$|A {{technique}} used {{to distribute the}} load of incoming mail over an array of servers is to return the same preference number for each server in the set. When determining which server of equal preference to send mail to, [...] "the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to spread the load across multiple <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers</b> for a specific organization", {{unless there is a}} clear reason to favor one. Note that multihomed servers are treated differently, since in this case any randomization is assumed to have been applied already by the name server. This mainly addresses routing problems; other types of server load can be addressed by using an SMTP proxy.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} types of records {{stored in the}} DNS {{database}} are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP <b>mail</b> <b>exchangers</b> (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although {{not intended to be}} a general purpose database, DNS can store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records.

5000|$|Since a large {{percentage}} of spam has forged and invalid sender ("from") addresses, some spam can be detected by checking that this [...] "from" [...] address is valid. A mail server can try to verify the sender address by making an SMTP connection back to the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> for the address, as if it was creating a bounce, but stopping just before any email is sent.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> record (MX record) {{is a type}} of {{resource}} record in the Domain Name System that specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a recipient's domain, and a preference value used to prioritize mail delivery if multiple mail servers are available. The set of MX records of a domain name specifies how email should be routed with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).|$|E
50|$|The {{boundary}} MTA {{uses the}} Domain name system (DNS) {{to look up}} the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> record (MX record) for the recipient's domain (the part of the email address {{on the right of}} @). The MX record contains the name of the target host. Based on the target host and other factors, the MTA selects an exchange server: see the article MX record. The MTA connects to the exchange server as an SMTP client.|$|E
50|$|The field {{record type}} is an {{abbreviation}} {{for the type}} of information stored in the last field, record data. The type also provides the name of each record. For example, an address record, having the identifier A for IPv4 and AAAA for IPv6, maps the domain name from the first field to an IP address in the record data, and a <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> record (MX) specifies the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail host for a domain.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the final}} hop accepts the {{incoming}} message, it {{hands it to}} a mail delivery agent (MDA) for local delivery. An MDA saves messages in the relevant mailbox format. As with sending, this reception can be done using one or multiple computers, but in the diagram above the MDA is depicted as one box near the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> box. An MDA may deliver messages directly to storage, or forward them over a network using SMTP or other protocol such as Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP), a derivative of SMTP designed for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The other {{alternative}} {{mentioned in the}} RFC is to use {{what appears to be}} a multihomed A record for a mail server. It may in fact be an array of mail servers that share the same host name. This method places the burden on the DNS system rather than the SMTP-sender to perform the load balancing, which in this case will present a list of IP addresses in a specific order to the clients querying the A record of the <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Since the RFC requires that the SMTP-sender use the order given in the A record query, the DNS server is free to carefully manipulate its balancing based on any method, including round robin DNS, mail server load, or some undisclosed priority scheme.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a service}} {{provided}} by TCP/IP protocol.It {{allows you to}} connect to other computers or networks by simple names instead of requiring memorization of IP addresses.The Internet maintains two principal namespaces: the domain name hierarchy and the IP address system. The Domain Name System maintains the domain namespace and provides translation services between these two namespaces. Internet name servers implement the Domain Name System. The top hierarchy of the Domain Name System is served by the root name servers maintained by delegation by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Below the root, Internet resources are organized into a hierarchy of domains, administered by the respective registrars and domain name holders.A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records, such as address (A, AAAA), name server (NS), and <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> (MX) records for a domain name (see also List of DNS record types) and responds with answers to queries against its database.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Wong hybridized two earlier {{proposals}} for sender authentication, Designated Mailer Protocol (DMP) and Reverse <b>Mail</b> <b>Exchanger</b> (RMX), and devised SPF (Sender Policy Framework, originally Sender Permitted From). [...] In November, he met Mark Lentczner at the Hackers Conference; Lentczner, an experienced protocol and language designer {{in his own}} right, became the primary co-author on the draft specification. SPF quickly caught on among the opensource community, receiving mentions on Slashdot, on Dave Farber's influential Interesting-People mailing list, and elsewhere. During 2004 Wong traveled widely, visiting ISPs in North America, Europe, Singapore, and Japan, and speaking at conferences to explain SPF. He was appointed Senior Technical Advisor to the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group. [...] In 2004 Microsoft merged their similar proposal, Caller-ID For Email, with SPF to form Sender ID Framework. In 2005, the Microsoft implementation was rolled out in Hotmail, Exchange, and Outlook. In 2006, RFC4408 was published by the IETF as an Experimental Standard. As of August 2006, between one-third and one-half of legitimate email volume worldwide carries an SPF record.|$|E
40|$|An {{abbreviation}} for Domain Name System, DNS {{is a system}} employed for naming computers and network services. This system is organized into a hierarchical scheme of domains. Naming service provided by DNS is used in TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet, to easily locate computers and services like <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> servers, through user-friendly names. When a user enters a DNS name in an application, DNS services resolves this name to other information associated with the name, such as an IP address. This paper presents the evaluation of a DNS server performance in the experimental backgrounds to establish the fact that frequent caching of results will improve the response time of the queries. It also simulates the client –server DNS model on OPNET. It thus proposes a performance-enhancing model for its better throughput keeping in mind, the various execution measures of DNS server like parallel requests, traffic distribution and least response time, which were tested on the DNS server...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe exhaustion of available public IPv 4 addresses {{has had a}} significant impact in an expanding, networked world and has led to increased adoption of IPv 6. As IPv 6 becomes more commonplace, it permits abusive and malicious parties to exploit both new and existing vulnerabilities. Among such vulnerabilities is abusive electronic messaging, or spam. To better understand the impact of spam utilizing IPv 6 as its delivery protocol, this study focused on both real-world IPv 6 spam collected from large production domain and IPv 6 spam laboratory measurements. This study used various network traffic analysis tools to detect, classify, and associate IPv 6 spamming behavior, both at the victim <b>mail</b> <b>exchanger</b> and among IPv 6 wide-area routes. Furthermore, popular mail transfer agents were tested in an effort to profile their IPv 6 behavior and correlate with spam obtained from the real world production domain. Results show that while IPv 6 spamming behavior is growing, it {{is still in its infancy}} and no outstanding characteristics emerged that allow for definitive classification as a dominant IPv 6 spamming behavior.
