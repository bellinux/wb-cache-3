Like many journalists, he was a curious mixture of conviction, opportunism and sheer humbug. According to his biographer W. Sydney Robinson, [...] "He twisted facts, invented stories, lied, betrayed confidences, but always with a genuine desire to reform the world - and himself." [...] According to Dominic Sandbrook, [...] "Stead's papers forced his readers to confront the seedy underbelly of their own civilisation, but the editor {{probably}} knew <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> dark world than he ever let on. He held up a mirror to Victorian society, yet deep down, like so many tabloid crusaders, he was raging at his own reflection." ...|$|E
