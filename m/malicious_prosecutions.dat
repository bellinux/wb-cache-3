5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions</b> and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E

50|$|After {{losing his}} seat, Bruce was elected for Renfrewshire on 25 January 1869, {{he was made}} Home Secretary by William Ewart Gladstone. His tenure of this office was {{conspicuous}} for a reform of the licensing laws, and {{he was responsible for}} the Licensing Act 1872, which made the magistrates the licensing authority, increased the penalties for misconduct in public-houses and shortened the number of hours for the sale of drink. In 1873 Bruce relinquished the home secretaryship, at Gladstone's request, to become Lord President of the Council, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Aberdare, of Duffryn in the County of Glamorgan, on 23 August that year. Being a Gladstonian Liberal, Aberdare had hoped for a much more radical proposal to keep existing licensee holders for a further ten years, and to prevent any new applicants. Its unpopularity pricked his nonconformist's conscience, when like Gladstone himself he had a strong leaning towards Temperance. He had already pursued 'moral improvement' on miners in the regulations attempting to further ban boys from the pits. The Trades Union Act 1871 was another more liberal regime giving further rights to unions, and protection from <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the United States grand juries played a major role in public matters. During that period {{counties}} followed the traditional practice of requiring all decisions be made by at least twelve of the grand jurors, (e.g., for a twenty-three-person grand jury, twelve people would constitute a bare majority). Any citizen could bring a matter before a grand jury directly, from a public work that needed repair, to the delinquent conduct of a public official, to a complaint of a crime, and grand juries could conduct their own investigations. In that era most criminal prosecutions were conducted by private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen. A layman could bring a bill of indictment to the grand jury; if the grand jury found there was sufficient evidence for a trial, that the act was a crime under law, and that the court had jurisdiction, it would return the indictment to the complainant. The grand jury would then appoint the complaining party to exercise the authority of an attorney general, that is, one having a general power of attorney to represent the state in the case. The grand jury served to screen out incompetent or <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecutions.</b> The advent of official public prosecutors in the later decades of the 19th century largely displaced private prosecutions.|$|E

50|$|Sixteen U.S. {{states require}} another element of <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> This element, {{commonly}} called the English Rule, states that, {{in addition to}} fulfilling all other <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> elements, one must also prove injury other than the normal downside of being sued. This rule is limited to equitable damages, such as loss of profit, and excludes damages that cannot be measured by the law (e.g., damage to reputation).|$|R

5000|$|A {{cause of}} action for abuse of process {{is similar to the}} action for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> in that both actions are based on and involve the {{improper}} use of the courts and legal systems. The primary difference between the two legal actions is that <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> concerns the <b>malicious</b> or wrongful commencement of an action, while, on the other hand, abuse of process concerns the improper use of the legal process after process has already been issued and a suit has commenced. In abuse of process, the legal process is misused for some purpose which is considered improper under the law. Thus technically, the service of process itself—in the form of a summons—could be considered abuse of process under the right circumstances, e.g. fraudulent or malicious manipulation of the process itself, but in <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution,</b> the wrongful act is the actual filing of the suit itself for improper and malicious reasons. [...] As noted above, the three requirements of malice, lack of probable cause in the issuance of the process, and a termination of the prior proceeding favorable to the plaintiff, are essential elements for <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Most jurisdictions do not require any of these three elements in order to make out a prima facie case for abuse of process.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Malicious</b> <b>prosecution</b> is {{a common}} law {{intentional}} tort, while like the tort of abuse of process, its elements include (1) intentionally (and maliciously) instituting and pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action (civil or criminal) that is (2) brought without probable cause and (3) dismissed {{in favor of the}} victim of the <b>malicious</b> <b>prosecution.</b> In some jurisdictions, the term [...] "malicious prosecution" [...] denotes the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while the term [...] "malicious use of process" [...] denotes the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.|$|R
