5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that <b>moment.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

Never have I {{had so much}} {{satisfaction}} as at this <b>moment,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{have just}} explained rigorously, by the simple law of rectilinear motion, those of universal gravitation, which decreases in the same proportion as the squares of the distance increase.|$|E
500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> witnessed it." ...|$|E

500|$|Cisneros says of this moment: So to me {{it began}} there, and that's when I {{intentionally}} started writing {{about all the things}} in my culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of Wicked Wicked Ways—and the stories in House on Mango Street. I think it's ironic that at the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me. Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the [...] "thousands of silent women" [...] whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street.|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E
500|$|With {{a growing}} fanbase, the xx made {{commitments}} to more concerts and extended their tour for the album. They intermittently toured for 18 months, including most of 2010. That year, they embarked {{on their first}} US tour and played high-profile festivals such as South by Southwest, Coachella, and Bonnaroo. Croft recalled their show at Coachella, where they performed for 30,000 people: [...] "That was the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was, like, Oh, my God, I think people might be into this." [...] They were also a supporting act for fellow English group Florence and the Machine. By touring frequently, the xx broadened their reputation among listeners and the press. In March 2010, they played two consecutive nights at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London to capacity crowds and appeared {{on the cover of}} NME, who proclaimed them [...] "the most underrated band in Britain". In April and May, they toured the southern US and Japan, which Croft said was most demanding part of the tour because [...] "none of us had been away from home continuously for so long." [...] They were accompanied during this six-week period by photographer Jamie-James Medina, who later published his photos of the group in his book The Tourist (2010).|$|E

On opposition leadership, he said in 2008 that: [...] "The <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wanted to [...] was just about the first day I started in the job. There was many a time {{from the first day}} onwards when I thought to myself, How the hell can I get out of this?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} he {{resigned}} as minister, the Girondins came under attack and Roland was denounced as well. Roland fled Paris and went into hiding; in his absence, {{he was sentenced to}} death. Madame Roland remained in Paris and was arrested and executed. When Roland learned of his wife's death, he wandered away from his refuge in Rouen and wrote a few words expressing his horror at the Reign of Terror: [...] "From the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> learned that they had murdered my wife, I would no longer remain in a world stained with enemies." [...] He attached the paper to his chest, sat up against a tree, and ran a cane-sword through his heart.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Schell {{returned}} to Germany {{and played the}} title role in William Shakespeare's Hamlet for German TV, a role that he would play on two more occasions in live theatre productions during his career. Along with Laurence Olivier, Schell is considered [...] "one of the greatest Hamlets ever," [...] according to some. Schell recalled that when he played Hamlet for the first time, [...] "it was like {{falling in love with}} a woman.... not until I acted the part of Hamlet did I have a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> knew I was in love with acting." [...] Schell's performance of Hamlet was featured as one of the last episodes of the American comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Takahashi's {{works have}} been {{translated}} into English, {{as well as other}} European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said [...] "Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It's inevitable. And yet, that doesn't mean my books can't be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I feel confident that there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can {{have a lot of fun}} reading them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there and when I looked it was a <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well so I tried to rely on my upper body movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|For his {{theological}} studies Pro {{was sent}} to Enghien, Belgium, where the French Jesuits (also in exile) had their faculty of Theology. His health continued to deteriorate. There he was ordained a priest on August 31, 1925. He wrote on that occasion: [...] "How can I explain to you the sweet grace of the Holy Spirit, which invades my poor miner's soul with such heavenly joys? I could not hold back the tears {{on the day of}} my ordination, above all at the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> pronounced, together with the bishop, the words of the consecration. After the ceremony the new priests gave their first blessing to their parents. I went to my room, laid out all the photographs of my family on the table, and then blessed them {{from the bottom of my}} heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Herodotus {{attributes}} {{cause to}} both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This {{is true of}} Greek thinking in general, at least from Homer onward. Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question [...] "why did this happen?" [...] but rather [...] "why did this happen to me?" [...] By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will {{is the reason that}} the house collapses at the particular <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.|$|E
2500|$|Roberto F. Canuto {{was born}} in Asturias, Spain. Since an early age he was curious for moviemaking. He remembered to watch The Jungle Book at a movie theatre {{when he was only}} 5 and {{question}} his family about the process of making a movie. During his childhood he starts music studies and obtains degrees in Piano, Harmony and other relates subjects at the [...] "Royal Conservatory of Music of Asturias" [...] (Spain) and he joins a short curse on acting at the [...] "Superior Dramatic Art School of Asturias" [...] in 1989. It is during these years when he discovers independent films from US and authors from Europe and, according to the director: [...] "that was probably the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> decided that my dream was to follow my storytelling passion".|$|E
2500|$|... "Marry Me" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} overall single off the album (second single in the U.S.). The song made its US radio premiere on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on August 26, 2013. It {{was released}} to all digital retailers on the same day. The song's accompanying music video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on September 23, 2013. The video also features Derulo's longtime girlfriend Jordin Sparks who appeares in the video due to Derulo writing the song about her. When speaking of the song Derulo said [...] "Marry Me {{is one of those}} very pulling heart strings kind of record, it’s very different than [...] "The Other Side" [...] … Basically it’s talking about getting ready for that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ask you to marry me". The song has since peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and number 8 on the ARIA top 40 singles.|$|E
60|$|As I {{look back}} over her early infancy, I realize that I loved her, {{although}} {{it is impossible for}} me to say how much of this love is retrospective. Why I was not mad about her every hour of the day is a puzzle to me now. Why, indeed, was I not mad about all three of them? There were <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> held and kissed them, when something within me melted: <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was away from them, and thought of them. But these moments did not last. The something within me hardened again, I became indifferent, my family was wiped out of my consciousness as though it had never existed.|$|R
2500|$|... "I am most {{surprised}} by those <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have {{felt as if}} the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination– that another power has found them and generously presented them to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no! I had my weak <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} shirk. I hated to feel I wasn't free like other people, and {{was willing to}} throw away my chance of getting rich. But that wouldn't have helped much; I couldn't {{get rid of the}} duty." ...|$|R
2500|$|Oberman {{described}} {{her work as}} [...] "A kind of Three Sisters via Woody Allen", reflecting the humour she saw in Chekhov's story. She expanded upon this personal connection in an article for The Guardian: [...] "Chekhov wrote about a world I recognised from my childhood – where intense pain is covered by bravura and humour, and where intense longing is masked by self-deprecation and wit. There was the same obsession with death, the same fierce familial loyalty, the same tendency toward melodrama – {{as well as a}} great passion for food." [...] After returning from Moscow, Oberman continued to work on her reinterpretation for the next 15 years, but lacked the confidence to take her project further. However, after her success in EastEnders she was offered [...] "a lot of work" [...] and was [...] "in a position where I could green-light stuff for myself", determining that [...] "this was the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was going to make this dream happen".|$|E
2500|$|Hung {{entered her}} first Legislative Election {{campaign}} in 1989. Her KMT branch director objected to her request, and therefore {{did not give}} her time off during the campaign. Hung insisted on entering the primary and was only {{able to participate in}} the events on weekends as a candidate. She had her cousin go to the events on weekdays and hold up her poster whenever her name was called as a silent protest of her helpless absence. This was widely reported by the media and Hung won the primary by marginal votes, and thus was nominated by the party. Hung said, [...] "My father passed away the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> won the primary. It seemed that he was waiting for the final confirmation. I was whispering in his ear, 'Bless me with the nomination {{if you want me to}} embark on my career in this path of politics.'" [...] Hung subsequently won the seat in the legislative election and began her career in the Legislative Yuan for eight consecutive terms.|$|E
2500|$|.....under no {{circumstances}} whatever will I be in connexion with Mr Pitt. It {{is sufficient for}} a man's life to have been duped once.

But in stating this it certainly is not in my contemplation to become again an active member of an opposition. Those days are over—circumstances have happened that make me think that I can be no more usefully so...but, in one word, should circumstances ever present to me the opportunity of doing essential injury to Mr Pitt's power, or of rendering effectual service to Mr Fox, I will not fail to seize it.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, {{something}} so wonderful has happened. I {{can hardly believe}} it. There are <b>moments</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> quake with the fear that it is all a dream.
