500|$|Eventually, the {{personal}} horror stories Falle heard from {{other women in}} her situation convinced her {{that she needed to}} get out of prostitution. Her substance dependence became so severe that she almost died. Her best friend was killed by her pimp. By this point, many of her friends in the sex industry had died, and she thought that she would be next. One night, Falle was hiding alone in a hotel room when she found a Bible placed there by Gideons International. She began reading the Psalms and later said, [...] "For the first time I understood what God was saying to <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> <b>night</b> my life began to move in a new direction." [...] On her 27th birthday, Falle left her husband and returned to her mother. Because of the delusions, Falle did not recognize her mother, thinking she had been replaced with a clone. Falle told her mother about being dependent on cocaine, entering prostitution, and marrying her pimp. Her mother accepted her back. It took several more years before Falle gave up hope that her husband would change.|$|E
2500|$|According to Byrd, a Klan {{official}} told him, [...] "You have {{a talent for}} leadership, Bob... The country needs young men like you in {{the leadership of the}} nation." [...] Byrd later recalled, [...] "Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But strike <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> it did." [...] Byrd became a recruiter and leader of his chapter. When it came time to elect the top officer (Exalted Cyclops) in the local Klan unit, Byrd won unanimously.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the murder}} of Virgil Starks nine weeks later, Hollis and Larey {{declared}} that their attacker was the same person who killed the other five victims. Hollis said, [...] "I think {{the man is a}} young white man; under thirty years old." [...] He also stated, [...] "I know he's crazy. The crazy things he said made me feel that his mind was warped," [...] and [...] "Evidently he thought he had killed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Right after it happened, I told the deputy sheriff and the city attorney that that man was dangerous. He is a potential murderer. The next person he gets will be killed. It wasn't long after that when the first two bodies were found out on West Seventh street. I think there are three people alive today who escaped from that man. The woman who is in the hospital now , Mrs. Larey and I." ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot set {{the story}} down as Nathaniel Peacock {{told it to}} <b>me</b> on <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> because his words were many; but the tale ran much like this: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I do not {{hesitate}} {{to say that my}} regard for her was too much for <b>me</b> on <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when I sent for you to the dining-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A wire was round <b>me</b> <b>that</b> white <b>night</b> on {{the river}} when she let him take me from her. Then I hated the wire. Alas! hear the end.|$|R
60|$|No! I {{lie down}} on my bed, and I {{discover}} {{that there is no}} rest for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And then I {{should be}} with him. Rosamond, send her away, I can't bear her. She sent him away from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> I heard her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At last, Cris, it is mine {{to thank}} you and to repay you in some measure for the service you {{rendered}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> at Penrith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you {{not speak}} to <b>me</b> on <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in the Halakazi caves, Umslopogaas, of one Zinita, who is your wife, and Inkosikaas of the People of the Axe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't try me too high," [...] she begged. [...] "Not now, precious." [...] And, indeed, even as I spoke, it did strike <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the <b>night</b> {{was pretty}} still.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, you did. You took <b>me</b> there <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when Prince--danced {{with the}} girl. Don't you {{remember}} the blowsy fat woman {{at the top of}} the stairs;--a regular horror?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They began first, as {{it turned}} out," [...] he said smiling, [...] "and very nearly made a meal of <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> on my way homeward." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{much sleep}} visited <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> In the morning, the young ladies not {{stirring}} and no prospects of duty for me, I rode down to town.|$|E
60|$|While we {{were eating}} I {{repeated}} to Tars Tarkas the story which Sola had told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> upon the sea bottom during the march to Thark.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{the full}} {{sense of it}} was with <b>me</b> all <b>that</b> <b>night</b> as I drove, lonely above the rush and murmur of my engines, out upon the weltering circle of the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nobody but my sister,' pursued Charley, 'would {{have found}} out such an {{extraordinary}} companion. She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another. She told <b>me</b> so, <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when we went there.' ...|$|R
60|$|Clearly I did not burn with {{a desire}} to linger, but rather it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} <b>night</b> had closed in, black and moonless, we must set out again, and push on to Monnerville, albeit our beasts were worn and the distance a good three leagues.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{remember}} me, sir?' said Clemency, {{trembling with}} emotion; 'I saw just now you did! You remember <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in the garden. [...] I was with her!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you met <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> on the Sacramento boat, {{and looked}} at me, did you--did I," [...] she hesitated,--"did {{you look at me}} because I had been crying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|STRANGWAY. Never loved me? Never loved <b>me?</b> <b>That</b> <b>night</b> at Tregaron? [At {{the look}} on her face] You might have told me before you went away! Why keep me all these---- ...|$|E
60|$|He wasn't {{pleased at}} all. He said {{all sorts of}} things and tried to kick <b>me,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> when he thought I was not listening, I heard him telling his wife that I was a pest and would have to be got rid of. <b>That</b> made <b>me</b> think.|$|R
6000|$|... "One word. Has it any {{connection}} {{with what you}} said to <b>me</b> on <b>that</b> last <b>night,</b> {{when we had a}} talk together on spiritualism?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, I have YOU," [...] she said. [...] "Life can't be {{altogether}} empty {{with such}} a friend. Anne, pat my head--just as if I were a little girl--MOTHER me a bit--and {{let me tell you}} while my stubborn tongue is loosed a little just what you and your comradeship have meant to <b>me</b> since <b>that</b> <b>night</b> I met you on the rock shore." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} sleep for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> I had {{first of all}} besought Nick to go up into the drawing-room and give the money back. But some strange obstinacy in him resisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ana," [...] {{said the}} Prince to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> when I {{was talking with}} him {{before he went to}} rest, [...] "I know not why, but I fear that man Laban; he has an evil eye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you remember," [...] he went on, [...] "how {{the young lady}} {{proposed}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> that I should finance a little venture in which she and her sleepy-eyed friend opposite were interested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Welcome! I have {{expected}} you. You could not surprise old Miriam. The teraph told <b>me</b> last <b>night</b> <b>that</b> {{you would be}} here....' ...|$|R
60|$|Eve {{was one of}} {{the first}} to congratulate <b>me</b> when, late <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> the results came in and I found that by a {{majority}} of twenty-seven votes I had been elected the member for the division.|$|R
60|$|I hugged my fire, and sat there, {{listening}} {{with all}} my ears, imagining every rustle of leaf to be the step of a lion. It was long before the thrills and shivers stopped chasing over me, longer before I could decide to lie down. But {{after a while the}} dead quiet of the forest persuaded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the <b>night</b> was far advanced, and I fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no more}} slumber for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> and {{in order}} to keep awake I sat bolt upright. This evidently did not please my companion, for {{presently}} he too sat up and looked at me sharply.|$|E
60|$|I got {{her back}} to the house and to her bed, whither she went obediently enough, and soon fell into the sleep of exhaustion. But there was no more sleep for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> I kept a grim vigil with dread.|$|E
60|$|That was 'ow I came {{to hear of}} it fust; a {{policeman}} told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> as I stood outside the gate 'aving a quiet pipe. He wasn't shedding tears; his only idea was that Sam 'ad got off too easy.|$|E
60|$|Steele {{instructed}} <b>me</b> to go <b>that</b> <b>night</b> to {{the saloon}} in question {{and get in}} the game. I complied, and, in order not to be overcarefully sized up by the dealer, I pretended to be well under the influence of liquor.|$|R
60|$|And then, {{in answer}} to his questions, I told him briefly of all <b>that</b> had befallen <b>me</b> since <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in Paris when the wager had been laid, and of how, through the cunning silence of Chatellerault, I was now upon the very {{threshold}} of the scaffold. His wrath burst forth at that, {{and what he said}} of the Count did me good to hear. At last I stemmed his invective.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Darrell,' said Lord Squib, 'is {{there any}} chance of my being a {{commissioner}} for anything? It struck <b>me</b> last <b>night</b> <b>that</b> I {{had never been in}} office.' ...|$|R
