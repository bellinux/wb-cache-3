25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto {{a printed circuit board}} which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was much larger than the <b>memory</b> <b>module</b> compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large <b>memory</b> <b>module</b> in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} memory capacity and bandwidth, chips are combined on a module. For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips {{with the common}} address lines are called a memory rank. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal rows and banks. A <b>memory</b> <b>module</b> may bear more than one rank. The term sides would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of chips on the module.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory clock speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per <b>memory</b> <b>module,</b> DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that near-data processing (NDP) is an effective technique for improving performance and energy efficiency of data-intensive workloads. However, leveraging NDP in realistic systems with multiple <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> introduces a new challenge. In today's systems, where no computation occurs in <b>memory</b> <b>modules,</b> the physical address space is interleaved at a fine granularity among all <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> to help improve the utilization of processor-memory interfaces by distributing the memory traffic. However, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful placement of data in <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> such that near-data computations and their exclusively used data can be localized in individual <b>memory</b> <b>modules,</b> while distributing shared data among <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> to reduce hotspots. In order to address this new challenge, we propose a set of techniques that (1) enable collections of OS pages to either be fine-grain interleaved among <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> (as is done today) or to be placed contiguously on individual <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> (as is desirable for NDP private data), and (2) decide whether to localize or distribute each memory object based on its anticipated access pattern and steer computations to the memory where the data they access is located. Our evaluations across a wide range of workloads show that the proposed mechanism improves performance by 31 % and reduces 38 % remote data accesses over a baseline system that cannot exploit computate-data affinity characteristics.

40|$|Switching Architectures {{deploying}} shareable parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> {{are quite}} versatile {{in their ability}} to scale to higher capacity while retaining the advantage of sharing its entire memory resource among all input and output ports. The two main classes of such architectures, namely, the Shared Multibuffer-(SMB-) based switch and the Sliding-Window-(SW-) based packet switch, both deploy parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> that are physically separate but logically connected. Inspite of their similarity in regards to using shareable parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules,</b> they differ in switching control and scheduling of packets to parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules.</b> SMB switch uses centralized control whereas the SW switch uses a decentralized control for switching operations. In this paper, we present a new memory assignment scheme for the Sliding-Window (SW) switch for assigning packets to parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> that maximizes the parallel storage of packets to multiple <b>memory</b> <b>modules.</b> We compare the performance of a sliding-window switch deploying this new memory assignment scheme with that of an SMB switch architecture under conditions of identical traffic type and memory resources deployed. The simulation results show that the new memory assignment scheme for the sliding window switch maximizes parallel storage of packets input in a given switch cycle, and it does not require speed-up of <b>memory</b> <b>modules.</b> Furthermore, it provides a superior performance compared to that of the SMB switch under the constraints of fixed memory-bandwidth and memory resources...|$|R
