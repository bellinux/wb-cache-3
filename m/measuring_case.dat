40|$|The {{problem of}} {{inspecting}} case-hardened steel {{has been of}} interest to industry for some time. A reliable nondestructive method is sought that will not only enable the depth-of-treatment to be established but will also provide some measure of a component’s bulk material properties and surface condition. While some methods can provide an adequate {{solution to the problem}} of <b>measuring</b> <b>case</b> depth, we will show the limitations and pitfalls awaiting the unwary. For example, small variations in heat-treatment conditions can lead to large differences in microstructure, and hence magnetic properties, of a steel. This can be especially true for the near surface layers of a component being treated. These variations in magnetic properties have a strong effect on eddy current and magnetic measurements and can lead to inaccurate results when <b>measuring</b> <b>case</b> depth. In addition, batch variations in material properties can also affect the measurements...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to create a supply chain measurement framework for manufacturing industry, define what data should be measured and verify the measurement framework in the case company's supply chain. The research approach is hermeneutic and the research was a qualitative, constructive single case study research. The case company operates in the steel industry and provides prefabricated products for customers. The case supply chain was defined to be one supply chain in a plant where prefabricated products are produced. There is a review of the current understanding of supply chain management and literature related to supply chain {{performance measurement}} and the study creates a framework for supply chain measurement. This study presents the main theory framework of supply chain performance measurement. The key elements for the measurement framework were defined as time, profitability, order book analysis and managerial analysis. The measurement framework is tested by <b>measuring</b> <b>case</b> supply chain performance. The measurement framework is a valid framework for supply chain performance measurement in manufacturing industry. It is stated that supply chain performance measurement is extremely important in developing supply chain.

Agenda 6 th Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is to combat HIV / AIDS, malaria and other diseases including pulmonary TB. Pulmonary TB is third number the biggest contributor to the death in the world, and Indonesia is the third country {{one of the largest}} contributors in the world. Pulmonary TB is highly contagious pulmonary tuberculosis patients where 1 BTA (+) can infect 10 - 15 people every year. One indicator of the success rate of TB control is the achievement of case detection rate (CDR) more than 70 %. Community participation is needed to achieve it by community-based surveillance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the effectiveness of community-based surveillance in assessing case detection rate (CDR) in Sumber Tlaseh district. Dander, Bojonegoro. The study design used is pre experiment with the approach of one shoot pre test-post test only design. The research sample in cadre TB surveillance is formed by taking a sample size of 24 people. The research sample in <b>measuring</b> <b>case</b> detection rate (CDR) is the public suspected tuberculosis. The independent variable is the community-based surveillance, the dependent variable is the case detection rate (CDR). The effectiveness of cadres carry out surveillance capability was measured by using a test in the form of a questionnaire before and after the education and training of pulmonary TB surveillance and tested with Paired T-Test, while the case detection rate (CDR) is measured by the results of the recording and reporting of TB cadres in surveillance activities. The effectiveness of community-based surveillance activities in measuring the percentage of CDR by comparing the before and after implemented community-based surveillance activities, where the initial CDR derived from secondary data clinic.

40|$|The {{research}} is {{initiated by the}} findings that the coating variation of light weight coated LWC paper is in synchronization with a backing roll of a coating station. The frequency of the largest peak in the quality variation spectrum corresponds to the oval geometry of a backing roll, but no such a phenomenon has been measured in a roll shop. It was realized {{that the cause of}} the research problem could be the change in the geometry as a function of running speed. First, a theoretical study is carried out by building a single cross-section FE model of a backing roll using measured wall thickness data with systematic thickness variation. Only the main variation component is used. The analysis shows the wall thickness variation is a possible cause for a dynamic geometry change. For a more detailed study, a cylindrical FE model is created, and the measured wall thickness matrix is used to define the inner surface nodes. The analysis shows dynamic geometry change although the geometry is more complex due to fixed end plates. A device is developed to measure the dynamic geometry change. The device is calibrated using a multi-lobe disc as a reference standard. Using the principles of GUM (Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements) it is shown that the expanded uncertainty U of the device is less than two micrometers in a typical <b>measuring</b> <b>case.</b> A full scale backing roll is used as a test roll in laboratory experiments. The measurements of the roll show similar behavior that was observed in the FE analyses. The magnitude of the change in simulation was about 20 % lower than in the measurements. It is concluded that enhancements in the FE model and the processing of the measuring data would lead to more consistent results. The significance of the phenomenon is studied using a quite large sample of backing rolls at paper mills in Finland and abroad. The measured rolls are classified according to different generations of manufacturing processes and materials used. The study showed that dynamic geometry change is a common phenomenon in industry. A correlation analysis between machine direction quality variations of LWC paper and the dynamic behavior of a backing roll shows a very strong correlation. In many cases, the dynamic geometry change is the most significant single component causing run-out, and thus the main single cause for the harmonic paper quality variation. During the research, some methods were used for maintenance purposes to improve the dynamic behavior of backing rolls. According to the measurements, the used maintenance methods proved to be useful...|$|E

40|$|Steel {{components}} are often {{subjected to a}} hardening {{process in which the}} surface gets hardened in order to improve resistance to wear. This introduces a casehardened layer. Various steel components have different requirements for the case depth. It is necessary to develop a nondestructive tool to monitor case depth for quality control. The case hardening process produces changes in the microstructure. As a result, the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability in the casehardened region are different from those in the substrate. This makes it possible to determine case depth using eddy current method.

Precisely, we considered the set of all step functions (the set of all uniform limits of such functions) such that integral of absolute value of the functions with respect to non-negative finitely additive measure λ is equal to the unit. For these sets, the possibility of the embedding is proved for the cases of non-atomic and finite range measure λ; in the cases the compacts do not coincide. Namely, in the nonatomic <b>measure</b> <b>case,</b> it is shown that the mentioned sets of functions allow the embedding into the unit ball (in the strong norm-variation) of weakly absolutely continuous measures with respect to λ in the form of a everywhere dense subset. In the finite range <b>measure</b> <b>case,</b> it is shown that the mentioned sets of functions allow the embedding into the unit sphere of weakly absolutely continuous measures with respect to λ in the form of a everywhere dense subset. In the last case the sphere is closed in the weak-star topology.
