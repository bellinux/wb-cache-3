5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> relevant {{for patients who}} have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> sensitive to environmental pollutants. When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it has possibly been exposed to a toxin.|$|E
5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation {{is that a}} high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs. APBI can typically be completed {{over the course of}} a week. The option of brachytherapy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E

5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|E

The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. Basically, a lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol has an {{additive}} effect {{when combined with}} zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>particularly</b> sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone.

25|$|The {{techniques}} and associated equipment {{that have been}} developed to overcome the limitations of conventional single cylinder, open circuit scuba diving are necessarily, more complex and subject to error, and technical dives are often done in more dangerous environments, so the consequences of an error or malfunction are greater.
