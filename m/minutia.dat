40|$|Minutiae-based {{method is}} the most popular {{approach}} in fingerprint matching. However, most existing methods need to search for the best correspondence of <b>minutiae</b> pairs or use reference points (core and delta points) to estimate the alignment parameters. The problem of lost <b>minutiae</b> or spurious <b>minutiae</b> always occurs during the <b>minutiae</b> detection process. Hence, the corresponding pairs or reference points may not be found under this condition. This paper proposes a new minutiae-based fingerprint matching algorithm using phase correlation. We define a new representation called <b>Minutiae</b> Direction Map (MDM). First, we convert <b>minutiae</b> sets into 2 D image spaces.

The similarity of two fingerprints is determined by the distance between two <b>minutiae</b> sets. Our approach does not need to search for the corresponding <b>minutiae</b> pairs.
