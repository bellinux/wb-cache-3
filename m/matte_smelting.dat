50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>matte</b> <b>smelting</b> stage is to {{eliminate}} {{as much of the}} unwanted iron, sulfur and gangue minerals (such as silica, magnesia, alumina and limestone) as possible, while minimizing the loss of copper. This is achieved by reacting iron sulfides with oxygen (in air or oxygen enriched air) to produce iron oxides (mainly as FeO, but with some magnetite (Fe3O4)) and sulfur dioxide.|$|E
50|$|The initial melting of the {{material}} to be smelted is usually {{referred to as the}} smelting or <b>matte</b> <b>smelting</b> stage. It can be undertaken in a variety of furnaces, including the largely obsolete blast furnaces and reverberatory furnaces, as well as flash furnaces, Isasmelt furnaces, etc. The product of this smelting stage is a mixture of copper, iron and sulfur that is enriched in copper, and which is called matte or copper matte. The term matte grade is normally used to refer to the copper content of the matte.|$|E

40|$|Four {{sulphide}} minerals – pyrite (FeS 2), pyrrhotite (Fe 1 –xS), pentlandite ([Ni,Fe] 9 S 8), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) – {{contain the}} base metals {{and most of}} the iron in concentrates of platinum group metals (PGMs). In the pyrometallurgical processing of PGM concentrates these sulphides form a <b>matte</b> during <b>smelting,</b> and iron and sulphur are removed from the matte during the converting process. This paper discusses the roasting of Merensky concentrate in air before smelting, with the purpose of reducing the matte load to the converter. Roasting tests were conducted in a bench-scale rotary kiln at temperatures from 350 °C to 700 °C. The concentrate tested contained 17. 4 % sulphur and consisted of 23 % pyrrhotite, 16 % pentlandite, 11 % chalcopyrite, and 2 % pyrite. The particles were fine (d 50 = 22 μm), and all the sulphide particles were liberated. Roasting in air at 550 °C and 650 °C for 20 minutes removed respectively 60 % and 70 % of the sulphur. The iron in the sulphides was oxidized to Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite) at temperatures below 500 ⁰C and to Fe 2 O 3 (haematite) at temperatures above 550 ⁰C. At 700 ⁰C the bed sintered and copper oxides formed. At temperatures below 450 °C oxidation was incomplete: pyrrhotite remained and only 30 % of the sulphur was removed. Smelting tests were conducted to assess matte fall and the deportment of copper and nickel to matte. It was evident that roasting resulted in lower matte falls (a drop of approximately 60 %) compared with matte falls from unroasted concentrate. The iron and sulphur levels in the matte were reduced to below 3. 5 % and 22 % respectively. This paper also briefly describes the mechanisms by which pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite are oxidized during roasting. For chalcopyrite, the mechanism proceeds through an intermediate solid solution phase, which extends from Cu 1. 02 Fe 1. 04 S 2 to Cu 2. 04 Fe 0. 72 S 2 to a copper-rich solid solution of bornite (Cu 4 Fe 1. 4 S 4 –Cu 2 S). The oxidation of pentlandite proceeds through a monosulphide solid solution (Ni 0. 39 Fe 0. 53 S–Ni 0. 74 Fe 0. 15 S) to a solid solution of heazlewoodite ([Ni,Fe] 3 ±xS 2). These mechanisms are explored in relation to chemical thermodynamics and microstructures. This paper was first presented at the, Platinum Conference 2014, 20 – 24 October 2014, Sun City South Africa.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. An {{understanding}} of the behaviour of chromium in mattes equilibrated with chrome-saturated slags {{is essential for the}} prediction and control of chromium deportment in these melts. The main ore reserves of South Africa’s platinum group metals (PGM) are associated with the Merensky and UG 2 reefs of the Bushveld Complex. The gradual depletion of the pyroxenitic Merensky reef over the years has necessitated the PGM industry to exploit the underlying chromiterich UG 2 reef. The problem with UG 2 reef is that it contains significant amounts of chromium, this being typically 5 % (reported as Cr 2 O 3) against < 1 % for the Merensky reef (in concentrates). Chromium has a number of deleterious effects on base-metal smelting processes. Under given conditions, it forms chromite spinels, which can accumulate and, over a period of time, form undesirable build-ups resulting in reduced furnace operational volume. The chromite spinels also tend to increase slag viscosity, thereby impacting negatively on the slag/matte separation, which leads to matte entrainment in slag. Moreover, high viscosities lead to problems with tapping of the furnace melts. Finally {{it can be said that}} chromium that deports to the <b>matte</b> during <b>smelting</b> will normally tend to precipitate as spinels during subsequent converting, and lead to the formation of very stable and unwanted slag foams in the converter. In literature, there exists very little published work on the behaviour of chromium in sulphur-saturated systems such as matte-smelting furnaces. The few publications that exist in this area do not cover the effect of controlling all the pertinent variables simultaneously on the behaviour of chromium in mattes in equilibrium with chromium-containing slags. Hence the main focus of the oxygen fugacities on the mineralogical and deportment behaviour of chromium in a matte-slag system. All the three variables (temperature, oxygen fugacity (pO 2), and sulphur fugacity (pS 2)) were investigated at three levels. Temperatures studied were 1300 °C, 1400 °C, and 1500 °C. Oxygen and sulphur fugacities were established by controlling the mix-ratios of purified carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and argon. Oxygen fugacities were maintained at 10 - 10 atm, 10 - 8 atm, and 10 - 6 atm; whereas sulphur fugacities were maintained at 10 - 6 atm, 10 - 4 atm, and 10 - 2 atm. In order to investigate the effect of each of these three variables (temperature, pS 2, and pO 2) at different levels of the other variables, a completely randomised 33 full factorial experimental design was adopted. The study revealed that chromium is generally present in matte as both dissolved CrS and as precipitated oxidic and sulphidic chromium spinel phases. It was shown that as the conditions become more oxidising (pO 2 = 10 - 6 atm), CrS (which is soluble in matte) becomes a predominant phase, and as the conditions become more reducing (pO 2 = 10 - 10 atm), the sulphospinel, daubreelite (FeCr 2 S 4), becomes a more predominant phase. Oxidic chromium spinels were found to be present in matte under the more oxidising conditions (pO 2 of 10 - 6 atm) of this investigation. The presence of the above-mentioned phases was confirmed using X-ray diffraction. Subject to the experimental conditions employed in this research, chromium was found to partition the least to matte under the conditions of; low temperature, high pO 2, and low pS 2. Conversely, chromium was found to partition the most to matte under the conditions of; high temperature, low pO 2, and high pS 2...|$|R

40|$|In copper extraction, the Cu-Fe-S {{minerals}} {{from which}} about 80 % of world’s copper originates from are insoluble in aqueous solutions hence {{much of the}} copper extraction is through the pyrometallurgical route. In this pyrometallurgical route, the Cu-Fe-S and Cu-S mineral particles are separated from gangue minerals by froth flotation to obtain a copper concentrate (20 - 30 % Cu) which is then melted at about 1200 oC and oxidised (smelting) to produce a sulphide-rich melt called matte (45 - 75 % Cu), and an oxide-rich melt called slag (1 - 2 % Cu). The separation of these two melts (matte and slag) in the smelting process is enhanced by addition of silica (SiO 2) flux which makes them immiscible. The molten <b>matte</b> from the <b>smelting</b> process is further oxidised in the converting process where blister copper (99 % Cu) and slag (4 - 8 % Cu) are produced. Boliden Mineral AB is a metals company with two of its five smelters being copper smelters namely Rönnskär and Harjavalta, which use the copper extraction processes (smelting and converting) described above. Rönnskär smelter {{is located on the}} coast of Skellefteå in Sweden, while Harjavalta smelter is located in Finland with operations in Harjavalta and Pori. The separation of different molten phases (matte, white metal, metal, speiss and slag) in copper and other base metals production is critical in that it affects the efficiency of the smelting and converting processes as the direct and total yield of the processes get affected. Since in both smelting and converting processes the phase separation is mostly mechanical through settling (gravity separation), these processes are collectively being referred to as settling processes in this study. It is therefore, important to have an in-depth understanding of the degree of separation of the molten phases in these settling processes, and the factors that could influence the settling. The known factors that could influence settling are time, temperature, density, viscosity, composition and vessel geometry. Therefore, in this dissertation, mapping (graphic symbolic representation of the degree of separation) of different settling processes at the Boliden Rönnskär and Harjavalta smelters is done to enable assessment of the quality of settling in each process studied, and compare the different settling processes. The result of this study could then be used to improve processes efficiency as the yields would be improved. Also, process operating parameters that affect separation such as settling time would be optimised. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the selected slag samples from Boliden Rönnskär and Harjavalta smelters settling processes gave an understanding of the characteristics of the different slags. Based on this understanding, Light Optical Microscopy (LOM) slag characterization was used {{to come up with a}} mapping of the different settling processes at the two smelters which included the electric smelting furnace, flash furnace, electronic scrap kaldo (E-Kaldo) furnace, lead kaldo furnace, precious metals (PMs) kaldo furnace, and Peirce-Smith (PS) converter. Comparing LOM micrographs of smelting processes to converting processes proved that the degree of separation was better in smelting processes. Slag composition was observed to be a key factor in settling processes as with it other factors such as viscosity, temperature and settling time become interlinked. As slag composition would be controlled to improve settling, it would also indirectly help manage impurities in the processes. It is recommended that the degree of separation be quantified so that a proper assessment of process optimization is made. Validerat; 20150706 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} concept is proposed, one that {{combines}} the inherent advantages of conventional hydro- and pyro-metallurgical processes to {{provide opportunities for}} significant increases in resource utilisation and smelter productivity. The process involves first leaching copper minerals in aqueous solution, separation of undesirable impurity elements from the solution using conventional hydrometallurgical technologies, and then preparation of a precipitated solid copper compound product. The product can then be used directly as a high-copper, low-iron feedstock in the smelting and/or converting stages of pyrometallurgical copper production. The solid precipitated copper product can be transported to the smelter and used as a separate feed, or {{can be used to}} enhance copper concentrations in sulphide concentrate blends.

40|$|Platinum group metals (PGMs) are {{traditionally}} smelted in electric furnaces where the valuable metals are {{collected in a}} base-metal sulphide matte. An alternative to this process is the ConRoast process that uses reductive alloy smelting in a DC arc furnace to collect the valuable metals in an iron-rich alloy. Reductive smelting of feed materials containing PGMs, using carbon as a reducing agent, {{can be used to}} obtain high PGM and base-metal recoveries and to ensure the solubility of chromium in slags. Based on work carried out in Mintek’s 3 MW DC arc furnace at throughputs of over 1000 tons per month, it was found that PGMs could be collected effectively, and that the chromium problem could be managed. However, if matte is present in the furnace, there remains a significant risk of furnace failure. Furthermore, the PGM ‘lockup ’ (inventory inside the furnace) in a process that used reductive <b>matte</b> <b>smelting</b> of UG 2 concentrates was much greater than that of reductive alloy smelting.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an alternative technique for measuring the matte level height in sulphide smelting furnaces. The initial studies involved applying electrochemical oxygen probes in a smelting furnace to measure the oxygen potentials of the matte and slag phases. However, these measurements were not successful as a result of low temperatures, preventing the reference electrode from attaining equilibrium during the measurements. These trials were followed up by using oxygen probes containing a (Mo + MoO 2) reference electrode instead of the (Cr + Cr 2 O 3) reference electrode used previously. It was shown that with some further development work, {{it should be possible to}} measure the oxygen potential of these mattes accurately. Further measurements were performed with a magnetic sensor in sulphide mattes. It was shown that an electronic signal, which is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding material, was generated during immersion into liquid matte. These measurements were extended and done in a smelting furnace. Initial results indicated that when the magnetic sensor was dipped through the slag layer into the matte, a signal was generated as soon as the sensor came in contact with the matte. Measurements are ongoing in order to record (on a computer for improved accuracy) the signal as a function of distance when the sensor is immersed through the slag layer into the matte phase. The magnetic sensor measurements may be the solution to a matte level measurement problem that has existed for a few decades in <b>matte</b> <b>smelting</b> furnaces...|$|E
40|$|PGM {{concentrates}} {{contain more}} than just the platinum group minerals. They also concentrate three minerals pyrrhotite (Fe 1 xS), pentlandite ([Fe,Ni] 9 S 8) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2). In a sample of Merensky concentrate tested in this study, these minerals account for half the concentrate. During smelting and converting these sulphides collect the PGMs in <b>matte.</b> <b>Smelting</b> produces a matte, the composition of which converting adjusts by oxidizing sulphur to SO 2 and iron to Fe 2 SiO 4 (fayalite). The objective of roasting a PGM concentrate would be to alter the composition of a concentrate, at lower temperatures in a kiln before smelting, so that the matte formed contains less iron and sulphur, but, still, collects all of the PGMs, copper and nickel. Roasting tests were conducted in a bench-scale rotary kiln on a sample of Merensky concentrate supplied by Lonmin. The kiln was purged with air to maintain high oxygen partial pressures (~ 0. 21 atm O₂). Test temperatures from 350 °C to 700 °C and residence times from 2 to 30 minutes were explored. The roasted products were smelted in argon at 1500 °C to assess the effect of roasting on matte fall and the deportment of base metals. Roasting for 20 minutes at 550 and 650 °C reduced the sulphur content in the concentrate by 60 and 70 %, respectively from 17. 4 % to ~ 5 % sulphur. Iron was oxidized to an iron oxide. Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite) predominated at lower temperatures (< 500 °C); Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) predominates at higher temperatures. Oxidation in each of these minerals occurred through a number of reactions. Some rates were faster than others. Under the conditions tested all of the iron in pyrrhotite oxidized to iron oxides, and most of the iron in chalcopyrite and pentlandite were oxidized. Copper and nickel remained as sulphides. The smelting of roasted products produced a lower matte fall, the iron in matte was less than 3 %, and matte collected all of the copper, but not all of the nickel. Nickel also partitioned to the slag, where it reported to the spinel phases. The matte formed (from concentrate roasted at 550 °C) in a number of discrete prills (rather than collecting in a single "button"), which might have been a consequence of high slag viscosities. For concentrate roasted at 650 °C discrete alloy prills and not matte prills were formed. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The matte {{converting}} furnace s are {{found at the}} heart of the copper and nickel smelting processes where oxygen contained in air and industrial oxygen is used to oxidise iron in the furnace matte to produce blister copper or the iron free matte suitable for treatment in the downstream processes. A fundamental knowledge of the base metals <b>matte</b> <b>smelting</b> and converting processes system is valuable for maintaining a stable and optimum process operation. A mathematical model for the Ni - Cu - PGM matte converting process has been developed based on the assumption that the converting process is both in chemical and thermal equilibrium. The converting process demonstrated by the model is the Top Submerged Lance (TSL) base metal continuous converter that treats Ni - Cu - PGM furnace matte similar to the one utilized at one platinum smelter. The TSL PGM converter was chosen for the reasons that the Ausmelt/Isasmelt TSL smelting furnaces are high ly productive flexible smelting and converting units and environmentally friendly, that requires a low capital cost compared to other smelting processes. The model predicts the masses of the process inputs of air, oxygen, fuel coal or oil, silica flux and the outputs components contained in the three product s high grade matte, slag and offgas. The mathematical model utilises the matrix - inverse method that is used to solve the matrix representing a system of several linear equations to give the values of unknown variables. The mathematical matrix - inverse method provides us with the tool to solve many large linear equations arranged in a square matrix numerically to gives solutions. The matrix - inverse method was chosen because it is part of windows excel formulas as MINVERSE and MMULT formulas which is accessible on most computers with Microsoft windows program. The inverse of the matrices is solved using the Gauss - Jordan mathematical method. The study found that the matrix simulation model is able to give accurate predictions of the masses of the industrial TSL converter process inputs fuel, air, oxygen, and silica flux as well as the process outputs masses of the components of converter matte, slag and offgases. The model also indicated that changes in the feed matte composition, moisture in feed, matte feed rate, oxygen enrichment, bath operating temperature and fuel type results in change in one or more of the process inputs requirement and masses and composition of product phases. The simulated model results compare very well with the industrial plant process parameters sourced from one of the platinum smelters that use the TSL technology for {{converting furnace}} matte. The results predicted by the model provides good insight into the operations, control and design of the TSL Ni - Cu matte converter and therefore the model is regarded as an invaluable asset for predicting the process dynamics of the present and future converting units. The model provides a good understanding of the base matte converting process and as such will serve as a useful tool in improving and optimising the base metals converting processes without carrying out extensive and expensive tests. It is concluded from the study that the mathematical matrix - inverse calculation method is suitable for modelling the smelting and converting processes of the Ni - Cu - Fe - PGM matte in the TSL converter. The model results were validated through comparison with actual plant operating parameters sources from the relevant platinum smelter which indicated an accuracy of over 9 0 % on most parameters. The modelling of the base metal smelting and converting processes has valuably been furthered, however for complete confidence in the model results, further validation is recommended using other simulation softwares and methods...|$|E
