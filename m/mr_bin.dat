2500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{criticized the}} film for not {{mentioning}} {{the history of}} repression, aggression, war crimes and the general state {{of human rights in}} Saddam Hussein's Iraq, nor Iraq's noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions. Hitchens writes, [...] "in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic." [...] While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests [...] "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation" [...] and that [...] "Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden are no problem. ...

2500|$|Said Steve Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally ended last Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this can be tough to distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing <b>Mr</b> <b>bin</b> Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi's {{links to}} Islamic {{fundamentalist}} groups, {{as well as}} allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting Osama bin Laden to the country. The United States had listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993, mostly due to al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi taking complete power in the early 1990s. U.S. firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997. In 1998, the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum was destroyed by a U.S. cruise missile strike because of its alleged production of chemical weapons and links to al-Qaeda. However the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning {{the attack on the}} factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in the New York Times: [...] "Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to <b>Mr.</b> <b>bin</b> Laden or to chemical weapons was weak." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 23, 2006 the United States Department of the Treasury {{designated}} Abdelrazik as {{a supporter}} of al-Qaeda and a terrorist, [...] "for his high-level ties to and support for al-Qaeda." [...] According to the Globe and Mail, the U.S. State Department believes, [...] "Mr. Abdelrazik was “closely associated with Abu Zubaydah, Osama bin Laden's lieutenant responsible for recruiting and for al-Qaeda's network of training camps in Afghanistan.” The United States also alleges Mr. Abdelrazik recruited and accompanied a Tunisian extremist named Raouf Hannachi for paramilitary training at a camp in Afghanistan in 1996 “where al-Qaeda and other UN-sanctioned terrorist groups were known to train,” and became personally acquainted with <b>Mr.</b> <b>bin</b> Laden". [...] In April 2011, Wikileaks revealed that a November 2008 U.S. Department of Defence document stated that Abdelrazik had admitted receiving $10 000 from alleged al-Qaeda financier Hassan Zemiri, who was captured in late 2001 in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. [...] However, none of these allegations have been proven {{in a court of}} law and Abdelrazik has never been charged with any crime, in Canada or anywhere else in the world. Eight days after he was designated a terrorist by the US, he was added to the UN Security Council terrorist blacklist (not a no fly list) by the U.S. and is now the only living Canadian on that list. According to the Globe and mail,"any country can nominate anyone they consider to be an islamic extremist. All his personal assets were frozen once he was put on that list. Individuals on the list are subject to a sanctions regime which include an asset freeze and a ban on international travel (but not flight per se). According to a letter sent on April 18, 2008, by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Abousfian Abdelrazik's lawyer, the Canadian government requested the UN's 1267 Committee to remove Abdelrazik from its list of al Qaeda supporters.|$|E
