40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims {{to protect}} the aquatic {{environment}} and human health by reducing pollutants at the source. In order to achieve this, the concentration of priority substances should be lower than Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) values at the point sources. There are cases when the priority substance exceeds the EQS at the effluent discharge, however, they should be met at a distance close to the discharge point. The zones {{in the vicinity of}} discharge points where the priority substances exceed the relevant EQS values are called <b>mixing</b> <b>zones.</b> Article 4 of Directive 2008 / 105 /EC allows member states to designate <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> when the pollutant concentrations exceed the EQS values at effluent discharges. But <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> should not affect the compliance {{of the rest of the}} water body with EQS standards. Therefore, <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> design should meet some defined criteria. Moreover for ensuring that design criteria are met and for facilitating the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> application, member states are provided with a <b>Mixing</b> <b>Zone</b> Guideline. This project applies the <b>Mixing</b> <b>Zone</b> Guidelines at the Rönnskär Smelter located in the Northern Sweden with effluent discharges to the Baltic Sea. A second assessment of <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> is done in a mine area with discharge to Brubäcken stream. A “Tiered Approach” used in the guidelines is followed in assessment of <b>mixing</b> <b>zones.</b> The priority substances considered in the effluents are Hg, Cd, Ni and Pb. In the Rönnskär Smelter at Tier 2 determination of <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> length is done by the Discharge Test provided with <b>Mixing</b> <b>Zone</b> Guideline. CORMIX model is used for prediction of mixing in Tier 3. In the mine area the concentration of metals at the measured points showed no exceedence of EQSs, therefore there was no need for the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> design. In Rönnskär, for effluents where more than one priority substance exceeded the EQS values, the <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> determination is done separately for each metal. <b>Mixing</b> <b>zone</b> AA-EQS criteria were met for each substance within a predefine distance of 500 m from each of the discharge points. However, much more investigation is needed related to the use of total and dissolved metals concentrations, consideration of background concentration and other input data which are site specific. Further research is also needed for <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> assessment where the effluent discharges contain multiple priority substances. We also concluded that climate effects, seasonal changes and other factors related to the receiving water characteristics need further investigation for a proper implementation of <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> for protection of aquatic and human life in Sweden...|$|R

The impact of the aerator tube configuration and <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> length on the size of bubbles inside the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> and the spray droplet characteristics at different gas-to-liquid flow rates ratios were studied.

A frequently proposed solution to protect the location privacy of mobile nodes suggests changing pseudonyms in regions called <b>mix</b> <b>zones.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel metric based on the mobility profiles of mobile nodes in order to evaluate the mixing effectiveness of possible <b>mix</b> <b>zone</b> locations.

Within the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> a zone of enhanced turbidity (maximum turbidity zone) was observed comparable to studies in other rivers. Flocculation of particles due to changes in salinity and hydrography cause this maximum turbidity zone, and resuspension additionally enhances the turbidity in the near-bottom layers. Organic matter behaves conservatively in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> in terms of its percentage of suspended matter. It, however, undergoes degradation as revealed by amino acid data. Inorganic, redox- and salinity-sensitive, proxies (Mn, Fe) behave non-conservatively. Dissolved iron is removed at low salinities (< 2) due to precipitation of iron-oxyhydroxides and adsorption of manganese on suspended particles, enhancing the Mn/Al ratio of the suspended matter in the same zone. At higher salinities within the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> Fe/Al and Mn/Al ratios of the suspended particles are depleted due to resuspension of sediment with lower Fe/Al and Mn/Al ratios. Dissolved manganese concentrations are significantly higher in the near-bottom layers of the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> due to release from the anoxic sediment.

A three-dimensional model for mixing process was simulated. The effected parameters are rotation speed and impeller diameter. Continuity, momentum, and turbulent equations were solved by ANSYS package software 5. 4 code with FLOTRAN/CFD based on Finite Element method. In the experimental work, two visualization methods are used in this work, the first method is the acid-base reaction visualization method and the second is the particle distribution visualization method.

40|$|Glaciological {{processes}} at grounding lines, which divide {{floating ice}} shelves from grounded ice sheets, may strongly influence the dynamics {{and evolution of}} inland ice. Therefore, understanding the oceanic forcing on ice shelves in this region is of importance to predictions of cryospheric change and sea level rise. As the ocean cavity shallows toward the grounding line, tidal mixing becomes proportionately more important until a tidal front forms, beyond which the water properties are vertically homogenized. The extent of this <b>mixed</b> <b>zone</b> is relevant to several questions because a fully mixed region behaves differently to the stratified ocean offshore. In this study a highly simplified one-dimensional model is {{used to examine the}} size, properties, and sensitivities of the <b>mixed</b> <b>zone.</b> The model suggests that most grounding line <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> are small, implying that the usual models representing a stratified ocean are generally valid if tidal mixing is also taken into account. Modeled <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> can be significant in near-freezing regions with vigorous tides and a shallowly sloping cavity, but even these areas are smaller than previously proposed. It therefore seems that upwelling of warm water, rather than <b>mixing</b> in tidal <b>zones,</b> generally maintains ice shelf basal melting near grounding lines. Where <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> are present, the model suggests that they insulate the grounding line from offshore ocean waters. The model illustrates the origin of Ice Shelf Water plumes and confirms that unlike elsewhere in the cavity, melting in the <b>mixed</b> <b>zone</b> increases linearly in response to ocean warming...|$|R

The instabilities that develop at the interface of the two liquids close to the central nozzle exit are classified in three categories based on their spatial characteristics as dilatational, Kelvin Helmholtz and short wave instabilities.

Characteristics of the ternary Al 2 O 3 –Cr 2 O 3 –Y 2 O 3 relevant for the <b>mixed</b> <b>zone</b> include (i) a continuous solid solution series between the orthorhombic phases YAlO 3 (YAP) and YCrO 3, (ii) a limited Cr vs. Al substitution (16 mol%) in Cr–YAG Y 3 (Al 1 −x Cr x) 5 O 12 and (iii) extended phase fields involving Cr-YAG and sesquioxide phases which represent typical late-stage <b>mixed</b> <b>zones</b> in the excess-zirconia model scenario.

40|$|In {{coastal zones}} with saline {{groundwater}}, fresh groundwater lenses may form due to infiltration of rain water. The thickness {{of both the}} lens and the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> determines fresh water availability for plant growth. Due to recharge variation, {{the thickness of the}} lens and the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> are not constant, which may adversely affect agricultural and natural vegetation if saline water reaches the root zone during the growing season. In this paper, we study the response of thin lenses and their <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> to variation of recharge. The recharge is varied using sinusoids with a range of amplitudes and frequencies. We vary lens characteristics by varying the Rayleigh number and Mass flux ratio of saline and fresh water, as these dominantly influence the thickness of thin lenses and their <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> Numerical results show a linear relation between the normalised lens volume and the main lens and recharge characteristics, enabling an empirical approximation of the variation of lens thickness. Increase of the recharge amplitude causes increase and the increase of recharge frequency causes a decrease in the variation of lens thickness. The average lens thickness is not significantly influenced by these variations in recharge, contrary to the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> thickness. The <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> thickness is compared to that of a Fickian mixing regime. A simple relation between the travelled distance of the centre of the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> position due to variations in recharge and the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> thickness is shown to be valid for both a sinusoidal recharge variation and actual records of daily recharge data. Starting from a step response function, convolution can be used to determine the effect of variable recharge in time. For a sinusoidal curve, we can determine delay of lens movement compared to the recharge curve as well as the lens amplitude, derived from the convolution integral. Together the proposed equations provide us with a first order approximation of lens characteristics using basic lens and recharge parameters without the use of numerical models.

40|$|The <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> {{developed}} at freshwater-seawater interface {{is one of}} the most important features in complex coastal hydrogeologic systems, which controls subsurface flow and reactive transport dynamics. Freshwater-seawater mixing-zone development is influenced by many physical and chemical processes, such as characteristics of geologic formation, hydrodynamic fluctuations of groundwater and seawater levels, fluid-rock interactions, and others. Wide <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> have been found in many coastal aquifers all over the world. However, the mechanisms responsible for wide <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> are not well understood. In this thesis, two hypotheses were proposed to explain wide <b>mixing</b> <b>zones</b> in coastal aquifers: (1) kinetic mass transfer coupled with transient conditions, which create the movement of the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> may widen <b>mixing</b> zones; and (2) aquifer stratification may widen the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> The hypotheses were tested by both multiscale numerical simulations and laboratory experiments. Numerical simulations were based on a variable-density groundwater model by varying mass transfer parameters, including immobile porosity, mobile porosity, and mass transfer coefficient, and the hydraulic conductivity contrast between aquifer layers. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a quasi-two-dimensional tank, where real beach sands were installed and foodstuff dyes were used to visualize the development of freshwater-seawater <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> Major conclusions included (1) the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> can be significantly widened when the mass transfer timescale and the period of transient boundary is comparable due to the nonequilibrium mass transfer effects; and (2) a thick <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> occurs in low-permeability layer when it overlays upon a fast flow layer. These results not only improve the understanding of the dynamics of mixing-zone development and its associated geochemical processes in coastal aquifers, but also identify hydrogeologic conditions for the model of sharp-interface approximation to be valid. In addition to better understanding the mechanisms and dynamics of <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> this thesis also investigates cost-effective management of coastal groundwater resources. To protect and conserve limited water recourses in coastal regions, interest in aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) has been growing in recent years. ASR is a promising strategy for water resources management and has been widely used in many contaminated and saline aquifers. However, its performance may be significantly constrained by mass transfer effects due to the mobilization of solutes initially residing in immobile domains. Better understanding of kinetic mass transfer effects on ASR is needed in order to aid the decision-making process. A numerical model is developed to simulate ASR performance by combining the convergent and divergent dispersion models with a first-order mass transfer model. By analyzing the concentration history at the pumping well, we obtain simple and effective relationships for investigating ASR efficiency under various mass transfer parameters, including capacity ratio and mass transfer timescales, and operational parameters. Based on such relationships, one can conveniently determine whether a site with mass transfer limitations is appropriate or not for ASR and how many ASR cycles are required for achieving a positive recovery efficiency (RE).

The chemical reaction in <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> between the fresh mixture in the jet and the hot gas in the recirculation zone supplies heat for the stabilization of a flame in the flow. The influence of the flow parameters on the stability was determined by changing the burner size and geometry.

First, for large ratios, the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> was covered by the flow of fresh mixture along the complete length of the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> This type of flow with a free <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> shows a great deal of similarity with the flow of the bluff body flameholder.

The <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> had more fine sediments, organic matter and calcium carbonate content due by the lower hydrodynamic conditions. Starting from that zone and moving toward the marine zone, an increase in temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH of bottom water occurred. The results found in the present study showed that the greatest P-f.a. concentrations were verified in the estuarine <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> and were associated with finer grain size, greater organic matter content and a decrease in hydrodynamic conditions. These factors also influenced the highest concentrations of P-Fe in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> in addition to bottom water oxygenation. P-Me showed no regular distribution along the estuary. P-Ca also had greater concentrations in the mixing zone; however, their concentrations were higher than the first two fractions due to the alkalinity of the bottom water in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> This characteristic impeded the redissolution of phosphorus immobilized by the high carbonate availability in this zone. P-res showed no regular distribution along the estuary. This fraction showed peak concentrations only at lower hydrodynamic points, which indicates that these conditions can influence the redistribution of this fraction. Pinorg-total had higher concentrations in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone.</b> This work suggests that the limit between the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> and the river zone coincides with the SF position. In the Guapimirim estuary, this limit is located at station 9, approximately 3.5  km upstream of the mouth, on average.|$|R

An attempt is made to quantify the RMI-induced air/sulphurhexafluoride (SF 6) mixing by measuring turbulence levels inside the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> at a given stage of its development and by extracting {{the growth rate of}} the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> from the Schlieren images...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the two-dimensional flow of heated water from a channel into a deep reservoir filled with cold water was made. Only flows producing a dilution of warm water by entrainment of cold water were investigated. These flows consisted of a <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> near the outlet followed downstream by a stratified flow. The outlet flow characteristics, the type of downstream control, and the geometry of the transition were identified as the essential controlling parameters for the entrainment. The amount of vertical entrainment in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> at the outlet was calculated and measured. The flow in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> where the entrainment is produced {{was found to be}} a combination of a buoyant half jet with an inverted internal hydraulic jump. The simultaneous presence of both inertial and buoyant forces was responsible for this occurrence. Theoretical and experimental results show that substantial dilution occurred in the outlet <b>mixing</b> <b>zone,</b> but actual rates of entrainment were quite sensitive to changes in flow conditions.

40|$|Abstract—Privacy {{protection}} is of critical concern to Location-Based Service (LBS) users in mobile networks. Long-term pseudonyms, although {{appear to be}} anonymous, in fact em-power third-party service providers to continuously track users’ movements. Researchers have proposed the <b>mix</b> <b>zone</b> model to allow pseudonym changes in protected areas. In this paper, we investigate {{a new form of}} privacy attack to the LBS system that an adversary reveals a user’s true identity and complete moving tra-jectory with the aid of side information. We propose a new metric to quantify the system’s resilience to such attacks, and suggest using multiple <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> to tackle this problem. A mathematical model is presented that treats the deployment of multiple <b>mix</b> <b>zones</b> as a cost constrained optimization problem. Furthermore, the influence of traffic density is also taken into account to enhance the protection effectiveness. The placement optimization problem is NP-hard. We therefore design two heuristic algorithms as practical and effective means to strategically select <b>mix</b> <b>zone</b> locations, and consequently reduce the privacy risks of mobile users trajectories. The effectiveness of our proposed solutions is demonstrated through extensive simulations on real-world mobile user data traces. I...|$|R

Distributions of dissolved and particulate forms of these elements indicate that the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> acts as a pH-based geochemical barrier, at which almost all dissolved iron and smaller amounts of other metals are precipitated. When chemogenic particulate matter formed in the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> enters the open ocean, it can sorb trace elements from sea water...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on vertical mixing between freshwater and seawater in controlled column experiments. The aim was to quantify the variation in {{the thickness of the}} <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> caused by water table fluctuations in aeolian dune sandy sediments. A series of column experiments were setup: first a study on in-well mixing was completed to understand the suitability of down-hole logging in existing piezometers versus multi level sampling; then, an unsaturated–saturated column experiment with sandy aeolian dune sediments of the target aquifer was performed to characterize the <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> thickness; finally the third column experiment was conducted by imposing a groundwater fluctuation of 0. 1 m to quantify the increase of the freshwater–saltwater <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> due to vertical water table oscillations. The freshwater–saltwater <b>mixing</b> <b>zone</b> increase was very limited and did not exceed 0. 1 m. All experiments were modeled by means of the SEAWAT numerical code, and calibrated against saltwater concentrations. The model fit was good for all experiments, providing insights into the vertical dispersivity of sandy aeolian dune sediments and also into the reliability and precision of the freshwater–saltwater interface monitoring methods. The down-hole logging technique, in fact, was demonstrated to be inefficient when horizontal flow velocity is negligible; in this case only multi-level sampling techniques provided reliable results...|$|R
