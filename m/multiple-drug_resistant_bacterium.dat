30|$|Discussion While <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{nosocomial}} infections dramatically increase in France and Europa, trends in bloodstream 3 GCRE, MRSA, Candida infections and Clostridium difficile colitis rates were stable in our ICU 2 years after {{introduction of a}} new antibiotic policy for third-generation cephalosporins. And our results seem different to some previous studies because only boodstream infections were considered in order to affirm <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> infections. But this method induced lower HA infections rates. Our results have to be analyzed after adjustment with <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> carriage at admission in ICU between the two periods. About 20 % of patients carriers of <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> will be infected by the same bacteria during hospitalization indeed. A Poisson regression model (adjusted for overdispersion) will be used with log occupied bed-days as an offset. Linear trend terms {{were used to assess}} temporal changes. The main hypothesis was to see whether the trend in HA infections rates following antibiotic policy change was the same as the trend before the intervention. Poisson regression will be again used to assess which of the antibiotics was the better predictor of HA bloodstream 3 GCRE, MRSA, Candida infections and Clostridium difficile colitis cases.|$|R

Otherwise, antibiotics use have different consequences on bowel bacteria selection pressure.

Although most animal {{experiments}} focus on therapeutic efficacy, the blood clearance kinetics of phages {{have not been}} well described. For further development of an efficient therapeutic strategy, information on phage blood kinetics is important. In this study, time-course concentration changes in peripheral blood of healthy and neutropenic mice were measured using four therapeutic phages (φMR 11, KPP 10, φEF 24 C, and KEP 10).

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} the susceptibility profile of bacterial isolates from hand dug wells and borehole waters within the Amai Kingdom, in Ukwuani Local Government Area of Delta State. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Novena University, between April 2016 and November 2016. Methodology: A total of 30 boreholes and 30 well water samples were randomly sourced using sterile tightly locked plastic containers and {{transported to the}} laboratory within 2 hours. The water samples were cultured using spread plate method and the pure bacterial isolates tested for susceptibility to some commercial antibiotic discs using the Kirby-Bauer method. Results: Bacteria were isolated respectively from 50 % and 100 % of the borehole and well water samples collected. A total of 45 bacterial isolates, distributed among the genera Staphylococcus (6. 7 %), Bacillus (10. 0 %), Escherichia (16. 7 %), Pseudomonas (11. 7 %) Enterobacter (8. 3 %), Proteus (10. 0 %), and Klebsiella (11. 7 %), was encountered. Majority of the isolates were sensitive to Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Gentamicin, Ofloxacin, and resistant to Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole and Tetracycline. Bacillus sp (56 %) was more resistant (p=. 05) than S. aureus (33 %), while the most <b>resistant</b> Gram-negative <b>bacteria</b> was Pseudomonas sp. (54 %), followed by both E. coli (44 %) and Klebsiella sp (44 %), and both Proteus sp., (33 %) and Enterobacter sp. (33 %). Drug resistance was observed {{in at least three}} of the tested antibiotic disks. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that the drinking water sources in the Amai Kingdom are bacteriologically poor, with <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and thus of public health importance. Public education on dangers associated with indiscriminate dumping of waste and drug abuse is strongly recommended...|$|R

Most current antimalarial combinations are binary but {{it is likely that}} new triple drug combinations will be required in the future. A review of previous triple combinations of antimalarial drugs was done to focus attention on past problems and possible future combinations. The advantages of such triple drug combinations include greater efficacy against <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> strains, synergistic action between the different medications and simplification of the regimen so that it could be administered under direct observation and possibly as single-dose therapy. The disadvantages of poly-pharmacy include increased cost of medication, difficulty preparing robust regulatory packages and problems constructing combined formulations due to drug-drug interactions. Given the arrival of artemisinin tolerance/resistance in Southeast Asia, it is likely that new drugs introduced for malaria treatment will be in triple drug combinations...|$|R
50|$|Most {{isolated}} P. penneri strains are <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant,</b> with 12 {{being the}} highest drug-resistance number reported. P. penneri has a distinguishing susceptibility profile, {{based on the}} production of the chromosomally induced β-lactamase HugA. HugA determines resistance to aminopenicillins and first- and second-generation cephalosporins,including cefuroxime. However, HugA does not affect cephamycins or carbapenems and is inhibited by clavulanic acid. Similar to other Proteus species, P. penneri is resistant to tetracyclines and nitrofurantoin.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{treatment}} for latent <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> tuberculosis infection remains unclear. In anticipation of future clinical trials, we modeled the expected performance of six potential regimens {{for treatment of}} latent <b>multiple-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> tuberculosis. A computerized Markov model to analyze {{the total cost of}} {{treatment for}} six different regimens: Pyrazinamide/ethambutol, moxifloxacin monotherapy, moxifloxacin/pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin/ethambutol, moxifloxacin/ethionamide, and moxifloxacin/PA- 824. Efficacy estimates were extrapolated from mouse models and examined over a wide range of assumptions. In the base-case, moxifloxacin monotherapy was the lowest cost strategy, but moxifloxacin/ethambutol was cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 21, 252 per quality-adjusted life-year. Both pyrazinamide-containing regimens were dominated due to their toxicity. A hypothetical regimen of low toxicity and even modest efficacy was cost-effective compared to "no treatment. "In our model, moxifloxacin/ethambutol was the preferred treatment strategy under a wide range of assumptions; pyrazinamide-containing regimens fared poorly because of high rates of toxicity. Although more data are needed on efficacy of treatments for latent MDR-TB infection, data on toxicity and treatment discontinuation, which are easier to obtain, could have a substantial impact on public health practice...|$|R

Currently, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Systems, a collaborative effort of the Centers for Disease Control, the US Department of Agriculture, and the US Food and Drug Administration, does not monitor antimicrobial resistance in surface waters. Given the serious nature of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings, and the likelihood that antibiotic <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> can be transmitted to humans from large environmental reservoirs via drinking water, explanations for the distribution of antibiotic <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> and tools for studying this distribution must be found. Here we focus on mathematical modeling of cultivable bacteria in a river, which will be used to study the distribution of antibiotic <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the environment.

Amount of total mercury in the samples was determined using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometery.

Isolation of mercury <b>resistant</b> <b>bacteria</b> was performed using the primary enrichment culture method and directly plating on agar containing 10 mg L - 1 HgCl 2 Hg (II). Total viable counts ranged from 6. 5 X 10 6 to 2. 2 X 10 7 cfu g - 1 in different stations.
