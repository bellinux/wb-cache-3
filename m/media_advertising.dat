40|$|The Out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> are {{far more}} {{expansive}} {{than they used to}} be, and the shape and format of these media globally, as well as in South Africa, have changed considerably over the past few decades. Until rather recently, the out-ofhome <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> landscape consisted primarily of outdoor advertising or billboards; but these days, this has expanded to include other platforms, such as transit <b>advertising</b> <b>media,</b> street and retail furniture <b>advertising</b> <b>media,</b> and a wide variety of alternative out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> types. This proliferation of out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media,</b> the scant research on out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> planning and the number of obstacles in the South African advertising- and media industry have emphasised the need for a clear understanding of the changing nature of out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> and the planning and integration thereof. No previous study has addressed the integration of different out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> platforms as part of an integrated marketing communication plan. Very little has been published on how out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> planning across platforms should actually be done, even more so in a developing country such as South Africa. It was therefore necessary to investigate this further, in order to propose a framework for guiding the planning and integration of out-of-home advertising media; and one that can be applied in the South African environment. The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore how experienced out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> specialists plan and integrate different out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> platforms, as part of an overall integrated marketing communication plan. This, together with an extensive investigation into the relevant literature, was then used to develop a framework for the planning and integration of out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> in South Africa. Purposive sampling was used to select ten out-of-home media specialists from within prominent media-only agencies, and out-of-home advertising media-specialist agencies in South Africa. The specialists selected were responsible for planning out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> strategies of several of the largest advertisers in South Africa. These advertisers included Coca Cola, Unilever, Brandhouse, Cadbury, Pantene, Pfizer, Vodacom, Cell C, MTN, Spar, Shoprite, KFC, ABSA, Standard Bank Nedbank, Visa, Sony, Virgin Active, Adidas, Green Cross, Kulula airlines, NuMetro and Eskom. In-depth interviews with these specialists were conducted, using a basic guiding framework or interview guide. Qualitative thematic analysis was applied to the transcribed interviews using the software program, ATLAS. ti. The qualitative findings revealed nine themes, related to three theoretical constructs, namely: the alignment of the out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> campaign with the overall integrated marketing communication plan; the planning of out-of-home advertising media; and the evaluation and research of out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> It was recommended that specialists who understand the requirements of coordination and integration on several levels should do the planning of out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media.</b> These are firstly, the alignment between the out-of-home advertising campaign and the overall integrated marketing communication plan objectives; secondly, the co-ordination between the message strategy and an out-ofhome <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> plan; and thirdly, the integration between different platforms and formats used in the out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> mix. To optimally achieve integration on all these different levels required vertical integration and communication between all the role-players involved: the advertisers, the <b>advertising</b> agency, the <b>media</b> agency and the out-of-home media specialists. Effective integrated out-of-home <b>advertising</b> <b>media</b> campaigns can no longer be treated as mere add-ons; they should be part of the planning right from the start.

25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to <b>media</b> <b>advertising,</b> rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E
