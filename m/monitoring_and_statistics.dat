40|$|Fifteen papers, plus {{a summary}} and {{conclusion}} by the editors, examine {{the national and}} international economic concerns of third world countries and the recent work of UNICEF to enlighten others on the unnecessary suffering of children through the neglect of their needs {{in the development of}} economic policy. Part 1 focuses on recession, adjustment, and child welfare in the 1980 s, and discusses the economic decline and human welfare in the early 1980 s; the effects of adjustment policies between 1980 and 1985 on child welfare; the impact on government expenditure; the potentials and limitations of adjustment at the household level; and country experience with adjustment. Part 2 examines an alternative, growth-oriented approach, focusing on an overview of the approach; alternative macropolicies, meso policies, and vulnerable groups; restructuring, targeting, and efficiency in social policymaking; policies toward small farmers; supporting productive employment among vulnerable groups; health policy and program options; education; nutrition interventions; <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>statistics</b> for adjustment; and the international system and protection of the vulnerable.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the issues of}} systematization, modeling and presentation of regional biological resources data. The problem of providing regional state authorities with actual biological resources data and an analysis tool has been stated. The necessity of complex analysis of heterogeneous biological resources data {{in connection with the}} landscape factors has been articulated. The system of biological resources’ cartographic models (BRCM) is proposed as tools for the regional authorities to develop the BRCM for practical appliances. The goal and the target audience of the system are named. The principles of cartographic visualization of information in the BRCM are formulated. The main sources of biological resources data are listed. These sources include state cadastres, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>statistics.</b> The scales for regional and topical biological resources’ cartographic models are stated. These scales comprise two scale groups for depicting the region itself and its units of internal administrative division. The specifics of cartographic modeling and visualization of relief according to legal requirements to public cartographic data are described. Various options of presentation of biological resources’ cartographic models, such as digital maps, 3 Dmodels and cartographic animation are described. Examples of maps and cartographic 3 D-models of Novosibirsk Region forests are shown. The conclusion about practical challenges solved with BRCM has been made...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} {{build on the}} {{framework}} used in the Bank of Canada's Financial System Review to assess the evolution of household indebtedness and financial vulnerabilities in response to changing economic conditions. To achieve this, they first compare two microdata sets generated by Ipsos Reid's Canadian Financial <b>Monitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistics</b> Canada's Survey of Financial Security. They find that the surveys are broadly comparable, despite methodological differences. This enables them to use the combined information content for {{the identification of the}} threshold value of the debt-service ratio (DSR). The article then presents an innovative framework that uses household-level microdata to simulate changes in the distribution of the DSR under various stress scenarios. The authors show how this framework can be used by analyzing the effects of two different scenarios on the distribution of the debt-service ratio and the impact on vulnerable households. This tool will enable researchers to refine their analyses of current risks to the financial health of Canadian households. The article concludes with comments on future directions for refining the Bank's analyses of household sector risk. ...|$|R

Their major advantage is the fact that they provide a common ground to networking equipment vendors and network operators to examine their equipment and/or network topology behavior under various circumstance. The work performed in the particular thesis project is an integral part of a larger Keletron objective, relating to the development of a test tool/terminal equipment product line based on the Compact PCI system interface, and targeted for UMTS (3 G) implementations. Specifically, the goal of the thesis project was the implementation of the interfacing and measuring system for the Gi interface, which provides the interconnection between the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and the external packet data network. For this purpose two systems were implemented, one related to traffic generation and one to traffic <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>statistics</b> gathering. Each system was realized in a Virtex-II Field Programmable Gate Array device that includes the test tool. Parameterized architectures were designed and implemented for both the traffic generation and the traffic monitoring modules, using the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). The final instances of the architectures were decided based on the test tool throughput requirements and went through the simulation, synthesis and implementation process in order to verify their functionality and performance...|$|E
40|$|The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is {{systematically}} charting {{the optical}} transient and variable sky. A primary science driver of PTF {{is building a}} complete inventory of transients in the local universe (distance less than 200 Mpc). Here, we report the discovery of PTF 10 fqs, a transient in the luminosity "gap" between novae and supernovae. Located on a spiral arm of Messier 99, PTF 10 fqs has a peak luminosity of Mr = - 12. 3, red color (g - r = 1. 0), and is slowly evolving (decayed by 1 mag in 68 days). It has a spectrum dominated by intermediate-width Hα (930 kms- 1) and narrow calcium emission lines. The explosion signature (the light curve and spectra) is overall {{similar to that of}} M 85 OT 2006 - 1, SN 2008 S, and NGC 300 OT. The origin of these events is shrouded in mystery and controversy (and in some cases, in dust). PTF 10 fqs shows some evidence of a broad feature (around 8600) that may suggest very large velocities (10, 000 kms- 1) in this explosion. Ongoing surveys can be expected to find a few such events per year. Sensitive spectroscopy, infrared <b>monitoring,</b> <b>and</b> <b>statistics</b> (e. g., disk versus bulge) will eventually make it possible for astronomers to unravel the nature of these mysterious explosions. © 2011.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{present the results}} of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>statistics</b> of a grid {{connected}} photovoltaic (PV) system located {{on the roof of the}} building occupied by the “Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnolog´ıa del Distrito Federal” (ICyTDF), at the historical center of Mexico-City (DF). The on-grid connected photovoltaic system has 6150 Watts peak (Wp). This system ensures a daily mean reduction of 30 kW. h in the consumption of electric energy at the ICyTDF facilities; which results in a significant saving of fossil fuels and avoiding the emission of greenhouse gases. This system can generate an annual average of 10. 8 MW. h of electrical energy, equivalent to burning 0. 87 tonnes of oil which would lead to the emission of approximately 2. 1 tonne/year of CO 2 into the atmosphere. The ecological impact of the photovoltaic system installed in the ICyTDF is equivalent to a forest area with more than 700 adult trees (7 hectares of forest). We also report the analysis of the PV-performance in real time of several commercial solar modules, manufactured with different materials and technologies, these results may give an indication of the comparative performance of the technologies under the environmental conditions of M´exico City. Four different solar modules made of monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon and CdS/CdTe technologies were tested. The outcome of this study is that a better performance was noted for modules made of amorphous silicon technology under temperature variations typical of Mexico City’s environmental conditions...|$|E
