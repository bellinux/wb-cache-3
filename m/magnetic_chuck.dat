5000|$|The {{surface grinder}} is {{composed}} of an abrasive wheel, a workholding device known as a chuck, and a reciprocating or rotary table. The chuck holds the material in place while it is being worked on. It can do this one of two ways: ferromagnetic pieces are {{held in place by}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck,</b> while non-ferromagnetic and nonmetallic pieces are held in place by vacuum or mechanical means. A machine vise (made from ferromagnetic steel or cast iron) placed on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> can be used to hold non-ferromagnetic workpieces if only a <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> is available.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{workpiece}} material, {{the work is}} generally held {{by the use of}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck.</b> This may be either an electromagnetic chuck, or a manually operated, permanent magnet type chuck; both types are shown in the first image.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>chucks,</b> such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>chucks</b> and vacuum chucks, {{are of a}} {{different}} sort from the radially symmetrical mechanical clamps mentioned above. Instead, they may be surfaces (typically flat) against which workpieces or tools are firmly held by magnetic or vacuum force.|$|R

Easily determine whether a given operation can be performed in a specific magnetic table requires prior knowledge of the limits of the equipment and of the forces generated in the cutting process. This article determines necessary tools to feed a system of evaluation of applicability based on the relationship between stresses and reactions of the magnetic plate.

40|$|Fundamental {{to many of}} NASA's in-space {{transportation}} missions is {{the capture}} and handling of various objects and vehicles in various orbits for servicing, debris disposal, sample retrieval, and assembly {{without the benefit of}} sufficient grapple fixtures and docking ports. To perform similar material handling tasks on Earth, pincher grippers, suction grippers, or <b>magnetic</b> <b>chucks</b> are used, but are unable to reliably grip aluminum and composite spacecraft, insulation, radiators, solar arrays, or extra-terrestrial objects in the vacuum of outer space without dedicated handles in the right places. The electronic Flexible Electrostatic Technologies for space Capture and Handling (FETCH) will enable reliable and compliant gripping (soft dock) of practically any object in various orbits or surfaces without dedicated mechanical features, very low impact capture, and built-in proximity sensing without any conventional actuators. Originally developed to handle semiconductor and glass wafers during vacuum chamber processing without contamination, the normal rigid wafer handling chucks are replaced with thin metal foil segments laminated in flexible insulation driven by commercial off-the-shelf solid state, high-voltage power supplies. Preliminary testing in NASA Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Flat Floor Robotics Lab demonstrated compliant alignment and gripping with a full-sized, 150 -lb microsat mockup and translation before a clean release with a flip of a switch. The flexible electrostatic gripper pads can be adapted to various space applications with different sizes, shapes, and foil electrode layouts even with openings through the gripper pads for addition of guidance sensors or injection of permanent adhesives. With gripping forces estimated between 0. 5 and 2. 5 lb/in 2 or 70 - 300 lb/ft 2 of surface contact, the FETCH can turn on and off rapidly and repeatedly to enable sample handling, soft docking, in-space assembly, precision relocation, and surface translation for accurate anchoring...|$|R
50|$|Used {{for holding}} {{ferromagnetic}} workpieces, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> {{consists of an}} accurately centred permanent magnet face. Electromagnets or permanent magnets are brought into contact with fixed ferrous plates, or pole pieces, contained within a housing. These pole pieces are usually flush with the housing surface. The part (workpiece) to be held forms {{the closing of the}} magnetic loop or path, onto those fixed plates, providing a secure anchor for the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Grinding is {{commonly}} used on cast iron and various types of steel. These materials lend themselves to grinding {{because they can be}} held by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> commonly used on grinding machines, and they do not melt into the wheel, clogging it and preventing it from cutting. Materials that are less commonly ground are Aluminum, stainless steel, brass & plastics. These all tend to clog the cutting wheel more than steel & cast iron, but with special techniques it is possible to grind them.|$|E
5000|$|Surface grinder, {{which has}} a head that is lowered to a workpiece, which is moved back and forth under the {{grinding}} wheel on a table that typically has a controllable permanent magnet (<b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck)</b> for use with magnetic stock (especially ferrous stock) but can have a vacuum chuck or other fixturing means. The most common surface grinders have a grinding wheel rotating on a horizontal axis cutting around the circumference of the grinding wheel. Rotary surface grinders, commonly known as [...] "Blanchard" [...] style grinders, have a grinding head which rotates the grinding wheel on a vertical axis cutting on the end face of the grinding wheel, while a table rotates the workpiece {{in the opposite direction}} underneath. This type of machine removes large amounts of material and grinds flat surfaces with noted spiral grind marks. It {{can also be used to}} make and sharpen metal stamping die sets, flat shear blades, fixture bases or any flat and parallel surfaces. Surface grinders can be manually operated or have CNC controls.|$|E
25|$|Netherland {{opens on}} protagonist Hans van den Broek, a Dutch {{financial}} analyst living in London with his English wife Rachel, but quickly flashes {{back to the}} years Hans spent in New York City before and {{in the immediate aftermath}} of 9/11. At the beginning of the novel, Hans is preparing to return to Manhattan for the funeral of estranged friend Chuck Ramkissoon, who becomes the central figure of the novel. Chuck, a Trinidadian immigrant, guides Hans into and through the world of The Staten Island Cricket Club, most of whose members are also of West Indian or South Asian descent. Chuck is a charismatic idealist, running multiple (occasionally illegitimate) businesses, and making big, optimistic plans for the future. While Hans is swept along by <b>Chuckâ€™s</b> <b>magnetic</b> ardor for the American dream, Rachel moves back to London under the pretense of safety for their young son and ideological indignation over the American fixation on economic oppression. Though Rachel is a markedly less likeable character than Chuck, Hans eventually, inevitably follows her back to London. He loses touch with his Trinidadian friend who is discovered, years later, simply a body, handcuffed and disposed of in the Gowanus Canal.|$|R

40|$|Precise {{machining}} {{of bearing}} rings {{is integral to}} finished bearing assembly quality. The output accuracy of center-based machining systems such as lathes or <b>magnetic</b> <b>chuck</b> grinders relates directly {{to the accuracy of}} part centering before machining. Traditional tooling and methods for centering on such machines are subject to wear, dimensional inaccuracy, setup time (hard tooling) and human error (manual centering). A flexible system for initial part centering is developed based on a single measurement system and actuator, whereby the part is placed by hand onto the machine table, rotated and measured to identify center of geometry offset from center of rotation, then moved by a series of controlled impacts or pushes to align the centers. The prototype centering system is developed as a demonstration platform for research in a number of mechanical engineering areas, particularly: Characterization of optimal state estimators through analysis of accuracy and computational efficiency; Distributed communication and control, efficient transfer of information in a real-time environment, and information sharing between processes; Modeling of sliding dynamics and the interaction of friction with compliant body dynamic models; Motion path planning through both deterministic geometric transforms and through frequency domain command manipulation. A vision is created for future work not only in the described areas, but also in the areas of advanced controller design incorporating multiple variables, derived machine diagnostic information, and application of the distributed communication architecture to information flow throughout the manufacturing organization. The guiding motivation for this research is reduction of manufacturing processing costs in the face of global competition. The technologies researched, developments made, and directions prescribed for future research aid in enabling this goal. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Thomas R.
