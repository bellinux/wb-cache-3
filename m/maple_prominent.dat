5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the <b>maple</b> <b>prominent</b> (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bridge is}} a {{precisely}} cut piece of <b>maple,</b> preferably with <b>prominent</b> medullary rays, showing a flecked figure. The bridge forms the lower anchor {{point of the}} vibrating length of the strings, and transmits the vibration of the strings {{to the body of}} the instrument. Its top curve holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard, permitting each to be played separately by the bow. The mass distribution and flex of the bridge, acting as a mechanical acoustic filter, have a prominent effect on the sound.|$|R

5000|$|The Toronto Blue Jays {{unveiled}} new uniforms on November 18, {{returning to}} a variation of their vintage logo used from 1977 through 1996. The new logo {{is similar to the}} original used from 1977-96, with a few exceptions: a more <b>prominent</b> <b>maple</b> leaf, a sleeker-looking blue jay, serifed modern lettering on the team name, and a split-line blue circle enclosing the logo. The new uniforms are similarly based on the set used from 1989-96; a white home uniform with [...] "Blue Jays", a grey road uniform with [...] "Toronto", and a blue alternate uniform with [...] "Blue Jays". The team/city name is arched above the secondary logo of the blue jay with the maple leaf, sans the baseball, situated on the left side. The secondary logo is also placed in the blue cap. The uniforms use the breathable double-knit polyester fabric, claiming the previously lighter Climate Base fabric became too heavy, once players began to sweat.|$|R
