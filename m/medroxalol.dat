50|$|<b>Medroxalol</b> is a {{vasodilator}} {{beta blocker}} also {{classified as a}} mixed receptor blocker as it blocks both alpha and beta receptors.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} step, {{salicylamide}} (1) {{is the subject}} of a Friedel-Crafts acetylation and then the aromatic methylketone is halogenated. in the usual manner. The bromide in 2 is then displaced by the nitrogen in N-benzyl-1-(3',4'-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3-butylamine (3), which is itself prepared by reductive amination on the corresponding ketone. The product of the last step (4) is catalytically hydrogenated. This serves the dual purpose both of reducing the ketone and removing the benzyl protecting group affording the product <b>medroxalol</b> (5). Note that a benzyl protecting group is not necessarily used.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>medroxalol</b> {{are described}} in normal subjects and {{compared with those of}} labetalol. Both drugs were administered in doses of 400 mg orally and 1 mg/kg intravenously. The data for both drugs was most appropriately described by a two compartment model. For oral <b>medroxalol</b> the clinical pharmacokinetic parameters were a terminal elimination half-life (t 1 / 2,Z) of 15. 6 h, a peak level of 450 ng/ml and a time to peak of 2 - 3 h. Following intravenous <b>medroxalol</b> the bioavailability was calculated as 64 %, the plasma clearance was 948 ml/min and the t 1 / 2,Z was 7. 3 h. The t 1 / 2,Z following intravenous administration was significantly shorter than that following oral administration. The significant differences between <b>medroxalol</b> and labetalol were in time to peak, respectively 2. 3 and 1. 1 h; oral t 1 / 2,Z, 15. 6 and 5. 5 h; clearance 948 and 1560 ml/min; and bioavailability, 64 and 20 %. Despite the pharmacokinetic differences a similar plasma concentration-hypotensive effect relationship was described for each drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} prazosin, labetalol, and <b>medroxalol</b> were {{studied in the}} rabbit sino-atrial node, Purkinje cells and {{papillary}} muscles. At concentrations producing similar bradycardia, labetalol and <b>medroxalol</b> reduced the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) and overshoot potential in the sinus node. Prazosin had no such effects. These large and highly significant reductions in Vmax and overshoot in sinus node cells were observed at concentrations of <b>medroxalol</b> and labetalol which had no negative inotropic effect. If depolarization in the sinus node {{was due to the}} second inward current, this would imply that such currents in the sinus node and contracting cardiac muscle are pharmacologically distinct. All three drugs prolonged action potential duration in the sinus node, Purkinje cells and papillary muscles in a dose-related manner. Recovery after 1 h in drug-free solution from the effects of <b>medroxalol</b> and labetalol was only partial in the sinus node, but almost complete in Purkinje cells and papillary muscle. Recovery from prazosin was complete in all tissues. All three drugs depressed Vmax in Purkinje cells and papillary muscles in a dose-related manner, and recovery was complete. It is concluded that all three drugs had class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic actions, which could contribute to their protective effects in ischaemia and reperfusion independently of blockade of myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|<b>Medroxalol,</b> a {{new drug}} which has been {{reported}} to possess both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties, was compared with labetalol in single dose studies in normotensive males. Oral doses of 400 mg of each drug significantly reduced blood pressure, both supine and erect, without significant changes in heart rate. The chronotropic and diastolic depressor responses to isoprenaline were significantly antagonised by both drugs, for at least 6 - 8 h after drug administration. <b>Medroxalol</b> was associated with significantly greater beta-adrenoceptor antagonism than labetalol. There was no significant antagonism by either drug of the pressor response to noradrenaline. However, in a sub-group of subjects the responses to the selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, were consistent with modest alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism. This was significant only for labetalol. The ratios of beta 1 - to alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism as calculated from the relative shifts of the isoprenaline and phenylephrine dose-response curves, were 3 to 1 for labetalol and about 7 to 1 for <b>medroxalol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Haemodynamically, the {{combination}} of alpha 1 - and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is a logical one. alpha 1 -Adrenoceptor blockade causes vasodilatation and hence counteracts elevated peripheral vascular resistance, the most consistent haemodynamic derangement in established essential hypertension. beta-Blockers, which lower elevated blood pressure by a different (not yet clearly understood) mechanism, suppress the reflex tachycardia triggered by vasodilatation. Combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blockade {{can be obtained by}} the simultaneous administration of both types of adrenoceptor antagonists, but also by giving drugs that possess alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity in the same molecule. Carvedilol and labetalol are the best known examples of such combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, although their pharmacodynamic profile is a result of different receptor selectivity of their component stereoisomers, rather than combined alpha/beta-blocking activity in a single chemical entity. Both compounds have been investigated clinically in the treatment of essential hypertension in moderate-to-large scale trials. A few newer combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as amosulalol, arotinolol and <b>medroxalol</b> have been developed, but clinical data on these compounds are relatively scarc...|$|E
