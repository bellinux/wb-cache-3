The energy and dedication that had previously been responsible for the building of the SDKPiL would henceforth be devoted to the priorities of the struggle <b>for</b> <b>proletarian</b> <b>power</b> in Russia, to the defense of the revolution during the civil war, and eventually, to the tasks of socialist construction.|$|R

At {{the time it was}} a left-wing {{opposition}} to the military regime that had taken power the same year. It remained in opposition during the Ratsiraka regime and was part of the movement that forced him to give up his power in 1991. It also backed Marc Ravalomanana against Ratsiraka in the December 2001 presidential election and helped in persuading him to not accept the first official result but proclaim himself as the winner.|$|R

5000|$|Among {{those who}} opposed the party's {{adherence}} to the Stalinist hard line, August Enderle's profile was higher than most because of his contributions to the party publications The Red Flag and Inprecor. In addition, in 1927 he published a book, [...] "Die Gewerkschaftsbewegung. Ein Leitfaden für proletarische Gewerkschaftsarbeit" [...] ("The trades union <b>movement.</b> A manual <b>for</b> <b>proletarian</b> trades union work"). He also published a widely distributed pamphlet, [...] "Kampf um den Achtstundentag" [...] ("Struggle for an eight hour day"). [...] On his exclusion from the party {{at the end of}} 1929 he was accordingly a leading voice among the many hundreds of comrades similarly treated at this time. The response was the creation of an alternative communist party, known as the Communist Party (Opposition) ("Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Opposition)" [...] / KPD-O). August Enderle and his longstanding fellow activist Irmgard Rasch were among its founders, under the leadership of Heinrich Brandler and August Thalheimer. During 1929 August Enderle and Irmgard Rasch were married.|$|R

5000|$|The {{lesson of}} the last revolutionary wave {{is not that the}} working class can do without {{organised}} leadership, nor that the party is the class (a metaphysical abstraction they attribute to latterday Bordigists). Rather, that leadership and its organisational form (the party) is the most important weapon that the revolutionary working class has. Its task will be to fight for a communist perspective in the mass organs of <b>proletarian</b> <b>power</b> (soviets). The party, however, will remain a minority of the working class and is not a substitute for the class in general. The task of establishing socialism is one for the working class as a whole. It is a task which cannot be delegated, not even to the class conscious vanguard.|$|R

Examples include best-seller lists, films and music that must appeal to the masses, and shopping malls.

He {{was also one of the}} founders of Rono-ha (workers farmers faction), a group of Marxist thinkers opposed to the Comintern. His most famous work was the essay [...] "A change of course <b>for</b> the <b>proletarian</b> movement"(無産階級運動の方向転換) where he advocated direct political action and better coordination with the labour movement while criticising the anarchist <b>movement</b> <b>for</b> failing to achieve any lasting results.

This would, among other things, make it difficult <b>for</b> the <b>proletarians</b> to form a clear conception of who was their principal enemy. Regarding France, he suggests that the bourgeoisie recognised that they had been better off under the monarchy (1830-1848) than during the brief period when they wielded power themselves (1848-1851) [...] "since they must now confront the subjugated classes and contend against them without mediation, without the concealment afforded by the crown." ...|$|R

Thus, far from breaking with 'work',...the workers maintained the practice of clocking-in, continued to organize themselves and the community around the needs of the factory, paid themselves from profits arising from the sale of watches, maintained determined relations between individual work done and wage, and continued to wear their work shirts throughout the process." ...|$|R
