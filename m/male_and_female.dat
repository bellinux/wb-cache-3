5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female.</b> The <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E

5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors of <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E
40|$|The {{determinants}} of juvenile delinquency for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> using the Delinquency in a Birth Cohort II Study are investigated. Ordered probit models for juvenile arrest are estimated separately for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> The {{results indicate that}} juvenile arrests for both <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> are more likely for non-whites {{and for those who}} leave education early. <b>Males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> behave differently, in that males {{are more likely to be}} repeat offenders. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> {{are similar}} in size <b>and</b> color. <b>Males</b> weigh about 41.0 grams <b>and</b> <b>females</b> weigh about 36.6 g. The average {{wingspan}} of <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> is 96.9 <b>and</b> 92.1 mm, respectively.In 2008, Hofmann, Cronin, and Omland, conducted a study that showed there is little color difference in the feathers between the <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> of many tropical orioles, including the Puerto Rican oriole. This means that <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> both have elaborate colors, in contrast many temperate-zoned birds have brightly colored <b>males</b> <b>and</b> dull colored <b>females.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of juvenile delinquency for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> using the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study. Ordered probit models for juvenile arrest are estimated separately for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> An adaptation of the EM-algorithm is used to estimate the model for females in order address a problem of missing values for the variable linking demographic and arrest data. The results indicate that juvenile arrests for both <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> are more likely for nonwhites {{and for those who}} leave education early. <b>Males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> behave differently, in that males {{are more likely to be}} repeat offenders. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows that}} the peculiarities of {{divergent}} and convergent thinking in young <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> of various creativity levels are stipulated by a definite EEG frequency-and-spatial arrangement.

In young <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> of right LAP (lateral arrangement profile), connections are clearly localized in case of solution of both convergent and divergent tasks.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{description}} of the calls and stridulatory structures of <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> of an Indian weta species from the Western Ghats of Southern India. Calls of <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> produced by femoro-abdominal stridulation were recorded and call features such as chirp duration, chirp period, syllable period and syllable duration were characterised. The calls of males were highly stereotyped with regular chirp periods and durations whereas chirp rates in the female calls were more variable. The number of syllables per chirp was constant for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> <b>and</b> the fine temporal features such as syllable periods and syllable durations showed low inter-individual variation in both <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> The arrangement of femoral stridulatory structures {{was different from the}} previously described anostostomatid species.

5|$|Both the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> <b>female</b> will feed the chicks.|$|E

50|$|The sexual {{division}} of labour (SDL) is the delegation of different tasks between <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> Among human foragers, <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> target different types of foods and share them {{with each other for}} a mutual or familial benefit. In some species, <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> eat slightly different foods, while in other species, <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> will routinely share food - but only in humans are these two attributes combined. The few remaining hunter-gatherer populations in the world serve as evolutionary models that can help explain the origin of the sexual {{division of}} labor. Many studies on the sexual division of labor have been conducted on hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer population of Tanzania.|$|R
