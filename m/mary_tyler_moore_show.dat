5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The <b>Mary</b> <b>Tyler</b> <b>Moore</b> <b>Show)</b> and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} Kent Brockman {{functions as}} The Simpsonss main character for news parodies. He {{was based on}} Los Angeles anchormen Hal Fishman and Jerry Dunphy, and modeled after anchorman Ted Koppel. Another influence on the character was The <b>Mary</b> <b>Tyler</b> <b>Moore</b> <b>Shows</b> Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight. His role on The Simpsons is to host the news as the fictional television channel, Channel 6's anchorman. In addition to the news, he also hosts the programs Eye on Springfield and Smartline. In most of his appearances, he seems more interested in entertaining the viewers than informing them of real news. In [...] "Homer Loves Flanders" [...] Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory" [...] in a news broadcast. Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always trying to scare everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. Turner said that [...] "in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases", of which he says are glibness, amplification, and sensationalism. MSN called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors. Brockman is joined by Scott Christian and Arnie Pie on the Channel 6 news team. Originally, Scott Christian was the anchor and Brockman was the field reporter, but the show shifted focus to Brockman. Arnie Pie is a helicopter-based traffic reporter that sometimes help with field reports other than traffic.|$|R
500|$|Hartman {{became one}} of the stars of the NBC sitcom NewsRadio in 1995, portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal. He signed up after being {{attracted}} by the show's writing and use of an ensemble cast, and joked that he based McNeal on himself with [...] "any ethics and character" [...] removed. Hartman made roughly $50,000 per episode of NewsRadio. Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat. After the completion of the fourth season, Hartman commented, [...] "We seem to have limited appeal. We're on the edge here, not sure we're going to be picked up or not", but added he was [...] "99percent sure" [...] the series would be renewed for a fifth season. Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC's decision to repeatedly move NewsRadio into different timeslots, but later regretted his comments, saying, [...] "this is a sitcom, for crying out loud, not brain surgery". He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled [...] "it just will open up other opportunities for me". Although the show was renewed for a fifth season, Hartman died before production began. Ken Tucker praised Hartman's performance as McNeal: [...] "A lesser performer [...] would have played him as a variation on The <b>Mary</b> <b>Tyler</b> <b>Moore</b> <b>Shows</b> Ted Baxter, because that's what Bill was, on paper. But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill's self-centeredness, turning him devious, cowardly, squeamish, and foolishly bold from week to week." [...] Hartman was posthumously nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1998 for his work on NewsRadio, but lost to David Hyde Pierce.|$|R
