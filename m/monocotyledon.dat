5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the Liliaceae {{has a very}} complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it {{became one of the}} largest of the <b>monocotyledon</b> families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the Latin terms sensu lato and sensu stricto are frequently used (together with their abbreviations, s.l. and s.s.) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively, e.g. Liliaceae s.s..|$|E
25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single <b>monocotyledon</b> is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.|$|E
500|$|The Liliaceae {{family was}} {{described}} by Michel Adanson in 1763 and formally named by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789. Jussieu defined this grouping as having a calyx of six equal colored parts, six stamens, a superior ovary, single style, and a trilocular (three-chambered) capsule. By 1845, John Lindley, the first English systematist unhappily acknowledged the great diversity in the circumscription of the family, {{and that it had}} expanded vastly, with many subdivisions. As he saw it, the Liliaceae were already paraphyletic ("catch-all"), being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. He recognized [...] 133 genera and 1200 species. By the time of the next major British classification – that of Bentham and Hooker in 1883 (published in Latin) – several of Lindley's other families had already been absorbed into the Liliaceae. Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly, and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary, eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species, within the order Liliales in the Cronquist system (1981). Cronquist merged the Liliaceae with the Amaryllidaceae, making this one of the largest <b>monocotyledon</b> families.|$|E
30|$|The {{adoption}} of APG IV affects 79 (64 in dicotyledons and 15 in <b>monocotyledons)</b> of the 193 families (152 in dicotyledons and 41 in <b>monocotyledons)</b> recorded in FOT (Boufford et al. 2003), including changes in familial recircumscriptions in 50 families (41 in dicotyledons and 9 in <b>monocotyledons),</b> synonymization of 27 families (21 in dicotyledons and 6 in <b>monocotyledons),</b> and two families {{not present in}} Taiwan (i.e., Rafflesiaceae and Hydrophyllaceae). Circumscriptions of 114 (59.1 %) families [88 (57.9 %) in dicotyledons and 26 (63.4 %) in monocotyledons] of FOT remain unchanged. A total of 46 families are added under current classification. Table  1 summarizes current status of the families recorded in FOT (Boufford et al. 2003), newly added families (46), and frequently cultivated families not recorded in FOT (20).|$|R
