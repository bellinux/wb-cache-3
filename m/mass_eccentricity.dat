40|$|In this study, dynamic {{responses}} of two buildings connected by viscoelastic dampers under bidirectional excitations are extensively investigated. The two buildings are a 10 -story building and a 16 -story building, with the shorter {{building on the}} left. Viscoelastic dampers are installed at all floors of the shorter building. Equations of motion are formulated using a fractional derivative model to represent the viscoelastic dampers. Three cases are considered with <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricities</b> at 0, 10 % and - 10 % {{with respect to the}} dimensions of the buildings. The {{responses of}} the buildings are numerically predicted at different damper properties. The simulation results indicated that the maximum horizontal responses of the buildings without eccentricities are significantly mitigated. However, torsional effects are adversely increased. For asymmetric buildings, the effectiveness of the connecting dampers is affected by building eccentricities. As a result, <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricities</b> {{must be taken into account}} in damper selection. When compared with vibrations induced by unidirectional excitations, bidirectional excitations can increase the responses of coupled asymmetric buildings. In addition, installing dampers only at the top floor of the shorter building may cause a sudden change in lateral stiffness of the taller building. Consequently, the story shear envelopes of the taller building are changed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

So rotor <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity</b> vibration compensation control on rotating machine has great significance, especially for the high speed bearing less induction motor (BIM). A rotor <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity</b> compensation control strategy was presented to restrain the vibration of suspended rotor for BIM. Firstly, the suspension rotor dynamical model was deduced and unbalanced vibration mechanism was analyzed. Secondly, based on decoupling control between electromagnetic torque and radial force, the obtained vibration signal from the displacement sensor was put into the original radial force control system.

40|$|Spitzer Proposal ID # 13067 The {{recently}} detected TRAPPIST- 1 {{planetary system}} represents {{a unique opportunity}} to extend the nascent field of comparative exoplanetology into the realm of temperate terrestrial worlds. It is composed of at least three Earth-sized planets similar in sizes and irradiations to Earth and Venus transiting an ultra-cool dwarf star only 39 light-years away. Thanks to the Jupiter-size and infrared brightness of their host star, the planets are amenable for detailed atmospheric characterization with JWST, including for biosignatures detection. Our Spitzer Exploration Science Program aims to prepare and optimize the detailed study of this fascinating planetary system through the two following complementary sub-programs: (1) a 480 hrs continuous monitoring of the star to explore its full inner system up to its ice line in a search for any other transiting object(s) (planet, moon, Trojan) with a sensitivity high enough to detect any body as small as Ganymede, and (2) the observation of ~ 130 transits of the planets (520 hrs).

First, to measure precisely the planets' <b>masses</b> and <b>eccentricities</b> through the Transit Timing Variations method, to constrain strongly their compositions and energy budgets. Secondly, to measure with an extremely high precision the planets' effective radii at 4. 5 microns to assess, when combined with future HST/WFC 3 observations, the presence of an atmosphere around them.

The proposed turbine generator {{is equipped with}} a squeeze film damper under the effect of rub-impact in the oil film rupture. This system consists of a turbine rotor, generator, flywheel with <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity,</b> and a squeezed film damper. The turbine and generator are connected by a coupling which is regarded as rigid. System equations of motion are formulated by the Global Assumed Mode Method (GAMM) and the Lagrange's approach. This study investigates the nonlinear behavior of the system, including the trajectory of the rotor in the time domain, frequency spectrum, Poincaré map, and bifurcation diagram, by solving the system's equation of motion with the Runge-Kutta method. Results show that the system displays period-one motion when the rotor speed ratio is very small under the effects of flywheel eccentricity. However, the periodic motion is suddenly transformed into aperiodic motion without any transition. The squeeze film damper fails to support the rotor if the speed ratio is in the interval between 0. 93 and 1. 065 when flywheel eccentricity is 1 e- 4 m.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability and bifurcation of a rigid rotor support by journal and thrust active magnetic bearing (TAMB). The system is modelled as a five-axis controlled active magnetic bearing-rotor system (AMBRS), and the system equations are formulated by combining the equations of motion of the rotor and the equations of the decentralized proportional-integral-derivative controllers. For this AMBRS, the magnetic forces of the journal and TAMB are strongly non-linear with respect to control current and shaft displacement. This study focuses on the influence of non-linearities on the stability and bifurcation of T periodic motion of the AMBRS subjected to the influence of TAMB and <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity.</b> In the stability analysis, only periodic motion is investigated. The periodic motions and their stability margin are obtained by shooting method and path-following technique. The local stability and bifurcation behaviours of periodic motions are obtained by the Floquet theory. The results indicate that TAMB and <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity</b> have great influence on non-linear stability and bifurcation of the T periodic motion of the system and cause the spill-over of system non-linear dynamics and degradation of stability and bifurcation of T periodic motion. Therefore, sufficient attention should be paid to these factors in the analysis and design of rigid rotor systems equipped with TAMBs in order to ensure system reliability.

The collapse process highly depends on the whole structural system. Since, asymmetry of the building plan leads to the local damage concentration; it may intensify the progressive collapse mechanism of asymmetric buildings. In this research the progressive collapse of regular and irregular 6 -story RC ordinary moment resisting frame buildings are studied in the presence of the earthquake loads. Collapse process and collapse propagation are investigated using nonlinear time history analyses (NLTHA) in buildings with 5 %, 15 % and 25 % mass asymmetry with respect to the number of collapsed hinges and story drifts criteria. Results show that increasing the value of <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity</b> makes the asymmetric buildings become unstable earlier and in the early stages with lower number of the collapsed hinges. So, with increasing the <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricity</b> in building, instability and collapse of the entire building occurs earlier, with lower potential of the progressive collapse.

A five-storey steel frame building was used as reference structure and two different structural systems were employed to represent torsional stiff and torsional flexible structures. Accurate numerical models of the different structures were developed and nonlinear static and dynamic analyses under bi-directional ground motion were carried out. The influences of axial force-bending moment interaction in columns in the two main directions and second order effects were taken into account in the numerical analyses. The results of the numerical investigations on symmetric structures showed that the reduction of the number of moment resisting connections may lead to an increase of the structural damage. Asymmetric variants of the investigated structures were created by assuming different <b>mass</b> <b>eccentricities</b> in each of the two principal directions and extensive parametric studies were performed.
