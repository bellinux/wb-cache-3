40|$|Executive Summary The {{argument}} that market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration enhance product innovation performance has gained wide acceptance among scholars and managers. In this study, the authors use contingency theory and knowledge-based arguments {{to support this}} conclusion but, at the same time, qualify it in several ways. In particular, they complement extant knowledge with two main sets of findings. First, they distinguish among different dimensions of market knowledge (i. e. breadth, depth, and specificity and tacitness) and analyze their differential value for product innovation performance. Second, they investigate how formal knowledge integration mechanisms (i. e., use of documentation, information sharing meetings, analysis of successful and failed projects, and project reviews and briefings by external experts and consultants) help realize the full benefits of market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration in product innovation. The results from a double-informant survey of high-tech firms in China show that <b>market</b> knowledge <b>breadth,</b> depth, and specificity positively influence product innovation performance. However, tacitness of market knowledge {{is not related to}} product innovation performance. As for the role of knowledge integration mechanisms, such organizational structures and processes help translate market knowledge depth, market knowledge specificity, and cross-functional collaboration into product innovation performance. However, it appears that though some characteristics of market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration may make knowledge integration mechanisms necessary, their use must be tempered by the amount of contextual complexity the firm faces and the resulting need for functional flexibility and autonomy. Conversely, <b>market</b> knowledge <b>breadth</b> has a strong, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. Thus, it is inherently valuable for product innovation performance. This study challenges researchers and managers to take a more sophisticated look at how and why market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation outcomes. First, the direct effect of <b>market</b> knowledge <b>breadth</b> sheds new light on the importance ascribed to the concept of market orientation in product innovation and the importance that marketing theory places on a broad understanding of customers and competitors. Second, the results regarding the effects of market knowledge dimensions suggest that theoretical exploration of the failure of firms in product innovation should not be ascribed mainly to their failure in cross-functional collaboration, as many previous research and anecdotal reports have suggested. Third, this study clarifies how and why knowledge integration mechanisms matter in product innovation performance by showing simultaneously their mediating and moderating roles. The use of knowledge integration mechanisms appears to involve a trade-off between their necessity, occasioned by stickiness of market knowledge and the information-processing demands of cross-functional collaboration {{on the one hand and}} the implementation costs of knowledge integration mechanisms on the other hand. Finally, the findings of this study, along with those of previous studies, call for further investigation into the value of tacit knowledge for product innovation and firm performance...|$|R

We present a general framework of valuation based on the optimal realization of a performance index relative to the set of all feasible portfolio trajectories. Numerical examples are then presented and analyzed that show option price increases as the market transitions from liquid to less liquid state.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of portfolio diversification {{is a central}} tenet implicit to modern financial theory and practice. Linked to diversification {{is the notion of}} breadth. Breadth is correctly thought of as the number of in- dependent bets available to an investor. Conventionally applications us- ing breadth frequently assume only the number of separate bets. There may be a large discrepancy between these two interpretations. We uti- lize a simple singular-value decomposition (SVD) and the Keiser-Gutman stopping criterion to select the integer-valued effective dimensionality of the correlation matrix of returns. In an emerging market such as South African we document an estimated breadth that is considerably lower than anticipated. This lack of diversification may be because of market concentration, exposure to the global commodity cycle and local currency volatility. We discuss some practical extensions to a more statistically correct interpretation of <b>market</b> <b>breadth,</b> and its theoretical implications for both global and domestic investors. ...|$|E

We motivate this idea in a framework a la Holm-strom and Tirole (1997) that explains {{the relationship between}} creditor protection, credit <b>market</b> <b>breadth</b> and the credit cycle. We test the basic implications of the model using an updated data set on legal determinants of finance in a panel of data of aggregate credit growth for a sample of 139 countries during the period 1990 - 2003. We find support for the claim that better legal protections significantly reduce impact of exogenous shocks on credit. The results are not only statistically but also economically significant and robust to alternative measures of creditor protection, the inclusion of variables that reflect different stages of economic develop-ment, the restriction of our sample to only developing countries, and to alternative measures of shocks. ∗We are grateful to Danielken Molina, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes and participants at the IDB brown bag seminar, the Development Seminar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Sextas Jornadas de Economía Monetaria e Internacional at Universidad de la Plata, and the 2001 LACEA meeting in Uruguay for useful comments and suggestions.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} in the marketing literature that market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for successful product innovation. However, few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, {{the authors argue that}} knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions (i. e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated, <b>market</b> knowledge <b>breadth</b> has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of market knowledge depth and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms. By showing the differential effects of market knowledge dimensions on product innovation performance, the authors provide a more refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge, its integration, and the firm’s performance in product innovation. The authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge integration mechanisms, previous research may have provided an overly optimistic view of the value of cross-functional collaboration in product innovation...|$|R

40|$|In the {{increasingly}} competitive service industry, service innovation {{is an important}} driver of a service firm’s success and survival. While service innovation has often been couched {{in the notion of}} new service development, there exists a lack of clarity regarding the extent that a service firm introduces a service innovation to the market through service branding. Achieving superior new service performance is a challenging task for managers, as they need to formulate an appropriate brand strategy that supports the pursuit of new service development, as well as deploy distinctive operational resources and capabilities to successfully implement brand strategy. Without the proper deployment of resources and capabilities, the translation of brand strategies into the superior new service performance-outcomes can be lost. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} explore the role of brand strategies (i. e. new brand strategy and brand extension strategy) in the relationships between service innovations, market knowledge, market orientation, branding capability and new service performance. Specifically, this study focuses on the extent that service firms achieve higher new service performance when they deploy an appropriate service innovation (exploratory vs. exploitative service innovation) regarding their brand strategy type. The current study seeks to offer four important contributions to the current literature. First, it will contribute to the literature by arguing that exploratory and exploitative service innovations are driven by specific market knowledge dimensions (market knowledge depth and breadth), regarding the type of brand strategy (new brand strategy vs. brand extension strategy). This study shows that brand strategies moderate the relationship between market knowledge dimensions and service innovations. Second, this study contributes to the literature by arguing that market orientation helps service firms to acquire and develop an appropriate market knowledge dimension regarding their brand strategy. It will show that brand strategies affect the relationship between market orientation and market knowledge depth and breadth. Third, this study contributes to the literature by arguing that users of both brand strategies benefit from applying the branding capability to increase new service performance. Fourth, this study contributes to the literature by arguing that service innovations, specifically exploratory and exploitative service innovations, affect new service performance regarding the brand strategy type. It shows that brand strategy moderates the relationship between exploratory and exploitative service innovation and new service performance. In addition, this study contributes more generally to the literature by examining the interaction role of service innovations, market knowledge, market orientation, branding capability and brand strategies in the service context of Australia as a developed economy. Given the growing importance of the service industry in Australia, scant attention has been paid to the role of service branding in the service industry. Therefore, understanding the role of service branding in new service development in the service industry and extending the theory to new context is worthy of investigation. Overall, the findings of this study reveal that service firms using new brand strategy need greater exploratory service innovation than exploitative service innovation to achieve higher new service performance. In addition, new brand strategy users need greater <b>market</b> knowledge <b>breadth</b> than <b>market</b> knowledge depth to deploy exploratory service innovation. Furthermore, brand extension strategy users need greater market knowledge depth than <b>market</b> knowledge <b>breadth</b> to deploy exploitative service innovation. The findings of this study are contributing to the service branding literature, providing a fuller understanding of the extent to which service firms formulating new brand strategy or brand extension strategy need to understand and invest in appropriate service innovation, market knowledge dimensions, market orientation and branding capability in order to optimise the implementation of their brand strategy...|$|R

40|$|Innovativeness {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} instruments of growth strategies that provide companies with a competitive edge. Only a few recent studies have examined marketing innovation and the factors that might encourage its adoption. This study investigates the factors that motivate marketing innovation and examines whether the occurrence of marketing innovation varies across industry sectors. This study uses data from surveys and a nationwide census conducted by Statistics Canada. They include: the Survey of Innovation and Business Strategies (SIBS) 2009, the Survey of Innovation and Business Strategies (SIBS) 2012, the Business Registry (BR) and the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI). Multilevel (random-intercept) logistic regression modelling is employed. The results show that if a firm has a strategic focus on new marketing practices, maintains marketing within its enterprise, acquires or expands marketing capacity, has competitor and customer orientations, and adopts advanced technology then it is more likely to carry out <b>marketing</b> innovation. However, <b>breadth</b> of long-term strategic objectives and competitive intensity do not have significant impacts on marketing innovation. In addition, product innovation and organizational innovation occur simultaneously with marketing innovation, but process innovation may not.

40|$|This thesis investigates pricing of {{liquidity}} in the French stock market. The study covers 835 {{ordinary shares}} traded {{in the period}} of 1996 - 2014 on Paris Euronext. The author utilizes the Liquidity-Adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model (LCAPM) recently developed by Acharya and Pedersen (2005) to test whether liquidity level and risks significantly affect stock returns. Three different liquidity measures – Amihud, FHT, and PQS – are incorporated into the model to find any difference between the results they could provide. It appears that the findings largely depend on the liquidity measure used. In general the results exhibit more evidence for insignificant influence of liquidity level and risks as well as market risk on stock returns. The similar conclusion was reported earlier by Lee (2011) for several regions, including France. This finding of the thesis, however, is not consistent across all the liquidity measures. Nevertheless, the difference in the results between these measures provides new insight to the existing literature on this topic. The Amihud-based findings might indicate that market resiliency is not priced in the French stock market. At the same time the contradicting results from FHT and PQS provide some foundation for the hypothesis that one of two leftover liquidity dimensions – <b>market</b> depth or <b>breadth</b> – could significantly affect stock returns. Therefore, the thesis’ findings suggest a conjecture that different liquidity dimensions have different impacts on stock returns...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} neural network based trend prediction for equity <b>markets.</b> Despite a <b>breadth</b> of research which {{has focused on}} the prediction of various equity and currency exchange markets, much {{has focused on the}} use of specific techniques in such predictions. Few bodies of work have compared a wide range of equity market data preprocessing and technical analysis techniques in creating a prediction model based on feed-forward and recursive neural networks. To achieve a broad-based prediction model, the work in this study was broken into three distinct parts. Firstly, the neural networks goal is defined as finding whether a stock will be higher or lower than the previous trading period. Subsequent to this, a variety of input data scaling and network topologies are looked at. This includes the use of Self Organising Maps (SOM) as a data classification method to limit neural network inputs and training data requirements. Feed Forward and Elman networks of various topologies are used to narrow down the best network combinations. The resulting simulation is a neural network that can predict whether the next trading period will be, on average, higher or lower than the current. Secondly, the topology and preprocessing lessons learned during the first phase are applied to two types of neural network. Technical analysis is applied to the input data in an attempt to verify the usefulness of conventional stock indicators as inputs to neural networks. The two types of networks trained are, {{for the purposes of this}} thesis, dubbed indicator-predictive and price-predictive networks, meaning that technical analysis inputs are used to predict the next trading days technical indicator or future stock price direction respectively. Finally, a combined network is trained which takes the inputs from the price-predictive networks in an attempt to gain better results. The hypothesis with this network is that the combined neural network should learn which of its inputs are more indicative of a stock price movement, and thus more accurately predict the future direction of the stock...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} one {{essay on}} incomplete information and two {{essays on the}} capital market implications of asymmetric information. The acquisition of information and its dissemination to all economic units are central activities in capital markets. Limits to information diffusion may exist when market participants have limited processing ability or when market structure causes information asymmetry to persist. Merton (1987) proposes a simple capital market equilibrium model with incomplete information, in which difference in a stock’s investor recognition affects its cost of capital. Myers and Majluf (1984) lay out the theoretical foundation {{for the role of}} asymmetric information in corporate finance and its capital market implications. The first essay tests and offers support to Merton’s (1987) theory. In the U. S. <b>market,</b> using the <b>breadth</b> of ownership among retail investors as a proxy for investor recognition, I show that a long-short portfolio based on the annual change of shareholder base earns a compounded annual abnormal return of 6. 42 % after controlling for the Fama-French three factors. These results are more pronounced among young, low visibility and high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. Moreover, I present evidence that the investor recognition effect can explain approximately 20 % of the puzzling net equity issuance effect documented by Pontiff and Woodgate (2008). The second essay suggests a novel signaling mechanism in the framework of asymmetric information. When a firm’s convertible debt is issued, it is not only determined by the fundamentals of the firm such as past stock performance, but also related to whether this performance is realized during the tenure of current CEO who decides the issues. I define the performance that the current CEO achieves in the firm ever since the CEO comes to the helm as CEO-specific performance. Higher CEOspecific performance leads to (1) a higher probability of convertible issues, and (2) a less negative abnormal stock return in response to the convertible issue announcement, controlling for other firm characteristics. These evidences indicate that CEO-specific performance serves as a credible information signal to influence the adverse selection costs between the firm and outside investors in convertible bond financing. The third essay explores the possibility of asymmetric information in explaining the pronounced share issue anomaly in the cross-sectional variations of stock returns, as documented by Pontiff and Woodgate (2008). A lot of equity share issue and repurchase actions are actively determined by the decision of corporate stakeholders, such as employees at the stock options exercises. As these stakeholders hold a large amount of private information about the firm, it is in their optimal decisions to try to time the exercise of their share purchase activity, but outside investors are likely to fail to interpret the information revealed from these actions. I present strong evidence that a negative relation between share issues and stock returns is affected to a greater extent when the information asymmetry problem is more severe. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Changing factors within markets, such as {{continually}} shortening {{product life}} cycles, increasing competition due to shorter development and order processing times, manufacturing in intercompany networks and the individualization of customer needs, create new requirements which manufacturing organizations {{are expected to}} fulfil. To be successful, manufacturing organizations and business processes have to be transformable to cope with these environmental changes [1]. That's why the creation and implementation of self-adaptive production systems represents one vision of the near future, offering the ability to detect important changes, simulate the impacts of these changes and generate suggestions for an optimised configuration. A first step {{on the way to}} self-adaptive production systems is the transition from a nonrecurring, static planning und operation cycle to a continuous replanning and reconfiguration of work systems, supported by new planning methods and tools. In order to realize continuous replanning and reconfiguration, planning methods and tools have to meet new requirements: production modelling should be fast, and the model structure modular in order to enable quick and economical changes by the production planner. Within internal or external production networks, defined sectors have to be planned, simulated and optimised both separately and in combination with others. In temporary inter-company production, as realized in virtual companies, different production models must be able to communicate online with each other using new information technology such as the Internet. The paper presents a solution for an integrated planning tool, based on object-oriented, generic simulation models. The tool supports the production planner in adjusting the production system to changing product demand or corporate goals. It enables the planner in a decentralized organisation to model, simulate and evaluate his area of accountability, and to generate proposals for reconfiguration. Because no specialized knowledge of simulation programming is needed, model composition or input and structure parameter modification can be performed by the planner himself. Flexible production planning modules (FPPMs) are the core elements of the solution. By using these modules, machines and groups of machines can be compounded to subsystems which can then be replanned by a decentralized planning group. Because of the hierarchical composition of such a model, it is also possible to group the FPPMs repeatedly in order to improve the production system as a whole. The interconnection between the individual FPPMs, as well as between the FPPMs and the evaluation and optimisation unit, takes place through plug-and-play interfaces. The generic simulation model is generated using structure data and the FPPMs. After combining different FPPMs to a practical simulation model, the evaluation unit and the optimisation unit are added automatically. During the optimisation cycles, the simulation results are compared to firm-specific goals. The optimisation unit, based on an evolutionary algorithm, creates a population of possible new configurations which are the starting point for the next optimisation cycle. Thereby future production systems will be flexible, mobile, agile and temporary, thus meeting the requirements of the turbulent <b>market</b> environment. The <b>breadth</b> and depth of the production planner's tasks will increase substantially within this environment. With this proposed planning tool, the planner obtains an instrument to realize self-optimisation, to react to changes in his company's objectives and environment...|$|R
