50|$|A <b>minigene</b> is {{a minimal}} gene {{fragment}} that includes an exon {{and the control}} regions necessary for the gene to express itself {{in the same way}} as a wild type gene fragment. This is a <b>minigene</b> in its most basic sense. More complex minigenes can be constructed containing multiple exons and intron(s). Minigenes provide a valuable tool for researchers evaluating splicing patterns both in vivo and in vitro biochemically assessed experiments. Specifically, minigenes are used as splice reporter vectors (also called exon-trapping vectors) and act as a probe to determine which factors are important in splicing outcomes. They can be constructed to test the way both cis-regulatory elements (RNA effects) and trans-regulatory elements (associated proteins/splicing factors) affect gene expression.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide a good <b>minigene</b> model, the gene {{fragment}} should {{have all of the}} necessary elements to ensure it exhibits the same alternative splicing (AS) patterns as the wild type gene, i.e., the length of the fragment must include all upstream and downstream sequences which can affect its splicing. Therefore, most <b>minigene</b> designs begin with a thorough in silico analysis of the requirements of the experiment before any [...] "wet" [...] lab work is conducted. With the advent of Bioinformatics and widespread use of computers, several good programs now exist for the identification of cis-acting control regions that affect the splicing outcomes of a gene [...] and advanced programs can even consider splicing outcomes in various tissue types. Differences in minigenes are usually reflected in the final size of the fragment, which is in turn a reflection of the complexity of the <b>minigene</b> itself. The number of foreign DNA elements (exon and introns) inserted into the constitutive exons and introns of a given fragment varies with the type of experiment and the information being sought. A typical experiment might involve wild type minigenes which are expected to express genes normally in a comparison run against genetically engineered allelic variations which replace the wild-type gene and have been cloned into the same flanking sequences as the original fragment. These types of experiments help to determine the effect of various mutations on pre-mRNA splicing.|$|E

To study {{the roles of the}} different neuropeptides encoded by one large precursor we developed a method to overexpress <b>minigenes</b> and establish local secretion. Results We fused the signal peptide from the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) to a furin site followed by a processed form of the Agouti related protein (AgRP), AgRP 83 - 132 or α-melanocyte stimulating hormone. In vitro, these <b>minigenes</b> were secreted and biologically active. Additionally, the proteins of the <b>minigenes</b> were not transported into projections of primary neurons, thereby ensuring local release. In vivo administration of VWF-AgRP 83 - 132, using an adeno-associated viral vector as a delivery vehicle, into the paraventricular hypothalamus increased body weight and food intake of these rats compared to rats which received a control vector. Conclusions This study demonstrated that removal of the N-terminal part of full length AgRP and addition of a VWF signal peptide is a successful strategy to deliver neuropeptide <b>minigenes</b> to the brain and establish local neuropeptide secretion. </p...|$|R

5000|$|RNA {{splicing}} errors {{have been}} estimated {{to occur in}} a third of genetic diseases. To understand pathogenesis and identify potential targets of therapeutic intervention in these diseases, explicating the splicing elements involved is essential. Determining the complete set of components involved in splicing presents many challenges due to the abundance of alternative splicing, which occurs in most human genes, and the specificity in which splicing is carried out in vivo. [...] Splicing is distinctly conducted from cell type to cell type and across different stages of cellular development. Therefore, {{it is critical that}} any in vitro or bioinformatic assumptions about splicing regulation are confirmed in vivo. [...] Minigenes are used to elucidate cis-regulatory elements, trans-regulatory elements and other regulators of pre-mature RNA splicing in vivo. Minigenes have been applied to the study of a diverse array of genetic diseases due to the aforementioned abundance of alternatively spliced genes and the specificity and variation observed in splicing regulation. The following are examples of <b>minigene</b> use in various diseases. While it is not an exhaustive list, it does provide {{a better understanding of how}} minigenes are utilized.|$|E

A sequence termed ISAR (intronic splicing activator and repressor) has been implicated {{as an important}} cis regulatory element in both activation of exon IIIb and repression of exon IIIc splicing in epithelial cells. In order to better understand how this single sequence could have dual roles, we transfected <b>minigenes</b> containing a series of 2 -bp mutations in the 18 3 ′-most nucleotides of ISAR that we {{refer to as the}} ISAR core.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the alternative splicing patterns of CD 44 v 3 {{and how they are}} regulated in the metastasis of breast cancer cells. The primary goal was to construct a <b>minigene</b> containing the CD 44 v 3 plasmid. The protocol involved multiple steps of cloning, including polymerase chain reaction experiments, gel purification, enzyme digestion, ligation, transformation, and mini-prep procedures. The cloning process was followed by the transfection of the newly constructed <b>minigene</b> into breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cells used were non-metastatic MCF- 7 cells and metastatic MDA-MB- 231 cells. Data from previous reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments indicated that the MDA cells contain a higher concentration of CD 44 v 3, suggesting that a CD 44 v 3 <b>minigene</b> may be able to serve as a model system of the gene for further study of splicing regulation. Two minigenes were constructed. The first <b>minigene</b> contained the exontrap vector and the variable exon 3. The second <b>minigene</b> experienced more difficulty during cloning than the v 3 <b>minigene.</b> The construction of the E 5 -v 3 -E 16 <b>minigene</b> required a new strategy of inserting exons 5 and 16 individually into the v 3 plasmid in order to obtain the complete <b>minigene.</b> Once they were successfully cloned, both the v 3 and the E 5 -v 3 -E 16 minigenes were transfected into breast cancer cells.

One of every 3, 500 males suffers from DMD, yet no treatment is currently available. Genetic therapeutic approaches, using primarily myoblast transplantation and adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, have met with limited success. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, although proven superior for muscle gene transfer, are too small (5 kb) to package the 14 -kb dystrophin cDNA. Here we have created a series of minidystrophin genes (< 4. 2 kb) under the control of a muscle-specific promoter that readily package into AAV vectors. When injected into the muscle of mdx mice (a DMD model), two of the <b>minigenes</b> resulted in efficient and stable expression in a majority of the myofibers, restoring the missing dystrophin and dystrophin-associated protein complexes onto the plasma membrane. More importantly, this AAV treatment ameliorated dystrophic pathology in mdx muscle and led to normal myofiber morphology, histology, and cell membrane integrity. Thus, we have defined minimal functional dystrophin units and demonstrated the effectiveness of using AAV to deliver the <b>minigenes</b> in vivo, offering a promising avenue for DMD gene therapy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe α-fetoprotein (AFP) gene is {{transcribed}} in most {{epithelial cells}} lining the fetal mouse small intestine, but transcription persists {{in only a}} subset of enteroendocrine cells representing less than 1 % of the total intestinal epithelial cells in the adult. The decrease in AFP expression after birth is mediated {{in part by a}} repressor element lying between - 838 and - 250 bp of the AFP gene. Deletion of this element from AFP <b>minigene</b> constructs results in high-level <b>minigene</b> expression in the intestines of adult transgenic mice. Although high levels of AFP <b>minigene</b> RNA are expressed, the fetal pattern of expression is not maintained upon deletion of the repressor element. Instead, the number of cells in which the <b>minigene</b> is expressed increases from less than 1 % to approximately 10 % of the epithelial cells in the adult small intestine, and includes the majority of the goblet cells in addition to the enteroendocrine cells. In contrast, the pattern of AFP <b>minigene</b> expression in the enterocytes is unaffected by deletion of the repressor element and continues to decrease in the neonate. These studies indicate that the identified AFP repressor is active specifically in goblet cells. The decrease in AFP expression in the enterocytes may be mediated by a separate cis -acting element that is contained in the AFP <b>minigene</b> construct. Alternatively, it is possible that mature enterocytes lack some of the positive factors required for initiation and maintenance of <b>minigene</b> transcription {{in the absence of the}} identified negative element...|$|E

These effects on hormones {{have been identified}} as the cause of many endocrine disorders including thyroid-related pathological conditions, rickets, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. [...] One specific example of a splicing error causing an endocrine disease that has been studied using <b>minigenes</b> is a type of growth hormone deficiency called isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD), a disease that results in growth failure. IGHD type II is an autosomal dominant form caused by a mutation in the intervening sequence (IVS) adjacent to exon 3 of the gene encoding growth hormone 1, the GH-1 gene. This mutated form of IVS3 causes exon 3 to be skipped in the mRNA product. The mRNA (-E3) encodes a truncated form of hGH that then inhibits normal hGH secretion. <b>Minigenes</b> were used to determine that a point mutation within an intron splice enhancer (ISE) embedded in IVS3 was to blame for the skipping of E3.

First, three discrete viral CTL epitopes expressed from <b>minigenes</b> encoding peptides as short as 12 amino acids can be recognized when expressed from recombinant vaccinia virus; second, concentrating on two of the three epitopes, we show that these vaccinia virus recombinants can confer protection in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted manner, third, the <b>minigenes</b> can be fused to generate a "string of beads, " and the close proximity of the two epitopes within one oligopeptide does not disrupt recognition of either epitope; fourth, this string-of-beads vaccine, in contrast to the single epitope vaccines, can protect on both MHC backgrounds; and, fifth, CTL to different epitopes may act synergistically, as protection is improved when the vaccine contains more than one CTL epitope for a given MHC background. Adaptive immunity to virus infection can be conferred in either of two ways: passive, usually by transfer of immune serum, or active, by exposure to antigen. The latter method, most commonly by using as antigen live, attenuated viruses, has yielded outstanding results: smallpox has been eradi...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} described {{the construction of}} an intronless mouse thymidylate synthase (TS) <b>minigene</b> that has the normal 5 ' and 3 ' flanking regions of the gene linked to full length TS cDNA. Transfection of the <b>minigene</b> into ts- hamster V 79 cells led to low level expression of normal mouse TS mRNA and protein. In the present study we analyzed the effect of introns on the expression of the TS <b>minigene</b> in transient transfection assays. Inclusion of introns 5 and 6 at their normal locations in the coding region led to an 8 - 9 -fold stimulation of the level of TS and TS mRNA. Almost all of introns 5 and 6 could be deleted without diminishing the stimulatory effect. Inclusion of intron 3 also stimulated the expression of the <b>minigene,</b> although to a lesser extent than introns 5 and 6. However, inclusion of intron 4 had no stimulatory effect. Analysis of minigenes that contained various combinations of introns revealed that the stimulatory effects of the introns were not additive...|$|E
40|$|A random five-codon {{gene library}} {{was used to}} isolate minigenes whose {{expression}} causes cell growth arrest. Eight different deleterious minigenes were isolated, five of which had in-frame stop codons; the predicted expressed peptides ranged in size from two to five amino acids. Mutational analysis demonstrated that translation of the inhibitory minigenes is essential for growth arrest. Pulse-labeling experiments showed that expression of {{at least some of}} the selected minigenes results in inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. Expression of the deleterious minigenes in cells deficient in peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase causes accumulation of families of peptidyl-tRNAs corresponding to the last <b>minigene</b> codon; the inhibitory action of <b>minigene</b> expression could be suppressed by overexpression of the tRNA corresponding to the last sense codon in the <b>minigene.</b> Experimental data are compatible with the model that the deleterious effect of <b>minigene</b> expression is mediated by depletion of corresponding pools of free tRNAs. Short open reading frames (ORFs) are abundant in ge-nomes of all the studied organisms. Some mini-ORFs, espe-cially those found in transcribed RNAs (mRNA, rRNA, or others), may be potentially translated into short, functionally active peptides. For example, it has been shown recently tha...|$|E
40|$|A <b>minigene</b> {{version of}} the human gene for type II procollagen (COL 2 A 1) was {{prepared}} that lacked a large central region containing 12 of the 52 exons and therefore 291 of the 1523 codons of the gene. The construct was modeled after sporadic in-frame deletions of collagen genes that cause synthesis of shortened pro alpha chains that associate with normal pro alpha chains and thereby cause degradation of the shortened and normal pro alpha chains through a process called procollagen suicide. The gene construct was used to prepare five lines of transgenic mice expressing the <b>minigene.</b> A {{large proportion of the}} mice expressing the <b>minigene</b> developed a phenotype of a chondrodysplasia with dwarfism, short and thick limbs, a short snout, a cranial bulge, a cleft palate, and delayed mineralization of bone. A number of mice died shortly after birth. Microscopic examination of cartilage revealed decreased density and organization of collagen fibrils. In cultured chondrocytes from the transgenic mice, the <b>minigene</b> was expressed as shortened pro alpha 1 (II) chains that were disulfide-linked to normal mouse pro alpha 1 (II) chains. Therefore, the phenotype is probably explained by depletion of the endogenous mouse type II procollagen through the phenomenon of procollagen suicide...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{delivery}} into dendritic cells (DC) is most efficiently {{achieved by}} viral vectors. Recombinant canarypox viruses (ALVAC) were validated safe and efficient in humans. We aimed firstly to evaluate DC transduction by ALVAC vectors, then to investigate if such infection induced {{or not the}} maturation of the DC, and finally to assess the efficiency of ALVAC-MAGE-transduced DC to activate specific CTL clones. Clinical grade DC from melanoma patients were generated from blood monocytes and infected with a recombinant ALVAC virus encoding either a marker gene (EGFP) or the MAGE- 1 -MAGE- 3 <b>minigenes.</b> According to the patient-donor, 22 +/- 16 % of immature DC were successfully transduced. Flow cytometry analysis of surface markers expressed on DC after ALVAC infection did not reveal a mature phenotype. Moreover, ALVAC transduction did {{not interfere with the}} capacity of the DC to further mature under poly:IC stimulation. But most importantly, our results demonstrated that DC from HLA-A 1 patient-donors infected with the recombinant ALVAC MAGE- 1 -MAGE- 3 <b>minigenes</b> virus were capable of activating a MAGE 3 /A 1 CTL clone more efficiently than same DC loaded with MAGE 3 /A 1 peptide, as shown by increased IFN-gamma secretion. These results could be the basis {{for the development of a}} new clinical strategy in melanoma patient's immunotherapy. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Two point {{mutations}} of ABCA 1 gene {{were found}} in a patient with Tangier disease (TD) : i) G>C in intron 2 (IVS 2 + 5 G>C) and ii) c. 844 C>T in exon 9 (R 282 X). The IVS 2 + 5 G>C mutation was {{also found in the}} brother of another deceased TD patient, but not in 78 controls and 33 subjects with low HDL. The IVS 2 + 5 G>C mutation disrupts ABCA 1 pre-mRNA splicing in fibroblasts, leading to three abnormal mRNAs: devoid of exon 2 (Ex 2 (-) /mRNA), exon 4 (Ex 4 (-) /mRNA), or both these exons (Ex 2 (-) /Ex 4 (-) / mRNA), each containing a translation initiation site. These mRNAs are expected either not to be translated or generate short peptides. To investigate the in vitro effect of IVS 2 + 5 G>C mutation, we constructed two ABCA 1 <b>minigenes</b> encompassing Ex 1 -Ex 3 region, one with wild-type (WTgene) and the other with mutant (MTgene) intron 2. These <b>minigenes</b> were transfected into COS 1 and NIH 3 T 3, two cell lines with a different ABCA 1 gene expression. In COS 1 cells, WTgene pre-mRNA was spliced correctly, while the splicing of MTgene pre-mRNA resulted in Ex 2 -/mRNA. In NIH 3 T 3, no splicing of MTgene pre-mRNA was observed, whereas WTgene pre-mRNA was spliced correctly. These results stress the complexity of ABCA 1 pre-mRNA splicing in the presence of splice site mutations...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of robust T cell memory {{is critical for}} the development of novel vaccines for infections and cancers. Classical memory generatedby CD 8 + T cells is characterised by contracted populations homing to lymphoid organs. T cell “memory inflation”, as seen for example after cytomegalovirus infection, is the maintenance of expanded, functional, tissue-associated effector memory cell pools. Such memory pools may also be induced after adenovirus vaccination, and we recently defined common transcriptional and phenotypic features of these populations in mouse and man. However, the rules that govern which epitopes drive memoryinflation compared to classical memory are not fully defined and thus it is not currently possible to direct this process. We used our adenoviral model of memory inflation to first investigate the role of the promoter and then the role of the epitope context in determining memory formation. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that conventional memory could be converted to “inflationary” memory by simple presentation of the antigen in the form of “minigene” vectors. When epitopes from LacZ and MCMV that normally induce classical memory responses were presented as <b>minigenes,</b> they induced clear memory inflation. These data demonstrate that, regardless of the transgene promoter, the polypeptide context of a CD 8 + T cell epitope may determine whether classical or inflating memory responses are induced. The ability to direct this process by the use of <b>minigenes</b> is relevant to the design of vaccines and understanding of immune responses to pathogens...|$|R
