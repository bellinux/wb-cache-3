40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a four-terminal electrical connector device for testing and measuring unknown resistances of initiators used for starting pyrotechnic events aboard the space shuttle. The testing device minimizes contact resistance degradation effects and so improves {{the reliability of}} resistance measurements taken with the device. Separate and independent voltage sensing and current supply circuits each include a pair of socket contacts for <b>mating</b> <b>engagement</b> with the pins of the initiator. The unknown resistance that {{is measured by the}} device is the resistance of the bridgewire of the initiator which is required to be between 0. 95 and 1. 15 ohms...|$|E
40|$|A four-terminal {{electrical}} connector device (40) for testing and measuring unknown resistances of initiators (11) used for starting pyrotechnic events aboard a Space Transportation System. The testing device minimizes contact resistance degradation effects and so improves {{the reliability of}} resistance measurement taken with the device. Separate and independent voltage sensing (19) and current supply (20) circuits each includes a pair of socket contacts (13 - 16) for <b>mating</b> <b>engagement</b> with the pins (17, 18) of the initiator.

40|$|A {{quick connect}} {{fastener}} and {{method of use}} is presented wherein the quick connect fastener is suitable for replacing available bolts and screws, the quick connect fastener being capable of installation by simply pushing a threaded portion of the connector into a member receptacle hole, the inventive apparatus being comprised of an externally threaded fastener having a threaded portion slidably mounted upon a stud or bolt shaft, wherein the externally threaded fastener portion is expandable by a preloaded spring member. The fastener, upon contact with the member receptacle hole, has the capacity of presenting cylindrical threads of a reduced diameter for insertion purposes and once inserted into the receiving threads of the receptacle member hole, are expandable for engagement of the receptacle hole threads forming a quick connect of the fastener and the member to be fastened, the quick connect fastener can be further secured by rotation after insertion, {{even to the point}} of locking engagement, the quick connect fastener being disengagable only by reverse rotation of the <b>mated</b> thread <b>engagement...</b>|$|R
50|$|MIL-PRF-64266 is a {{performance}} specification describing the performance requirements for circular, plug and receptacle style, multiple removable genderless termini, fiber optic connectors for DoD applications—including aerospace and maritime—and that {{are compatible with}} multiple transmission element cables. These fiber optic connectors cover a family of general purpose, interconnection hardware providing a variety of compatible optical coupling arrangements, including connector shells, connector inserts, connector backshells, connector backshell accessories, and connector dust caps. All connector styles are designed to assure proper orientation of the mating halves prior to <b>mating,</b> and provide <b>engagement</b> between <b>mated</b> shells prior to terminus engagement and have the termini so located as {{to be protected from}} handling damage. The plug and receptacle styles permit straight, wall (panel) mounted, jamnut mounted, right angle and other connector configurations.|$|R
40|$|A {{device for}} {{installing}} rocket engines is reported that is supported at a cant relative to vertical by an axially extensible, tiltable pedestal. A lifting platform supports the rocket engine at its thrust chamber exit, including a mount having a concentric base {{characterized by a}} concave bearing surface, a plurality of uniformly spaced legs extended radially from the base, and an annular receiver coaxially aligned with the base and affixed to the distal ends of said legs for receiving the thrust chamber exit. The lifting platform rests on a seat concentrically related to the pedestal and affixed to an extended end portion thereof having a convex bearing surface <b>mated</b> in sliding <b>engagement</b> with the concave bearing surface of the annular base for accommodating a rocking motion of the platform...|$|R
