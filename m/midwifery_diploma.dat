40|$|Context: Pregnant Nunavut {{women are}} usually {{expected}} {{to relocate to}} distant and larger urban centres, often for several weeks, to give birth. A national study revealed that these women {{are less likely to}} have necessary information on pregnancy related topics and less satisfied with their maternity experiences. While prenatal and postpartum care can be accessed through nursing stations, opportunities for intrapartum care within Nunavut are limited to the hospital in Iqaluit or the birthing centre in Rankin Inlet. Issues: One strategy that may be help ameliorate these regional differences is increasing the integration of midwifery services. Many historical and political factors have contributed to the loss of traditional maternity care among the Inuit of Nunavut. A unique, multi-layered midwifery education program, with a range of exit points from maternity care worker to baccalaureate degree, was implemented by a partnership between the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Arctic College (NAC). Creative approaches were invoked to develop a program that is both culturally safe and ensures that graduates at <b>midwifery</b> <b>diploma</b> leve...|$|E

40|$|Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Background: In sub-Saharan Africa {{including}} South Africa, {{maternal mortality}} rates remain unacceptably high {{due to a}} shortage of registered nurses with advanced <b>midwifery</b> <b>diplomas.</b> Objective: To determine the profile of registered nurses (RNs) involved in maternity care in public referral hospitals of the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive {{study was conducted in}} all maternity units of Limpopo’s public referral hospitals. The study population comprised of 210 registered nurses, who became the study sample. Data on their educational profile and work experience in midwifery was analysed using STATA version 9. 0. Results: The mean age of the 210 registered nurses was 44. 5 ± 9. 1 years (range 21 to 62). The majority (152 / 210; 70 %) were 40 years and older, 56 % (117 / 210) had been working for more than 10 years, and 63 / 210 (30 %) were due to retire within 10 years. Only 22 % (46 / 210) had advanced <b>midwifery</b> <b>diplomas,</b> i. e. after their basic undergraduate training. Only six (2. 9 %) of the RNs providing maternity care in these referral hospitals were studying for advanced <b>midwifery</b> <b>diplomas</b> {{at the time of the}} study.

40|$|A {{strategic}} approach, utilising two sequential {{action research}} cycles over a two year period, was adopted to prepare teachers in one college for nursing and <b>midwifery</b> for <b>diploma</b> level courses. Ini tially, a link wi th higher education was developed, a policy for staff development implemented, and diploma level courses were planned. A survey of 63 teaching staff revealed their misconceptions about diploma level courses. During the second cycle, conjoint validation and subsequent implementation of diploma level courses were achieved. A staff development progammme was planned and implemented to prepare teachers for new roles and responsibili ties wi th diploma level courses. Five exploratory visits to other colleges of nursing were undertaken to valida te the approach adopted to staff development. Four were in England {{and one in}} Norway. Critical incident techniques and semistructured interviews of 7 education managers and a sample of 12 teachers were conducted to evalua te the programme's effectiveness. Teachers had an enhanced awareness of academic level in courses and were more confident to teach at diploma level. They were still inexperienced and uncertain about diploma level assessment and the integration of diploma level intellectual skills into practice settings. Theory has emerged from the research concerning the ongoing development of intellectual skills of nurses and midwives wi thin an academic framework incorpora ting a taxonomy of cognitive skills, self-directed learning and reflective practice. The central component of all these aspects is tha t of cri tical thinking which respondents identified as the characteristic which differentiated diploma level courses from previous training approaches. The eclectic staff development approach within a policy framework including individual performance review, achieved both individual and organisational development {{and contributed to the}} creation of corporate identity and cri tical awareness amongst staff. The programme also familiarised teachers with higher education approaches to course delivery prior to the impending merger of nurse education with higher education...|$|R
