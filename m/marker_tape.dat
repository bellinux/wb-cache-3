40|$|Abstract—Sonographic {{evidence}} of tumor removal by Mammotome excision does not confirm histological clearance. The operator finds {{it hard to}} determine if a malignant tumor has been fully removed, leaving a safe margin in the direction of each border; that is, the spatial orientation during tumor retrieval is not well-established by naked eye under sonographic guidance. We propose a computational imaging process to extract reasonable tumor contour in pre- and postoperative data sets for sonographic guidance so that Mammotome excision can help the operator to evaluate the surgical outcome. There were five tumors in the study, including three benign and two malignant. The lesion of interest was delineated after 2 -D examination was completed, then it was analyzed with 3 -D breast ultrasound (US). To give a reference point for correlations between pre- and postoperative images, we used a <b>marker</b> <b>tape</b> pasted on the skin within the transducer scanning area and then the preoperative 3 -D US images were obtained. Subsequently, 2 -D breast US was applied during Mammotome operation. After the Mammotome procedures were finished, the postoperative 3 -D US images were obtained; thus, we gained two different data sets of 3 -D US images that were used for later analysis for evaluating the extension of postoperative margin status. From the results, the safe margin was not satisfactory in all directions, because the minimum differences measured by the proposed algorithm were not large enough in all five cases, and this was proved from two malignant mastectomy specimens.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze whether, and if so, in what way risks would {{influence}} the design, costs and routing of CO 2 pipelines. This article assesses locational and societal risks of CO 2 pipeline transport and analyses whether rerouting or implementing additional risk mitigation measures is the most cost-effective option. The models EFFECTS and RISKCURVES are used to estimate the dispersion and risk, respectively. The pipeline routes are optimized by using the least cost path function in ArcGIS. This article evaluates three case studies in the Netherlands. The results show that pipelines transporting dense phase CO 2 (8 – 17 MPa) with a minimal amount of risk mitigation measures already meet the 10 − 6 locational risk required in the Netherlands. 10 − 6 locational risks of 135 m are calculated for intermediate pumping stations, handling 450 kg CO 2 /s (about 14 Mt CO 2 /year). In all the cases, pumping stations could be located along the pipeline route without any problem. For the cases studied transporting gaseous CO 2 (1. 5 – 3 MPa) leads to larger 10 − 6 locational risk distances than transporting dense phase CO 2. This is caused by the large momentum behind a dense phase CO 2 release, leading to smaller but higher jet and to a higher mixing rate with the surrounding air than for a gaseous CO 2 release. Based on our analysis, it can be concluded that dense phase CO 2 transport is safe if it is well organized. The risks are manageable and widely accepted under current legislation. In addition, risk mitigation measures, like <b>marker</b> <b>tape</b> and increased surveillance, are available which reduce the risk significantly and increase the costs only slightly. Pipeline routing for gaseous CO 2 transport appears more challenging in densely populated areas, because larger safety zones are attached to it...|$|E

5000|$|Van Vliet used a piano—an {{instrument}} he {{had never}} played before—as his main compositional tool. Since he had no experience with the piano and no conventional musical knowledge at all, {{he was able to}} experiment with few preconceived ideas of musical form or structure. Beefheart sat at the piano until he found a rhythmic or melodic pattern that he liked. Mike Barnes compared this approach to John Cage's [...] "maverick irreverence toward classical tradition". John French then transcribed this pattern, typically only a measure or two long, into musical notation. After Beefheart was finished French would then piece these fragments together into compositions, reminiscent of the splicing together of disparate source material on <b>Marker's</b> <b>tape.</b> French decided which part would be played on which instrument and taught each player their part, although Van Vliet had final say over the ultimate shape of the product. Band member Bill Harkleroad has remarked on [...] "how haphazardly the individual parts were done, worked on very surgically, stuck together, and then sculpted afterwards." [...] Once completed, each song was played {{in exactly the same way}} every time, eschewing the improvisation that typifies most popular music in favor of an approach more like a formal, classical composition. Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process [...] "forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of manipulative physiotherapists in palpating radiologically identified lumbar spinous processes (SPs). Five experienced manipulative physiotherapists were each allocated a cohort of 15 consecutive low back pain (LBP) patients presenting for X-rays and were asked to use surface palpation to identify the L 1, L 3 and L 5 SPs. Spherical radio-opaque <b>markers</b> were <b>taped</b> to the skin over these palpated points and standard lateral radiographs taken. Measurements were made to determine the proximity of these nominated markers to identified SPs. Seventy-two percent of markers were either placed accurately over the nominated SP or consistently within one SP of the nominated level. Forty-seven percent were accurately placed over the nominated SPs. A greater SP height at L 3 and L 5, and decreased soft tissue thickness over L 5, were associated with an increase in palpation accuracy levels, yet the patient variables of age, sex and body mass index (BMI) had no effect. The strongest effect on accuracy was between-therapist variability. The manipulative physiotherapists used in this study appear to be moderately successful in either palpating a nominated SP or being no more than one spinal level in error. Further research will focus on the choice of palpation procedure and a larger sample. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a case study from the {{automotive}} industry and relative to a test rig of internal combustion engines: the output shaft of the engine transmission is connected with an electromechanical brake {{by means of a}} transmission shaft which hosts a torsional coupling with rubber elements. The engine test cell was developed several years ago; over years, the engine operations and performance have been changed, in terms of output power and torque, entailing more severe dynamic loads affecting the driveline members. In this scenario, early failures of the rubber elements of the flexible coupling have occurred. The goal is to solve the problem by bringing the fewest possible modifications to the cell layout. An experimental campaign was thus carried out, with the aim of characterizing the current system dynamic behavior and finding possible modifications able to solve the problem. In particular, torsional vibration measurements have been achieved by a coder-based technique using high-quality optical sensors and equidistantly spaced <b>markers</b> (zebra <b>tape)</b> on the rotating components. The measured data were analyzed in the Time, Frequency, Time-Frequency, and Order domains.

Reflective <b>markers</b> were <b>taped</b> on the thorax (C 7, T 2, T 4, T 6, T 8, T 10, T 12, sternum, clavicles and ribs) and their 3 D positions were captured with an opto-electronic system.

50|$|The DCC Studio {{application}}, however, was {{a useful}} application {{that makes it}} possible to copy audio from tape to hard disk and vice versa, regardless of the SCMS status of the tape. This makes it possible to circumvent SCMS with DCC Studio. The program also allows users to manipulate the PASC audio files that were recorded to hard disk in various ways: they can change equalization settings, cut/copy and paste track fragments, and place and move audio markers and name those audio markers from the PC keyboard. It is possible to record a mix tape by selecting the desired tracks from a list, and moving the tracks around in a playlist. Then the user can click on the record button to copy the entire playlist back to DCC tape, while simultaneously recording markers (such as reverse and end-of-tape) and track titles. It is not necessary to record the track titles and <b>tape</b> <b>markers</b> separately (as you would do with a stationary recorder), and thanks to the use of a PC keyboard, it is possible to use characters in song titles that are not available when using a stationary machine's remote control.|$|R

Specifically, in contrast to most previous studies in which an external focus was directed at an implement, we used a gymnastics skill that did not involve the use of an implement. Furthermore, while most studies used only outcome measures of performance, we also assessed movement quality. Twelve-year-old gymnasts performed a maximum vertical jump with a 180 -degree turn while airborne, with their hands crossing in front of their chest during the turn under three different focus conditions. Under the external focus condition, participants were asked to focus on the direction in which a <b>tape</b> <b>marker,</b> which was attached to their chest, was pointing after the turn. Under the internal focus condition, they were asked to focus on the direction in which their hands were pointing after the turn. Under the control condition, no focus instructions were given. The external focus condition resulted in both superior movement form and greater jump height than did the other two conditions, which produced comparable results. The present findings show that, similar to other tasks, the performance of form-based skills can be enhanced relatively easily by appropriate external focus instructions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Walking {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} activities of daily living in humans, when the hip joints transfer power between the lower extremities and the pelvis. Hip osteoarthritis (OA) will more or less influence this function and is increasing in an ageing population. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common treatment for patients diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis when non-surgical treatments have failed. Optical tracking systems (OTS) based on cameras and force plates mounted in the floor have been used since the 1960 s. The technique includes attachment of reflective <b>markers</b> with double-adhesive <b>tape</b> to the skin of the patient. Marker positions are recorded when the patient walks through a calibrated measurement volume. Material and methods: In Study I, hip joint movements were measured with two different dynamic motion analysis systems, an optical tracking system and roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) in 16 patients with THA. In Study II, three patient groups were examined to study if the reproducibility of meas-ured values differs depending on whether the hip joint is normal, has developed OA or has been replaced with a THA. The aim of Study III was to investigate the gait in 22 patients operated bilaterally with two different types of stems at the same occasion. In Study IV, 62 patients operated with a Madreporic Lord hip prosthesis between 1979 and 1986 were followed for an average period of 26 years. In Study V, gait analy-sis was performed using two different motion analysis systems, one based on an optical tracking system and one based on accelerometers. Forty-nine THA patients were simultaneously evaluated with both methods. Results: During active hip motions soft-tissue displacements caused an underestimation of the true skeletal motion (Study I). In Study II the hip motions in patients with OA showed inferior repeatability between different investigators compared with THA patients and healthy controls. The gait pattern in the THA patients had not returned to normal one to two years after the operation. Study III showed no differences in speed, step length and frequency, or regarding kinematics or kinetics between short and conventional stems. Although both hip joints were operated during one-stage bilateral THA, there was still a difference between gait patterns two years after surgery compared with controls. In Study IV, the follow-up showed an average HHS of 81 (SD 14) and a pain score of 41 (SD 5), despite that more than half of the patients had undergone a revision of the acetabular cup. Some hips, but not all showed pronounced loss of bone mineral density around the stem. In Study V the accelerometer system measured movements of the pelvis and knee joint that did not differ from the optical system. However, significantly smaller flexion-extension was recorded. Conclusion: This dissertation shows that the deviation from skeletal movements measured using OTS is smallest when measuring hip flexion-extension in patients with THA. OTS is able to distinguish patients with hip osteoarthritis and patients with THA from a healthy control group while walking. The walking ability of patients with THA was still affected at least two years after surgery. A long-term follow-up of patients with an uncemented hip prosthesis revealed good function, despite that the acetabular component had been replaced in almost 50 % of cases. The accelerometer-based motion analysis system that was exam-ined had good validity when measuring pelvis and knee movements in the sagittal plane, but underestimated hip joint flexion and extension...|$|R
