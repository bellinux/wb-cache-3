50|$|The {{hydraulic}} control system consists of a valve arrangement and an engine driven pump. The automatic transmission contains a planetary gear set consisting of two sun gears, two sets of three planet pinions contained within a planetary carrier and ring gear. Various speed ratios are obtained by holding or clutching various combinations of elements of the planetary train. This is performed by two bands, two <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutches</b> and a one-way clutch.|$|R

50|$|However, as the {{development}} process continued, engineers at BorgWarner discovered that, with clever software programming, they could control the variable electromagnetic <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> {{to a point where}} it would allow the front and rear drive shafts to turn at different rotational speeds on its own, without the aid of a planetary or bevel geared center differential. In Auto mode the new software algorithms allowed the <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> pack's friction and clutch discs to slip as needed, simulating a planetary or bevel geared center differential, making a geared differential redundant. Thus, the geared differential was abandoned and therefore never included on the final production version of the four-wheel drive system.|$|E
50|$|Krebs {{introduced}} many {{improvements in}} car design: {{the steering wheel}} (1898), non-reversible steering (1898), engine balance (1898), nickel steel alloys and other special steel alloys (1901), the shock absorber (1906), <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> (1907), the electric brake dynamometer for testing high performance engines (1905), the enveloping (globoid) Worm gear differential (1915).|$|E
50|$|The {{design team}} gained {{confidence}} in their concept in 1989, when they made a breakthrough in the multi-disc clutch's control system. Development of closed-loop control smoothed its operation. Using it, the <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> made smaller adjustments, but did it more frequently. The microprocessor would review input from sensors every 20 milliseconds and decide if the front axle needed more torque. Using this technique, the unit's computer watched for drive wheel slip. If it sensed as little as half an rpm difference between {{the front and rear}} axles, it sent a power signal to the <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch.</b> The clutch engaged, diverting torque to the front axle in 10 percent increments, until it alleviated the drive wheel slip. As a result, the system could control runaway drive wheel speed in as little as a third of a wheel revolution.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wave {{spring is}} a key {{component}} of <b>multi-disc</b> wet <b>clutch</b> and the response speed and running quality of <b>multi-disc</b> wet <b>clutch</b> is affected by its characteristics. This paper analyses the theoretical calculation of load-deformation relationship of wave spring. The load-deformation relationship of wave spring is obtained by ANSYS 10. 0 software according to its structural characteristics and actual boundary condition and compared with the calculated results based on different methods and the measured value, and then study the effect of the wave number on the load- deformation relationship of wave spring. The results show that the calculated value of finite element analysis(FEM) is closer to the measured value and the FEM has more advantages on simulation of the working performance of wave spring...|$|R
50|$|However, heat {{proved to}} be a {{persistent}} issue. Excessive heat buildup would burn out the new clutch material. To solve the problem, engineers studied the clutch's torque capacity. It was determined that excessive heat buildup was caused by inadequate clutch torque capacity. Engineers increased the system's capacity and equipped a fleet of test vehicles, which they took to the Anza-Borrego desert in southern California. They made a total of 11 trips, subjecting the prototypes to heat, mountain driving, and deep sand with the intelligent <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutches</b> being called upon for almost continuous delivery of torque. At first, the environment quickly burned out the clutches. But as engineers gained knowledge, the clutches improved. Eventually, the engineers were able to improve the clutch packs enough that the test vehicles could be virtually destroyed from hard off road use, but the clutch packs would still look good.|$|R
40|$|Drag torques of {{gearboxes}} are {{an important}} part of the overall losses in today’s vehicle drive trains. From measurements it is well known that overall drag torques of vehicle gearboxes vary significantly over the range of operating points and speeds, de-pending on the interaction of the losses of the single gearbox elements like bearings, gearings, etc. Be-cause today’s vehicle emission regulations are be-coming stricter and stricter "drag torque design " of gearboxes will be even more important in the future. Prediction of losses helps to save cost (e. g. drag tor-que measurements), speeds up the development and allows to assess many concepts in short time. We collected detailed semi-analytical drag models for the common gearbox components from literature and from manufacturer information and implemented them in a Modelica library. This library contains models for radial shaft seals, rotary unions, synchro-nizers, <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutches,</b> helical gearings, planeta-ry gearings, various kinds of bearings, lubrication systems and lubricant characteristics. Using this li-brary drag torques of any vehicle gearbox may be computed for any operating condition (engaged gear, speed, torque, temperature). Simulation results for a 7 speed double clutch transmission show good corre-lation with measurements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} process of damping of non-linear vibrations in a three-mass model of a power transmission system with a <b>multi-disc</b> exible friction <b>clutch</b> switched on and o electroma-gnetically. Steady-state motion of the system is subject to harmonic exci-tation. The problem is considered on the assumption of a uniform unit pressure distribution between the contacting surfaces of the cooperating friction discs. Structural friction, small relative sliding of the clutch discs and linear viscotic damping have also been taken into account. In the case of sliding, the friction coecient is not constant but depends on the relative angular velocity of slowly sliding discs. The aim of the analysis is to assess the in uence of geometric parameters of the system, its exter-nal load, unit pressure, viscotic damping on resonance curves and phase shift angle of steady-state vibrations. The equations of motion of the examined system are solved by means of the slowly varying parameters (Van der Pol) method and digital simulation. Key words: non-linear vibrations, viscotic damping, friction clutch, struc-tural friction, hysteresis loo...|$|R
5000|$|Auto mode was {{featured}} on both Explorer and Expedition {{and allows for}} all-weather, full-time four-wheel drive capability on pavement as needed. In Auto mode, the engine’s torque is normally routed to the rear drive wheels. A misconception about the system is that it continuously shifts {{into and out of}} four-wheel drive as needed. This is not true, for when Auto mode is selected, the front axle hubs are permanently engaged, locking them to the front axle shafts, front differential, and front drive shaft. This is so the front drive shaft always rotates (turns) when the vehicle is being driven at speed. The computer control system needs the front drive shaft to turn, so that it can monitor and compare the rotational speed of both the front and rear drive shafts. If the rear drive shaft starts to turn faster than the front, the system interprets that (along with input from other sensors) as traction loss. When traction loss is detected, torque is sent forward to the front differential in 10 percent increments, via the center <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch.</b> As it does so, intelligent control software allows the center <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> to behave like a geared center differential, such that [...] "driveline binding" [...] and [...] "torque windup" [...] do not occur. The transfer of torque is done in secrecy, virtually undetectable by the occupants of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|A {{finite-element method}} is {{developed}} {{for determining the}} critical sliding speed for thermoelastic instability of an axisymmetric clutch or brake. Linear perturbations on the constant-speed solution are sought that vary sinusoidally in the circumferential direction and grow exponentially in time. These factors cancel in the governing thermoelastic and heat-conduction equations, leading to a linear eigenvalue problem on the two-dimensional cross-sectional domain for the exponential growth rate for each Fourier wavenumber. The imaginary part of this growth rate corresponds to a migration of the perturbation in the circumferential direction. The algorithm is tested against an analytical solution for a layer sliding between two half-planes and gives excellent agreement, for both the critical speed and the migration speed. Criteria are developed to determine the mesh refinement required to give an adequate discrete description of the thermal boundary layer adjacent to the sliding interface. The method is then {{used to determine the}} unstable mode and critical speed in geometries approximating current <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch</b> practice...|$|E
40|$|The most {{essential}} property of a powershifting transmission is that {{power can be}} transferred even during a gear shift. Automatic transmissions in vehicles are a common application. The gearbox is shifted by simultaneous engaging and disengaging of clutches, connected to a gear train. Analytic simulation models are useful tools when optimizing the control strategy for these clutches. This dissertation presents the following models for analysis of powershift operations in vehicle drivelines: * Model for dimensionless equations: A driveline model without too many details generates equations, which are made dimensionless in a lucid way. Through these, a good overview {{of the principles of}} powershifting is found. Also, some phenomena of interest are strictly defined (tie-up, flare, torque and inertia phase, etc.). * Two-clutch model: This driveline model has a gearbox, which shifts between two gears by controlling two clutches, one for the lower gear and one for the higher gear. The simulation results are verified by tests. Thus the level of detail in the driveline model is found to be appropriate. * Multi-clutch model: In this model, the gearbox is equipped with as many clutches as the real gearbox has. (In the presented example, this means five clutches.) Therefore, all gear shifts for a certain gearbox can be analyzed with the same model. Also, it is possible to analyze other shift operations than those where exactly one clutch is engaging and one is disengaging. * Model including surrounding systems: The driveline model is connected to models of the engine block and vehicle. Also, a simple model of a passenger is present, making it possible to study the passenger comfort more properly. The clutches are often oil-immersed, and so they cannot be properly described with dry friction characteristics. A model of an engaging <b>multi-disc</b> <b>clutch,</b> including squeeze and viscous friction in the oil film, is therefore developed. The influence of the oil film on the gear shift quality is studied. The modelling is carried out systematically. Therefore, the work also gives some general advice as to how dynamic transmission systems should be modelled. An algorithm is developed to find the appropriate state variables for a constrained dynamic transmission system...|$|E
