5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for {{passengers}} and <b>mail.</b> <b>It</b> had a signal station (built 1872) {{and a time}} ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network.

It would be hauled by members of the DJ class, and unlike the steam-hauled expresses, it would not carry <b>mail.</b> <b>It</b> began service on 1 December 1970.|$|E

In her New York City laboratory, Hazen cultured organisms found in soil samples and tested their ability to fight against two fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus responsible for the chronic disease cryptococcosis, which affects lungs, skin, and other body parts like the central nervous system, and Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis, which can be minor in some cases (e.g. a vaginal yeast infection), or a serious infection in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

500|$|Colt {{spent three}} months as a marine and was disillusioned with the {{military}} lifestyle; clerking in a humid port was not the adventurous life he had envisioned.

He mailed the letter to his brother James and asked him to <b>mail</b> <b>it</b> to Colonel Anderson from Ware.

500|$|In Everett's view, {{the lyrics}} to [...] "She's Leaving Home" [...] {{address the problem of}} {{alienation}} [...] "between disagreeing peoples", particularly those distanced from each other by the generation gap. McCartney's [...] "descriptive narration", which details the plight of a [...] "lonely girl" [...] who escapes the control of her [...] "selfish yet well-meaning parents", was inspired by a piece about teenage runaways published by the Daily <b>Mail.</b> <b>It</b> is the first track on Sgt.

500|$|The {{success of}} the initial Epaulettes series {{inspired}} the introduction of three new varieties with different designs and denominations in October 1849.

In the same issue, a new denomination of forty centimes in red was produced for overseas <b>mail.</b> <b>It</b> was rumoured {{at the time that}} Leopold I did not like the design at the time, and believed that the epaulettes gave him a childlike aspect. The Epaulettes were officially superseded in 1859, but remained legally valid until 1 July 1866 when, following Leopold I's death, all stamps bearing his effigy were demonetised.|$|E

The mailroom opened mail with gloves for weeks after the cartoon; one was covered in feces. A sexually-threatening letter {{was sent to the}} NGC communications officer, who had been quoted in articles about the work.

[...] These books were published together as a single volume in 1931. His book was considered superior to Shackleton's own account, published as South in 1919. [...] In 1938, a fourth book, First Voyage in a Square-rigged Ship was published. [...] When his financial circumstances required it, which was often, Worsley would write an article for money. His topics would range from the dogs used on the expedition to the pipe smoking habits of his Elephant Island cohabitants.|$|E
