60|$|Armstrong concurred, {{and they}} turned again upward toward Tacuzama. The trail was abrupt and precipitous, {{mounting}} through a dense forest. As night fell, dark and gloomy, Luis once <b>more</b> <b>halted.</b> Before <b>them</b> was a black chasm, bisecting the path {{as far as they}} could see.|$|R
60|$|Kell's party rode {{on through}} the town, and Smith <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> beyond the outskirts, near a grove of spruce-trees, where camp was to be made.|$|R
60|$|He {{ordered his}} cavalry to draw back and, riding {{up to the}} infantry, <b>halted</b> <b>them.</b> Terence at once ordered his men {{to lay down their}} arms.|$|R

50|$|Around 1888, several <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> {{were put}} into {{operation}} along the line, including in Pinnow and Niederlandin.|$|R
60|$|With one accord {{they started}} softly to retrace their steps {{when a new}} sound <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> again. It was a clear, fresh young voice singing a plaintive ditty in a nonchalant, {{careless}} tone.|$|R
5000|$|In 1759 {{following}} the defeat at the Battle of Bergen, Brunswick's forces retreated northwards as the French under Contades pushed home {{a plan to}} invade Hanover. Deciding to <b>halt</b> <b>them</b> {{near the town of}} Minden, Brunswick ...|$|R
60|$|The little battle {{so close}} to Bou Saada had drawn out a company of soldiers. Tarzan and his party met them just outside the town. The officer in charge <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> to learn the {{significance}} of the shots.|$|R
60|$|We {{arrived at}} the ship-yard without interruption, and then it behooved us to move with more of caution, for if so be the guards saw three lads embarking in a skiff, {{there would be little}} delay in <b>halting</b> <b>them</b> by means of a bullet.|$|R
50|$|China instead throws its {{resources}} into attacking the Caribbean. Due to the Monroe Doctrine, new President Bill Baker, {{who came to}} office on a pro-war platform, {{has to make a}} critical decision: to try to <b>halt</b> <b>them</b> with conventional forces, or use nuclear weapons.|$|R
60|$|The return {{journey was}} {{accomplished}} without misadventure. They made no <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> than {{were required to}} rest their horses and, travelling principally at night, they reached La Rochelle without having encountered any body of the enemy.|$|R
60|$|At Cherbourg a French dreadnaught <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> and {{an officer}} came aboard {{to give them}} a new chart of the mine fields between there and Calais and full {{instructions}} how to proceed safely. This officer, who spoke excellent English, asked a thousand questions and seemed grateful for their charitable assistance to his countrymen.|$|R
60|$|Beneath a great tree they <b>halted</b> <b>them,</b> and two ropes {{were thrown}} over a stout branch. One {{of the leaders}} started to search them; and when he drew his hands out of Bridge's side pockets his eyes went wide, and he gave a cry of elation which drew excited {{inquiries}} from all sides.|$|R
60|$|They trotted across {{half the}} {{intervening}} distance, and when Florence halted again Madeline {{was still not}} satisfied and asked to be taken nearer. This time, before they reined in again, Al Hammond saw them and wheeled his horse in their direction. He yelled something which Madeline did not understand, and then <b>halted</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Elysium, where Sunday makes a {{stand against}} the invading forces, was {{the first place to}} emerge from the Void, along with the Architect. The Seventh Key is strongest here, able to sense {{approaching}} troops and create natural disasters to <b>halt</b> <b>them.</b> It is possible that the Incomparable Gardens represent the Garden of Eden.|$|R
60|$|Even then Hodder did not answer, but {{rose and}} held open the door. As {{he made his}} exit under the strange {{scrutiny}} of the clergyman's gaze the little vestryman was plainly uncomfortable. He cleared his throat once <b>more,</b> <b>halted,</b> and then precipitately departed.|$|R
25|$|Auto racing became popular. Drivers would race an 8.4-mile loop {{made up of}} city streets. The Free-For-All Race was {{conducted}} between 1910 and 1912.

6000|$|An hour or {{two before}} midnight the band set out, {{accompanied}} by the Stranger and the Hermit's Pupil; and when they had gone some miles the Captain <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> to inform them of {{the object of the}} expedition.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 April 1864 at Dybb√∏l, the Prussians moved into their {{positions}} at 2.00.

50|$|Water {{has been}} classed as a {{commodity}} under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since the 1980s. This has increased tensions in the debate about exporting water. Although none of the NAFTA rules force Canada to begin to export its water in bulk, if Canada voluntarily decides to begin exports {{it would be very}} difficult to later <b>halt</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the afternoon, the Germans {{breached}} {{the perimeter}} near the canal at Bulskamp but the boggy {{ground on the}} far side of the canal and sporadic fire from the Durham Light Infantry, <b>halted</b> <b>them.</b> As night fell, the Germans massed for another attack at Nieuport. Eighteen RAF bombers found the Germans while they were still assembling and scattered them with an accurate bombing run.|$|R
60|$|As she was {{conducted}} up the stairway {{one of these}} yellow-coated warriors approached and halted her guides {{at the top of}} the steps.

50|$|On 11 April, daily IDF raids {{continued}} in the village, and troops continued to maintain roadblocks at the entrance. According to allegations by Israeli leftists and Awarta residents, soldiers humiliated residents and damaged property. Palestinian officials claimed that Israel had seized land around the village to expand nearby settlements. The Palestinian Authority condemned the raids and called on {{the international community to}} pressure Israel into <b>halting</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cwmaman Colliery {{also had}} a railmotor service; there were halts at Black Lion Crossing, from 1903. The service was for workmen only at first, but in 1906 three <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> were opened and the service became public. It {{did not make a}} direct {{connection}} {{with the rest of the}} passenger network.|$|R

60|$|Napoleon <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> for two days, {{in order}} that they might rest and receive {{provisions}} from the baggage trains following.

60|$|Putting {{himself at}} the head of his five-and-twenty men, Charlie rode off at once in pursuit of the rajah. He found him encamped in a village.

Then dismounting, and followed by Tim as his orderly, and Hossein as his body servant, he walked to the tent.|$|R
50|$|Led by the 1st SS Panzer division, {{they planned}} to attack the 2nd and the 99th Infantry Division {{with the goal of}} {{capturing}} Losheimergraben and gaining access to the vital road network to its north and west {{that would allow them to}} capture the important port of Antwerp. Mostly untried U.S. troops succeeded in severely limiting the German's advance, <b>halting</b> <b>them</b> at Elsenborn Ridge for most of the first day of the battle.|$|R
60|$|He {{therefore}} {{led them}} to a village on rising ground, {{a short distance from}} the road, and <b>halted</b> <b>them</b> there. The exhausted men threw themselves down {{in the shade of the}} houses. They had the long day yet to pass, and their thirst seemed unendurable; still, the halt was welcome, for there was not a man but felt that his strength was at an end, and that it would have been an impossibility to reach the city.|$|R
5000|$|Edmund Charaszkiewicz {{concluded}} his February 12, 1940, Paris {{paper with}} {{the observation that}} [...] "Poland's turning away from these Promethean processes can in no way <b>halt</b> <b>them,</b> while leaving us sidelined and exposing us to enormous losses that flow from the age-old principle that 'those who are absent, lose.' Poland's central position in the Promethean chain dictates to us readiness and presence at any disintegrative processes in Russia, and a leading Polish participation at their accomplishment." ...|$|R
50|$|Prisoners {{destined for}} the prison were no longer {{conveyed}} by the route after 1930 except during and just after World War 2, as the Southern Railway route to Tavistock and a road connection were <b>more</b> convenient.Two <b>more</b> <b>halts</b> (King Tor and Ingra Tor) were opened (in 1928 and 1936 respectively) to counter competition from local bus services and encourage tourist traffic.|$|R
50|$|Some {{think that}} SCT and ADHD produce two {{different}} kinds of inattention: While those with ADHD can engage their attention but fail to sustain it over time, people with SCT seem to have difficulty with engaging their attention to a specific task. Accordingly, the attentional style in SCT may be <b>more</b> <b>halting</b> and sluggish, whereas in ADHD it is jumpy and flighty.|$|R
