Wind tends to affect the north and west of the country more than the East, and Lincolnshire tends to receive no more than 2 days of gale per year (where gale is a gust of wind at >34knots, sustained for at least 10 minutes).

Averaging method is particularly crucial for data acquired in coastal regions. The effect of averaging method was markedly demonstrated for a precipitation-driven event on the U. S.

40|$|An energy analysis, {{combined}} with an economic one, in conventional and organic olive groves is useful in evaluating present situation and deciding best management strategies. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the differences in the energy budget between organic and conventional olive groves in three locations in the island of Thasos and to calculate CO 2 -emissions based on the used fossil energy. The data were collected through personal interviews with farmers during 2000 - 2003. Twenty-four farmers, who owned olive groves about I ha each, were randomly selected to participate in this study [(4 conventional and 4 organic) x 3 locations]. The <b>means</b> <b>averaged</b> over all locations for fertilizer application energy was significantly higher in conventional than in organic olive groves, while the opposite occurs for insect trapping energy. <b>Means</b> <b>averaged</b> over the two farming systems for weed control energy were significantly higher in the northeastern part of the island, followed by the northwestern and southern part. The <b>means</b> <b>averaged</b> over all locations for labor and fertilizers energy were significantly higher in conventional than in organic olive groves, while the opposite was observed for tools energy. <b>Means</b> <b>averaged</b> over the two farming systems for labor and tools energy were significantly higher in the northwestern part of the island. <b>Means</b> <b>averaged</b> over the two farming systems for electric and pesticides energy were significantly higher in the northwestern part of the island. Total energy inputs were not affected by any of the studied parameters, while outputs were affected by the location, by the farming system and their interaction. Outputs in the northeastern part of the island and production in all parts of the island were significantly lower in organic than in conventional olive groves. Outputs and production were lower in the southern part of the island than in the other parts, since olive groves in southern Thasos are located in slopes with less productive soils. The results show a clear response of energy inputs to energy outputs that resulted from the farming system and location. Global warming potential and CO 2 -emissions were not affected by the farming system and location. Organic olive groves tended to have lower CO 2 -emissions caused by the different uses of fossil energy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Athletes who have different physical disabilities may compete in the same class so long as their functional impairments are similar.

Swimmers are divided into ten classes based on degree of functional disability: S1, S2, S3, [...] S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 and S10. The most severely affected are in class S1; these swimmers normally use wheelchairs outside of the pool. Classes are prefixed with the letter [...] "S" [...] for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events, while those prefixed with [...] "SB" [...] are for breaststroke, and those with [...] "SM" [...] for individual medley events. This is because different strokes require the use of different muscle groups. In the case of the breaststroke, for example, the hand and the hip play a crucial role. Because of this, a swimmer may compete in one class for one stroke and a different class for another. It also means that swimmers with cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries and limb deficiencies may compete against each other.
