40|$|This {{study is}} part of an action {{research}} project designed to model a district-wide early identification and intervention program for Kindergartners at risk for reading failure. The project was designed to model quality professional development in the area of early literacy for Kindergarten teachers, the use of a <b>multi-gating</b> procedure for identifying those children most likely to benefit from extra support, training for paraprofessionals to provide support to identified low performing students, and the use of a “response to intervention” approach for determining level of intensity of intervention. This study evaluates the relative effectiveness of the two research-validated curricula chosen as strategic interventions for improving outcomes on early literacy indicators of at-risk Kindergarten students. Both curricula were delivered in small groups by classroom aides who received brief training. A second part of the study evaluates the effectiveness of individually designed, intensified interventions for those children whose achievement did not improve sufficiently under conditions of small group instruction. A third section examined factors affecting teacher motivation to participate in the project and to embrace new teaching and assessment methods. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of pegylated interferon-alfa- 2 a (Peg-IFN-α) therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is HBsAg seroconversion. Even though B cells are major mediators of a positive clinical outcome, their modulation during Peg-IFN-α therapy {{has not yet been}} described. We investigated here the effects of Peg-IFN-α on eight circulating B-cell subsets thanks to an original <b>multi-gating</b> approach based on CD 19, CD 27, IgD, CD 10, and CD 38 markers in patients with CHB treated with nucleos(t) ide analog alone or in combination with Peg-IFN-α. These dynamic changes were analyzed during the 48 -weeks of Peg-IFN-α therapy and up to 2 years after the cessation of treatment. The CD 19 +CD 27 -IgD+CD 10 +CD 38 high transitional B cells and the CD 19 +CD 27 +IgD-CD 10 -CD 38 high plasmablasts continuously increased, whereas the CD 19 +CD 27 -IgD+CD 10 -CD 38 low naive, CD 19 +CD 27 +IgD+ natural memory, and CD 19 +CD 27 +IgD-CD 10 -CD 38 low post-germinal center B cells decreased during the course of Peg-IFNα treatment. Such modulations correlated with a sustained increase in sCD 30 levels and the decrease in plasma HBsAg. However, no seroconversion occurred and all parameters returned to baseline after the stop of the treatment.

40|$|In {{recent years}} plastic {{moulding}} techniques, such as injection moulding, {{have been developed}} to fulfil the needs of micro-components fabrication. Micro-injection moulding (SLIM) is the process which enables the mass production of polymer micro-systems such as micro-mechanical parts, micro-fluidic systems, micro-optics, micro-components for medical devices, etc. A key factor in micro-polymer based systems is the possibility of designing and therefore replicating very complex geometries, allowing an increasing number of applications and micro-products. Complex geometries bring challenges during the filling stage of the process. Many features cause melt front separation: through holes, presence of pins and cores, changes of thickness, <b>multi-gating</b> systems, existence of micro-inserts, two component injection moulding, etc. When two or more melt flows join each other after separation, a layer between the two original flows will generate and a weld line is formed {{on the surface of the}} micro-moulded part. This phenomenon has to be avoided or at least reduced, since in the weld line area the mechanical properties are poorer than in the bulk part, creating strength problems on the final part. Although weld lines are unavoidable, the micro-injection moulding process can indeed be optimized in order to on one hand obtain a good filling of the cavity and on the other hand decrease the size of the weld lines. In this paper, an investigation devoted to the determination of the influence of typical injection moulding parameters on the weld lines' dimensions is presented, using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Depth and width of weld lines were chosen as parameters to be optimized...|$|E

In order to utilize the full potential of <b>multi-gate</b> FETs, {{there is a need}} for design methodologies which exploit unique technology features to achieve superior design solutions. Moreover, design issues specific to <b>multi-gate</b> FETs need to be identified and addressed using innovative techniques at different levels of design abstraction. This research focuses on device/circuit-level design and analysis of <b>multi-gate</b> FET based SRAMs. For our analysis, we have developed a mixed-mode simulation framework, with the capability of treating quantum mechanical effects in deeply scaled devices. The simulation framework is based on non-equilibrium Green 2 ̆ 7 s function (NEGF) models and Taurus simulations for devices. Circuit simulations are carried out using HSPICE with look-up table based Verilog-A models. Using this simulation framework, we explore the device-circuit interactions in <b>multi-gate</b> FET based SRAMs. First, we show that using unique technology features of FinFETs (a type of <b>multi-gate</b> FET), design conflicts in 6 T SRAM can be mitigated. To that effect, we propose FinFETs with asymmetric gate underlap and asymmetric source/drain doping to mitigate the read-write conflict in SRAMs and achieve larger cell stability along with leakage reduction. We also explore independent gate FinFET based SRAMs and propose design techniques to improve the cell stability. Next, we propose a double-gate heterojunction intra-band tunnel (HIBT) FET based on different source/drain and channel materials. We show that compared to Si double-gate MOSFET, HIBT FET exhibits lower drain-induced barrier lowering/thinning and lower sensitivity of OFF current to process variations. We also discuss the suitability of the proposed device for low voltage SRAMs. Finally, based on some unique features of FinFETs, we report the possibility of negative-bias temperature instability in n-type silicon-on-insulator FinFETs used as access transistors in SRAMs and analyze its impact on the cell stability and performance. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{performance}} driven layout design, parasitic components {{need to be}} evaluated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The dominant layout capacitances and resistances in CMOS integrated circuits are highly correlated with the structures of MOS gate and source/drain regions. Therefore, a physical model including layout/geometry effects of arbitrary configurations is essential. In this thesis, high-frequency models for planar bulk and non-planar SOI MOSFETs are developed. A wide range of devices are investigated, from conventional multi-finger MOSFETs, to enhanced compact waffle MOSFETs, and to three-dimensional <b>multi-gate</b> devices for next-generation circuit blocks. For planar bulk CMOS devices, a small-signal model including parasitic components is analyzed, {{which can be used}} to predict RF figures of merits (cut-off frequency ƒT, oscillation frequency ƒmax, minimum noise figure NFmin, etc.) for both compact waffle layouts and conventional RF CMOS layouts. The validity of the small-signal model is verified through device fabrication and high-frequency scattering parameter measurement. In addition, the advantages of the compact waffle layout are demonstrated by the implementation of low-noise amplifiers, passive mixers and wide-band transmit/receive (T/R) switches in a 0. 35 -μm standard processing technology. When CMOS technologies advance into nano-scale regime, researchers have been studying non-planar <b>multi-gate</b> silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs for their superior capability of suppressing the short-channel effects (SCEs). However, their three-dimensional nature complicates the relationship between parasitic components and device geometrical parameters such as fin spacing, fin height and polysilicon thickness. In this thesis, an equivalent gate-resistance model derived from distributed R-C networks is established and verified using a 2 -D MEDICI simulator. Also, a layout-oriented optimization guideline is derived to achieve the minimum gate resistance. For parasitic fringing and overlap capacitances in non-planar SOI <b>multi-gate</b> devices, a physical method based on a system transformation named conformal mapping is proposed catering to the gate architecture.

An accurate and computationally efficient compact transistor model is necessary to simulate circuits in multiple-gate MOSFET technologies. In this dissertation research, a compact multiple-gate MOSFET model, BSIM-MG is developed. BSIM-MG includes independent <b>multi-gate</b> compact model BSIM-IMG and common <b>multi-gate</b> compact model BSIM-CMG.

The basic formulations for surface potential, drain current and charge are derived and verified against TCAD simulations with excellent agreements. The model preserves important property of <b>multi-gate</b> MOSFETs such as volume inversion. Non-ideal effects including short channel effects, length dependent back-gate coupling, transport models, leakage currents, parasitic resistances and capacitances, temperature effects and self heating are considered in the model. The model expressions are carefully formulated so that the symmetry of the source and drain is preserved. Rules for maintaining symmetry are discussed in this dissertation. For the common <b>multi-gate</b> transistor model BSIM-CMG, the basic expressions have been improved {{so that it is}} compatible with a novel non quasi-static effects modeling technique — charge segmentation. In addition, a parasitic source/drain resistance model is developed, including three components: the contact resistance, the spreading resistance, and the bias-dependent extension resistance. Both BSIM-CMG and BSIM-IMG models are verified against TCAD and measured data. The use of the FinFET compact model to model manufacturing variation in a FinFET technology is further explored. The model matches measured data well for both the nominal case and the statistical distribution for NMOS threshold voltage as well as the read static noise margin. A non-Gaussian threshold voltage distribution is observed for nFET devices, and the compact model successfully captures the distribution.
