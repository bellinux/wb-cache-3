5|$|The {{inclination}} {{is given}} by an angle that can assume values between -90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.|$|E

The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic {{expedition}} in HMS Erebus and HMS Terror was {{a full-scale}} Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function {{of which was}} to test current theories on magnetism, {{and to try to}} locate the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and was supported by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he {{had been a member of}} a party that had reached the location of the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole,</b> and he was an obvious choice as commander.|$|E
5000|$|More plausibly, however, radio-quiet {{neutron stars}} {{may simply be}} pulsars which do not pulse in our direction. As pulsars spin, it is theorized they emit {{radiation}} from their <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> When the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> do not lie on the axis of rotation, and cross the line {{of sight of the}} observer, one can detect radio emission emitted near the star's <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> Due to the star's rotation this radiation appears to pulse, colloquially called the [...] "lighthouse effect". Radio-quiet neutron stars may be neutron stars whose <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> do not point towards the Earth during their rotation.|$|R

5|$|While {{preparing}} for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David {{to lead a}} Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party {{was to try to}} reach the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole,</b> and was to carry out a full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders to plant the Union Jack at the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> and to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.|$|E
5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E

5|$|On {{its passage}} northward, Southern Cross halted at Franklin Island, off the Victoria Land coast, {{and made a}} series of {{magnetic}} calculations. These indicated that the location of the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed. The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from Bluff, New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to sea ice {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow.

In January 1895 Borchgrevink {{was one of a}} group from that expedition that claimed the first confirmed landing on the Antarctic continent, at Cape Adare. Borchgrevink determined to return with his own expedition, which would overwinter and explore inland, with the location of the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> as an objective.|$|E

Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. On the medical side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh seal meat, which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Beardmore was {{sufficiently}} impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved {{hard to come}} by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E

Building on this force between poles, Siméon Denis Poisson (1781-1840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824. In this model, a magnetic -field is produced by 'magnetic poles' and magnetism is due to small pairs of north/south <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
