40|$|We {{find the}} spin {{polarized}} disordered Fermi liquids are unstable to the nucleation of superconducting pairing states at <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales</b> even when magnetic fields which polarize the spins are substantially {{higher than the}} critical one. We study the probability of finding superconducting pairing states at <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales</b> in this limit. We find that the distribution function depends only on the film conductance. The typical length scale at which pairing takes place is universal, and decreases when the magnetic field is increased.

40|$|Wave-induced {{fluid flow}} at {{microscopic}} and <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales</b> arguably constitutes the {{major cause of}} intrinsic seismic attenuation throughout the exploration seismic and sonic frequency ranges. The quantitative analysis of these phenomena is, however, {{complicated by the fact}} that the governing physical processes may be dependent. The reason for this is that the presence of microscopic heterogeneities, such as micro-cracks or broken grain contacts, causes the stiffness of the so-called modified dry frame to be complex-valued and frequency-dependent, which in turn may affect the viscoelastic behaviour in response to fluid flow at <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales.</b> In this work, we propose a simple but effective procedure to estimate the seismic attenuation and velocity dispersion behaviour associated with wave-induced fluid flow due to both microscopic and mesoscopic heterogeneities and discuss the results obtained for a range of pertinent scenarios...|$|R

40|$|We study {{statistical}} {{properties of}} peculiar responses in glassy systems at <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales</b> {{based on a}} class of mean-field spin-glass models which exhibit 1 step replica symmetry breaking. Under variation of a generic external field, a finite-sized sample of such a system exhibits a series of step wise responses which {{can be regarded as}} a finger print of the sample. We study in detail the statistical properties of the step structures based on a low temperature expansion approach and a replica approach. The spacings between the steps vanish in the thermodynamic limit so that arbitrary small but finite variation of the field induce infinitely many level crossings in the thermodynamic limit leading to a static chaos effect which yields a self-averaging, smooth macroscopic response. We also note that there is a strong analogy between the problem of step-wise responses in glassy systems at <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales</b> and intermittency in turbulent flows due to shocks.

40|$|We prove a Central Limit Theorem for {{the linear}} {{statistics}} of two-dimensional Coulomb gases, with arbitrary inverse temperature and general confining potential, at the macroscopic and <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales</b> and possibly near {{the boundary of}} {{the support of the}} equilibrium measure. This can be stated in terms of convergence of the random electrostatic potential to a Gaussian Free Field. Our result is the first to be valid at arbitrary temperature and at the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scales,</b> and we recover previous results of Ameur-Hendenmalm-Makarov and Rider-Virág concerning the determinantal case, with weaker assumptions near the boundary. We also prove moderate deviations upper bounds, or rigidity estimates, for the linear statistics and a convergence result for those corresponding to energy-minimizers. The method relies on a change of variables, a perturbative expansion of the energy, and the comparison of partition functions deduced from our previous work. Near the boundary, we use recent quantitative stability estimates on the solutions to the obstacle problem obtained by Serra and the second author.

50|$|This is a {{mechanism}} that operates under low to moderate homologous temperatures, low confining pressure and relatively high strain rates and involves fracturing, sliding and rolling of fragments, and further fragmentation of these into smaller particles. During cataclastic flow, a rock will deform without any obvious strain localization at the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scale,</b> yet {{the process of}} deformation is microfracturing and frictional sliding where tiny fractures, called microcracks, and the associated rock fragments move past each other. Frictional sliding is strongly pressure dependent, where with increasing pressure the ability of sliding is reduced. The microfractures can be intergranular (along grain boundaries) or intragranular (within individual grains), where the process occurs by breaking many atomic bonds at the same time; however the crystal structure away from the fracture is unaffected. Cataclastic flow can occur by grain-boundary sliding with limited continuous fracturing of grains, or continued fracturing and other deformation processes can limit the rate of cataclastic flow.|$|E

In this paper we investigate the transition on the intermediate, i. e. <b>mesoscopic,</b> <b>scales.</b> The time scales that we consider are such {{that the system is}} already in microscopic equilibrium (sine-universality for the local correlations), but we have not yet reached equilibrium at the macrosopic scale.

We consider two situations: deterministic initial points and randomly chosen initial points.

50|$|Interesting {{behaviors}} {{arise from}} soft matter {{in ways that}} cannot be predicted, or are difficult to predict, directly from its atomic or molecular constituents. This is often because soft matter self-organizes into mesoscopic physical structures that are {{much larger than the}} microscopic scale (the arrangement of atoms and molecules), and yet are much smaller than the macroscopic (overall) scale of the material. The properties and interactions of these mesoscopic structures may determine the macroscopic behavior of the material. For example, the turbulent vortices that naturally occur within a flowing liquid are much smaller than the overall quantity of liquid and yet much larger than its individual molecules, and the emergence of these vortices control the overall flowing behavior of the material. Also, the bubbles that comprise a foam are mesoscopic because they individually consist of a vast number of molecules, and yet the foam itself consists of a great number of these bubbles, and the overall mechanical stiffness of the foam emerges from the combined interactions of the bubbles. By way of contrast, in hard condensed matter physics it is often possible to predict the overall behavior of a material because the molecules are organized into a crystalline lattice with no changes in the pattern at any <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

This technique combines measurements of seismic attenuation in the frequency range from 1 to 100 ?Hz with measurements of transient fluid pressure as a response of a step stress applied {{on top of the}} sample. We used a Berea sandstone sample partially saturated with water. The laboratory results suggest that wave-induced fluid flow on the <b>mesoscopic</b> <b>scale</b> is dominant in partially saturated samples.
