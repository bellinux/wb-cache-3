In Korean en-cyclopedia, an <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> is frequently omitted in a sentence. If the QA system uses a sentence without an <b>entry</b> <b>word,</b> it cannot provide a right answer. For resolving this problem, we combine a rule-based approach with Maximum Entropy model {{to use the}} merit of each approach. A rule-based approach uses caseframes and sense classes. The re-sult shows that combined approach gives a 20 % increase over our baseline. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a new political dispensation in South Africa, bilingual dictionaries have become a necessary part of daily life. The main function of a bilingual dictionary is to provide one or more equivalents in the target language for the <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in the source language. Not all bilingual dictionaries realize this objective satisfactorily, Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa bilingual dictionaries included. Some bilingual dictionaries in Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa provide one equivalent instead of all equivalents associated with the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> of the source language, especially if Tshivendcombining circumflex accent belowa is the target language. Not providing all equivalents renders a bilingual dictionary inadequate, because users do not always find what they look for.

The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to acquire knowledge about legal matters independent of any text (a cognitive function) - such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may also serve a variety of functions. First, they may have <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in one language and definitions in another language - these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate legal texts, into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce legal texts, usually in a foreign language.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to show the {{usefulness}} of (1) the computer processing of the manifold data of lexicographic works; and (2) the normal and reverse alphabetized concordances compiled on the basis of different texts. 1.

In the course of this work quite a lot of grammatically relevant information rendered by the cca. 60 thousand <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> of the source dictionary was registered, e. g. how many stems the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> consists of; whether it has an affix and where it is; what style it represents, what etymological explanation it is given, and mainly: what important morphological and (with verbs) syntactic characteristics it has, which part of speech i...|$|R
50|$|The reverse word {{dictionary}} is {{a dictionary}} where the <b>word</b> <b>entries</b> {{in the dictionary}} are not alphabetized {{in the same manner}} as a traditional dictionary. For example, A Reverse Dictionary of the Spanish Language and Walker's Rhyming Dictionary are reverse dictionaries, the organization of which is based upon sorting each <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> upon its last letter and the subsequent letters proceeding toward the beginning of that word. Consequently, in these reverse dictionaries all words that have the same suffix appear in order in the dictionary. Such a reverse dictionary would be useful for linguists and poets who might be looking for words ending with a particular suffix, or by an anthropologist or forensics specialist examining a damaged text (e.g. a stone inscription, or a burned document) that had only the final portion of a particular word preserved. Reverse dictionaries of this type have been published for most major alphabetical languages (see numerous examples listed below). By way of contrast, in a standard dictionary words are organized such that words with the same prefix appear in order, since the sorting order is starting with the first letter of the <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> and subsequent letters proceeding toward the end of that word.|$|R

Generally, US-based dictionaries contain pronunciation information for all headwords, while UK-based dictionaries provide pronunciation information only for unusual (e.g., ache) or ambiguously spelled (e.g., bow) words.|$|R

40|$|We have {{recently}} presented {{an approach to}} combine optical lip motion analysis and acoustic voice analysis {{in order to identify}} the people speaking. Due to the independence of the different data sources, a higher reliability of the results in comparison with simple optical lip reading was observed. From this proposal, a system prototype has emerged. This improved setup demonstrated here has shown promising results, with a false recognition rate of 0 per cent for both surnames and <b>entry</b> <b>words</b> on a sample of 101 persons. Rejection rates of 8 per cent and 14 per cent respectively have been observed. For performing the recognition, the person to be identified has to speak a single word, which can either be specific of the person (e. g. surname), or be one identical <b>entry</b> <b>word</b> for all persons. Meanwhile, a field test at the entrance of our Institute has been started, which will last for a few months. In this paper, we demonstrate first results of this field test.
