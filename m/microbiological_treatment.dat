After compaction, to replicate different environmental boundary conditions, some of the samples were cured in a system open to vapour transfer and some were cured in a closed system. The small-strain shear stiffness was periodically tracked with bender elements during the ageing period.

However, during the past decade a significant body of evidence has accumulated that demonstrates that fungi, in particular lignin-degrading or white-rot fungi, have the ability to degrade a wide range {{of hazardous}} organic compounds and thus might also be useful for treatment of materials contaminated with these compounds. White-rot fungi are filamentous wood-decay fungi, primarily Hymenomycetous basidiomycetes but including a few ascomycetes from the order Sphaeriales, that share the ability to metabolize lignin and the polysaccharide components of wood simultaneously (Rayner and Boddy, 1988). These fungi are the major degraders of highly lignified tissues (lignin contents> 20 %) and therefore play a vital role in the recycling of photosynthetically fixed carbon (Kirk, 1983). Decay by these fungi gives wood a bleached appearance, thus the term white-rot.

The chemical composition of these feedstocks was determined. Conversion of wastes to free sugars by acid hydrolysis varied from one treatment to another. In single-stage dilute acid hydrolysis, increasing acid concentration from 1 % (v/v) to 5 % (v/v) decreased the conversion percentage of almost all treated agro-industrial wastes. Lower conversion percentages for some treatments were obtained when increasing the residence time from 90 to 120 min. The two-stage dilute acid hydrolysis by phosphoric acid (1. 0 % v/v) followed by sulphuric acid (1. 0 % v/v) resulted in the highest conversion percentage (41. 3 % w/w) on treated sugar beet waste.

50|$|One {{possibility}} is that the water is sent to a waste management facility to be treated and then recirculated. However, experts have found that sewage treatment does not remove these chemicals completely from drinking supplies. Any type of water that is flushed down the shower, toilet, or sink usually carries with it some sort of EDC. These drains lead to pipes that lead to a waste water management plant. A typical {{waste water treatment plant}} involves a multiple step process of water cleaning but due to the microscopic size of EDC particles, it usually isn't a 100% successful process. For example, Boulder, Colorado Waste Water Management receives water in inceptor pipes, which lead into larger holding pools at the facility. The typical treatment usually lasts between 12 and 24 hours and consists of three main treatment processes. First, physical treatments remove solid and organic materials from the waste water. Then, <b>microbiological</b> <b>treatments</b> follow. Bacteria in these waste tanks feed on carbon and nitrogenous compounds left in the sewage. And finally, the water is treated with ultraviolet blue light to disinfect the remaining water. The effluent water is feed back into local creeks, streams, and freshwater resources.
