5|$|Well-known {{songs from}} the late 1960s and early 1970s {{included}} Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and the 1971 release Matkarakastaja ("Travelling Lover"), which met with criticism. While Vainio's early albums were collections of singles, he recorded his first proper studio album in 1972. The album Viisari värähtää ("The Pointer Twitches") included the song Kaunissaari (a reference to a place in Finland), which Vainio recorded several times during his career. It was also included on his next album, Tulin, näin ja soitin ("I Came, I Saw, I Played"), which was released in 1975. Although Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää were Vainio's earliest published compositions, {{it was not until}} the late 1970s that he began to compose music <b>more</b> <b>actively.</b>|$|E

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, {{creating}} the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E

5|$|In September 1935, {{after seven}} years, Briskin {{resigned}} from Columbia, failing {{to reach an}} agreement with Harry Cohn over stock options. For years, many in the film industry knew that Briskin was responsible for many of the successes at Columbia, even though studio head Harry Cohn was taking the credit. Shortly after, reports began to circulate that he was headed to 20th Century-Fox. Shortly after that report, he was offered a front-office position at MGM, but turned it down because he wanted to be <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> involved in film production, which was followed by a denial from Fox that he was headed to that studio. One of the rumors which circulated was that Briskin was part of a group aligned with Consolidated Film Industries, which was attempting a takeover of Universal. By year's end, Briskin had agreed to a deal with Warner Bros. to produce 12 films, however that deal never reached fruition and Briskin ended up agreeing to a deal with RKO to join the studio as their vice-president in charge of production. The position was newly created especially for Briskin. B. B. Kahane remained as the overall head of RKO Studios, running all aspects other than production, but there was concern that Briskin would have conflict with long-term RKO producer, Pandro S. Berman. Conflict was averted when Berman received a one-year extension on his contract, wherein he had sole authority over his productions, answering only directly to Kahane.|$|E

25|$|The {{terms of}} {{occupation}} in Denmark gave Danish politicians greater influence over internal affairs in Denmark, {{and in particular}} command authority over Danish police forces. Consequently, German occupying authorities {{had to rely on}} German police and military to perform arrests. Where Danish police participated, it was to rescue Jews from Germans. Since the Norwegians resisted the Germans <b>more</b> <b>actively,</b> the country never enjoyed the same civil autonomy as did the Danes during the occupation.|$|E
25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> interact with the dream without thinking about what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E

50|$|The punting {{specialist}} position requires similar {{skills to}} those used in Australian Rules football. Salaries are up to five times higher and the position lends itself to longevity: Australian football players generally retire at around 30, whereas American football punters can play well into their 40s (in fact, {{one of the players}} listed below, Darren Bennett, played 11 seasons in the NFL after leaving behind an Australian rules career when he was nearing 30). Initially Australians sought out American football careers, although now NFL scouts are <b>more</b> often <b>actively</b> seeking punters from Australia.|$|R
40|$|In two {{experiments}} (n = 87 and n = 90), {{we showed}} that strongly identifying members of a low status group are <b>more</b> likely to <b>actively</b> inform the ingroup rather than the outgroup about an outgroup transgression, and consider it as more loyal to the ingroup to do so. Moreover, strongly identifying members of a high status group are <b>more</b> likely to <b>actively</b> inform the outgroup rather than the ingroup about an outgroup transgression, and consider this to be more loyal to the ingroup. The results are {{in support of the}} notion that, depending on a group's existing status position, negative outgroup information can be used to enhance or confirm the ingroup's standing, affecting whether the ingroup or the outgroup will initially be informed about an outgroup transgression.

25|$|Not surprisingly, {{those who}} are high in global human {{identification}} are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> to global concerns, value {{the lives of all}} human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues. They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.|$|E
25|$|Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, Fennoscandia) hunt <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> {{than their}} North American relatives. This {{may be because}} {{competing}} predator populations in Eurasia are not as dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill {{and then try to}} snatch it. They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so changes in wolf populations may affect the population of wolverines. They are also known on occasion to eat plant material.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effect of music therapy on stroke patients when combined with traditional therapy. One study found the incorporation of music with therapeutic upper extremity exercises gave patients more positive emotional effects than exercise alone. In another study, Nayak et al. found that rehabilitation staff rated participants in the music therapy group <b>more</b> <b>actively</b> involved and cooperative in therapy than those in the control group. Their findings gave preliminary support to the efficacy of music therapy as a complementary therapy for social functioning and participation in rehabilitation with a trend toward improvement in mood during acute rehabilitation.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before the}} P-36A entered production, the French Air Force entered {{negotiations}} with Curtiss for delivery of 300 aircraft. The negotiating process {{ended up being}} very drawn-out because {{the cost of the}} Curtiss fighters was double that of the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Bloch MB.150, and the delivery schedule was deemed too slow. Since the USAAC was unhappy with the rate of domestic deliveries and believed that export aircraft would slow things down even <b>more,</b> it <b>actively</b> opposed the sale. Eventually, it took direct intervention from U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt to give the French test pilot [...] a chance to fly the Y1P-36.|$|R
40|$|What can early {{childhood}} music educators learn from recent investigations of brain-based learning {{to guide us}} when teaching movement in our music classes? In the recent past, cognitive scientists substantiated advantages of active, hands-on learning: The human brain learns from the body and remembers <b>more</b> when <b>actively</b> engaged in the learning process. Increased learning ensues because the entire body is interconnected with the brain, which responds to and is stimulated by active engagement.
