5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{early application}} of AR occurred when Rockwell International created video <b>map</b> <b>overlays</b> of satellite and orbital debris tracks {{to aid in}} space observations at Air Force Maui Optical System. In their 1993 paper [...] "Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System" [...] the authors describe the use of <b>map</b> <b>overlays</b> applied to video from space surveillance telescopes. The <b>map</b> <b>overlays</b> indicated the trajectories of various objects in geographic coordinates. This allowed telescope operators to identify satellites, and also to identify - and catalog - potentially dangerous space debris.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} famous Sankey {{diagrams}} is Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It is a flow <b>map,</b> <b>overlaying</b> a Sankey diagram onto a geographical map. It was created in 1869, so it actually predates Sankey's 'first' Sankey diagram of 1898.|$|R
50|$|The single-player {{campaign}} and Realm Quest mode are a narrative game world <b>map</b> <b>overlay</b> linking together {{a series of}} battles culminating in a boss battle with the player(s) pitted against a wizard king unit and a wizard unit. The mode introduces both strategy game and role-playing game elements such as capturing infrastructure, sending units to a target, hiring mercenary units to accompany the wizard unit, and resolving story driven elements.|$|E
50|$|Spatial {{association}} {{is the degree}} to which things are similarly arranged in space. Analysis of the distribution patterns of two phenomena is done by <b>map</b> <b>overlay.</b> If the distributions are similar, then the spatial {{association is}} strong, and vice versa. In a Geographic Information System, the analysis can be done quantitatively. For example, a set of observations (as points or extracted from raster cells) at matching locations can be intersected and examined by regression analysis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Map</b> <b>Overlay</b> and Statistical System (MOSS), is a GIS {{software}} technology. Development of MOSS {{began in}} late 1977 and was first deployed {{for use in}} 1979. MOSS represents a very early public domain, open source GIS development - predating the better known GRASS by 5 years. MOSS utilized a polygon based data structure in which point, line, and polygon features could all be stored in the same file. The user interacted with MOSS via a command line interface.|$|E
40|$|As {{positional}} {{error is}} {{a major issue in}} the assessment of spatial data quality, its propagation has been studied widely in <b>map</b> <b>overlaying.</b> However, few studies deal with a manifest consequence of positional error in <b>map</b> <b>overlaying,</b> namely sliver polygons. Sliver polygons are generally treated as awkward by-products that need to be removed quickly. Nevertheless, as they represent spurious areas, their nature and properties carry useful information, for example, for land use/cover assessment. Therefore, next to sliver removal, {{there is a need for}} intelligent detection and eventually further analysis of sliver polygons. This article proposes a general, semi-automated method for the assessment of slivers in vector polygon layers. A case study in Flanders (Belgium) illustrates a possible application in area estimation evaluation of land use allocation classes...|$|R

The display also has provision for digital geographic <b>map</b> <b>overlay,</b> which allows the target data to be integrated with tactical data for use by ground forces and commanders. Different geographical maps can be overlaid on the radar display. A target position can be marked for further investigation, or combing of the area by ground forces.|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as the}} {{substantial}} tramways referred to above, two much smaller concerns straddled the Flow Moss stations' sites from the 1880s. These can be clearly seen on the 1888 <b>map</b> <b>overlay,</b> running northeast and southeast from sidings immediately east of Glazebury station, with the British Moss Litter Works being prominent. These minor lines, which among other things used Salford's night soil as opposed to Manchester's which was used by their larger neighbours, are described on pages 6 and 7 of The Narrow Gauge Railway Society's magazine [...] "The Narrow Gauge" [...] Volume NG93.|$|E
