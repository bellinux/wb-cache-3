5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
500|$|According to Inglis, [...] "Love You To" [...] is [...] "defined" [...] by {{the interplay}} between sitar and tabla. Bhagwat later {{recalled}} of his involvement: [...] "George told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted and I tuned the tabla with him. He suggested I play something in the Ravi Shankar style, 16-beats, though he agreed that I should improvise. Indian music is all improvisation." [...] After rehearsing the song together many times, Harrison and Bhagwat recorded the sitar and tabla parts onto the vocal and guitar performance taped earlier that day.|$|E

6000|$|... "Something's {{the matter}} with God," [...] he remarked irrelevantly, [...] "to be letting you around loose. It's clean beyond <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> up to, playing such-like tricks on poor humanity. Now if I was God--" ...|$|R
500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time I told him what I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
500|$|Cudi {{commented that}} the way the song was {{recorded}} {{was similar to the}} way prior collaborations between the two were recorded; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas. In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was trying to say, I threw out some words, we rearranged words, and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Donnell has {{remarked that}} he [...] "sat {{with the level}} {{designers}} and 'spotted' the level {{as though it was}} a movie, with the knowledge that the music would have to be malleable rather than static.... he level designer would tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> hoped a player would feel at certain points or after accomplishing certain tasks." [...] Based on this information, O'Donnell would [...] "go back and develop appropriate music cues, then have the designer script the cues into the level, and then we'd play through it to see if it worked as desired." [...] He explained that the use of music in Halo is sparse because he believes that [...] " [...] is best used in a game to quicken the emotional state of the player and it works best when used least," [...] and that [...] " [...] music is constantly playing it tends to become sonic wallpaper and loses its impact when it is needed to truly enhance some dramatic component of game play." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The Italian! Why {{goodness}} <b>me!</b> <b>What's</b> <b>he</b> coming for? I can't {{make you}} out, Alvina. Is that his name, Chicho? I never heard such a name. Doesn't {{sound like a}} name at all to me. There won't be room {{for them in the}} cabs." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....his mood {{changed to}} anger when I {{asked him about}} Gustave Whitehead. He flatly refused to talk about Whitehead, and when I asked him why, he said: 'That SOB never paid <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> owed me. My father had a hauling {{business}} and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to {{where he wanted to}} go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the referee}} during the match between Crystal Palace and Manchester United at Selhurst Park on 25 January 1995, when Eric Cantona of United {{performed}} a kung fu-style two-footed kick towards {{a group of}} spectators {{as he was leaving}} the field following his sending off for deliberately kicking Palace's Richard Shaw four minutes into {{the second half of the}} game. Wilkie at the time had no idea what had gone on, as he was talking to United's Andy Cole at the time: [...] "It was only in the dressing room that one of the assistants told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> (Cantona) had done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keith Morris was the {{photographer}} who took Drake's photo {{for the cover}} of Bryter Layter (1971) and he was commissioned to photograph Drake for the cover of Pink Moon. However, the photos were not used as Drake's rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island's creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around {{the cover of the}} LP: [...] "I remember going to talk to , and he just sat there, hunched up, and even though he didn't speak, I knew the album was called Pink Moon, and I can't remember how he conveyed it, whether he wrote it down... he wanted a pink moon. He couldn't tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted, but I had 'pink moon' to go on." [...] Island picked a piece of surrealist Dali-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake's sister Gabrielle. Although Drake was not outspoken in his opinion on the cover art of Pink Moon, many close to him felt that he approved.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E

To {{hear some of}} you fellers talk, anybody'd {{think he was a}} reg'lar {{rhinoceros}} huntin' 'round to eat folks. Now, it's jest like this: I've got to help that feller, 'cause I promised him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed {{the lawyer}} in an {{affected}} ecstasy. 'Oh, very good, Sir! Oh, very good indeed! Quite eccentric! Dear <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> humour <b>he</b> has!' ...|$|R
