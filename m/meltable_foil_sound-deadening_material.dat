2500|$|The company's late {{innovations}} include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and {{masking tape}} (1925), {{as well as}} cellophane [...] "Scotch Tape" [...] and <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>materials</b> for cars.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{concrete}} under-floors often {{specify a}} 3mm layer of <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> above (is it foam plastic like ethaline - {{something with a}} long-life since it will be expensive to replace).|$|R
50|$|The main {{modification}} {{that separated}} the R3 from the GTi was its double stitch welded chassis, which meant the car was welded twice for increased structural rigidity, aided by the inclusion of front and rear suspension strut braces. The R3 was also stripped of its <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> and driver's airbag, which helped bring the weight down to just 995 kg. Suspension improvements included uprated springs and dampers, thicker anti-roll bars and lower ride height.|$|R
50|$|Acoustic {{earmuffs}}, {{also known}} as ear defenders: cups lined with <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material,</b> like thermal earmuffs and headphones in appearance, which are worn as hearing protection. These may be carried on a head-band or clipped onto the sides of a hard hat, for use on construction sites. Some manufacturers combine headphones with ear defenders, allowing the wearer to listen to music, communication or other audio source and also enjoy protection or isolation from ambient noise. For extra sound attenuation, earplugs {{can also be used}} in conjunction with earmuffs.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 model also {{includes}} less visible mechanical changes. The {{keyless entry system}} was improved. Reinforcements to the body shell improve overall chassis rigidity. The front dampers of the MacPherson strut suspension have been re-tuned to quicken steering response and reduce understeer. The hydraulic dampers of the multi-link rear suspension were also re-tuned to match the front suspension changes. Mazda engineers and designers addressed concerns regarding cabin noise level by redesigning or changing multiple systems and adding <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> to the roof lining and hood panel.|$|R
2500|$|The Z06X was {{designed}} to be a factory built road race car similar to cars like the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup and Dodge Viper ACR-X. [...] The concept car was built by GM with the help of Pratt & Miller Engineering. [...] The Z06X features racecar components such as: carbon fiber adjustable rear wing, carbon fiber front splitter, full roll cage, fire suppression system, race seat, harness, carbon ceramic brakes, upgraded cooling system, polycarbonate rear window, adjustable coilovers, adjustable sway bars, and tow hooks; the radio, interior carpeting and <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>materials</b> have been removed. [...] The suspension system {{was designed}} and supplied by Pfadt Race Engineering.|$|R
500|$|Another {{subwoofer}} {{claimed to}} be the world's biggest is a custom installation in Italy made by Royal Device primarily of bricks, concrete and <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> consisting of two subwoofers embedded in the foundation of a listening room. The horn-loaded subwoofers each have a floor mouth that is , and a horn length that is , in a cavity [...] under the floor of the listening room. Each subwoofer is driven by eight 18-inch subwoofer drivers with [...] voice coils. The designers assert that the floor mouths of the horns are additionally loaded acoustically by a vertical wooden horn expansion and the room's ceiling to create a 10Hz [...] "full power" [...] wave at the listening position.|$|R
50|$|The seventh {{generation}} codenamed G30 {{was unveiled}} on 13 October 2016. Improvements {{over the previous}} model include weight savings of up to 100 kg and a new design with a drag coefficient of 0.22 Cd. Other improvements include an updated BMW iDrive system that now uses a high-resolution 10.25-inch display, a new head-up display that covers 70% more area as well as selective anti-dazzle high beam headlights {{with a range of}} up to 500 metres. The seventh-gen 5 Series has 7-Series like gesture control, iDrive 6.0 infotainment unit, voice control, and head-up display, and new multi-contour massage seats. BMW claims that the cabin is quieter than ever thanks to extensive use of <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{subwoofer}} {{claimed to}} be the world's biggest is a custom installation in Italy made by Royal Device primarily of bricks, concrete and <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> consisting of two subwoofers embedded in the foundation of a listening room. The horn-loaded subwoofers each have a floor mouth that is 2.2 m2, and a horn length that is 9.5 m, in a cavity 1 m under the floor of the listening room. Each subwoofer is driven by eight 18-inch subwoofer drivers with 100 mm voice coils. The designers assert that the floor mouths of the horns are additionally loaded acoustically by a vertical wooden horn expansion and the room's ceiling to create a 10 Hz [...] "full power" [...] wave at the listening position.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, General Motors' Chevrolet {{division}} produced 57 full-size Impala coupes {{equipped with}} option package RPOZ-11, which added $1237.40 {{to the vehicle}} base price. They were the only automobiles the division ever built expressly for drag racing. The package included a specially modified W series 409 engine, now displacing 427 cubic inches, and was officially rated at [...] With a compression ratio of 13.5:1, the engine required high-octane fuel. The RPOZ-11 package had numerous modifications to reduce weight, including aluminum hood, fenders, fan shroud, and bumpers. <b>Sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> was removed, as were non-essentials such as heater and radio. Other racing features included a two-piece intake manifold, special exhaust manifolds, cylinder heads and pistons, a deep-sump oil pan, and cowl-induction air cleaner. The RPOZ-11 package was discontinued when General Motors ceased involvement in racing in 1964.|$|R
5000|$|The more {{sporting}} VX 4/90 was re-introduced, now {{based on}} the VX (formerly Victor FE), in March 1977 with a 5-speed close-ratio Getrag gearbox, initially for mainland European export markets only. The car featured a modified, twin-carburettor version of the existing 2279 cc four-cylinder engine for which an output of [...] was claimed, up from [...] in the VX 2300, and a prototype fuel-injected variant was tested but not put into production. The car was fitted with halogen headlights and supplementary fog-lights fitted beneath the front bumper, and also benefitted from extra <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>materials</b> to reduce road noise. The side window frames were fashionably blackened, and only four exterior colours could be specified, of which three were metallic. The manufacturer stated that the UK market would receive right-hand-drive versions of this latest incarnation of the VX 4/90 only in 1978. In 1978 the Vauxhall Carlton (was released as a direct replacement for the VX1800/2300, production of which ended in the same year. [...] The Carlton was {{based on the}} corresponding Opel Rekord E, and unlike the Victor FE/VX, was much closer in its engineering and body structure to its Opel sister - mirroring the process of [...] "Opelisation" [...] of the Vauxhall range that was going on at the time.|$|R
2500|$|Partway {{through this}} year and in limited quantities, a new 427 {{replaced}} the 406 for racing applications. It was intended to meet NHRA and NASCAR 7-liter maximum engine size rules. This engine was rated at a [...] with 2 x 4 barrel Holley carburetors and a solid lifter camshaft. Ford also made available aluminum cylinder heads as a dealer option. The 1963Â½ was still overweight, however. To be competitive in drag racing Ford produced 212 (around 170 from Ford Norfolk, about 20 from Ford Los Angeles) lightweight versions of the [...] "R" [...] code 427, in the Galaxie 500 Sport Special Tudor Fastback. Available only in Corinthian White with red vinyl interior, and with a list price of about US$4,200 (when a base Ford 300 went for US$2,324, and XL Fastback was US$3,268), these cars came stock with Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed, 4.11:1 rear axle, heavy-duty suspension and brakes, and were fitted with a fiberglass hood (a flat piece at first, late in 1963 the popular blister hood also used on the Thunderbolt), trunk, front fenders, and fender aprons, as well as aluminum bumpers and mounting brackets, transmission cases, and bellhousing. Hood springs, heater, trunk lining and mat, spare wheel and tire (and mounting bracket), trunk lid torsion bar, jack, lug wrench, one horn (of the stock two), armrests, rear ashtrays, courtesy lights, and dome light were removed to reduce weight. The first 20 cars had functional fiberglass doors, which shaved these were deleted because of Ford's concern for safety if used on the highway. The cars had all <b>sound-deadening</b> <b>material</b> removed, lightweight seats and floormats, and no options. They were not factory equipped with cold-air induction, as the Thunderbolt would be. In addition, they were built on the -lighter Ford 300 chassis, originally intended for a smaller-displacement V8. In all, the 427s were [...] lighter than before ( [...] with the fiberglass doors).|$|R
