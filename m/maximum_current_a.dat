40|$|Low-temperature {{measurements}} of asymmetric carbon nanotube (CNT) quantum dots are reported. The CNTs are end-contacted with one ferromagnetic and one normal-metal electrode. The measurements show a spin-dependent rectification {{of the current}} caused by the asymmetry of the device. This rectification occurs for gate voltages for which the normal-metal lead is resonant {{with a level of}} the quantum dot. At the gate voltages at which the current is at the <b>maximum</b> <b>current,</b> <b>a</b> significant decrease in the current shot noise is observed...|$|E

50|$|In {{engineering}} applications, it {{is often}} most convenient to describe a wire {{in terms of its}} cross-section area, rather than its diameter, because the cross section is directly proportional to its strength and weight, and inversely proportional to its resistance. The cross-sectional area is also related to the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> that <b>a</b> wire can carry safely.|$|R

40|$|Power gating is {{emerging}} as a viable solution to reduction of leakage current. However, power gated circuits {{are different from the}} conventional designs in the sense that a power-gated circuit must be brought to a valid state from the power-off state, when all nodes in the circuit are at logic zero state, before useful computation can begin. Thus, estimation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> in <b>a</b> power gated circuit must determine the maximum of all possible power-up and normal switching current. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based ATPG algorithm to estimate the <b>maximum</b> power-up <b>current</b> for combinational circuits. Our method achieves substantial improvement over simulation-based methods and also over the previously proposed ATPG-based methods. Further, we also formulate the sequential circuit <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> problem as <b>a</b> combinational ATPG problem, and solve it using the cluster-based estimation algorithm. Experimental results show that the <b>maximum</b> power-up <b>current</b> for sequential circuits can be up to 73 % larger than the <b>maximum</b> normal switching <b>current.</b> 1...|$|R

Specific defect interactions (enhancement and screening effects) are emphasized. We discuss the analogies for the rupture problem between resistor networks and mechanical systems...|$|R
50|$|Revision 1.2 of the {{specification}} {{was released}} in 2010. Several changes are made and limits are increased including allowing 1.5 A on charging downstream ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having <b>a</b> <b>current</b> up to 1.5 A, and allowing <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> of 5 <b>A.</b> Also, support is removed for charging port detection via resistive mechanisms.|$|R
30|$|If {{a person}} {{short-circuited}} the secondary tract, {{he would be}} shocked until the current interrupter or fuse tripped, or somebody switched off the system. According to Table  3, currents normally used for diagnostic systems would often be larger than the fibrillation thresholds shown in Tables  1 and 2. Also, smaller systems—designed for <b>maximum</b> <b>currents</b> of <b>a</b> few tens of mA—might have easily exceeded these thresholds when short-circuited [37]. The transformer current could be limited when a person came in series with a Coolidge tube or a hot cathode rectifying valve. In the first case, the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> was {{equal to that of}} the X-ray tube, in the second case the current would be likely slightly larger than the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> the system could deliver under normal circumstances.|$|R
50|$|This is {{an active}} {{connection}} of the EV to a fixed EVSE, 600 V DC including earth and control pilot, at <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> of 400 <b>A.</b> The DC charging power is rectified from AC mains power in the EVSE, which is consequently more expensive than a mode 3 EVSE.|$|R
50|$|Tubes are {{essentially}} obsolete for most applications, while the transistors and thyristors have significant limitations including that they cannot simultaneously control the maximum voltage, the effective voltage, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> of <b>a</b> non-linear load in a Direct AC (rectified but unfiltered) supply circuit. The benistor overcomes these shortcomings because, unlike the transistor and thyristor, it has separate control terminals for simultaneously managing {{the amount of}} <b>current,</b> <b>maximum</b> voltage, and effective voltage in an AC generator-load circuit, by means of either linear switching and/or self-switching mode of operations.|$|R

5000|$|Amplifying devices {{may also}} have limits on their inputs, for example the <b>maximum</b> base <b>current</b> <b>a</b> bipolar {{transistor}} can take, and a vacuum tube may have problems with grid current if the input signal becomes too positive. These factors can distort (clip) the input signal, if {{it comes from a}} high enough impedance source, or destroy the device (and so the designer will probably employ other limiting circuits; see below).|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the normal material in a supercon-ducting wire on the selffield losses has been investi-gated. The {{results show that the}} contribution of the normal material is considerable {{in the case of a}} highly conductive material like Cu. Measurements on wires with CuNi-material show no significant contribution of the normal material to the losses. In the latter case, how-ever, special attention should be paid to stability. Measurements show that the obtainable <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> under <b>a.</b> c. conditions obeys the adiabatic stability criterion rather well. The dependence of the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> amplitude on the critical current density and the diameter of the wire has been obtained.

40|$|Abstract>> Four {{types of}} {{electrolyte}} were {{tested for the}} application as an electrolyte in the Zn-Br redox flow battery. Electrolyte was consist of ZnBr 2 (electrolyte number 1), ZnBr 2 +KCl (electrolyte number 2), ZnBr 2 +KCl+NH 4 Br (electrolyte number 3) and ZnBr 2 +KCl+EMPBr(C 7 H 16 BF 4 N) (electrolyte number 4). The each electrolyte property was measured by CV (cyclic voltammetry) method. The different between the potential of anodic and cathodic <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> density in <b>a</b> CV experiment (△EP) was 0. 89 V, 0. 89 V, 1. 06 V and 0. 61 V for the electrolyte number 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The electrolyte involved KCl increased conductivity which was appeared by anodic and cathodic <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> density in <b>a</b> CV experiment. It was estimated that the electrolyte of number 3 (ZnBr 2 +KCl+NH 4 Br) and number 4 (ZnBr 2 +KCl+EMPBr) could be suitable as an electrolyte in the Zn-Br redox flow battery with non-appeared bubble, non-Br formation and high anodic-cathodic <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> density...|$|R

50|$|NiCd {{batteries}} {{usually have}} a metal case with a sealing plate equipped with a self-sealing safety valve. The positive and negative electrode plates, isolated from each other by the separator, are rolled in a spiral shape inside the case. This {{is known as the}} jelly-roll design and allows a Ni-Cd cell to deliver <b>a</b> much higher <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> than <b>an</b> equivalent size alkaline cell. Alkaline cells have a bobbin construction where the cell casing is filled with electrolyte and contains a graphite rod which acts as the positive electrode. As a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte (as opposed to the jelly-roll design), the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> that can be delivered.|$|R
50|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> during <b>a</b> {{discharge}} {{that the}} generator delivers {{can also be}} controlled. Because other sorts of generators may also be used by different machine builders, the parameters that may actually be set on a particular machine {{will depend on the}} generator manufacturer. The details of the generators and control systems on their machines are not always easily available to their user. This is a barrier to describing unequivocally the technological parameters of the EDM process. Moreover, the parameters affecting the phenomena occurring between tool and electrode are also related to the controller of the motion of the electrodes.|$|R

5000|$|Q1 is {{the pass}} or output transistor. Rsens is the load current sensing device. Q2 is the {{protection}} transistor which turns on {{as soon as}} the voltage across Rsens becomes about 0.65 V. This voltage is determined by the value of Rsens and the load current through it (Iload). When Q2 turns on, it removes base current from Q1 thereby reducing the collector current of Q1. which is very nearly the load current. Thus, Rsens fixes the <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> to <b>a</b> value given by 0.65/Rsens. For example, if Rsens = 0.33 Ω, the current is limited to about 2 A even if Rload becomes a short (and Vo becomes zero).|$|R
