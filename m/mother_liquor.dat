25|$|Freeze {{distillation}} is {{an analogous}} method of purification using freezing instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a recrystallization where {{the product is}} the <b>mother</b> <b>liquor,</b> and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process {{is used in the}} production of ice beer and ice wine to increase ethanol and sugar content, respectively. It is also used to produce applejack. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. However, reducing methanol with the absorption of 4A molecular sieve is a practical method for production. Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.|$|E
500|$|The crystal {{is mounted}} for {{measurements}} {{so that it}} may be held in the X-ray beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. In the past, crystals were loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution (the <b>mother</b> <b>liquor).</b> [...] Nowadays, crystals of small molecules are typically attached with oil or glue to a glass fiber or a loop, which is made of nylon or plastic and attached to a solid rod. [...] Protein crystals are scooped up by a loop, then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. This freezing reduces the radiation damage of the X-rays, as well as the noise in the Bragg peaks due to thermal motion (the Debye-Waller effect). However, untreated protein crystals often crack if flash-frozen; therefore, they are generally pre-soaked in a cryoprotectant solution before freezing. Unfortunately, this pre-soak may itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally, successful cryo-conditions are identified by trial and error.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{crystallization}} of a diastereomeric salt {{during the}} optical resolution of a synthesized intermediate led to crystals showing poor filterability. With {{a view to}} decrease {{the duration of the}} filtration step, linear cooling profiles, including a preliminary stabilization step, and non-linear cooling profiles (quoted as controlled type) are tested.

40|$|A {{meaningful}} {{solubility product}} of a zeolite should remain constant as composition of zeolite <b>mother</b> <b>liquors</b> varies at a given temperature.

40|$|The {{results on}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of highly monodisperse Fe-doped ZnO nanocrystals are presented. Stable suspensions of these materials were produced in an ethanol solution at room temperature. To promote crystal growth, the suspensions of nanocrystals were aged in contact with their <b>mother</b> <b>liquors.</b> X-ray diffraction characterization of doped systems at various Fe-atomic fractions x confirmed the exclusive formation of the host ZnO with the wurtzite structure. High resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses of the suspensions revealed the high monodispersity and crystallinity of the 6 ? 8 nm nanocrystals. Ultraviolet-visible measurements confirmed not only the nanocrystalline nature of the samples but also evidenced the continuous growth of the crystals when aged in their <b>mother</b> <b>liquors.</b> Room-temperature magnetic measurements indicated that the ferromagnetic behavior of doped ZnO was dependent on composition and crystal size of produced nanocrystals.

50|$|The {{appearance}} and size {{range of a}} crystalline product is extremely important in crystallization. If further processing of the crystals is desired, large crystals with uniform size are important for washing, filtering, transportation, and storage, because large crystals are easier to filter out of a solution than small crystals. Also, larger crystals have a smaller surface area to volume ratio, leading to a higher purity. This higher purity is due to less retention of <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> which contains impurities, and a smaller loss of yield when the crystals are washed to remove the <b>mother</b> <b>liquor.</b> The theoretical crystal size distribution can be estimated {{as a function of}} operating conditions with a fairly complicated mathematical process called population balance theory (using population balance equations).|$|E
