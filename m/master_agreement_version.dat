50|$|There are two <b>versions</b> of the <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement,</b> {{the local}} <b>version</b> for {{transactions}} between parties {{located in the}} same jurisdiction who are transacting in only one currency, and the multicurrency version for use when parties are located in different jurisdictions transacting in different currencies. The provisions included in the multicurrency version {{but not in the}} local currency version concern issues such as taxes, currency of payment, the use of multiple offices to enter into transactions, and the designation of an agent for service of process.|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> is {{the central}} {{document}} around which {{the rest of the}} ISDA documentation structure is built. The preprinted <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> is never altered except to insert the names of the parties, but is customised through use of the schedule to the <b>master</b> <b>agreement,</b> a document containing elections, additions and amendments to the <b>master</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|R

50|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of the ISDA <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> is that the <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> and all the Confirmations entered into under it form a single agreement. This is very important (especially for regulated financial companies) as it allows the parties to an ISDA <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> to aggregate the amounts owing by each of them under all of the Transactions outstanding under that ISDA <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> and replace them with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. Netting, dealt with under section 2(c) of the ISDA <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement,</b> allows the parties to net out amounts payable on the same day and in the same currency.|$|R

50|$|The ISDA <b>MASTER</b> <b>AGREEMENT</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used <b>master</b> service <b>agreement</b> for OTC derivatives transactions internationally. It is part of a framework of documents, designed to enable OTC derivatives to be documented fully and flexibly. The framework consists of a <b>master</b> <b>agreement,</b> a schedule, confirmations, definition booklets, and credit support documentation. The ISDA <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{provides}} the parties two {{means by which}} the <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> and all transactions thereunder may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events. The first is the occurrence of an event of default, which permits a party to terminate the <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> and liquidate all transactions if the other party is affected by an Event of Default. In contrast, Termination Events may affect both parties, are usually the result of the actions of third parties, and may provide the affected party a grace period to cure the Termination Event before the other party may terminate and liquidate the <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> {{is quite}} lengthy, and the {{negotiation}} {{process can be}} burdensome, but once a <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> is signed, the documentation of future transactions between parties is reduced to a brief confirmation of the material terms of the transaction.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} schedule, the <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> sets forth {{all of the}} general terms and {{conditions}} necessary to properly allocate the risks of the transactions between the parties but does not contain any commercial terms specific to a particular transaction. Once the <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> is executed, the parties can enter into numerous transactions by agreeing to the material commercial terms over the telephone as evidenced by a written confirmation without any need to revisit the underlying terms contained in the <b>master</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> allows {{parties to}} {{calculate}} their financial exposure under OTC transactions on a net basis, i.e. a party calculates {{the difference between}} what it owes to a counterparty under a <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> and what the counterparty owes it under the same agreement.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, ISDA {{produced}} three documents: (i) {{a standard}} form <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> for U.S. dollar interest-rate swaps; (ii) a standard form <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> for multi-currency interest-rate and currency swaps (collectively {{known as the}} [...] "1987 ISDA Master Agreement"); and (iii) the interest rate and currency definitions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> is a {{document}} agreed between two parties that sets out standard terms {{that apply to}} all the transactions entered into between those parties. Each time that a transaction is entered into, {{the terms of the}} <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> {{do not need to be}} re-negotiated and apply automatically.|$|R
50|$|A <b>master</b> service <b>agreement</b> is a {{contract}} reached between parties, {{in which the}} parties agree {{to most of the}} terms that will govern future transactions or future <b>agreements.</b> A <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> permits the parties to quickly negotiate future transactions or agreements, because they can rely on the terms of the <b>master</b> <b>agreement,</b> so that the same terms need not be repetitively negotiated, and to negotiate only the deal-specific terms.|$|R

50|$|Master {{contracts}} {{can also}} be used strategically for other ends such as organizing and to break down employer resistance to collective bargaining. In Canada, unions have used master contracts to organize thousands of new workers. A <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> has tended to weaken an employer's resistance to the spread of the union to unorganized worksites or divisions, and some industries and markets welcome the standardization of pay and fringe benefits that unionization brings. In the United States, some unions have sought to create <b>master</b> <b>agreements</b> which provide for a neutrality agreement, code of conduct for the organizing election, or neutral third-party oversight of an election in order to make union organizing easier. Some <b>master</b> <b>agreements</b> even state that new workers will automatically come under the <b>master</b> <b>agreement.</b> <b>Master</b> bargaining also reduces the likelihood that employers will refuse to bargain or seek to whittle away at unionization workplace by workplace.|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> also aids in {{reducing}} disputes by providing extensive resources defining its terms and explaining {{the intent of}} the contract, thereby preventing disputes from beginning as well as providing a neutral resource to interpret standard contractual terms. Finally, the <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> greatly aids in risk and credit management for the parties.|$|R
5000|$|The above only applies in {{relation}} to the 1992 <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The 2002 <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> did away with First and Second method. In practice First Method was very rarely opted for because its use required the relevant financial institutions to report their gross, rather than net, exposure under the <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The 2002 <b>Master</b> <b>Agreement</b> also replaced the distinction between Market Quotation and Loss with a single concept, [...] "Close-out Amount". This is determined in respect of each Terminated Transaction and is, broadly, the profit or loss which would be made in incurred on entering into an equivalent Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. The aggregate of the Close-out Amounts and Unpaid Amounts {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Early Termination Amount". This is the net amount payable by one party to the other in respect of the Terminated Transactions.|$|R

The discretionary improvements may exceed City standards or comprise new features, provided the improvements are located in the immediate vicinity of underground stations or along the at-grade sections of the transit corridors.

The initiative, a joint venture between the campus libraries, the University’s System Office of Contracts Administration, and the Purchasing Department, started with one basic <b>master</b> <b>agreement</b> and quickly expanded to over 115 signed documents. The agreements cover the vast majority of library electronic and media resource vendors and have reduced contract volume by more than half. When <b>master</b> <b>agreements</b> are in place, terms and conditions no longer sit awaiting review and approval for multiple weeks or months, which virtually eliminates the danger of access to library resources being shut off.
