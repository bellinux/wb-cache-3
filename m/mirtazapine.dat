5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications {{similar to those used}} in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and <b>mirtazapine</b> have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|E
5|$|The coroner {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including Clonazepam, <b>Mirtazapine,</b> Atomoxetine, and Amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. <b>Mirtazapine</b> (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> is a 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 antagonist. <b>Mirtazapine</b> {{also has}} an {{antagonistic}} effect on H1 histamine receptors. Because of its wide spectrum of serotonergic receptor inhibition, <b>Mirtazapine</b> exhibits an agonistic effect on 5-HT1A receptors by funneling more serotonin to them. <b>Mirtazapine</b> is used as an antidepressant in patients dealing with insomnia and weight loss.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> {{does not}} have serotonergic {{activity}} and does not cause serotonergic side effects or serotonin syndrome. This is {{in accordance with the}} fact that it is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or MAOI, nor a serotonin receptor agonist. There are no reports of serotonin syndrome in association with <b>mirtazapine</b> alone, and <b>mirtazapine</b> has not been found to cause serotonin syndrome in overdose. However, there are a handful of case reports of serotonin syndrome occurring with <b>mirtazapine</b> in combination with serotonergic drugs like SSRIs, although such reports are unusual, very rare, and do not necessarily implicate <b>mirtazapine</b> as causative. The addition of <b>mirtazapine</b> to an MAOI does not cause serotonin syndrome, and has been considered to be a safe combination. Moreover, <b>mirtazapine</b> may actually be useful in the treatment of serotonin syndrome, with at least one publication finding it to be effective in resolving the syndrome. This is in accordance with the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor is the predominant serotonin receptor thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome (with the 5-HT1A receptor seeming to be protective). <b>Mirtazapine</b> is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine, a drug that shares this property, mediates recovery from serotonin syndrome and is well-established clinically as an antidote against it.|$|E
25|$|A {{case report}} {{described}} <b>mirtazapine</b> as inducing hypertension in a clonidine-treated patient, {{likely due to}} occupancy of α2-adrenergic receptors by <b>mirtazapine</b> limiting the efficacy of concurrent clonidine therapy.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{reported}} fatalities {{have been}} attributed to <b>mirtazapine</b> overdose. The fatal toxicity index (deaths per million prescriptions) for <b>mirtazapine</b> is 3.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 17.2). This is similar to that observed with SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent {{use with}} inhibitors or {{inducers}} of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and/or CYP3A4 {{can result in}} altered concentrations of <b>mirtazapine,</b> as these are the main enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As examples, fluoxetine and paroxetine, inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase <b>mirtazapine</b> levels, while carbamazepine, an inducer, considerably decreases them. Liver and moderate renal impairment {{have been reported to}} decrease the oral clearance of <b>mirtazapine</b> by about 30%; severe renal impairment decreases it by 50%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; {{mianserin}} {{was developed}} by the same team of organic chemists and <b>mirtazapine</b> differs from it via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine.|$|E
25|$|Analogues of <b>mirtazapine</b> include mianserin, setiptiline, and aptazapine.|$|E
25|$|A four-step {{chemical}} synthesis of <b>mirtazapine</b> has been published.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> has antihistamine, α2-blocker, and antiserotonergic activity. It is {{specifically}} a potent antagonist or inverse agonist of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, and the histamine H1 receptor. Unlike many other antidepressants, {{it does not}} inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidase. Similarly, <b>mirtazapine</b> has weak or no activity as an anticholinergic or blocker of sodium or calcium channels, in contrast to most TCAs. In accordance, it has better tolerability and low toxicity in overdose. As an H1 receptor antagonist, <b>mirtazapine</b> is extremely potent, and {{is in fact the}} most potent of all the TCAs and TeCAs. Antagonism of the H1 receptor is by far the strongest activity of <b>mirtazapine,</b> with the drug acting as a selective H1 receptor antagonist at low concentrations.|$|E
25|$|With {{depression}} in dementia, {{there is no}} benefit compared to either placebo or <b>mirtazapine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> {{and other}} {{antidepressants}} may cause a discontinuation syndrome upon cessation. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize discontinuation symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with <b>mirtazapine</b> may include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like {{symptoms such as}} allergies and pruritus, headaches and sometimes hypomania or mania.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Remeron among others, is an {{atypical}} antidepressant which is used primarily {{in the treatment of}} depression. In addition to its antidepressant properties, <b>mirtazapine</b> has anxiolytic, sedative, antiemetic, and appetite stimulant effects and is sometimes used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, and to produce weight gain when desirable. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparative}} {{meta-analysis of}} 12 major antidepressants found that venlafaxine, <b>mirtazapine,</b> escitalopram, and sertraline {{were significantly more}} efficacious than duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. A combination of venlafaxine and <b>mirtazapine</b> achieved remission rates (defined as a HAM-D score of 7 or less) of 58% in one controlled trial. In combination with an antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole, better results in treatment resistant depression in older adults have been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> is {{considered}} to be relatively safe {{in the event of an}} overdose, although it {{is considered}} slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the SSRIs (except citalopram). Unlike the TCAs, <b>mirtazapine</b> showed no significant cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose. Case reports of overdose with as much as 30 to 50 times the standard dose described the drug as relatively nontoxic, compared to TCAs.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{has been}} shown {{clinically}} to reduce the clearance of <b>mirtazapine,</b> imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, nortriptyline, gabapentin, and desipramine in humans.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{case reports}} have been {{reported}} in five papers on the use of <b>mirtazapine</b> in the treatment of hives as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|In general, all antidepressants, {{including}} <b>mirtazapine,</b> require {{at least}} a week for their therapeutic benefits on depressive and anxious symptoms to become apparent.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor, {{an action}} <b>mirtazapine</b> shares with the {{approved}} antiemetic ondansetron, significantly improves pre-existing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} in afflicted individuals. <b>Mirtazapine</b> {{may be used as}} an inexpensive antiemetic alternative to ondansetron. Blockade of the 5-HT3 receptors has also shown to improve anxiety and to be effective in the treatment of drug addiction in several studies. receptors | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–202 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2203069 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(90)90086-H }} In conjunction with substance abuse counseling, <b>mirtazapine</b> has been investigated for the purpose of reducing methamphetamine use in dependent individuals with success. In contrast to <b>mirtazapine,</b> the SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, and some TCAs increase the general activity of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors leading to a host of negative changes and side effects, the most prominent of which including anorexia, insomnia, sexual dysfunction (loss of libido and anorgasmia), nausea, and diarrhea, among others. As a result, it is often combined with these drugs to reduce their side-effect profile and to produce a stronger antidepressant effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{case report}} {{published}} in 2000 noted an {{instance in which}} <b>mirtazapine</b> counteracted the action of clonidine, causing a dangerous rise in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{clinically}} relevant, <b>mirtazapine</b> {{has been}} found to act as a partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor at high concentrations (EC50 = 7.2μM).|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> is a {{very strong}} H1 {{receptor}} inverse agonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15mg dose of <b>mirtazapine</b> to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to desensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in afflicted individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, <b>mirtazapine</b> has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> was {{developed}} by Organon International in the Netherlands and {{was introduced in the}} United States in 1996. Its patent expired in 2004, so generic versions are available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> is {{sometimes}} prescribed as an appetite stimulant for cats or dogs experiencing anorexia due to medical {{conditions such as}} chronic kidney disease. It is especially useful for treating combined poor appetite and nausea in cats and dogs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} at Organon {{and published in}} 1989, was first approved for use in major depressive disorder in the Netherlands in 1994, and {{was introduced in the}} United States in 1996 under the brand name Remeron.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{clinical}} trials demonstrated that sertraline {{is similar in}} efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and <b>mirtazapine.</b> There is low quality evidence that sertraline is more efficacious {{for the treatment of}} depression than fluoxetine.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 Cochrane {{review that}} {{compared}} <b>mirtazapine</b> to other antidepressants, {{found that while}} {{it appears to have}} a faster onset in people for whom it works (measured at 2 weeks), it is about the same as other antidepressants at 6 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Because {{insomnia}} is {{a common}} symptom of depression, antidepressants are effective for treating sleep problems {{whether or not they}} are associated with depression. While all antidepressants help regulate sleep, some antidepressants such as amitriptyline, doxepin, <b>mirtazapine,</b> and trazodone can have an immediate sedative effect, and are prescribed to treat insomnia. Amitriptyline and doxepin both have antihistaminergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties, which contribute to both their therapeutic effects and side effect profiles, while mirtazapine's side effects are primarily antihistaminergic, and trazodone's side-effects are primarily antiadrenergic. <b>Mirtazapine</b> is known to decrease sleep latency (i.e., the time it takes to fall asleep), promoting sleep efficiency and increasing the total amount of sleeping time in people with both depression and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mirtazapine</b> is marketed under many {{brand names}} worldwide, {{including}} Adco-Mirteron, Afloyan, Amirel, Arintapin Smelt, Avanza, Azapin, Beron, Bilanz, Calixta, Ciblex, Combar, Comenter, Depreram, Divaril, Esprital, Maz, Menelat, Mepirzapine, Merdaten, Meronin, Mi Er Ning, Milivin, Minelza, Minivane, Mirastad, Mirazep, Miro, Miron, Mirrador, Mirt, Mirta, Mirtabene, Mirtadepi, Mirtagamma, Mirtagen, Mirtalan, Mirtamor, Mirtamylan, Mirtan, Mirtaneo, Mirtapax, Mirtapil, Mirtapine, Mirtaron, Mirtastad, Mirtax, Mirtaz, Mirtazap, Mirtazapin, Mirtazapina, <b>Mirtazapine,</b> Mirtazapinum, Mirtazelon, Mirtazon, Mirtazonal, Mirtel, Mirtimash, Mirtin, Mirtine, Mirzapine, Mirzaten, Mirzest, Mitaprex, Mitaxind, Mitocent, Mitrazin, Mizapin, Motofen, Mytra, Norset, Noxibel, Pharmataz, Promyrtil, Ramure, Redepra, Reflex, Remergil, Remergon, Remeron, Remirta, Rexer, Saxib, Sinmaron, Smilon, Tazepin, Tazimed, Tetrazic, Tifona, U-Mirtaron, U-zepine, Valdren, Vastat, Velorin, Yarocen, Zania, Zapex, Zestat, Zismirt, Zispin, Zuleptan, and Zulin.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{appetite}} or weight {{are common}} among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and {{are related to}} which neurotransmitters they affect. <b>Mirtazapine</b> and paroxetine, for example, {{have the effect of}} weight gain and/or increased appetite, while others (such as bupropion and venlafaxine) achieve the opposite effect.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{statistical}} or meaningful clinical differences in remission rates, response rates, or times to remission or response among {{any of the}} medications compared in this study. These included bupropion sustained release, bupropion, citalopram, lithium, <b>mirtazapine,</b> nortriptyline, sertraline, triiodothyronine, tranylcypromine, and venlafaxine extended release.|$|E
25|$|The (S)-(+) {{enantiomer}} of <b>mirtazapine</b> {{is responsible}} for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (R)-(–) enantiomer {{is responsible for}} antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and α2-adrenergic receptors, although the (S)-(+) enantiomer is the stronger antihistamine.|$|E
25|$|In general, some antidepressants, {{especially}} SSRIs, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples' {{depression or}} anxiety or cause suicidal ideation. Despite its sedating action, <b>mirtazapine</b> is also {{believed to be}} capable of this, so in the United States and certain other countries, it carries a black box label warning of these potential effects.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as {{venlafaxine}} {{have shown}} similar effectiveness to the SSRIs. In Japan, Milnacipran {{is used in}} the treatment of Taijin kyofusho, a Japanese variant of social anxiety disorder. The atypical antidepressants <b>mirtazapine</b> and bupropion have been studied for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, and rendered mixed results.|$|E
