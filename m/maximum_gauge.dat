Positive bias for a p-type device (negative for an n-type) partially depleted the NWs forming a pinch-off region, which resembled a funnel through which the electrical current squeezed.

30|$|Fitting a {{polynomial}} through fluctuations {{during the}} tsunami has smaller effects on tsunami amplitudes {{later in the}} morning of November 28. These effects result from a half-hour delay, in the Alternative Tide, of the first high tide after the earthquake. This is the higher high water, at 0637 IST in the Admiralty tide tables, that Pendse (1946, 1948) used to estimate that the tsunami, around 0800 IST, crested nearly 1.5  m above ambient tide. The Accepted Tide hastening this high water slightly to 0631 IST. It is delayed until about 0705 IST in the Alternative Tide, because of curve-fitting to the positive waves between 0500 IST and 0900 IST.

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} a facile "paint-on" approach to fabricate highly stretchable and highly sensitive strain sensors by combining one-dimensional copper nanowire networks with two-dimensional graphite microflakes. This paint-on approach {{allows for the}} fabrication of electronic skin (e-skin) patches which can directly replicate with high fidelity the human skin surface they are on, regardless of the topological complexity. This leads to high accuracy for detecting biometric signals for applications in personalised wearable sensors. The copper nanowires contribute to high stretchability and the graphite flakes offer high sensitivity, and their hybrid coating offers the advantages of both. To understand the topological effects on the sensing performance, we utilized fractal shaped elastomeric substrates and systematically compared their stretchability and sensitivity. We could achieve a high stretchability of up to 600 % and a <b>maximum</b> <b>gauge</b> factor of 3000. Our simple yet efficient paint-on approach enabled facile fine-tuning of sensitivity/stretchability simply by adjusting ratios of 1 D vs. 2 D materials in the hybrid coating, and the topological structural designs.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the switch panel design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the switch panel has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different wheel profiles). The optimum design includes a 12 mm <b>maximum</b> <b>gauge</b> widening. Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the crossing nose and wing rails. The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn wheel profiles in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. elastic rail pads), this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, core-reinforced braided {{composite}} rods (BCRs) were developed and characterized for strain sensing capability. A mixture of carbon and glass fibre {{was used in}} the core, which was surrounded by a braided cover of polyester fibres. Three compositions of core with different carbon fibre/glass fibre weight ratios (23 / 77, 47 / 53, and 100 / 0) were studied to find out the optimum composition for both strain sensitivity and mechanical performance. The influence of carbon fibre positioning in BCR cross-section on the strain sensing behaviour was also investigated. Strain sensing property of BCRs was characterized by measuring the change in electrical resistance with flexural strain. It was observed that BCRs exhibited increase (positive response) or decrease (negative response) in electrical resistance depending on carbon fibre positioning. The BCR with lowest amount of carbon fibre was found to give the best strain sensitivity as well as the highest tensile strength and breaking extension. The developed BCRs showed reversible strain sensing behaviour under cyclic flexural loading with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gauge</b> factor of 23. 4 at very low strain level (0. 55 %).

40|$|Methods for simulation-based {{optimisation}} of {{the design}} of railway turnouts (switches & crossings, S&C) are developed and demonstrated. Building on knowledge of dynamic wheel–rail interaction in turnouts, it is investigated how rail profile degradation can be reduced by the optimisation of geometry and component stiffness of the track superstructure. It is assumed that reduced rail profile degradation will reduce the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of turnouts. In order to obtain robust optimised designs that perform well in situ, the influence of spread in traffic parameters, such as wheel profile and wheel–rail friction coefficient, is accounted for in the optimisations. For this purpose, studies of the correlation between wheel profile characteristics and damage in S&C are performed to allow for an efficient parameter sampling using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method. Track gauge optimisation in the switch panel is performed using a multi-objective optimisation approach to highlight the design trade-off in performance between different traffic routes and moves. The objective is to minimise rail and wheel wear as estimated by the energy dissipation in the wheel‒rail contacts. As track gauge widening affects the switch rail design, the switch rail geometry {{is linked to the}} gauge widening in the parameterisation. It is found that gauge configurations with a large <b>maximum</b> <b>gauge</b> widening for the straight stock rail are optimal for both the through and diverging routes, while the results for the curved stock rail show a more significant route dependence. A method for the optimisation of switch rail profile geometry is presented, where the geometry parameterisation is inspired by a manufacturing process for switch rails. It is found that increased profile height and increased profile shoulder protuberance are preferred to reduce the energy dissipation and wheel‒rail contact pressures when a nominal S 1002 wheel profile is used as input. It is concluded that accurate constraints on allowable switch rail loading need to be established to determine the feasible design space for switch rail geometry optimisation. A method for the optimisation of crossing geometry is also introduced. The rail cross-sections are optimised for minimum wheel‒rail contact pressure. Further, the longitudinal height profiles of the wing rails and crossing nose are optimised to minimise an estimate of the accumulated damage in the transition zone. The optimisation is computationally efficient which makes it possible to account for very large samples of wheel profiles. An investigation and demonstration of the constraints imposed on the crossing design by the spread in profile and lateral displacement of passing wheels is presented. Supplementary to the optimisation studies is the comparison of simulation results to field measurement data to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the utilised model of dynamic vehicle‒track interaction, as well as a demonstration of a methodology that simulates rail profile degradation for a given mixed traffic situation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 10. 1002 /hyp. 7587. abs In {{order to}} {{quantify}} total error affecting hydrological models and predictions, we must explicitly recognize errors in input data, model structure, model parameters and validation data. This paper tackles {{the last of}} these: errors in discharge measurements used to calibrate a rainfall-runoff model, caused by stage–discharge rating-curve uncertainty. This uncertainty {{may be due to}} several combined sources, including errors in stage and velocity measurements during individual gaugings, assumptions regarding a particular form of stage–discharge relationship, extrapolation of the stage–discharge relationship beyond the <b>maximum</b> <b>gauging,</b> and cross-section change due to vegetation growth and/or bed movement. A methodology is presented to systematically assess and quantify the uncertainty in discharge measurements due to all of these sources. For a given stage measurement, a complete PDF of true discharge is estimated. Consequently, new model calibration techniques can be introduced to explicitly account for the discharge error distribution. The method is demonstrated for a gravel-bed river in New Zealand, where all the above uncertainty sources can be identified, including significant uncertainty in cross-section form due to scour and re-deposition of sediment. Results show that rigorous consideration of uncertainty in flow data results in significant improvement of the model's ability to predict the observed flow.
