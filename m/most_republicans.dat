5|$|The tariff levels {{had been}} a major {{political}} issue since before the Civil War, and they became the most dominant matter of the 1888 election. The high tariff rates had created a surplus {{of money in the}} Treasury, which led many Democrats (as well as the growing Populist movement) to call for lowering them. <b>Most</b> <b>Republicans</b> preferred to maintain the rates, spend the surplus on internal improvements and eliminate some internal taxes.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the election, the lame-duck session of the old 67th Congress met. Harding {{had come to believe}} that his early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. <b>Most</b> <b>Republicans</b> realized that there was no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and <b>most</b> <b>Republicans,</b> the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E
50|$|Fincher's {{seat was}} made {{considerably}} safer after the 2010 census. He lost {{his share of}} Clarksville while picking up some heavily Republican territory east of Memphis which had previously been in the 7th District. This turned the 8th {{into one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> districts in the nation; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+19, it is the 11th <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> district in the South and the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> district in the state outside of East Tennessee.|$|R
50|$|Vermont {{would be}} the third <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> {{state in the union}} in terms of victory margin, and the second <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> state in terms of vote share. Vermont would weigh in as over 26% more Republican than the {{national}} average in the 1920 election.|$|R
50|$|Gaetz {{defeated}} Democratic candidate Steven Specht with 69 {{percent of}} the vote. However, he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his primary win; the 1st is the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> district in Florida {{and one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> districts in the nation.|$|R
5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and <b>most</b> <b>Republicans</b> in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike <b>most</b> <b>Republicans,</b> favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like <b>most</b> <b>Republicans,</b> favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E
50|$|Despite being Wilson's home state, New Jersey {{registered}} {{as the third}} <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> {{state in the nation}} in terms of vote share and the fourth <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> state in the nation in terms of margin, the state being about 15% more Republican than the national average.|$|R
50|$|Whereas Vermont {{had been}} the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> {{state in the union}} in the 1930s, a strong swing against Roosevelt in the Midwest pushed Vermont into being only the fifth <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> state, {{although}} it still registered as a strong twenty percent more Republican than the national average.|$|R

The <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> district is Texas's 13th at R+33. As for states as a whole, Wyoming and Utah are the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> at R+25, and Hawaii is the most Democratic at D+18.|$|R

25|$|Grant's {{support from}} Congress {{and the nation}} {{declined}} due to scandals within his administration and the political resurgence of the Democrats in the North and South. By 1870, <b>most</b> <b>Republicans</b> felt the war goals had been achieved, and they {{turned their attention to}} other issues such as economic policies.|$|E
25|$|Fossella's {{voting record}} was very {{conservative}} by New York standards. In contrast, <b>most</b> <b>Republicans</b> from New York City (such as Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, and Fossella's two predecessors, Guy and Susan Molinari) {{tend to be}} fairly moderate. Although Democrats have a 17-point advantage in registered voters, the Democrats in this district tend to be fairly conservative on social issues.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} vote share, Vermont was the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> {{state in the}} nation, {{and in terms of}} margin, it was the second <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> state after Maine, as populist William Lemke took votes away from Roosevelt in Maine but was not on the ballot in Vermont. Vermont would weigh in as a whopping 37% more Republican than the {{national}} average in the 1936 election.|$|R
5000|$|Even as Eisenhower won {{a decisive}} {{re-election}} landslide nationally, Vermont weighed in as a whopping 29% more Republican {{than the national}} average, making Vermont the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> {{state in the union}} in the 1956 election. While Vermont had been the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> state in the nation in many elections prior to 1956, this would prove to be the last election in which it would hold that title.|$|R
25|$|Many {{contemporary}} Republicans voice {{support of}} strict constructionism, the judicial philosophy that the Constitution {{should be interpreted}} {{as close to the}} original intent as is practicable. <b>Most</b> <b>Republicans</b> point to Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide, as a case of judicial activism. Republicans favor judicial restraint and have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being activist judges.|$|E
25|$|The {{chances were}} less than {{favorable}} for ratification of the treaty by a two-thirds vote of the Republican Senate. Public opinion was mixed, with intense opposition from <b>most</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Germans, and Irish Catholic Democrats. In numerous meetings with Senators, Wilson discovered opposition had hardened. Despite his weakened physical condition Wilson decided to barnstorm the Western states, scheduling 29 major speeches and many short ones to rally support.|$|E
25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>Republicans</b> support {{school choice}} through charter schools and school {{vouchers}} for private schools; denounce {{the performance of}} the urban public school system and the teachers' unions. The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Many Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, opposed the creation of the United States Department of Education when it was initially created in 1979.|$|E

25|$|During {{his second}} term, Bellmon worked with Democrats in the Oklahoma {{legislature}} {{to pass an}} educational reform package, House Bill 1017, over the opposition of <b>most</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Bellmon chose not to seek reelection to a third term as governor in 1990, which Bellmon was eligible for, since his two terms in office were nonconsecutive. The Republican candidate to replace him, Bill Price, promised to repeal HB 1017. However, Price was defeated by David Walters, whom Bellmon had defeated four years earlier.|$|E
25|$|As strong {{opponents of}} the war, the Federalists held the Hartford Convention in 1814 that hinted at disunion. National {{euphoria}} after the victory at New Orleans ruined {{the prestige of the}} Federalists and they no longer played a significant role as a political party. President Madison and <b>most</b> <b>Republicans</b> realized they were foolish to let the Bank of the United States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war. So, with the assistance of foreign bankers, they chartered the Second Bank of the United States in 1816.|$|E
25|$|While not all Southerners saw {{themselves}} as fighting to preserve slavery, most of the officers and {{over a third of}} the rank and file in Lee's army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation angered both Peace Democrats ("Copperheads") and War Democrats, but energized <b>most</b> <b>Republicans.</b> By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the 1862 elections, but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats losing decisively in the 1863 elections in the northern state of Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.|$|E

The popular incumbent had governed in a very moderate way that appealed to New England voters, and was able to gain dramatically among voters in states like New Hampshire compared to 1952.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Bean {{ran against}} 73-year-old 8th District Republican {{incumbent}} Phil Crane, a 33-year incumbent. Bean attacked Crane for taking numerous lobbyist-funded trips. She lost, but gained 43% of the vote. This was unexpected {{since she had}} received very little funding from the national party. The 8th had historically been the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> district in the Chicago area, and by some accounts was the <b>most</b> <b>Republican</b> district in all of Illinois. Bean's performance was even more notable since the 8th had reportedly been redrawn to protect Crane.|$|R
