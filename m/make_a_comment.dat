25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
500|$|The rumors {{concerning}} his sexuality {{led to a}} Gawker article linking him to a New York Post Page Six blind item about a closeted gay actor, nicknamed [...] "the Gay Rapist". Despite {{the victim of the}} alleged attack denying that it was Franco, two magazines then contacted Franco's lawyer to alert them that they might run stories suggesting his involvement, but were unable to, as at least part of their stories were fabricated. However, Gawker refused to take their article down as they were simply reporting what another outlet published and instead offered him a chance to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> about the speculation on its website. He declined, hoping it would die down. The actor later called the episode very offensive because he has friends who have been raped. In July 2015, a former Gawker employee admitted on his Twitter account — in now deleted posts — that he was pressured to write a series of articles about [...] "the Gay Rapist", and lead readers into believing the man was Franco.|$|E

When Vang asked if something was wrong, other people told Vang that if Eastwood did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment,</b> then his performance was satisfactory. Vang added that Eastwood encouraged ad-libbing with the Hmong actors. Ahney Her said that she liked the improvisation work, even when she was required to translate between the English and Hmong languages. When asked if the in-character racial slurs offended the actors in real life, Ahney said that she did not feel offense. Vang said [...] "I was called so many names that I can’t say here because of how vulgar they were. It disturbed me quite a lot, but at the end of the day it was just a script." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2011, Peace Corps volunteers shared their {{experiences}} of violence and sexual assault. At this meeting, it was found that between 2000–2009 there have been several cases of rape or attempted rape, and about 22 women [...] are sexually assaulted each year. The case of murdered Peace Corps volunteer Kate Puzey was discussed. The Peace Corps has gained attention in the media and their directors have been attacked for how they handled this situation. Kate Puzey's mother was one of those to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> at the meeting about how badly the situation with her daughter had been handled. One woman claimed that her country's director had blamed her for getting raped, while other victims have also been similarly blamed. Criticism of how Peace Corps has responded to sexual assaults against volunteers culminated in the appointment of Kellie Green as the agency's first Director of the Office Of Victims Advocacy in 2011. Green was eventually pushed out of her position in April 2015 for purportedly [...] "creating a hostile work environment". Greene maintains that Peace Corps retaliated against her for pressing agency officials to fully comply with their responsibilities towards volunteers who have been victims of sexual assault. A Change.org petition demanding that Green be reinstated began circulating among former volunteers in December 2015.|$|E

Yet even these strikes which you propose are puny affairs. You want to wage war {{for the sake of a}} few shillings. We ought to fight, if at all, for a greater and more splendid principle. It isn't a shilling or two more a week that the people want. It's a share--a share to which they are, without the shadow of a doubt, entitled--in the direct product of their labour." ...|$|E

And lastly, There is anger, {{which is}} another passion of the soul; and that, as the rest, is {{extended}} by the soul, according {{to the nature of}} the principle by which it is acted, and from whence it flows. And, in a word, to speak nothing of the fierceness and power of this passion, it is then cursed when it breaketh out beyond the bounds that God hath set it, the which to be sure it doth, when it shall by its fierceness or irregular motion, run the soul into sin. 'Be ye angry, and sin not' (Eph 4:26), is the limitation wherewith God hath bounded this passion; and whatever is more than this, is a giving place to the devil. And one reason, among others, why the Lord doth so strictly set this bound, and these limits to anger, is, for that it is so furious a passion, and for that it will so quickly swell up the soul with sin, as they say a toad swells with its poison. Yea, it will in a moment so transport the spirit of a man, that he shall quickly forget himself, his God, his friend, and all good rule. But my business is not now to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> upon the passions of the soul, only to show you that there are such, and also which they are.|$|E
