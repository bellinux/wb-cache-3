According to local tradition, two children in the <b>Mason</b> family died on the property and were interred in the estate's burial vault. Successive owners of the Colross estate claimed it was haunted by the deceased <b>Mason</b> children.|$|E
5|$|Alexander met Bettie <b>Mason</b> of Virginia in 1859 {{and married}} her on April 3, 1860.

Lt. Alexander's final assignments for the U.S. Army were at Fort Steilacoom, in the Washington Territory, and at Alcatraz Island, near San Francisco, California.|$|E
5|$|George Mason's great-grandfather, George <b>Mason</b> I, {{had been}} a Cavalier: militarily {{defeated}} in the English Civil War, some of them came to America in the 1640s and 1650s. He {{had been born in}} 1629 at Pershore, in the English county of Worcestershire. The immigrant George <b>Mason</b> settled in what is now Stafford County, Virginia, having obtained land as a reward for bringing his party to the colony as 50 acres were awarded for each person transported into the Colony of Virginia. His son, George <b>Mason</b> II (1660–1716), was the first to move to what in 1742 became Fairfax County, then at the frontier between English and Native American areas. George <b>Mason</b> III (1690–1735) served in the House of Burgesses and, like his father, was county lieutenant. George <b>Mason</b> IV's mother, Ann Thomson <b>Mason,</b> was the daughter of a former Attorney General of Virginia who had immigrated from London and was of a Yorkshire family.|$|E

5|$|In 1832, James S. <b>Mason</b> of Philadelphia {{began the}} {{commercial}} production of shoe blacking and inks. In 1851, James S. <b>Mason</b> & Co. constructed a building at 138/140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually, to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees. Later, tins of blacking were labeled as <b>Mason</b> Shoe Polish. This business ceased operation in 1919 {{and the building}} was razed in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a flurry of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including <b>Mason)</b> about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. <b>Mason</b> had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and <b>Mason</b> supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mason</b> {{retained}} {{his interest}} in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark's expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. <b>Mason</b> and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and <b>Mason</b> received a report directly from Clark. <b>Mason</b> sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George <b>Mason)</b> was unfavorable to Virginia, he voted for it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, <b>Mason</b> remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, {{who had never been}} married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able {{to take some of the}} burden of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1750, <b>Mason</b> married Ann Eibeck, {{only child}} of William and Sarah Eibeck of Charles County, Maryland. The Masons and Eibecks had {{adjacent}} lands in Maryland, and had joined together in real estate transactions; by his death in 1764, William Eilbeck {{was one of the}} wealthiest men in Charles County. At the time of his marriage, <b>Mason</b> was living at Dogue's Neck, though in which residence is uncertain. George and Ann <b>Mason</b> would have nine children who survived to adulthood. Ann <b>Mason</b> died in 1773; their marriage, judging by surviving accounts, was a happy one.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} boom attracted many Muslim chejaras, <b>masons,</b> and Hindu kumhars, {{members of the}} potter caste who became <b>masons,</b> to Shekhawati. The painters were mostly gifted, self-taught men drawn from amongst them. For the finest work, teams of professional painters were called in from the Jaipur direction.

2500|$|Nineteenth-century historians imposed {{the term}} [...] "Guild" [...] on the [...] "fellowships" [...] of medieval tradesmen as an analogy with the {{merchant}} guilds.

In other words, they were forcibly recruited {{when the need}} arose. In 1356, the preamble to regulations governing the Trade of <b>Masons</b> specifically states that, unlike the other trades, no body existed for the regulation of masonry by <b>masons.</b> Finally, in 1376, four representatives of the [...] "mystery" [...] or trade are elected to the Common Council in London.
