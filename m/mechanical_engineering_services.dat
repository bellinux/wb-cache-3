His {{knowledge}} and interests particularly lied in wood structures and guyed towers. During the post-war years Morrison, along with fellow engineers Charles Hershfield, Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins responded to the building boom by establishing the firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins in Toronto in 1946. At that time the firm offered civil, structural, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>services.</b> With the company until {{the time of his death}} in 1993, Morrison’s roles included that of Principal, President and Chairman.

40|$|Introducing serious gaming systems (SGS) has the {{potential}} to enhance trainee experience and performance across the construction industry and its supply chain, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>services.</b> SGS as an ‘enabler ’ in architectural engineering has received limited research in its role to assess and enhance the performance of its workforce. In a personnel high-risk environment, improving training standards to eliminate or reduce health and safety risks, in addition to providing an understanding of workers ’ ergonomics, ensures sustainability of both the project and its workforce. This paper presents an activity tracking and feedback system that captures the physical activity of a construction worker climbing a ladder. Climbing is captured with a 3 D motion capture system and processed in real-time to identify potential areas of underperformance. A simple and representative scoring method was established as a reporting method (game statistics) for giving feedback about the correctness of the activity. It can nonetheless be tuned to characterise and adjust to various complexity levels in-line with the required training standards. Furthermore, the motion data and feedback information are fed into a virtual gaming environment enabling the real-time visualisation of the trainee’s motion and experiential learning of the performance through visual and audio feedback. The gaming concepts are employed here with multiple purposes, particularly for accelerating and facilitating the learning process of the trainee. In addition to the 3 D motion capturing system, this paper outlines and tests a proposed serious cyber-physical gaming system that incorporates wearable technologies that has {{the potential}} to support both construction training and practice. 1...|$|E

50|$|Birrana was {{the name}} of two motor racing organisations, both {{associated}} with South Australian racing driver and engineer Malcolm Ramsay. From 1971 to 1978 Birrana constructed a series of successful open-wheel racing cars as well as a Holden V8 touring car. Ramsay brought the Birrana name back to motor racing in the 1990s running a series of Reynard Motorsport built Formula 3000 chassis in the Australian Drivers' Championship. Birrana came to dominate the championship winning titles with Jason Bright, Paul Stokell, Rick Kelly and Simon Wills as well as giving Mark Webber his first racing experience of wings and slicks open-wheeler racing. As Formula Holden started to wither, Birrana moved into V8 Supercar with Wills. Ramsay reduced his involvement as the team morphed into Team Dynamik. Today Ramsay continues the Birrana name as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> firm <b>servicing</b> the mining industry.|$|R
