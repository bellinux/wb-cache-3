The two KGST were: maximum static lift (MSL), and maximum number of repetitions (MNR), both gripping a kimono wrapped around a bar. Isokinetic tests consisted of three sets of  5 <b>s</b> <b>elbow</b> flexion-extension maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in three different elbow angles (45, 90 and 120 °), and two sets of five concentric-eccentric elbow flexion-extension maximum dynamic contractions at 60 °·s- 1, to determine peak torque (PT). Absolute values of MSL and MNR were 41. 4 ± 16. 2 s and 10 ± 5 reps, respectively, and tests presented a nearly perfect correlation among them (r= 0. 91; p< 0. 001). Significant correlations were reported between MNR and PT during MVIC for elbow flexors at 45 ° and 90 °, elbow extensors at 120 °, and during concentric and eccentric dynamic contractions for both flexors and extensors. Therefore, KGST were highly correlated with isokinetic parameters, and were nearly perfect correlated among them, supporting that one of the tests could be chosen to evaluate strength in JJ athletes.

The applied fatigue model is based on established methods and is incorporated in an iterative numerical design tool for realistic wind turbine blades. All aerodynamic and structural design properties are available in literature. The software tool FAST is used for advanced aero-servo-elastic load calculations and stress-histories are calculated with elementary beam theory. According to wind energy design standards, a turbulent wind load case is implemented. Fatigue loads are estimated based on 100 % availability and a site-specific annual wind distribution. Rainflow cycle counting and <b>Miner</b> <b>s</b> sum for cumulative damage prediction is used together with constant life diagrams tailored to actual material S-N data. Material properties are based on 95 % survival probability, 95 % confidence level, and additional material safety factors to maintain conservative results. Fatigue performance is first evaluated for the baseline blade design of the 10 MW NOWITECH reference wind turbine. Results show that blade damage is dominated by tensile stresses due to poorer tensile fatigue characteristics of the shell glass fiber material. The interaction between turbulent wind and gravitational fluctuations is demonstrated to greatly influence the damage. The need for relevant S-N data to closely predict such blade stress cycle events is investigated to avoid non-conservative conclusions. State-of-art wind turbine blade trends are discussed and different designs of the NOWITECH baseline blade are analyzed in a parametric study focusing on fatigue performance and material costs...|$|R

Forty-seven men (mean ± SD age = 24 ± 1 yrs; body mass = 79. 39 ± 9. 12 kg; height = 174. 5 ± 5. 6 cm) were randomly divided into three training groups performing either one set (G 1 S), three sets (G 3 S), or five sets (G 5 S) of all exercises in a resistance training session or a control group (CG). All groups were assessed pre- and post-training for Sit-and-Reach test and range of motion of 10 joints using goniometry. The training protocol included three weekly sessions and was composed of nine exercises performed at a moderate intensity (eight to 12 RM).

The degree of matching of movement parameters was dependent on visual information. In the absence of visual information, these parameters were exactly matched in simultaneous movements of the two arms. When visual information was provided by displaying the position of right or left arm to the subject, {{the movements of the}} 2 ̆ 2 non-displayed 2 ̆ 2 arm were consistently of greater amplitudes and velocities than those of the 2 ̆ 2 displayed 2 ̆ 2 arm.

This matching was also seen for the independently made movements.;In some experiments the left arm was loaded. Loading altered the slope of the peak velocity-amplitude relation in movements of the left arm. Similar changes occurred in the velocity-amplitude relation of the right (non-loaded) arm.;To test interlimb responses to kinesthetic information, high frequency (120 Hz) mechanical vibration of muscle tendons was used to stimulate muscle spindles of the elbow movers. Vibration of the triceps muscle of one arm produced overshooting of the intended flexion end-position by the opposite arm.;It is concluded that the motor actions of the two arms are functionally linked.

Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Muscle {{weakness}} often complicates critical {{illness and}} {{is associated with}} increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and limiting functional outcome even years later. To assess the presence of muscle weakness and {{to examine the effects}} of interventions, objective and reliable muscle strength measurements are required. The first objective of this study is to determine interobserver reliability of handheld dynamometry. Secondary objectives are to quantify muscle weakness, to evaluate distribution of muscle weakness, and to evaluate gender-related differences in muscle strength. DESIGN:: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING:: The surgical and medical intensive care units of a large, tertiary referral, university hospital. PATIENTS:: A cross-sectional, randomly selected sample of awake and cooperative critically ill patients. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Handheld dynamometry was performed in critically ill patients who had at least a score of 3 (movement against gravity) on the Medical Research Council scale. Three upper limb and three lower limb muscle groups were tested at the right-hand side. Patients were tested twice daily by two independent raters. Fifty-one test-retests were performed in 39 critically ill patients. Handheld dynamometry demonstrated good interobserver agreement with intraclass correlation coefficients > 0. 90 in four of the muscle groups tested (range, 0. 91 - 0. 96) and somewhat less for hip flexion (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 80) and ankle dorsiflexion (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 76). Limb muscle strength was considerably reduced in all muscle groups as shown by the median z-score (range, - 1. 08 to - 3. 48 <b>sd</b> units). <b>Elbow</b> flexors, knee extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors were the most affected muscle groups.

However, very few studies have directly compared the two stimulation techniques for assessing VA of the elbow flexors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare TMS and motor point stimulation for assessing VA in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. Participants performed a fatigue protocol that included twelve, 15 <b>s</b> isometric <b>elbow</b> flexor contractions. Participants completed a set of isometric elbow flexion contractions at 100, 75, 50, and 25 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) prior to and following fatigue contractions 3, 6, 9, and 12 and 5 and 10 min post-fatigue. Force and EMG of the bicep and triceps brachii were measured for each contraction. Force responses to TMS and motor point stimulation and EMG responses to TMS (motor evoked potentials, MEPs) and Erb's point stimulation (maximal M-waves, Mmax) were also recorded. VA was estimated using the equation: VA% = (1 −SITforce/PTforce) × 100. The resting twitch was measured directly for motor point stimulation and estimated for both motor point stimulation and TMS by extrapolation of the linear regression between the superimposed twitch force and voluntary force. MVC force, potentiated twitch force and VA significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased throughout the elbow flexor fatigue protocol and partially recovered 10 min post fatigue. VA was significantly (p < 0. 05) underestimated when using TMS compared to motor point stimulation in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. Motor point stimulation compared to TMS superimposed twitch forces were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher at 50 % MVC but similar at 75 and 100 % MVC. The linear relationship between TMS superimposed twitch force and voluntary force significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased with fatigue. There was no change in triceps/biceps electromyography, biceps/triceps MEP amplitudes, or bicep MEP amplitudes throughout the fatigue protocol at 100 % MVC. In conclusion, motor point stimulation as opposed to TMS led to a higher estimation of VA in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. The decreased linear relationship between TMS superimposed twitch force and voluntary force led to an underestimation of the estimated resting twitch force and thus, a reduced VA...|$|R

" Concern for bottom-line results invokes questions such as: How much was produced? At what cost? And, was anyone injured? While these questions will always carry everyday emphasis at the mine, they are fundamentally lacking in that they often appear, especially to lower levels of management and to the production worker, as preeminent concerns. Driven by market economics, many organizations have decentralized, outsourced, downsized, restructured, and formed new coalitions. Investments in new technology and concentration on productivity have been part and parcel with these changes, contributing to improvements in both safety and efficiency. A reason for (and, perhaps a result of) these improvements has been {{the development of a}} highly experienced and flexible work force. These changes in mining present an interesting opportunity to modify a few paradigms about work life in general, and perhaps a few paradigms about how we invest in the miner, in particular. Studying these issues now might offer some interesting opportunities for the future, as the foundations {{for the next generation of}} mine workers are laid. With the average "experienced" U. <b>S.</b> <b>miner</b> five to fifteen years from retirement, perhaps a key determinant of future success in the world market might be how well we make the transition from today's work force to the work force of tomorrow. We can ill afford to wait a few more years to tap into the special knowledge residing within a veteran mining work force. The WCPM work Crew Performance Model, see pp.) is one approach to defining, capturing, and transferring this expertise...|$|R
40|$|This Information Circular {{from the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{documents}} and supplements {{the information presented}} {{in a series of}} workshops held during 2002 and 2003. The primary intended audience consists of all who are involved in developing and conducting miners' training. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), mine operators reported 240, 000 full-time equivalent workers and independent contractors reported 42, 000 full-time equivalent workers working on mine property during the year 2000. Unfortunately, these workers have a relatively high risk of suffering serious work-related injuries and illnesses. The mining industry has the highest rate of occupational fatalities among all U. S. industries. The fatality rate is 30 deaths per 100, 000 workers compared to 4. 6 for all private industry (Morbidity and Mortality Week Report, 2001; NIOSH, 2002). Compared to workers in other industries, miners also have a relatively high rate of nonfatal lost-time injuries, and their injuries tend to be more severe (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1999). Many miners are also exposed to significant health hazards, including coal and silica dust, diesel exhaust, and noise. More than 1000 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> die of lung disease each year (NIOSH, 1999). Mine safety and health professionals have long recognized training as a critical element of an effective safety and health program. Federal regulations (30 CFR, Parts 46 and 48) require mine operators to provide initial safety and health training to all new miners, as well as a minimum of 8 hours of refresher training each year. The time and money being spent to train U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> is substantial, and so there is a strong and steady demand for new and better mine training materials and methods. A growing concern among mine safety professionals regards the training of new workers. A major change in the mining workforce is anticipated within the next decade. In major segments of mining, especially coal, relatively few workers have been hired since the 1970 's. Thus, as an entire cohort of miners in the current workforce nears retirement, the replacement of these employees will require an influx of new workers. New miners may be young people who lack the ability to recognize and respond to mining hazards in an appropriate manner. They may also have had different educational experiences than their older counterparts. Many safety professionals believe that these two cohorts require different approaches to training. The papers in this report should help prepare mine trainers for the changes about to occur in the workforce and acquaint them with strategies they can use to enhance the effectiveness of their training. The first three papers present basic principles for teaching adults. The five remaining papers are intended to illustrate how these principles {{can be applied to the}} development and imple 2 of effective training for miners. Below is an overview of these papers. 1. Kowalski and Vaught review the process and principles of adult learning. The learning model they present includes a discussion of goals, content, delivery, assessment, and remediation. Adults are viewed as active learners, experienced-based, expert in their own right in specific areas, independent, real-life centered, task-centered, problem-centered, solution-driven, skill-seeking, self-directing, and internally and externally motivated. Basic aspects of curriculum development are briefly reviewed. For further information about adult learning, see Camm and Cullen's paper. 2. Mallett and Reinke's first paper discusses issues related to training new miners who have recently or will soon be entering the mining workforce. These new generations of miners have different learning style preferences and training needs than Baby Boomers and other older miners. Even trainers who have been highly effective in the past should reassess their training styles and their classroom materials to...|$|R
40|$|Longwall mining {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} {{as being the}} safest extraction method in underground coal mines. However, {{one of the most}} difficult tasks associated with longwall mining is moving the face once a panel is completed. Based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fatality reports since 1996, longwall face recovery operations have claimed the lives of 5 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> and have resulted in numerous injuries. Recovery operations can be hazardous because they involve moving large pieces of equipment in very confined spaces. They are also conducted in highly stressed ground conditions due to front abutment loads generated by panel extraction. Shield removal is the most hazardous operation during face recovery because miners are constantly exposed to the unpredictable gob edge. To protect the miners, one or more walking shields, cribbing and/or other supplemental roof and standing supports are typically employed as breaker line supports as each shield is removed. At the Harris No. 1 Mine in southern WV, mobile roof supports (MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) have been used in lieu of traditional walking shields on 17 face moves since 1997. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s are shield-like support units mounted on crawler tracks and are commonly used during room-and-pillar retreat mining operations. For longwall recovery, the two biggest advantages that MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have over traditional walking shields are that they are remotely controlled and are highly maneuverable. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have contributed to safer shield recovery and shorter move times at the Harris No. 1 Mine. This paper will address both the safety and the operational issues associated with MRS usage during shield recovery. It will also discuss new developments, including the use of the inherently safer battery powered MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s, which have been recently certified by the Mine Safety and Health Administration...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{provides an}} historical overview of research {{undertaken by the}} U. S. federal government over the last 100 years to improve {{the health and safety}} of our nation 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>miners.</b> Federal research efforts began with the establishment of the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM, or the Bureau) in 1910. They have continued over the past century, even after the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s closure in 1996. It is hoped that this publication will give the reader an appreciation for the work of mining health and safety researchers over the past century, and of the miners served by this research. Although not a comprehensive history, this report highlights the key organizational changes made within the Bureau and the federal government that affected mining safety and health research. Some mention is also made of Bureau research not directly related to mining health and safety. Note that the work classified as safety and health research has varied over the last century. For example, before 1970 the Bureau separated mining research and safety and health research. At that time, mining research included ground control and methane drainage because they had direct implications for mine safety. Explosives research was also reported separately from health and safety, even though permissible explosives research was obviously related to safety. Therefore, where budget figures from the Bureau are mentioned in this report, it is often not possible to separate safety and health research from other types of research. This history is generally chronological, with a few exceptions. Because of their prominence and direct links to Bureau research, most of the Public Health Service mining studies completed before 1970, when NIOSH was established, will be discussed in a single section, even though the work spanned many decades. Likewise, for convenience, the brief histories of the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s mining research centers are located in one section...|$|R
