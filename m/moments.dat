5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic <b>moments</b> of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic <b>moments</b> that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic <b>moments</b> of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, a <b>moment</b> is a {{specific}} quantitative measure, used in both mechanics and statistics, of {{the shape of a}} set of points. If the points represent mass, then the zeroth <b>moment</b> is the total mass, the first <b>moment</b> divided by the total mass is the center of mass, and the second <b>moment</b> is the rotational inertia. If the points represent probability density, then the zeroth <b>moment</b> is the total probability (i.e. one), the first <b>moment</b> is the mean, the second central <b>moment</b> is the variance, the third central <b>moment</b> is the skewness, and the fourth central <b>moment</b> (with normalization and shift) is the kurtosis. The mathematical concept is closely related to the concept of <b>moment</b> in physics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Moment</b> invariants {{have been}} {{frequently}} used as features for shape recognition. They are computed {{based on the}} information provided by both the shape boundary and its interior region. Although several fast algorithms for computing traditional <b>moment</b> invariants have been proposed, none has ever shown the theoretical results of <b>moment</b> invariants computed based on the shape boundary only. This paper proposes improved <b>moment</b> invariants computed using the shape boundary only, which tremendously reduces computations. The new <b>moment</b> invariants, called improved <b>moment</b> invariants are mathematically proved to be invariant to scaling, translation, and rotation. Graphical plots of the first two improved <b>moment</b> invariants for six country maps and four industrial tools using improved <b>moment</b> invariants are also given.
