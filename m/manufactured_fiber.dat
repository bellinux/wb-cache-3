40|$|Nulling {{interferometry}} is {{the baseline}} technique for the DARWIN planet finding {{mission of the}} European Space Agency. Using this technique {{it will be possible}} to cancel, by destructive interference, the light from the bright star and look directly at its surrounding planets and eventually discover life on them. To achieve this goal wavefront errors need to be reduced to a very high degree in order to achieve the required nulling quality. Such a high wavefront quality can only be achieved with adequate wavefront filtering measures. Single mode fibers in general have excellent mode filtering capabilities, but they were not recently available for the broad infrared wavelength region of Darwin (4 - 20 um). Within an ESA technology development project, TNO has designed and tested an infrared single mode fiber based on chalcogenide glasses that has been manufactured by the University of Rennes. Several tests are carried out to characterize the materials used and the IR single mode fiber.

40|$|Locard’s Exchange Principal – when a {{criminal}} {{comes in contact}} with a person or object a cross transfer of evidence occurs. Fibers – how are they used in court cases? Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, Army captain and Green Beret accused of murdering his pregnant {{wife and two children}} in 1970, he was made famous in the book and subsequent made for TV movie “Fatal Vision”. The investigators were suspicious of the doctor {{because of the nature of}} his wounds – suggesting that they were not defensive and perhaps even self inflicted. Blue threads that matched the doctor’s pajama top were found under the body of his wife as well as in the bedroom of both murdered children and even under the fingernails of one of his daughters. When MacDonald was confronted with this and other evidence he reportedly stated “You guys are more thorough than I thought”. Dr. MacDonald is currently in prison and still maintains his innocence. Fiber background: There are two general types of fibers, natural and manufactured. Natural fibers have been utilized by humans for centuries and are derived from plants and animals.

40|$|Fiber optic current sensors {{utilize the}} Faraday effect which causes the po-larization {{of the light}} to rotate. These sensors have several {{advantages}} com-pared to conventional current measurement methods such as electrical insu-lation and small size and weight. There is however requirement on specially <b>manufactured</b> <b>fiber</b> and components in order to cancel out undesired linear birefringence which will transform the polarization. In this thesis the foundations of these system have been investigated and tested in a configuration including a SMF (Single Mode Fiber) as the sensing coil terminated with a Faraday mirror. The wavelength of operation is around 1550 nm {{and the number of}} loops in the sensing coil is approximately 2100. The SMF was not preferable in these types of sensors and it is recommended to use spun highly birefringent fiber for such large number of loops in order to cancel out the linear birefringence properly.

40|$|Flows within {{very thin}} channels, {{typically}} filled with spacers, can be often encountered in many {{processes such as}} electrodialysis (ED) and reverse electrodialysis (RED). Although the ED and the RED processes have been studied for a long time, the optimization of the fluid dynamics within the channels is still an open problem. In the present work, realized within the EU-FP 7 funded REAPower project, computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out in order to predict the fluid flow field inside a single ED/RED channel. Some different configurations were tested which includes: an empty channel, a channel provided with a spacer, and a channel filled with a purposely <b>manufactured</b> <b>fiber</b> porous medium. Two types of spacers were investigated: (1) a commercial type made of woven perpendicular filaments and (2) an overlapped perpendicular filament spacer. A sensitivity analysis concerning computational grid size and topology was performed. For the cases investigated, adopting the hybrid grids mainly composed of hexahedral volumes {{was found to be}} more reliable and less computational demanding than tetrahedral grids. As concerns the dependence of the pressure drops on the flow rate, the empty channel was found to guarantee the lowest pressure drops at a given fluid flow rate, as expected. Conversely, the woven spacer filled channel was found to provide larger pumping costs. The pressure drops along the channel filled with a porous medium even at low flow rate were very high thus suggesting that this specific configuration may be unsuitable and that further investigations should be devoted to this topic...|$|E
40|$|Rayon was and {{continues}} to be an important fiber to the textile and fashion industry. Prior to rayon 2 ̆ 7 s invention, only natural fibers such as cotton, silk, flax, and wool were available for clothing and home furnishings. Rayon, invented in 1846, began to be manufactured in the United States in 1911. Called artificial silk until 1924 when the name rayon was coined, rayon was a less expensive alternative to silk clothing and accessories. This paper focused on the time period of 1910 - 1924. The start date 1910 was selected because rayon production in the United States started in 1911. The year 1924 was chosen as a stop date for this project because acetate was invented in 1924 making rayon no longer the only <b>manufactured</b> <b>fiber.</b> This topic was important to study because little to no research had been done to address how rayon was introduced to consumers and to assess its impact on the fashion world. Seven research questions guided the research. These questions were: What was the early history of rayon production and introduction to the public? What names did manufacturers use when selling rayon? What type of products featured rayon? How were the above products promoted to the public? What were the stated advantages of rayon during this time period? What were the stated disadvantages of rayon during this time period? Why was rayon perceived as inferior to silk? This study utilized a grounded theory and content analysis to analyze data collected from the retailers 2 ̆ 7 newspaper Women 2 ̆ 7 s Wear, the woman 2 ̆ 7 s fashion magazine Harper 2 ̆ 7 s Bazar, and the woman 2 ̆ 7 s home magazine Good Housekeeping. Manufacturers and the industry used a variety of names to describe rayon which seemingly caused confusion for the consumer. The terms artificial silk, art silk, fiber (fibre) silk, fiber (fibre), chemical silk, manufactured silk, scientific silk, rayonner, and rayon silk were all used to describe one type of fabric. The majority of products made of rayon were hosiery; along with sweaters, draperies and curtains, embroidery and trim, bed spreads, dresses, scarves, blouses, women 2 ̆ 7 s suits, hats, and socks. During the time period of 1910 - 1924, many advantages and disadvantages were apparent. The major advantage of rayon was its luster; the second major advantage was cost. Rayon was lower in cost than silk. Other advantages of rayon included its ability to cover and it wore well as dress trimmings and embroidery. In spite of these advantages, there were many disadvantages. Rayon was susceptible to heat and moisture, only one-eighth as strong as silk, and weaker when wet. Women who purchased rayon {{did not know how to}} properly care for the fiber. Rayon fibers were coarser than silk which produced a coarser weave, had poor elasticity, poor abrasion resistance, poor dye affinity, and lacked the necessary qualities to produce a twistable yarn. Rayon was seen as inferior to silk for four main reasons. First, was the industry 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of the fiber rayon. Terms such as 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 silk made consumers think that silk was the optimal choice, but that they might have to settle for rayon, the imposter. Cost perceptions was the second major reason rayon that was seen as inferior. The majority of rayon products were priced less expensively than silk products. For many consumers, cheaper prices equaled lower quality. Third was confusion about the terminology used. A variety of terms were used to describe rayon: artificial silk, art silk, fiber (fibre) silk, fiber (fibre), chemical silk, scientific silk, rayonner, wood silk, and rayon silk. With this list of terms, consumers would not necessarily know what specific product they purchased or the correct fiber content. The fourth, and final reason, was poor information provided about rayon to the consumer...|$|E
