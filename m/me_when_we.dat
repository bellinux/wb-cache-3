500|$|According to Vanderbilt's All-Southern halfback and 1924 captain-elect Gil Reese, [...] "He {{would never}} let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would {{threaten}} me, Bomar was always right there to say 'Keep your hands off that boy'. They always did, too. Bomar always looked after me, and he always called back to <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar." [...] Bomar and Reese were on an all-time Vanderbilt team in the school's 1934 yearbook, and Bomar was chosen for an Associated Press Southeast Area all-time football team for the era from 1920 to 1969.|$|E

Monteux was the conductor {{for the two}} outstanding works of the season, Vaslav Nijinsky's ballet version of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's Daphnis et Chloé to a score commissioned from Ravel. Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> played L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when we came to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E

[...] The Guardian advocated the show's revival, arguing that [...] "a revamped Press Gang with Moffat at the helm could turn the show from a cult into a national institution - a petri dish for young acting and writing talent to thrive. It's part of our TV heritage and definitely worthy of resuscitation." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the film's release, {{executive}} producer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs stated [...] "If Toy Story is a modest hit—say $75million {{at the box}} office, we'll [...] both break even. If it gets $100million, we'll both make money. But if it's a real blockbuster and earns $200million or so at the box office, we'll make good money, and Disney will {{make a lot of}} money." [...] Upon its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350million worldwide. Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated [...] "I don't think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve. Believe <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first agreed to work together, we never thought their first movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the strength of it." [...] The film's first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend) earned it $39,071,176. The film placed first in the weekend's box office with $29,140,617 and maintained the [...] 1 position at the domestic box office for the next two weekends. Toy Story became the highest-grossing domestic film of 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld, and GoldenEye. At the time of its release, it was the third highest-grossing animated film of all time, after The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992). When not considering inflation, Toy Story is [...] 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of all time. The film had gross receipts of $191,796,233 in the U.S. and Canada and $181,757,800 in international markets for a total of $373,554,033 worldwide. At the time of its release, the film ranked as 17th highest-grossing film (unadjusted) domestically and it was the 21st highest-grossing film worldwide.|$|E

Zinner eventually won Best Editing Oscar for The Deer Hunter.

2500|$|Additionally, opponents {{argue that}} the method of {{administration}} is also flawed. They state that since the personnel administering the lethal injection lack expertise in anesthesia, the risk of failing to induce unconsciousness is greatly increased. In reference to this problem, Jay Chapman, {{the creator of the}} American method, said, [...] "It never occurred to <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> set this up that we'd have complete idiots administering the drugs." [...] Also, they {{argue that the}} dose of sodium thiopental must be customized to each individual patient, not restricted to a set protocol. Finally, the remote administration results in an increased risk that insufficient amounts of the lethal injection drugs enter the bloodstream.|$|E

He was seen in modernist circles, and contributed to the 1934 exhibit Peisajul bucureștean ("The Landscape of Bucharest"), with paintings dating back to 1919. A year later, he had a retrospective show at Dalles, which ran parallel to the debut exhibit of Alexandru Ciucurencu. Zambaccian recalls that Sion felt jealousy toward Ciucurencu's fast rise. According to Zambaccian's own account: [...] "And since I was more preoccupied with Ciucurencu than Theodorescu Sion, he got upset and put up a sign on the door of his exhibit: 'No Entry for Dogs and Zambaccian'. Of course the storm soon subsided. The painter's wife tore off the card, and Theodorescu Sion kissed <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> met again!" ...|$|E

Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, [...] "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Quran was revealed in their tongue." [...] They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.

2500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cao Cao's position, Yu Jin encountered {{about a dozen}} {{injured and}} naked men on the road. When he asked them what happened, they told him that they were robbed by the Qingzhou Corps (青州兵). The Qingzhou Corps was a unit in Cao Cao's forces formed by the former Yellow Turban rebels who surrendered to Cao in Qing Province (Qingzhou) in the early 190s. The furious Yu Jin said, [...] "The Qingzhou Corps are part of Lord Cao's army. How dare they become robbers!" [...] He then led his men to attack and punish them. Some of the Qingzhou soldiers escaped to Wuyin and accused Yu Jin of committing the crimes they were responsible for. When Yu Jin reached Wuyin, he immediately set up defensive fortifications around the camp instead of reporting directly to Cao Cao. His subordinates told him, [...] "The Qingzhou soldiers framed you. You should explain matters to Lord Cao as soon as possible." [...] Yu Jin replied, [...] "The enemy is still in pursuit and may reach here anytime. If we don't set up defences now, how can we expect to hold them off? Lord Cao is intelligent and wise. Those accusations aren't a cause for concern." [...] After the defences were set up, Yu Jin went to meet Cao Cao and explained everything. Cao Cao was pleased and he said, [...] "How dangerous it was for <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were defeated at the Yu River (淯水). General, you're able to bring order to chaos and hold your ground against a fierce enemy, and you display unwavering loyalty.
