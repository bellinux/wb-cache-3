40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that sorghum is highly digestible in the rat.

40|$|Biomass sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. ] is a {{candidate}} bioenergy feedstock in the Midwest, US. Research suggests that biomass sorghum is more drought tolerant and has higher water-use-efficiency (WUE; the ratio of cumulative biomass production to total evapotranspiration; g kg- 1) than Zea mays (maize) in water-limiting environments. However, comparisons of the seasonal evapotranspiration (total ET) and WUE of biomass <b>sorghum</b> <b>and</b> <b>maize</b> have focused on irrigated systems and are scarce for the rain-fed, Midwest. We conducted a side-by-side comparison of the total ET <b>and</b> WUE of <b>maize</b> <b>and</b> biomass <b>sorghum</b> at a site within the US Corn Belt. Total ET was estimated using a micrometeorological method and aboveground plant biomass was determined using destructive hand harvests. Theoretical ethanol yield (EY; l m- 2) and ethanol water requirement (EWR; l water l ethanol- 1) were also determined for each species. Over two non-drought growing seasons, we found similar mean WUE for maize (3. 51 ± 0. 26 g kg- 1) <b>and</b> biomass <b>sorghum</b> (3. 47 ± 0. 22 g kg- 1).
