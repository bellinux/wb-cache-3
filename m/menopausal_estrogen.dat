40|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence that ovarian hormones {{play a crucial}} role at all stages in the development of breast cancer, and many clinically evident breast cancers remain sensitive to ovarian hormones. Both major ovarian hormones, estradiol and progesterone, play important roles in increasing breast cancer risk. 1) Key epidemiologic evidence The key epidemiologic observations on the relation of ovarian hormones to breast cancer risk are as follows. (1) Early menopause, whether it occurs naturally or through bilateral oophorectomy, reduces risk. (2) Postmenopausal obesity increases risk, but premenopausal obesity decreases risk. (3) <b>Menopausal</b> <b>estrogen</b> replacement therapy increases risk, but only to a relatively small extent. (4) Use of combination type oral contraceptives does not decrease the risk. (5) Use of depot medroxy rogesterone acetate does not decrease breast cancer risk (Pike et al. 1993). 2) Estrogen-augmented-by-progesterone hypothesis The key epidemiologic hormonal risk factors for breast cancer are all explicable in terms of the estrogen augmented by progesterone hypothesis.

40|$|Objective: Menopause is a physiological {{life period}} that {{potentially}} affects various organs and systems. Therefore, a wide spectrum of {{signs and symptoms}} of eyes may be clinically observed in the postmenopausal period. Aim of the study : To evaluate the macular, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and choroidal thickness alterations by using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in postmenopausal women and compare with healthy reproductive-age women controls. Material and methods: The study population included a healthy reproductive-age control group (n = 72) and postmenopausal study group (n = 72). Retinal thickness parameters were measured by SD-OCT. Peripapillary RNFL thickness parameters, macular thickness and choroidal thickness were evaluated. Results : Superior inner macula, temporal inner macula, inferior inner macula, nasal inner macula, inferior outer macula and choroid thickness were significantly thinner in the postmenopausal study group than the healthy reproductive-age control group (p = 0. 007, p = 0. 037, p = 0. 027, p = 0. 006, p = 0. 016, p < 0. 001, respectively). After adjusting for age, only choroid thickness was significantly thinner in the postmenopausal study group than controls (p† = 0. 005). Conclusions : This study revealed that choroidal thickness measured by SD-OCT was significantly thinner in postmenopausal women than healthy reproductive-age women. We can speculate that the decrease in choroidal thickness in postmenopausal women may indicate a reduced estrogen-dependent vasodilatory effect in ophthalmic artery secondary to <b>menopausal</b> <b>estrogen</b> deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was to explore the {{influences}} of risk factors for breast cancer on breast cancer characteristics and survival. We evaluated the associations between number and timing of births and breast cancerspecific survival {{using data from the}} Swedish Cancer Register, the Swedish Cause of Death Register, and the MultiGeneration Register. We identified more than 27, 000 women born in Sweden and diagnosed with breast cancer in 1958 - 1997. We found a successively worse prognosis for women with a shorter delay between last birth and breast cancer diagnosis. Compared to women with their last birth more than 10 years before diagnosis, {{the risk of breast cancer}} death was increased by 72 % for those with breast cancer diagnosis in the first year after last birth, and 39 % for those diagnosed in the 3 rd year after last birth. Women with a first birth before 20 years had a slightly worse prognosis than parous women with their first birth between 20 - 24 years. These findings suggest that a recent birth and possibly an early first birth influence tumor biology. For the three following studies we used a Swedish population-based case-control study including more than 3, 000 women aged 50 - 74 diagnosed with breast cancer in 1993 - 1995, and more than 3, 000 agefrequency matched controls. The study holds information from questionnaires, patient records, and the Swedish Cause of Death Register. We assessed the influence of menopausal hormone therapy, anthropometric factors, reproductive factors, recent smoking, recent alcohol intake, family history of breast cancer, and previous benign breast disease on the risk of ductal, lobular, or tubular breast cancer. Menopausal estrogen-progestin therapy was associated with increased risks for all subtypes, but the estimates for lobular and tubular cancer were stronger compared to ductal cancer. <b>Menopausal</b> <b>estrogen</b> alone therapy was similarly associated with ductal and lobular breast cancer. Recent alcohol intake was significantly associated with tubular cancer, and seemed non-significantly related to lobular but not ductal breast cancer. Increasing age at first birth was borderline significantly more strongly related to lobular compared to ductal breast cancer. Other reproductive factors, anthropometric factors, and smoking seemed similarly related to ductal and lobular breast cancer. The same risk factors were also evaluated by joint estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumors. We found menopausal estrogen-progestin therapy to increase the risk for all receptor groups except the ER-PR- group. The risks were borderline significantly stronger for ER+PR+ tumors compared to ER-PR- tumors. <b>Menopausal</b> <b>estrogen</b> alone therapy was similarly associated with all receptor-defined groups. A high age at first birth seemed to increase the risk only for the ER+ groups, and substantial adult weight gain was associated only with the PR+ tumor groups. Most other risk factors seemed similarly associated with all receptor-defined tumor groups. Current, but not past, compared to never use of menopausal hormone therapy was associated with tumors of low grade, low S-phase fraction, and improved breast cancer specific survival. The associations were stronger with longer duration, and breast cancer survival seemed more favorable with estrogen-progestin than estrogen alone therapy. The improved survival among current users of menopausal hormone therapy was only partly explained by differences in available tumor characteristics and mammography surveillance...|$|E

40|$|Current {{evidence}} is reviewed here on {{risks and benefits}} of estrogen and progestin use by peri- and postmenopausal women in relation to the following conditions: endometrial cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). On balance, estrogen therapy appears to be beneficial for menopausal women, as it probably reduces the risks of CAD and osteoporosis, two of the major causes of mortality and morbidity. Although unopposed estrogen therapy increases the risk of endometrial cancer, that cancer is relatively rare and is not fatal {{in the vast majority of}} cases associated with estrogen use. Definitive conclusions about the relation of <b>menopausal</b> <b>estrogens</b> to breast cancer cannot be drawn due to inconsistent evidence to date. Although evidence from randomized controlled trials is lacking, biochemical and clinical evidence suggest that progestin supplementation is associated with a reduction in endometrial cancer risk in women taking <b>menopausal</b> <b>estrogens.</b> Progestin supplementation also may augment the beneficial effects of estrogens in providing protection against osteoporosis, although this effect is not yet well established. There is little direct evidence bearing on the relation of menopausal progestins to breast cancer. Although studies of CAD per se are lacking at present, progestins probably unfavorably alter lipoprotein profiles, thereby increasing a user's risk of CAD. Given the relatively high incidence and mortality of CAD in postmenopausal women, any negative effects on CAD risk could potentially counterbalance beneficial effects on other causes. We conclude that estrogen replacement therapy is of potential benefit to postmenopausal women, but that the question of progestin supplementation requires further study, particularly for CAD risk...|$|R

40|$|Context and Objective: During their {{reproductive}} years, women are generally protected from cardiovascular disease events by their estrogen-replete status. Our starting hypothesis was that lower estrogen levels after menopause {{are associated with}} macrophage activation profiles skewed towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes. Research Design and Setting: This was an in vitro and ex vivo study in human blood-derived macrophages. Subjects: We obtained blood from 12 healthy male donors for the in vitro study, and from 5 pre-menopausal and 8 post-menopausal women for the ex vivo study. Outcome: measurements: We determined macrophage immunophenotypes in resting state and after activation with M 1 - (LPS/IFNγ) or M 2 -associated (IL- 4 /IL- 13) stimuli, as well as expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and other transcription factors. Results: Unpolarized macrophages expressed both ERα and ERβ, and ERα but not ERβ levels were decreased by M 1 stimuli. LPS/IFNγ also induced downregulation of CD 163 and CD 206, markers of alternative activation, and increased cell-bound TNF-α and IL- 10. These effects were prevented by E 2 treatment through impaired nuclear factor (NF) -κB liberation. In agreement with a role for E 2 in attenuating the inflammatory response, M 1 /M 2 subpopulations were similar in monocytes and unstimulated macrophages from pre- and post-menopausal donors. In contrast, M 2 activation appeared to be blunted in macrophages from post-menopausal women, leading to increased M 1 /M 2 response ratio. Conclusions: Estrogen treatment prevented LPS/IFNγ action on human M 2 macrophage markers and cytokine production, whereas <b>menopausal</b> <b>estrogen</b> loss was associated with impaired response to alternative activation, suggesting that these mechanisms affect cardiovascular risk profile in relation to menopausal status...|$|E
40|$|Hormonal therapy (HT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} prescribed drug regimens for women after the age of 50 years. HT has been developed progressively since the 1960 s to provide estrogen to those women (a) who require relief of symptoms which have resulted from reduced circulating estrogen or (b) to act as an anti-resorptive agent to counteract the effect of the increased bone turnover which occurs with falling <b>menopausal</b> <b>estrogen</b> levels and which results in loss of bone mass leading to postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, a large number of women pass through the menopausal transition without experiencing distress as a result of the natural fall in estrogen hormone levels and since the introduction HT has been thought to be associated with a number of health benefits that have been tested in clinical trials but not substantiated. In women experiencing distressing climacteric symptoms double-blind randomised controlled clinical trials with a variety of HT regimens have shown that HT of any type provides symptom relief with no alternative treatment of similar effect. The dose and regimen of HT need to be individualised and in general the appropriate dose is dependent on the menopausal age. Women experiencing urogenital estrogen deficiency symptoms require long-term treatment which is most easily achieved with local estrogen. With the perspective provided by the most recent epidemiological findings not least from the estrogen only arm of the Women's Health Initiative Study (WHI) EMAS supports research activities generating HT with new compositions including lower doses and a wider range of progestins in order to positively affect the balance of clinical benefit and risk. Currently, however, individualized and appropriate prescription of the available HT products together with life-style management will sustain possibilities for beneficial effects on climacteric symptoms, quality of life and degenerative diseases after the menopause.

The primary outcome was assessing changes in plasma bone turnover markers. The secondary outcomes were assessing changes in cardiovascular risk markers including insulin resistance, blood pressure and lipid profile. We performed a double blind randomised parallel study where 200 women within 2 years after the onset of their menopause were randomised to 15 g soy protein with 66 mg isoflavone (SPI) or 15 g soy protein alone (SP), daily for 6 months. There was {{a significant reduction in}} type I collagen crosslinked Beta C-telopeptide (βCTX) (bone-resorption marker) with SPI supplementation (0. 40 ± 0. 17 vs. 0. 15 ± 0. 09 µg/L; p< 0. 01) compared to SP supplementation (0. 35 ± 0. 12 vs. 0. 35 ± 0. 13 µg/L; p= 0. 92) after 6 months. There was also a significant reduction in type I procollagen-N-propeptide (P 1 NP) (bone-formation marker) with SPI supplementation (50. 5 ± 25. 0 vs. 34. 3 ± 17. 6 µg/L; p< 0. 01), more marked between 3 and 6 month. Following SPI there was a significant reduction in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance and systolic blood pressure whereas no significant changes in these parameters was observed with SP. There were no significant changes in fasting lipid profile and diastolic blood pressure with either preparation. There was a significant increase in TSH and reduction in free thyroxine (p< 0. 01) with SPI supplementation though free tri-iodothyronine was unchanged. In conclusion, soy protein with isoflavones may confer a beneficial effect on bone health, analogous to the mode of action of anti-resorptive agents albeit to a less magnitude. There was a significant improvement of cardiovascular risk markers, but a significant increase in TSH and reduction in free thyroxine after SPI supplementation indicating a detrimental effect on thyroid function...|$|E

However, the joint effects of obesity and menopausal hormone therapy on endometrial cancer risk are incompletely understood. We addressed this issue in a cohort of 103, 882 women ages 50 to 71 years at baseline in 1995 to 1996. During a median of 4. 6 years, which contributed {{to a total of}} 455, 304 person-years of follow-up through 2000, 677 cases of endometrial cancer were ascer-tained. Both baseline body mass index (BMI) and adult weight gain were associated with increased endometrial cancer risk. The multivariate relative risk (RR) comparing obese with normal weight women (BMI> 30 versus < 25 kg/ m 2) was 3. 03 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 2. 50 - 3. 68]. Compared with women with stable weight (gained or lost < 5 kg) between age 18 and baseline, women who gained z 20 kg had a RR of 2. 75 (95 % CI, 1. 96 - 3. 86). Menopausal hormone therapy significantly modified the relations of BMI (P interaction < 0. 001) and adult weight gain (Pinteraction = 0. 004) to endometrial cancer risk. Compared with normal weight, the RRs for obesity were 5. 41 (95 % CI, 4. 01 - 7. 29) among women who never used menopausal hormone therapy, 2. 53 (95 % CI, 1. 21 - 5. 30) among former menopausal hormone therapy users, and 1. 44 (95 % CI, 1. 00 - 2. 05) among current users.

In this comprehensive review we consider strengths and weaknesses of more than 35 residential and occupational epidemiologic studies that investigated the association between EMF and breast cancer.

40|$|In our {{cross-sectional}} study we investigated the separate influence of three main factors, namely <b>menopausal</b> and <b>estrogen</b> status, and chronological age, on ten neurovegetative climacteric complaints {{reported in the}} scale of Kupperman et al. A multivariate {{statistical analysis was performed}} by a multivariate statistical approach on 1161 untreated women seen at the Menopause Center of the Ferrara University Hospital. Ninety women (age range, 41 - 54 years) were premenopausal; 492 women (age range, 38 - 55 years) were perimenopausal with irregular periods or amenorrhea for less than 12 months; 468 women (age range, 41 - 69 years) had a spontaneous menopause (age range, 37 - 66 years); 111 had had hysterectomy with bilateral ovariectomy while still regularly menstruating. Serum estrone was used as the indicator of the patients' estrogen status. A clear positive trend was demonstrated between menopausal status and the prevalence of depression, hot flushes, insomnia and joint pain. However, only the prevalence of hot flushes amongst these four symptoms was significantly related with the climacteric estrogen decline (beta = - 0. 006, P = 0. 001). Moreover, menopausal status appeared to influence the intensity of fatigue, hot flushes, insomnia and paresthesia. Age was found to significantly (P = 0. 053) co-vary only with the intensity of the hot flushes, with a positive relation (beta = 0. 092, r = 0. 104, P = 0. 003), whereas estrone values did not significantly co-vary with any symptom. Furthermore, while neurovegetative symptoms are largely present also in the absence of hot flushes, when these latter are present, they exacerbate both the intensity and the prevalence of all the other symptom...|$|R
40|$|Besides their {{key role}} in reproduction, estrogens have effects in several organs in the body, as {{confirmed}} by the identification of estrogen receptors (ER) in multiple tissues. Experimental evidence has shown that estrogens have significant impacts on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), and a key question is to what extent the fall in estrogen levels in the blood that occurs with increasing age, particularly around and following the menopause, has an impact on the cognitive function and psychological health of women, specifically regarding mood. This review will consider direct effects of <b>menopausal</b> changes in <b>estrogens</b> on the brain, including cognitive function and mood. Secondary pathways whereby health factors affected by changes in estrogens may interact with CNS functions, such as cardiovascular factors, will be reviewed as well insofar as they also have an impact on cognitive function. Finally, because decline in estrogens may induce changes in the CNS, there is interest in clarifying whether hormone therapy may offer a beneficial balance and the impact of hormone therapy on cognition will also be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Labial adhesions {{are common}} in young girls and <b>menopausal</b> women. Topical <b>estrogen</b> is {{the first line of}} therapy for these adhesions. Based on a {{systematic}} literature review, postpartum labial adhesions are uncommon in clinical practice. They are not painful but can prevent patients from resum-ing normal sexual activity. Topical estrogen therapy is an ineffective treatment option for adhesions in this setting. Surgical division under local anesthesia is usually effective. Case: A 29 -year-old women presented at 6 weeks after an uncomplicated vacuum-assisted delivery for a routine postpartum evaluation. Examination revealed a 5 -mm labial adhesion connecting her left and right labia minora. Division under local anesthetic resulted in a complete recovery within 3 days. Conclusion: Postpartum labial adhesions can usually be surgically divided under local anesthetic with complete and rapid recovery. (J Am Board Fam Med 2007; 20 : 408 – 410.) Labial adhesions {{are common in}} young girls and occasionally occur in elderly women. 1 It is hypoth-esized that the relative hypoestrogenic states of these age groups predispose them to labial adhe-sions. 2 Although surgical dissection is sometime...|$|R
40|$|Background: Soft drink {{consumption}} {{may have}} {{adverse effects on}} bone mineral density (BMD), but studies have shown mixed results. In addition to displacing healthier beverages, colas contain caffeine and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4), which may adversely affect bone. Objective: We hypothesized that consumption of cola is associated with lower BMD. Design: BMD was measured at the spine and 3 hip sites in 1413 women and 1125 men in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Dietary intake was assessed by food-frequency questionnaire. We regressed each BMD measure on the frequency of soft drink consumption {{for men and women}} after adjustment for body mass index, height, age, energy intake, physical activity score, smoking, alcohol use, total calcium intake, total vitamin D intake, caffeine from noncola sources, season of measurement, and, for women, <b>menopausal</b> status and <b>estrogen</b> use. Results: Cola intake was associated with significantly lower (P < 0. 0019 ̆ 60. 05) BMD at each hip site, but not the spine, in women but not in men. The mean BMD of those with daily cola intake was 3. 7...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} relation between estrogen replacement therapy {{and the rate of}} restenosis after coronary angioplasty and atherectomy. Background. Although estrogen replacement therapy in women has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events and improvement in endothelial function, no study has examined whether estrogen reduces restenosis rates after percutaneous coronary interventions. Methods. A total of 204 women enrolled in the Coronary Angioplasty Versus Excisional Atherectomy Trial with angiographic follow-up were contacted, and their <b>menopausal</b> and <b>estrogen</b> replacement status was determined. Late loss in minimal lumen diameter, late loss index, minimal lumen diameter, rate of restenosis > 50 % and actual percent of stenosis were compared in estrogen users and nonusers by quantitative coronary angiography at 6 -month follow-up. Results. Late loss in minimal lumen diameter was significantly less in women using estrogen than in nonusers (− 0. 13 vs. − 0. 46 mm, p = 0. 01). A regression analysis of the determinants of late loss in minimal lumen diameter revealed that estrogen use was the single most important predictor of subsequent late loss (F = 13. 38, p = 0. 0006). Formal testing revealed a highly significant interaction between the use of estrogen and intervention (angioplasty or atherectomy). Women undergoing atherectomy who received estrogen had a significantly lower late loss index (0. 06 vs. − 0. 63, p = 0. 002), less late loss (0. 06 vs. − 0. 61 mm, p = 0. 0006), larger minimal lumen diameter (p = 0. 044) and lower restenosis rates (p = 0. 038 for > 50 % stenosis) than those not using estrogen. In contrast, estrogen had minimal effects on restenosis end points after angioplasty. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the potential for estrogen replacement therapy to reduce angiographic measures of restenosis in postmenopausal women after coronary intervention, particularly in those undergoing atherectomy...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{provided}} inconclusive results relating hexachlorobenzene (HCB), an organochlorine fungicide, to female breast cancer risk. The current study, {{with a total}} of 304 breast cancer cases and 186 controls recruited in Connecticut between 1994 and 1997, examined the association by directly comparing breast adipose tissue levels of HCB between incident breast cancer cases and noncancer controls. The cases and controls were patients who had breast biopsies or surgery at the Yale-New Haven Hospital (New Haven, CT) and histologically diagnosed either as breast cancer or benign breast disease. Information on major known or suspected risk factors for breast cancer was obtained through in-person interview by trained interviewers. No significant difference in mean breast adipose tissue levels of HCB was observed between breast cancer patients (21. 0 ppb) and controls (19. 1 ppb) in this large case-control study. The risk also did not vary significantly by <b>menopausal</b> status, <b>estrogen</b> or progesterone receptor status of the breast cancer cases, breast cancer histology, stage of diagnosis, or type of benign breast disease. Among parous women who reported ever breast feeding, an odds ratio (OR) of 0. 5 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 2 – 1. 4] was observed when the highest quartile was compared with the lowest quartile. However, no association was observed among parous women who reported never breast feeding (OR 5 0. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 3 – 1. 7 for the fourth quartile). For nulliparous women, the adjusted OR was 2. 1 (95 % CI, 0. 5 – 8. 8) for the third tertile when compared with the lowest based on few subjects. Therefore, our study does not support a positive association between environmental exposure to HCB and risk of breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Premenopausal women {{demonstrate}} preferential {{accumulation of}} adiposity in the gynoid region, a distribution which shifts towards the abdominal region after the <b>menopausal</b> transition. Although <b>estrogen</b> is implicated {{as a major}} player in determining body fat distribution the mechanisms behind estrogenic action(s) in adipose tissue of women are still unclear. The global aim of this project was to determine if local estrogen influences regional adiposity in premenopausal women. Specifically, we investigated the influence of local estradiol on adipose tissue lipolysis as well as estrogen receptor content and adipocyte size in abdominal and gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue of overweight-to-moderately-obese premenopausal women. Eighteen overweight-to-moderately obese Caucasian (CA, n= 9) and African American (AA, n= 9) women were recruited. Between 15 and 17 of these women took part {{in each of the three}} studies. We found the influence of estradiol on lipolysis to be adipose tissue depot specific and treatment dependent, with estradiol perfusion blunting the response to lipolytic stimulation under some conditions while potentiating this response in others. Furthermore, we found differences in abdominal and gluteal estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) protein content, potentially revealing region specific actions of estrogen through thes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the contribution of}} genetic and nongenetic factors to biological aging in American Caucasians. The studied sample included 1402 members of 288 pedigrees from the Framingham Heart Study. The original cohort participants received hand radiography in 1967 – 1969 (mean age, 58. 7 years) and their offspring in 1992 – 1993 (mean age, 51. 6 years). An osseographic score was applied to hand radiographs. Standardized residuals between Osseographic Scoring System-predicted age and actual age were used {{as a measure of}} biological age (BA). In variance component genetic analysis, sex, cohort, height, body mass index, and, in women, <b>menopausal</b> status and <b>estrogen</b> use, jointly explained approximately 6 % of the total variance of BA. Genetic factors explained an additional 57 %. Linkage analysis of covariate-adjusted BA suggested the presence of quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 3 p, 7 q, 11 p, 16 q, and 21 q. In conclusion, the variation in BA measured by radiography was strongly governed by genetic factors in a sample of American adults. INTERPERSONAL health differences tend to accumulateand increase as a population ages; the health status among elderly individuals therefore commonly shows tremendous variation. Measurement of the variability see...|$|R
40|$|Limiting energy-dense foods, fast foods, and sugary drinks {{that promote}} weight gain is a cancer {{prevention}} recommendation, but no studies have evaluated intake {{in relation to}} breast cancer risk in African American (AA) women. In a case-control study with 1692 AA women (803 cases and 889 controls) and 1456 European American (EA) women (755 cases and 701 controls), odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for risk were computed, stratifying for <b>menopausal</b> and <b>estrogen</b> receptor (ER) status. Among postmenopausal EA women, breast cancer risk was associated with frequent consumption of energy-dense foods (OR = 2. 95; 95 % CI: 1. 66 - 5. 22), fast foods (OR = 2. 35; 95 % CI: 1. 38 - 4. 00), and sugary drinks (OR = 2. 05; 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 3. 70). Elevated risk of ER+ tumors in EA women was associated with energy-dense (OR = 1. 75; 95 % CI: 1. 14 - 2. 69) and fast foods (OR = 1. 84; 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 2. 77). Among AA women, frequent fast food consumption was related to premenopausal breast cancer risk (OR = 1. 97; 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 3. 43), and with ER+ tumors. Energy adjustment attenuated risk estimates in AA women, while strengthening them among EA women. Frequent consumption of energy-dense and fast foods that have poor nutritive value appeared to increase breast cancer risk in AA and EA women, with differences by menopausal status and ER status. 1 US 58 DP 003931 - 01 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesK 22 CA 138563 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesK 22 CA 138563 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesN 01 PC- 2010 - 00027 /PC/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesP 01 CA 151135 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesP 01 CA 151135 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesP 30 CA 072720 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 CA 100598 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 CA 100598 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States 2015 - 10 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25265504 PMC 420162...|$|R
