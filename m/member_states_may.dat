2500|$|However, {{after an}} {{evaluation}} {{carried out by}} the European Commission (EC) on the water reuse standards of several member states it was concluded that they differ in their approach. There are important divergences among the different standards regarding the permitted uses, the parameters to be monitored, and the limit values allowed. This lack of harmonization among water reuse standards might create some trade barriers for agricultural goods irrigated with reclaimed water. Once on the common market, the level of safety in the producing <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>may</b> be not considered as sufficient by the importing countries.

2500|$|On 26 June 2003, EU farm ministers {{adopted a}} {{fundamental}} {{reform of the}} CAP, based on [...] "decoupling" [...] subsidies from particular crops. (<b>Member</b> <b>states</b> <b>may</b> choose to maintain {{a limited amount of}} specific subsidy.) The new [...] "single farm payments" [...] are subject to [...] "cross-compliance" [...] conditions relating to environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. Many of them were already either good practice recommendations or separate legal requirements regulating farm activities. The aim is to make more money available for environmental quality or animal welfare programmes. The political scientist Peter Nedergaard has analysed the 2003 reform on the basis of rational choice theory and states that, [...] "In order to arrive at an adequate explanation, an account of the policy entrepreneurship on the part of Commissioner Franz Fischler must be given." ...|$|E
2500|$|Protection of European {{consumers}} {{has been}} {{a central part of}} developing the EU internal market. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 169 enables the EU to follow the ordinary legislative procedure to protect consumers [...] "health, safety and economic interests" [...] and promote rights to [...] "information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests". All <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>may</b> grant higher protection, and a [...] "high level of consumer protection" [...] is regarded as a fundamental right. Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the Product Liability Directive 1985, Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993, Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005 and the Consumer Rights Directive 2011, requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they shop, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the Consumer Bill of Rights proclaimed by John F. Kennedy in 1962. The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the need for more consumer rights (than in commercial contracts) both because consumers tend to lack information, and they have less bargaining power.|$|E
2500|$|As the European Union {{has grown}} from 6 to 28 member states, a clear {{procedure}} for accession of members is set out in TEU article 49. The European Union is only open to a [...] "European" [...] state which respects the principles of [...] "human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, {{the rule of law}} and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities". Countries whose territory is wholly outside the European continent cannot therefore apply. Nor can any country without fully democratic political institutions which ensure standards of [...] "pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail". Article 50 says any member state can withdraw in accord [...] "with its own constitutional requirements", by negotiated [...] "arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union". This indicates that the EU is not entitled to demand a withdrawal, and that member states should follow constitutional procedures, for example, through Parliament or a codified constitutional document. Once article 50 is triggered, there is a two-year time limit to complete negotiations, a procedure which would leave a seceding member without any bargaining power in negotiations, because the costs of having no trade treaty would be proportionally greater to the individual state than the remaining EU bloc. Article 7 allows member states to be suspended for a [...] "clear risk of a serious breach" [...] of values in article 2 (for example, democracy, equality, human rights) with a four-fifths vote of the Council of the European Union, and the consent of the Parliament. Within the treaties' framework, sub-groups of <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>may</b> make further rules that only apply to those member states who want them. For example, the Schengen Agreements of 1985 and 1990 allow people to move without any passport or ID checks anywhere in the EU, but did not apply to the UK or Ireland. More recently, during the Eurozone crisis, the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism 2012 and the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance 2012 (the [...] "Fiscal Compact") were adopted only for member states who had the Euro (i.e. not Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania or Bulgaria). This required, among other things, a pledge to balance the government budget and limit structural deficits to 0.5 per cent of GDP, with fines for non-compliance. The jurisdiction for these rules remains with the Court of Justice.|$|E
50|$|All systems {{prescribed}} higher thresholds {{for passing}} acts {{that were not}} proposed by the Commission. <b>Member</b> <b>states</b> have to cast their votes en bloc (i.e., a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>may</b> not split its votes). Hence, the number of votes rather describes {{the weight of a}} member's single vote.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Article 31 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 35) {{states that}} courts of one <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>may</b> give provisional, {{including}} protective, measures although courts in another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> have jurisdiction {{as to the}} substance of the matter. This is an expression {{of the fact that the}} jurisdictional rules of the Brussels I Regulation do not regulate provisional measures; consequently, the competent court of any <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>may</b> give such measures “without regard to the rules of jurisdiction laid down in the Convention”. However, importantly, the measures given must be provisional only: they must be “intended to preserve a factual or legal situation so as to safeguard rights the recognition of which is sought elsewhere from the court having jurisdiction as to {{the substance of the}} matter”.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>may</b> allow a {{derogation}} {{for public}} lending (i.e. public libraries) provided that authors obtain some royalties 5(1). <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>may</b> also exempt [...] "certain categories of establishments" [...] from {{the payment of}} royalties 5(2). These provisions is interpreted strictly: Portugal has been censured for a transposition which effectively exempted all public institutions from payment of royalties, and Belgium for failing to set a rate of remuneration (making its collection impossible).|$|E
50|$|The EC Treaty {{lays down}} the {{principle}} that the self-employed (whether working in commercial, industrial or craft occupations or the liberal professions) the economic operators, established in the territory of a <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>may</b> exercise an economic activity in all <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in two ways. Self-employed person and professionals or legal persons, {{within the meaning of}} article 48 EC Treaty, who are legally acting in one <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>may</b> carry on an economic activity in a stable and continuous way in another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (freedom of establishment: Article 43) or offer and provide their services in other <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> on a temporary basis while remaining in their country of origin (freedom to provide services: Article 49). This implies eliminating discrimination on the grounds of nationality and, if these freedoms are to be used effectively, the adoption of measures {{to make it easier to}} exercise them, especially harmonisation of national access rules or their mutual recognition.|$|R
5000|$|Withdrawal {{from the}} European Union {{is the legal}} and {{political}} process whereby a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> of the European Union ceases {{to be a member}} of the union. <b>Member</b> <b>states</b> have the right to withdraw from the Union under the Treaty on European Union (TEU), Article 50, which states that: [...] "Any <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>may</b> decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements." ...|$|R
