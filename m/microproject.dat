We approach this question from two points of view that require: 1) some substantial methodological changes and 2) some changes on how to approach the content. We wish to focus here on teachers training in primary education in Argentina. We present a way to integrate methodology and content: the <b>Microproject</b> and we report an experience with Argentinian pre-service teachers.

First, it shows how the Mediterranean has become an area for democracy assistance. Second, it focuses on {{the implementation of the}} European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), with a special emphasis on <b>microprojects</b> funded in the Mediterranean, showing the gaps between discourse and practice. Finally, the article briefly sketches the current format of the EIDHR, which covers 2007 - 13, questioning whether it represents an improvement. The overall goal is to offer a starting point to readers interested in the topic, by summarizing historical developments of democracy assistance in the EU, its legal framework and issues arising from its implementation in the Mediterranean...|$|R
50|$|When the {{original}} BBC Micro version was converted for the Acorn Electron, the screen mode was changed from four colours to two {{because of the}} Electron's inferior video speed. The extra RAM freed up by the smaller frame buffer {{made it possible to}} include extra levels (bringing the total to nine against the BBC's three) and a screen designer which was not in the BBC original. The C64 version was written by <b>MicroProjects</b> Limited (Jason Perkins, Anthony Clarke & Mark Rogers) who were subcontracted by Statesoft to do the conversion. It has six levels. The BBC version had a higher resolution than the C64 and so some of the active playing area was off the screen, and has a distinct graphical style and catchy background music (different for each level).|$|R
40|$|The {{teaching}} experience we present is {{closely linked to}} research, {{considered part of the}} action of training teachers. In the new curriculum, adapted to the European Higher Education Area and valid throughout the European continent, a Final Degree Work (TFG) was introduced to the last semester of training, which must demonstrate a received comprehensive training in all subjects. We planned a TFG model in which students interrelate knowledge, professional practice and research. This type of TFG is based on the Emergent Educational Model that we have elaborated. In the current course we have carried out and analyzed four examples in which ethnomathematics is introduced as a foundation, <b>microprojects</b> focusing on different cultural signs are elaborated, and the interrelationship of the various sciences are reflected upon, creating awareness that research is a necessary element in teacher education. We describe the MED model of teacher education, the didactic teaching construct called micro-project, and the type of TFG designed, along with four examples thereof...|$|R

Curs acadèmic: 2016 / 2017 The {{financial}} sector {{plays a key}} role in long-term sustainable development and is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have as their goal the "end of poverty" (1 ST SDG). In this context, microfinance, and in particular microcredit, appears to be an appropriate tool for combating poverty, through the financing of <b>microprojects,</b> for those in a situation of social and financial exclusion. For this reason, the objective of this study is to analyze, through descriptive statistics, how microcredits can be an instrument to help eradicate poverty by studying the particular case of Bangladesh where this financing source is most widespread. Data for the analysis will be provided by the Grameen Bank and the World Bank. The results show that microloans can have a significant influence on certain economic variables and society in Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|The article {{shows how}} and why, after having agreed upon a {{programme}} for democracy assistance {{under the name}} of European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), the EU fell short of its original objectives in programme implementation. This is demonstrated by close analysis of <b>microprojects</b> in Mediterranean countries. The scope of EU action shrank as priorities for action were defined and projects approved. As a consequence, the EU has promoted democracy less than human rights, in relatively less demanding countries, and without spending all the budgeted money. This article shows how {{these findings are consistent with}} important themes in Policy analysis and implementation research, and thus supplements other explanations of EU shortcomings. EU democracy assistance, as represented by the EIDHR, is an ambiguous and contested policy, which also suffers from an institutional setting characterized by a long chain of command. This means that there are opportunities for small decisions to gradually shift the focus and downsize the relevance of the policy initiative. The EU is thus unintentionally undermining its own policy goals, as the large number of actors interpret the EU's best interest (and their own position in relation to it) in various and divergent way...|$|R
40|$|This study forms part of {{the output}} of a {{consultancy}} on Social Development Funds in Zimbabwe and Malawi commissioned from Chr. Michelsen Institute by the African Development Bank. It describes, analyses and evaluates selected <b>microprojects</b> and microcredit schemes in Malawi {{from the perspective of}} Social Dimensions of Adjustment programming and poverty alleviation objectives. The study assesses the context and dimensions of poverty in Malawi, especially in its Poverty Alleviation Programme, in particular community based and microcredit components. It evaluates the design, implementation and performance of four recent microcredit schemes: the UNDP pilot microenterprise programme, the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Fund, microenterprise projects funded under the SDA pilot programme and the Malawi Mudzi Fund; and concludes with recommendations on possible forms of follow-up interventions by the ADB.

30|$|Most MFIs {{admit that}} many clients use loans {{to pay for}} medical expenses, funerals, or to smooth {{household}} cash flow. Even {{if they do not}} have an immediate emergency, some customers only invest a portion of the loan in their businesses and save the rest so that they will have a cushion to fall back on if they experience repayment problems (Churchill 2002). These assertions support the argument that in the absence of significant assets and other risk mitigation mechanisms, the poor lack the capacity to withstand the consequences of many shocks (Cohen et al. 2005). A study in Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya shows that for the poor, the impact of a shock follows a two-step process: the immediate impact of the loss of assets and/or income and need of money, and the impact in the medium and long term that requires strategic choices coming from households, particularly in terms of resource reallocation (Barlet 2000). Thus, a shock that would prove mild to upper- and middle-income households can, {{in the case of a}} poor household, dramatically reduce assets (including stocks of physical and human capital), reduce or eliminate income sources, lead to reduced consumption, and ultimately put present and future generations of the poor deeper into poverty. The vulnerability is directly related to the ability of households to manage risk (Barlet 2000). To cope with shocks, poor households use many different risk management strategies, including informal group-based and self-insurance mechanisms, such as borrowing, saving, and drawing down productive and nonproductive assets. A relatively new option for the working poor to manage risk is microinsurance. Indeed, for a low-income person, usually the beneficiaries of microcredit for the implementation of <b>microprojects,</b> microinsurance paves the way for better risk management and helps reduce vulnerabilities to shocks.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{assessment}} was to review community involvement, performance and generate a lessons’ learnt report that would contribute to decision-support mechanisms and inform future interventions. The assessment methodology included extensive review of relevant documentation, interviews with key informants, specifically the component coordinators and other stakeholders; field visits to selected project sites, observation and discussions with community members. In response {{to the terms of}} reference (TORs) and scope of work; the critical question to be answered was whether the significant role of community participation has been realized as envisaged in the project document and what evidence there is. To address this question it was critical to review outputs by objective and components as outlined in the TORs and scope of work. Across the components the broad guiding questions were: {{what is the nature of}} community participation, achievements and potential for sustainability, the challenges and lessons learnt from the community as well as project implementation. The findings indicate that community participation cuts across all components and activities undertaken by community groups are at various stages of implementation. While <b>microprojects</b> were a major boost for community participation, community groups were mobilized and engaged in other activities identified through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and flagged as opportunities. This was more evident within the soil and water conservation component. The activities have both direct and indirect relation to the sustenance of the environment. These are outlined and discussed within each of the relevant components. Community participation in the various project components has progressed at different paces. In general, Water hyacinth, Wetlands, Soil and Water Conservation, and Afforestation have progressed at a higher pace compared to Capacity building, Fisheries and Water Quality components. Fisheries Research by its orientation on research had little room for community participation. However, training in aquaculture was availed to farmers under the Capacity Building component through the Department of Fisheries, Moi University. Given the complexity of the project design, LVEMP, embracing the strategy of Community Participation has done remarkably well. There have been substantial achievements in most of the project components notably Catchment Afforestation and Soil and Water conservation where community participation is most evident. Nevertheless, it is observed that if there had been a more concerted focus on community participation at the inception of the project; implementation would have been smoother, faster and the achievements would have been greater...|$|R
40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{suitability}} of the evaluation criteria used in <b>Microprojects</b> Programme Trust (MPT), by looking at hard and soft components of the development programme. In this sense hard components of development refer to those components of projects that are tangible and can be physically observed and can bring material changes {{to the life of}} the community. Soft components of development refer to those components of projects that bring qualitative transformation {{to the life of the}} community, i. e. increased levels of awareness, human well-being and the empowerment process that addresses the community's abstract needs, these are not tangible and often cannot be physically observed. Midway through its contract periods MPT evaluate all projects. The purpose of these mid term evaluations is to make recommendations to MPT on future approaches and methodology for community development and operations. The mid-term evaluation also influences the distribution and allocation of resources and funding. It was therefore vital that the criteria used are subject to tests and critical analysis so as to assess their validity. The assessment of the mid-term evaluation criteria used in MPT projects has been to further determine the appropriateness or suitability of the evaluation criteria as an instrument to measure and guide the MPT community development approach in the Eastern Cape. The method used was to conduct focus group discussions so as to get an insight into the local community situation as well as to assess non-tangible improvements and changes that have occurred in the life of the community as a result of the project. The information generated was used to compare what the community believe they achieved with what the official mid-term evaluation reports indicate was assessed and achieved and that was contrasted with what the literature recommends should have been assessed. The study found that the mid-term evaluations conducted on MPT projects have no social context in which the evaluations themselves were conducted. The terms of reference and criteria were based on the programme design which was formulated and compiled by the European Union without the participation of the local South African community. The findings also indicated that projects become unsuccessful or partly successful if the "soft" components which have a bearing on social and economic realities are neglected. The thesis ends with recommendations on how the mid-term evaluations as well as MPT programme can be developed to be more responsive to the needs as identified by the communities themselves. It is strongly believed that this study will provide a valuable contribution towards increasing the ability of MPT programme to bring about both material and qualitative transformation to the I ives of the disadvantaged community of the Eastern Cape whilst ensuring that the mid-term evaluations are developed and shaped to become an appropriate instrument to measure and guide MPT programme approach to community development...|$|R
