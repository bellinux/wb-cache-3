30|$|Risk {{identification}} {{is the first}} step in the management process and aims to capture and record all potential causes of hazards. Risk evaluation entails assessing the magnitude of each risk based on its probability of occurrence and impact. This can be achieved using qualitative or quantities methods. The aim of the risk evaluation phase is to prioritize the risks separating the acceptable ones from those that will require treatment (HSE 2015 a). The results from the risk evaluation are then used to develop adequate measures at the risk response planning. In setting up responses to the evaluated risks, the response strategy usually employs a sequential hierarchy of measures that starts with eliminating the risk as a first priority, with the subsequent steps being to reduce, isolate, control, and implement safe systems of work or as a last resort employ the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (Butler 2014). The risk <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>phase</b> implements either proactive routine inspections or reactive examination after an incident has occurred. It aims to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented risk management measures. In combination, the phases of risk management provide a proven approach for risk prevention and reduction. Therefore, managing safety risks in the engineering industry requires knowledge and skills in the implementation of all the phases of the risk management process. It is expected that VE research studies for safety education and training address the needs of this process by covering all its core three phases (risk identification, risk evaluation, risk response planning). This paper also verifies this hypothesis by mapping the identified studies against the key phases of the risk management process.|$|E

CD-ROM IncludedProject Management constraints and operationalisation dimensions of Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) program Urban air pollution was becoming an issue in Sri Lanka especially towards late 1990 ’s. It was evident that the transport sector was the largest contributor to the overall total emissions for all pollutants. Analysis of air quality data had suggested the ever increasing vehicle fleetas the major culprit. Poor vehicle maintenance, absence of a system to <b>monitor,</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> regulate vehicular emissions, and low quality fuels contributed towards increased emissions from vehicles. Therefore, government intervention was required to reverse the trend of deteriorating air quality and mitigate the accompanying adverse health effects caused by exposure to fine particles, lead and other vehicular emissions. With the roles, responsibilities and expertise dispersed within several organizations, to curb air pollution, in year 2001, created Air Resource Management Center (AirMAC) : a multistakeholder organization as a strong partnership institution linking all stakeholder agencies. AirMAC initiated Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) to <b>monitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> level of emission generated by vehicles in Sri Lanka in 2008. The main sponsoring body of the VET programme is Ministry of Environment in Sri Lanka. This {{study was conducted to}} determine critical constraints to the effective implementation of VET programme in Sri Lanka, particularly from a project management perspective. Its strengths and weaknesses are analysed to propose ways and means to improve its effectiveness and efficiency in the long term. The key findings of this case study categorized under 3 main development areas. The policy measures area includes programme administration, and financial mechanism of VET Trust Fund and has identified several planning and executing issues. Stakeholders’ goals and rewards areas how clear communication gaps and problems with stakeholders’ participation. In the benchmarking and standardization aspects of the VET programme during the <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>phases</b> were found several issues arising due to creation of competition, weakness of data and software management, lack of a roadside vehicle emission testing programme, VET centre inspection programme, non-implementation of liquidated damages or penalties for breach of test procedureand so on.

TSSA are created using a real-time IRIG-B signal generator and power system models are executed using a real-time simulator with commercial phasor measurement units (PMUs) coupled to them as hardware-in-the-loop. Because PMUs utilize time synchronization signals to compute synchrophasors, an error in the PMUs’ time input introduces a proportional phase error in the voltage or current phase measurements provided by the PMU. The experiments conclude that a phase angle monitoring application will show erroneous power transfers, whereas the anti-islanding protection mal-operates and the damping controller introduces negative damping in {{the system as a}} result of the time synchronization error incurred in the PMUs due to TSSA.

40|$|The {{investments}} {{have always}} been considered as an essential backbone and so-called ‘locomotive’ for the competitive economies. However, in various countries, the state has been put under tight budget constraints for the investments in capital intensive projects. In response to this situation, the cooperation {{between public and private}} sector has grown based on public-private mechanism. The promotion of favorable arrangement for collaboration between public and private sectors for the provision of policies, services, and infrastructure in Russia can help to address the problems of dry ports development that neither municipalities nor the private sector can solve alone. Especially, the stimulation of public-private collaboration is significant under the exposure to externalities that affect the magnitude of the risks during all phases of project realization. In these circumstances, the risk in the projects also is becoming increasingly a part of joint research and risk management practice, which is viewed as a key approach, aiming to take active actions on existing global and specific factors of uncertainties. Meanwhile, a relatively little progress has been made on the inclusion of the resilience aspects into the planning process of a dry ports construction that would instruct the capacity planner, on how to mitigate the occurrence of disruptions that may lead to million dollars of losses due to the deviation of the future cash flows from the expected financial flows on the project. The current experience shows that the existing methodological base is developed fragmentary within separate steps of supply chain risk management (SCRM) processes: risk identification, risk evaluation, risk mitigation, risk <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>phases.</b> The lack of the systematic approach hinders the solution of the problem of risk management processes of dry port implementation. Therefore, management of various risks during the investments phases of dry port projects still presents a considerable challenge from the practical and theoretical points of view. In this regard, the given research became a logical continuation of fundamental research, existing in the financial models and theories (e. g., capital asset pricing model and real option theory), as well as provided a complementation for the portfolio theory. The goal of the current study is in the design of methods and models for the facilitation of dry port implementation through the mechanism of public-private partnership on the national market that implies the necessity to mitigate, first and foremost, the shortage of the investments and consequences of risks. The problem of the research was formulated on the ground of the identified contradictions. They rose as a continuation of the trade-off between the opportunities that the investors can gain from the development of terminal business in Russia (i. e. dry port implementation) and risks. As a rule, the higher the investment risk, the greater should be their expected return. However, investors have a different tolerance for the risks. That is why it would be advisable to find an optimum investment. In the given study, the optimum relates to the search for the efficient portfolio, which can provide satisfaction to the investor, depending on its degree of risk aversion. There are many theories and methods in finance, concerning investment choices. Nevertheless, the appropriateness and effectiveness of particular methods should be considered with the allowance of the specifics of the investment projects. For example, the investments in dry ports imply not only the lump sum of financial inflows, but also the long-term payback periods. As a result, capital intensity and longevity of their construction determine the necessity from investors to ensure the return on investment (profitability), along with the rapid return on investment (liquidity), without precluding the fact that the stochastic nature of the project environment is hardly described by the formula-based approach. The current theoretical base for the economic appraisals of the dry port projects more often perceives net present value (NPV) as a technique superior to other decision-making criteria. For example, the portfolio theory, which considers different risk preference of an investor and structures of utility, defines net present value as a better criterion of project appraisal than discounted payback period (DPP). Meanwhile, in business practice, the DPP is more popular. Knowing that the NPV is based on the assumptions of certainty of project life, it cannot be an accurate appraisal approach alone {{to determine whether or not}} the project should be accepted for the approval in the environment that is not without of uncertainties. In order to reflect the period or the project’s useful life that is exposed to risks due to changes in political, operational, and financial factors, the second capital budgeting criterion – discounted payback period is profoundly important, particularly for the Russian environment. Those statements represent contradictions that exist in the theory and practice of the applied science. Therefore, it would be desirable to relax the assumptions of portfolio theory and regard DPP as not fewer relevant appraisal approach for the assessment of the investment and risk measure. At the same time, the rationality of the use of both project performance criteria depends on the methods and models, with the help of which these appraisal approaches are calculated in feasibility studies. The deterministic methods cannot ensure the required precision of the results, while the stochastic models guarantee the sufficient level of the accuracy and reliability of the obtained results, providing that the risks are properly identified, evaluated, and mitigated. Otherwise, the project performance indicators may not be confirmed during the phase of project realization. For instance, the economic and political instability can result in the undoing of hard-earned gains, leading to the need for the attraction of the additional finances for the project. The sources of the alternative investments, as well as supportive mitigation strategies, can be studied during the initial phases of project development. During this period, the effectiveness of the investments undertakings can also be improved by the inclusion of the various investors, e. g. Russian Railways’ enterprises and other private companies in the dry port projects. However, the evaluation of the effectiveness of the participation of different investors in the project lack the methods and models that would permit doing the particular feasibility study, foreseeing the quantitative characteristics of risks and their mitigation strategies, which can meet the tolerance of the investors to the risks. For this reason, the research proposes a combination of Monte Carlo method, discounted cash flow technique, the theory of real options, and portfolio theory via a system dynamics simulation approach. The use of this methodology allows for comprehensive risk management process of dry port development to cover all aspects of risk identification, risk evaluation, risk mitigation, risk <b>monitoring,</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>phases.</b> A designed system dynamics model can be recommended for the decision-makers on the dry port projects that are financed via a public-private partnership. It permits investors to make a decision appraisal based on random variables of net present value and discounted payback period, depending on different risks factors, e. g. revenue risks, land acquisition risks, traffic volume risks, construction hazards, and political risks. In this case, the statistical mean is used for the explication of the expected value of the DPP and NPV; the standard deviation is proposed as a characteristic of risks, while the elasticity coefficient is applied for rating of risks. Additionally, the risk of failure of project investments and guaranteed recoupment of capital investment can be considered with the help of the model. On the whole, the application of these modern methods of simulation creates preconditions for the controlling of the process of dry port development, i. e. making managerial changes and identifying the most stable parameters that contribute to the optimal alternative scenarios of the project realization in the uncertain environment. System dynamics model allows analyzing the interactions in the most complex mechanism of risk management process of the dry ports development and making proposals for the improvement of the effectiveness of the investments via an estimation of different risk management strategies. For the comparison and ranking of these alternatives in their order of preference to the investor, the proposed indicators of the efficiency of the investments, concerning the NPV, DPP, and coefficient of variation, can be used. Thus, rational investors, who averse to taking increased risks unless they are compensated by the commensurate increase in the expected utility of a risky prospect of dry port development, can be guided by the deduced marginal utility of investments. It is computed on the ground of the results from the system dynamics model. In conclusion, the outlined theoretical and practical implications for the management of risks, which are the key characteristics of public-private partnerships, can help analysts and planning managers in budget decision-making, substantially alleviating the effect from various risks and avoiding unnecessary cost overruns in dry port projects...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} a <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> system based on the {{client-server}} architecture and communicating in frames of TCP/IP communication protocol [...] The modularity of the system has prepared the good precondition for implementing the client application in the environment of any operating system equipped {{with the support of}} communication based on the TCP/IP protocol with BSD sockets network library. The local network <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> system has been debugged in the C-language in the OS Linux environment. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> system runs on both LAN and WAN Internet. That system is applied for <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> of real technological processes like fermentation temperature in local dimension area without direct connecting possibilities. The designed structure and its realisation have been proved in a real experiment with chromium tanned leather rests recycling process...|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} dependency of home appliances {{on human}} for <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> {{has been found}} to be mainly responsible for power wastage, and increase in the rate of wear and tear, which invariably implies additional spending on the part of owners. The smart technology provides a way out. This paper presents an automated system which is based on arduino and android device for <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> appliances to prevent the wastage of power. The system design is based on the Microcontroller MIKRO-C software, active sensors and wireless internet services which is used in different <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> processes of fan, air-conditioner, light and heater. The system when tested performs efficiently in <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>controlling</b> through switching the appliances in the room based on human presence and environmental changes due to light intensity and temperature variation...|$|R
