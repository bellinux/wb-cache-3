50|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the {{aldehyde}} dehydrogenases family of proteins. This enzyme {{plays a role in}} the valine and pyrimidine catabolic pathways. The product of this gene, a mitochondrial <b>methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde dehydrogenase, catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of malonate and <b>methylmalonate</b> semialdehydes to acetyl- and propionyl-CoA. <b>Methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is characterized by elevated beta-alanine, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and both isomers of 3-amino and 3-hydroxyisobutyric acids in urine organic acids. <b>Methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in this gene and the resulting protein.|$|E

50|$|Common {{treatment}} methods for MMA include {{a liver transplant}} or a liver and kidney transplant to combat the renal disease of methylmalonic acidemia. However, detrimental neurological effects can continue to plague patients even after a successful operation. It is thought that {{this is due to}} the widespread presence of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase throughout the central nervous system. Due to the loss of functionality of the enzyme, substrate levels build up in the CNS. The substrate, L-methylmalonyl-CoA hydrolyzes to form <b>methylmalonate</b> (methylmalonic acid), a neurotoxic dicarboxylic acid that, due to the poor dicarboxylic acid transport capacities of the blood-brain barrier, is effectively trapped within the CNS, leading to neurological debilitation. To combat these effects perioperative anti-catabolic regimes and no diet discontinuation are recommended.|$|E
50|$|Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is {{expressed}} in high concentrations in the kidney, in intermediate concentrations in the heart, ovaries, brain, muscle, and liver, and in low concentrations in the spleen. The enzyme can be found all throughout {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). MCM resides in the mitochondria, where a number of substances, including the branched-chain amino acids isoleucine and valine, as well as methionine, threonine, thymine and odd-chain fatty acids, are metabolized via <b>methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde (MMlSA) or propionyl-CoA (Pr-CoA) to a common compound - methylmalonyl-CoA (MMl-CoA).MCM catalyzes the reversible isomerisation of l‐methylmalonyl‐CoA to succinyl‐CoA, requiring cobalamin (vitamin B12) in the form of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) as a cofactor. As an important step in propionate catabolism, this reaction is required for the degradation of odd-chain fatty acids, the amino acids valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine, and cholesterol, funneling metabolites from the breakdown of these amino acids into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the ALDH6A1 gene are {{associated}} with <b>methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism with a highly variable phenotype. The disease is passed through autosomal recessive genetics. There have been many individual and familial case studies of this deficiency and the mutations that cause it. Some patients with this disease may be asymptomatic, whereas others show global developmental delay, nonspecific dysmorphic features, and delayed myelination on brain imaging. Meanwhile, some cases have been only identified through elevated levels of various acidic metabolites in the urine, notably 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid. This can result from an identified a homozygous 1336G-A transition in the gene, resulting in {{a change in the}} 446th residue from glycine to arginine. Another case study, a child from consanguineous patients, presented as significant hypotonia in infancy, poor feeding, and dysmorphic facial features, including narrowed, downslanting palpebral fissures, short convex nose with depressed nasal bridge, microphthalmia, cataracts, and adducted thumbs. Brain imaging showed delayed myelination and thinning of the corpus callosum. Laboratory studies showed 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria and mild lactic acidosis. Many case studies since then have presented similar symptoms, although the symptoms may be milder. The mutations identified are generally heterozygous missense mutations: S262Y, P62S, Y172H and R535C.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{establish}} a new gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method using a triple quadrupole which would allow for more sensitive quantification of changes in homocysteine, methionine and <b>methylmalonate</b> in small numbers of cultured cells and brain tissue. Homocysteine, methionine and <b>methylmalonate</b> are established markers of cobalamin deficiency. Methods: Cultured cells (1 x 106) and 5 mg of human brain were incubated with 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol in methanol for one hour at room temperature to reduce homocysteine disulfide bonds. Lipids were removed using methyl-tert-butyl ether and the aqueous phase derivatized with N-Methyl- N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA). Samples were subsequently analysed with a 7000 Agilent triple-quadrupole GC-MS. Multiple reaction monitoring was performed on the compounds in electron ionisation mode at 70 eV. Corresponding deuterated internal standards were used to quantify compounds. Results: We identified the following transitions: 420 - 3 ̆e 392, 318 424 - 3 ̆e 396, 322; 320 - 3 ̆e 292, 218, 323 - 3 ̆e 295, 221; 289 - 3 ̆e 189, 147 292 - 3 ̆e 192, which allowed for sensitive quantification of homocysteine, methionine and <b>methylmalonate</b> and their deuterated standards respectively. The lowest limits of detection for homocysteine, methionine and <b>methylmalonate</b> were found to be 0. 001 pM in three different cell lines and brain tissue. Sample preparation and analysis was complete in 4 h. Conclusion: Homocysteine, methionine and <b>methylmalonate</b> were successfully quantified in low cell numbers. This method is widely applicable for studies of cobalamin function in cells and has the potential advantage of conserving precious human tissue samples...|$|E
40|$|Genome {{sequence}} information {{suggests that}} B 12 -dependent mutases {{are present in}} a number of bacteria, including members of the suborder Corynebacterineae like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium glutamicum. We here functionally identify a methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) mutase in C. glutamicum that is retained in all {{of the members of the}} suborder Corynebacterineae and is encoded by NCgl 1471, NCgl 1472, and NCgl 1470. In addition, we observe the presence of <b>methylmalonate</b> in C. glutamicum, reaching concentrations of up to 757 nmol g (dry weight) − 1 in propionate-grown cells, whereas in Escherichia coli no <b>methylmalonate</b> was detectable. As demonstrated with a mutase deletion mutant, the presence of <b>methylmalonate</b> in C. glutamicum is independent of mutase activity but possibly due to propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity. During growth on propionate, increased mutase activity has severe cellular consequences, resulting in growth arrest and excretion of succinate.

40|$|Propionic and methylmalonic acidemia {{are both}} {{known to be}} {{associated}} with hyperammonemia. Rats injected with 10 or 20 mmol/kg of propionate or 20 mmol/kg of <b>methylmalonate,</b> along with 1. 5 g/kg of a mixture of amino acids, developed severe hyperammonemia, whereas rats administered the same dosages of acetate did not. In vitro, neither propionyl nor methylmalonyl CoA affected the activity of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I, ornithine transcarbamylase, nor the activation constant (KA) of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I for N-acetyl glutamate. Furthermore, rats injected with propionate showed no alteration of liver amino acid concentrations, which could explain impaired ureagenesis. Animals injected with <b>methylmalonate</b> showed an increase in both citrulline and aspartate, suggesting that argininosuccinic acid synthetase may also have been inhibited. Liver ATP levels were unchanged. Citrullinogenesis, measured in intact mitochondria from livers of injected animals, was reduced 20 - 25 % by 20 mmol/kg of propionate or <b>methylmalonate</b> (compared with acetate). This effect was attributable to an impairment in the normal rise of liver N-acetyl glutamate content after amino acid injection. Thus, carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activation was reduced. Liver levels of acetyl CoA and free CoA were reduced. Levels of unidentified acyl CoA derivatives rose, presumably reflecting the accumulation of propionyl and methylmalonyl CoA. Thus, the principal mechanism for hyperammonemia induced by these acids is depletion of liver N-acetyl glutamate, which is in turn attributable to depletion of acetyl CoA and/or competitive inhibition by propionyl and methylmalonyl CoA of N-acetyl glutamate synthetase. Injection of <b>methylmalonate</b> may also have an additional inhibitory effect on argininosuccinic acid synthetase...|$|E

Total odd-numbered long-chain fatty acids (C 15 : 0, C 17 : 1 and C 17 : 0) were expressed as a percentage of total C 12 -C 20 fatty acids. Control values were 0. 72 % +/- 0. 31 % (n = 12). Normalization of the percentage of odd-chain fatty acids occurred in all vitamin-responsive patients, following the institution of vitamin treatment.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} with aged nuclear-free homogenate of sheep liver and aged mitochondria {{in an attempt to}} measure both the extent of oxidation of propionate and the distribution of label from [2 - 14 C]propionate in the products. With nuclear-free homogenate, propionate was 44 % oxidized with the accumulation of succinate, fumarate, malate and some citrate. Recovery of 14 C in these intermediates and respiratory carbon dioxide was only 33 %, but additional label was detected in endogenous glutamate and aspartate. With washed mitochondria 30 % oxidation of metabolized propionate occurred, and proportionately more citrate and malate accumulated. Recovery of 14 C in dicarboxylic acids, citrate, α-oxoglutarate, glutamate, aspartate and respiratory carbon dioxide was 91 %. The specific activities of the products and the distribution of label in the carbon atoms of the dicarboxylic acids were consistent with the operation solely of the <b>methylmalonate</b> pathway together with limited oxidation of the succinate formed by the tricarboxylic acid cycle via pyruvate.

40|$|Homotetrameric MSDH (<b>methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde dehydrogenase) from Bacillus subtilis catalyses the NAD-dependent {{oxidation}} of MMSA (<b>methylmalonate</b> semialdehyde) and MSA (malonate semialdehyde) into PPCoA (propionyl-CoA) and acetyl-CoA respectively via a two-step mechanism. In {{the present}} study, a detailed mechanistic {{characterization of the}} MSDH-catalysed reaction has been carried out. The results suggest that NAD binding elicits a structural imprinting of the apoenzyme, which explains the marked lag-phase observed in the activity assay. The enzyme also exhibits a half-of-the-sites reactivity, with two subunits being active per tetramer. This result correlates well {{with the presence of}} two populations of catalytic Cys 302 in both the apo- and holo-enzymes. Binding of NAD causes a decrease in reactivity of the two Cys 302 residues belonging to the two active subunits and a pKapp shift from approx.   8. 8 to 8. 0. A study of the rate of acylation as a function of pH revealed a decrease in the pKapp of the two active Cys 302 residues to approx.   5. 5. Taken to-gether, these results support a sequential Cys 302 activation process with a pKapp shift from approx.   8. 8 in the apo-form to 8. 0 in the binary complex and finally to approx.   5. 5 in the ternary complex. The rate-limiting step is associated with the β-decarboxylation process which occurs on the thioacylenzyme intermediate after NADH release and before transthioesterification.

30|$|Herbert (1994) stated: “holoTCII {{will always}} be low before there is a rise in <b>methylmalonate</b> or {{homocysteine}} if that rise {{is due to a}} vitamin B- 12 deficiency.” This alternative model proposes an additional principle; that any fall in HoloTC, to below normal for the individual, must result in a disturbed metabolism and a rise in the metabolites. How quickly this happens depends on how much vitamin B 12 is stored in the cells; this varies between cell types; some cells, including nerve cells and some blood cells, have very small vitamin B 12 stores. For example, as stated by Herbert (1994) “Lack of delivery of vitamin B- 12 to the glial cells of the brain quickly wipes out their small vitamin B- 12 stores, after which they become vitamin B- 12 deficient”.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{vulnerability of}} the striatum and of subpopulations of cells within the striatum to many acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions has been well established. Neurodegenerative events such as ischemia, Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease and ingestion of mitochondrial toxins which target the striatum share the common feature of energetic failure as a critical {{early part of the}} cell death process. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate how striatal cells respond to energetic failure, to determine if these neurons are more inherently vulnerable to mitochondrial inhibition than other kinds of neurons and to evaluate the role of the unique circuitry of the striatum in mediating selective striatal cell death. The first part of this work evaluated the biochemical, molecular and morphological effects of energetic failure induced by the mitochondrial toxin <b>methylmalonate</b> in vitro. The major findings of this portion of the work were that methylmalonate: (1) inhibits mitochondrial respiration and causes dose dependent cell death which is not appreciably different in primary cultures of striatal versus cortical cells; (2) causes an early disruption of ion homeostasis and membrane depolarization and (3) induced apoptotic cell death predominantly which can be attenuated with the addition of antioxidants. These findings suggested that extrinsic or developmental factors may be of greater importance in mediating striatal vulnerability to energetic failure. To address this question, the next portion of this thesis was devoted to determining whether or not dopamine, which is abundant in the striatum, and released in large quantities during many insults to the CNS, is neurotoxic and if it potentiates the cell death caused by energetic failure. The major findings of these studies were that: (1) dopamine induces massive apoptotic striatal cells at concentrations similar to those observed in vivo during acute CNS trauma; (2) dopamine mediated cell death is due primarily to production of free radicals and, to a lesser extent, to toxic activation of D 1 receptors; (3) dopamine dramatically increases the amount of cell death caused by subtoxic doses of <b>methylmalonate</b> and (4) this increased toxicity is likely caused by convergent production of free radicals as it can be halted in the presence of antioxidants. This work characterizes a novel and biologically significant compound and system for studying acute and chronic neurodegenerative events and appreciably extends our understanding of how intrinsic factors within the striatum as well as the unique circuitry of the basal ganglia contribute to striatal vulnerability to neurodegeneration. ...|$|E

We examined whether vitamin B 12 prescrip-tions, a family history of dementia, or the need for home care service might be associated with tHcy values. Methods: A cross-sectional monocenter study comprising 926 consecutive sub-jects attending our Memory Care Unit was conducted. Results: Demented subjects being pre-scribed vitamin B 12 had higher serum vitamin B 12 (p = 0. 025) but also higher tHcy (p ! 0. 001) and serum <b>methylmalonate</b> (p = 0. 032), and lower serum folate (p ! 0. 001) {{than those who did not}} receive vitamin B 12 prescriptions. tHcy levels were significantly higher in non-demented sub-jects receiving home care service (p = 0. 007). This group also had lower serum albumin (demen-tia: p ! 0. 001; non-dementia: p = 0. 004). There was no difference in renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) in demented or non-demented subjects with or without vitamin B 12 prescriptions (dementia with/without vitamin B 12 prescription: p = 0. 561; non-dementia with...|$|E
