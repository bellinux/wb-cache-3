50|$|In {{the most}} general sense, a scaling {{includes}} {{the case in}} which the directions of scaling are not perpendicular.

50|$|The {{diminutive}} size of Z scale {{makes it}} possible to fit <b>more</b> <b>scale</b> space into the same physical layout as would be used by larger-scale models. Z scale can also be beneficial when {{there is a need to}} build very compact train layouts, such as novelty setups in briefcases, guitar cases, or jewellery boxes. Several transportation museums, for instance, have used Z scale to present real world railway scenes. Z scale allows longer trains and broader, more realistic curves than is practical in larger scales.|$|E
50|$|A scaling in {{the most}} general sense is any affine {{transformation}} with a diagonalizable matrix. It includes {{the case that the}} three directions of scaling are not perpendicular. It includes also the case that one or <b>more</b> <b>scale</b> factors are equal to zero (projection), and the case of one or more negative scale factors. The latter corresponds to a combination of scaling proper and a kind of reflection: along lines in a particular direction we take the reflection in the point of intersection with a plane that need not be perpendicular; therefore it is more general than ordinary reflection in the plane.|$|E

50|$|In February 2013, IMPALA {{and global}} rights agency Merlin {{announced}} a landmark agreement with Warner Music Group. The agreement arose {{out of the}} regulatory process in the EU concerning Universal's purchase of EMI’s recorded music business, which resulted in Universal being required to sell {{a significant portion of}} the acquired business (as well as certain UMG assets) in order to secure the EU's approval. This included Parlophone Music Group, which was subsequently acquired by Warner Music Group. The agreement between IMPALA, Merlin and WMG aims to bring <b>more</b> <b>scale</b> into the independent sector by offering independent labels an opportunity to buy, license or distribute a significant portion of Parlophone assets or their equivalent in WMG-owned assets. Other measures designed to help re-balance the recorded music market will also be put in place including behavioural commitments and capacity-building initiatives for independents, which again will be implemented by Merlin and IMPALA.|$|E
40|$|The {{first goal}} {{of this study was}} to obtain, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) problem-scales data for youths in Croatia, and compare them to the {{original}} American sample.

The instruments were administered to school adolescents aged between 12 – 18 comprising a non-referred sample (n= 611) drawn from the whole country. Youths, compared to their parents, rated higher scores in all scales in both sexes (p< 0. 001). According to parents’ reports boys had higher scores in <b>more</b> <b>scales</b> (five out of eleven).

50|$|The Joggers, {{formerly}} known as Stateside, are a four-piece band from Portland, Oregon. They play complex songs with elements of math rock which retain a pop sensibility.

Murphy Kasiewicz played second guitar on Solid Guild, but left the band before the recording of With A Cape And A Cane {{and was replaced by}} Dan Wilson (from Alaska) after that album, touring the US in support of it. Jake Morris has also played drums on tour with French Kicks and played drums for The Shaky Hands from December 2008 to March 2010.

40|$|Industrial psychologists {{continue}} {{to debate the}} bandwidth-fidelity dilemma in personality assessment. Do longer, broad scales predict better than shorter, <b>more</b> specific <b>scales?</b> In this study, the job-relatedness (cross-validated prediction of sales volume) of the global scales of the 16 PF Questionnaire were compared to the <b>more</b> specific, primary <b>scales.</b> It was hypothesized {{and found that the}} <b>more</b> specific <b>scales</b> would have higher levels of validity. Thus, this study adds another data point to the debate (in favor of specific scales), extends the bandwidth-fidelity debate to objective criterion, and adds to the literature on the validity of the 16 PF Questionnaire. Press Paragraph Personality is the “drill in ANWR ” issue of industrial psychologists. We disagree, sometimes heatedly, about the predictiveness of personality scales and, sometimes, even about the precise definition of personality. The currently, generally accepted definition is that personality consists of five broad dimensions. However, we also have <b>more</b> specific <b>scales</b> and there has been some debate about which type, broad or specific, is better. This paper adds another data point to the debate, finding that the <b>more</b> specific <b>scales</b> of the 16 PF Questionnaire predict sales volume better than broader scales. This pape...|$|R
