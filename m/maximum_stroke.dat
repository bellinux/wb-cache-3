40|$|Buckling of {{load-carrying}} beam-columns is {{a severe}} failure scenario in light-weight structures. The authors present {{an approach to}} actively stabilize a slender beam-column under static axial load {{to prevent it from}} buckling in its first buckling mode. For that, controlled active counteracting forces are applied by two piezoelectric stack actuators near the column's fixed base, achieving a 40 % higher axial critical load and leaving most of the column's surface free from actuation devices. However, uncertain actuator properties due to tolerances in characteristic <b>maximum</b> free <b>stroke</b> and blocking force capability have an influence on the active stabilization. This uncertainty and its effect on active buckling control is investigated by numerical simulation, based on experimental tests to determine the actual <b>maximum</b> free <b>stroke</b> and blocking force for several piezoelectric stack actuators. The simulation shows that the success of active buckling control depends on the actuator's variation in its <b>maximum</b> free <b>stroke</b> and blocking force capability...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{uncertainty}} in an active load-carrying system with an inserted single piezoelectric stack actuator for stabilisation purposes of a slender beam column critical to buckling is investigated. The piezoelectric pre-stressed stack actuator exerts a controlled lateral {{force on the}} beam column to stabilize the beam column. The focus of investigation lies on the statistical determination {{of the influence of}} scatter of the piezoelectric actuator's assumed blocking force, <b>maximum</b> free <b>stroke,</b> <b>maximum</b> electric driving voltage capabilities and of the stiffness of beam column on the actuator's force-stroke-performance. For that, the actuator's dynamic behavior is described in an analytical model in which force and stroke generated by the actuator depend on the electric driving voltage, on the stiffness of the passive host structure (beam column) at the contact point with the actuator and on the actuator's specifications like e. g. blocking force assumption. Stochastic and estimated {{uncertainty in}} the configuration process of the active system due to normally and uniformly distributed scatter in the actuator's blocking force and <b>maximum</b> free <b>stroke</b> capability will be determined by Worst-Case analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of these Worst-Case analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations, the effect of uncertain actuator's specifications like blocking force and <b>maximum</b> free <b>stroke</b> on the force-stroke-performance of the piezoelectric actuator is investigated numerically...|$|R

50|$|The TMG engine {{successfully}} overcomes many of {{the economic}} and mechanical difficulties common in conventional Stirling engines. However, there are some limitations of this design. The simple, low-cost annular regenerator is inefficient compared to other types, (and this contributes to this engine's somewhat low thermal efficiency of only 10%). The mechanical limitations of the articulated diaphragm only allow a <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> of an estimated 3 mm. These properties limit the maximum obtainable power to about 500 - 1000 Watts from an engine of this design. Nevertheless, it is rare for a low-cost Stirling engine to obtain this high level of reliability and operating life, which can only be attributed to the ingenuity of the design.|$|E
50|$|Having aerogel {{sheets of}} MWNTs, UT {{researchers}} fabricated actuators with giant strokes (~180% actuation along the width) with 5 ms delay time between applying the potential and observing the <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke.</b> Therefore, the actuation rate is {{slightly better than}} that of the human muscle. This is a very important achievement considering the actuation rate for artificial muscles used in robots is typically much slower. Furthermore, the use of carbon nanotubes as the building blocks as an artificial muscle also helps in terms of strength and robustness by making the artificial muscle stronger than steel in one direction and more flexible than rubber in the other two directions. The lack of electrolyte solution and temperature robustness of the aerogel sheet in inert ambient makes high temperature operation possible. The actuation stroke decreases by only 50% from its room temperature value to 1344 oC. Thus, this design of artificial muscles can be quite useful for many industrial applications with the drawback of high voltage operation for giant strokes.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} an in situ perfused turtle (Chrysemys scripta) heart preparation to study its intrinsic mechanical properties at 5 ˚C and 15 ˚C using normoxic and anoxic perfusion conditions. The in situ preparation proved durable and stable. At 15 ˚C and a spontaneous heart rate of 23. 4 beats min � 1, <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> volume was 2. 54 ml kg � 1 body mass, maximum cardiac output was 62. 5 ml min � 1 kg � 1 and maximum cardiac myocardial power output was 1. 50 mW g � 1 ventricular mass. There was good agreement between these values and those previously obtained in vivo. Furthermore, since the <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> volume observed here was numerically {{equivalent to that}} observed in ventilating C. scripta in vivo, {{it seems likely that}} C. scripta has little scope to increase stroke volume to a level much beyond that observed in the resting animal through intrinsic mechanisms alone. The ability of the perfused turtle heart to maintain stroke volume when diastolic afterload was raised (homeometric regulation) was relatively poor. At 5 ˚C, the spontaneous heart rate (8. 1 beats min � 1) was threefold lower and homeometric regulation was impaired, but <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> volume (2. 25 ml kg � 1) was not significantly reduced compared with the value at 15 ˚C.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to obtain accurate data from two three-legged spacecraft landing systems for purposes of validating current and future computer programs for legged landers. Two landing-gear systems were investigated: an inverted tripod system and a cantilever system.

Data from the two models are not directly comparable because of geometry and mass differences, but both {{are considered to be}} typical models of the respective landing-gear systems. Results indicate that maximum accelerations for both models, which occurred during a nearly flat landing on a horizontal surface, were nearly the same (approximately minus 18 g). Maximum primary strut forces occurred for landings into a 20 deg slope and were 40 kiloNewtons (9000 lbf) and 47 kiloNewtons (10 500 lbf) for the inverted tripod and cantilever models, respectively; and <b>maximum</b> primary strut <b>strokes</b> for both models were 19 cm (7. 4 in.).

However, some problems remain in the research towards development of EVC devices.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} ideal geometry and material parameters of piezo-driven axisymmetric unimorph actuators for micropump applications. Based on Classic Laminated Plate Theory, closed form expressions for the transverse and radial displacement under diverse loads are derived for two types of unimorph actuators. The general approach allows an application of this theory to almost arbitrary actuator geometries. Using analytical and numerical methods, both actuators are optimized to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> volume at predefined pressure conditions. In this process, strikingly simple expressions are found, constituting the theoretical <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> volume of a circular bender type actuator.

In summary, the optimization procedure presented in this paper facilitates the design of piezoelectrically driven unimorph diaphragm actuators by providing generic design rules regarding materials and geometrical dimensions...|$|E
40|$|A {{shape memory}} alloy (SMA) is an {{intermetallic}} compound able to recover, in a continuous and reversible way, a predetermined shape during a thermal cycle while generating mechanical work. In this thesis, its use in developing an actuator for a machining process is investigated. The actuator is to drive the tool cross feed into an aluminium workpiece in a finishing lathe operation. The actuator structure was designed with an output shaft to transfer the movement and force of the SMA wire outside the device. The actuator was fabricated and the experimental setup was assembled which also included a power supply control circuit, displacement sensor, temperature sensor and current sensor for feedback, and data collection and monitoring within software. PID control was implemented within the software that regulated the power supplied to the SMA, thereby providing the position control. This study covers the mechatronics system design {{and development of the}} actuator, the experiments carried out to determine performance and the results. Open loop tests were conducted to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke,</b> the effect of cooling and response to radial forces. These tests revealed the expected non-linearity of the SMA. The actuator achieved the rated <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> of 3 - 4 percent. The forced cooling test showed a general improvement of approximately 65 percent with fans. The radial force tests showed the value of the <b>maximum</b> <b>stroke</b> remained unaffected by force. The results from the closed loop tests responses with a tuned PID controller produced a stable system for various displacement setpoints. The actuator had a feed rate of 0. 25 mm/s and an accuracy of 0. 0153 mm, which was within the acceptable accuracy for turning operations.

We considered five interaction tasks (neutral, comfortable, maximum, vertical, and horizontal strokes), two device widths (60 and 90  mm) and three hand lengths. Horizontal (vertical) strokes deviated from the horizontal axis {{in the range from}} &# 8722; 10. 8 ° to &# 8722; 13. 5 ° (81. 6 &# 8211; 88. 4 °). <b>Maximum</b> <b>strokes</b> appeared to be excessive as these caused 43. 8 % greater discomfort than did neutral strokes. The 90 -mm width also appeared to be excessive as it resulted in 12. 3 % increased discomfort relative to the 60 -mm width. The small-hand group reported 11. 9 &# 8211; 18. 2 % higher discomfort ratings, and the percent maximum voluntary exertion of their flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, pertaining to index finger flexion, was also 6. 4 % higher.

This aspect of bodily self-consciousness can be experimentally manipulated by exposing individuals to conflicting multisensory input, or can be abnormal following focal brain injury. Recent technological developments helped to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration and self-location, but the neural underpinnings are still under investigation, and the manual application of stimuli resulted in large variability difficult to control. This paper presents the development and evaluation of an MR-compatible stroking device capable of presenting moving tactile stimuli to both legs {{and the back of}} participants lying on a scanner bed while acquiring functional neuroimaging data.
