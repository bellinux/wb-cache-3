40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that cognitive abilities decline with normal aging. At {{the same time}} it is also recognized that there is variability in the magnitude and rate of decline among aging individuals. A similar phenomenon exists for dementia, where individuals with similar neuropathologic burden present with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Of importance is determining what factors account for this variability, and whether individuals can modify these factors in order to preserve their cognitive abilities with aging or delay the onset of dementia. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine three potentially modifiable lifestyle factors 2 ̆ 7 association with age-related differences/change in cognitive performance and risk for dementia by conducting three separate studies. The first study examined the association between engagement in lifestyle activities and concurrent cognitive speed performance. The second study examined whether there are differential associations between social resource factors and change in cognitive performance. The final study estimated the risk of late-life dementia in Swedish twins as a function of fruit and vegetable consumption in midlife. Taken together, the results of these studies provide evidence that individuals may be able to protect themselves against age-related cognitive decline or dementia by modifying their lifestyle. Specifically, individuals may benefit their cognitive speed performance by engaging in <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities.</b> Declines in episodic memory performance may be alleviated by being more satisfied with social support, and declines in general cognitive performance and speed and attention in young-old adults may be attenuated by having a larger social network of friends. Finally, the risk of all types of dementia and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease may be reduced by consuming a moderate amount of fruits and vegetables in the diet, especially for females, those with self-reported angina, and those who consumed alcohol in midlife. These findings contribute to the literature on potential strategies to maintain cognitive health with aging and serve as groundwork for future intervention studies...|$|R

Not only is higher education linked to a <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities.</b> The <b>more</b> education a person has received, the less the effects of aging, dementia, white matter hyperintensities, MRI-defined brain infarcts, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Also, aging and dementia are less in those that engage in complex cognitive tasks. The cognitive decline of those with epilepsy could also be affected by the level of a person’s education.|$|R

Older adults showed poorer decision performance compared with younger adults.

40|$|The {{current study}} applied classic {{cognitive}} capacity models {{to examine the}} effect of cognitive load on deception. The study also examined whether the manipulation of cognitive load would result in the magnification of differences between liars and truth-tellers. In the first study, 87 participants engaged in videotaped interviews while being either deceptive or truthful about a target event. Some participants engaged in a concurrent secondary task while being interviewed. Performance on the secondary task was measured. As expected, truth tellers performed better on secondary task items than liars as evidenced by higher accuracy rates. These results confirm the long held assumption that being deceptive is <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> than being truthful. ^ In {{the second part of the}} study, the videotaped interviews of both liars and truth-tellers were shown to 69 observers. After watching the interviews, observers were asked to make a veracity judgment for each participant. Observers made more accurate veracity judgments when viewing participants who engaged in a concurrent secondary task than when viewing those who did not. Observers also indicated that participants who engaged in a concurrent secondary task appeared to think harder than participants who did not. ^ This study provides evidence that engaging in deception is <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> than telling the truth. As hypothesized, having participants engage in a concurrent secondary task led to the magnification of differences between liars and truth tellers. This magnification of differences led to more accurate veracity rates in a second group of observers. The implications for deception detection are discussed. ...|$|R

The impact that decision task complexity has on the uptake and use of clinical decision support systems (DSS) is also not well understood. Antibiotic prescribing in critical care is a complex, <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> task, made under time pressure. A web-based experiment was conducted to explore the impact of decision complexity on DSS utilization, comparing utilization of antibiotic guidelines and an interactive probability calculator for ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) plus laboratory data. Decision support was found to be used more often for less complex decisions. Prescribing decisions of higher complexity were associated with a lower frequency of DSS use, but required the use of the <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> situation assessment tool for infection risk along with pathology data. Decision complexity thus seems to impact on the extent and type of information support used by individuals when decision-making...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I analyse {{a finding}} by Riggs and colleagues {{that there is}} a close {{connection}} between people's ability to reason with counterfactual conditionals and their capacity to attribute false beliefs to others. The result indicates that both processes may be governed by one cognitive mechanism, though false belief attribution seems to be slightly <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding.</b> Given that the common denominator for both processes is suggested to be a form of the Ramsey test, I investigate whether Stalnaker's semantic theory of conditionals, which was inspired by the Ramsey test, may provide the basis for a psychologically plausible model of belief ascription. The analysis I propose will shed some new light on the developmental discrepancy between counterfactual reasoning and false belief ascription. ...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} has demonstrated {{the benefits of}} using simulation games in enhancing learning {{especially in terms of}} cognitive gains. This is to be expected as the dynamism and non-linearity of simulation games are <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding.</b> However, the other effects of simulation games, specifically in terms of learners' emotions, have not been given much attention and are under-investigated. This study aims to demonstrate that simulation games stimulate positive emotions from learners that help to enhance learning. The study finds that the affect-based constructs of interest, engagement and appreciation are positively correlated to learning. A stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that a model involving interest and engagement are significantly associated with learning. The emotions of learners should be considered in the development of curriculum, and the delivery of learning and teaching as positive emotions enhances learning...|$|R
40|$|The {{sense of}} agency, the {{experience}} of being responsible for the external effects of our actions, is pervasive, but the mechanism of this sensation is not well understood. Recent research has focused on a `comparator model' in which implicit comparisons between predicted and experienced sensory input drive the sense of agency. However, this cannot account for occasions when one feels responsible for an unpredicted outcome, like accidentally knocking over a glass. This study examined whether such judgments involve a <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interpretive process by comparing the effect of a cognitively taxing verbal shadowing task on agency judgments for expected and unexpected action-consistent outcomes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that agency judgments for unexpected action-outcomes were not more susceptible to interference from verbal shadowing than judgments for expected action-outcomes...|$|R

In contrast, our research shows that level of uncertainty rather than personal involvement influence judgments of appropriateness.

Our findings highlight a need to investigate how variation in uncertainty produces variation in utilitarian judgment...|$|R

An experimental situation was created for observation of consecutive, rule-based construction steps as a function of input diagnosticity, and for the quality assessment of constructed mental models. The findings show that participants preexposed to uncontrollability, as well as depressed students, were able, as were controls, to identify rule-relevant information needed for model construction.

Structural estimates show that all three effects are driven entirely by increases in the intertemporal substitution elasticity parameter (α).

40|$|Promising recent {{research}} suggests that <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interviews improve deception detection accuracy. Would these <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> techniques {{work in the same}} way when discriminating between true and false future intentions? In Experiment 1 participants planned to complete a task, but instead were intercepted and interviewed about their intentions. Participants lied or told the truth, and were subjected to high (reverse order) or low (sequential order) cognitive load interviews. Third-party observers watched these interviews and indicated whether they thought the person was lying or telling the truth. Subjecting participants to a reverse compared to sequential interview increased the misidentification rate and the appearance of cognitive load in truth tellers. People lying about false intentions were not better identified. In Experiment 2, a second set of third-party observers rated behavioral cues. Consistent with Experiment 1, truth tellers, but not liars, exhibited more behaviors associated with lying and fewer behaviors associated with truth telling in the reverse than sequential interview. Together these results suggest that certain <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> interviews may be less useful when interviewing to detect false intentions. Explaining a true intention while under higher cognitive demand places truth tellers at risk of being misclassified. There may be such a thing as too much cognitive load induced by certain techniques...|$|R
40|$|A key {{characteristic}} of selective visual attention {{is that it}} may be deployed on the basis of our knowledge or goals of the task at hand.

Here, we report a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that addressed an important but yet unanswered question: Is the neural activity associated with intentional faked responses and with errors differentiable? Using a word list learning recognition paradigm, the findings of this mixed event-related fMRI study clearly indicated that the brain activity associated with intentional faked responses was different to the activity associated with errors committed unintentionally. For intentional faked responses, significant activation was found in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate region, and the precuneus. However, no significant activation was observed for unintentional errors.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the central {{processing}} of two unpleasant sensations, itch and pain, and how these sensations can be modulated using psychological tools. The initial section focuses on the induction and modulation of thermal noxious stimuli {{and the way in}} which this is represented in the brain. It is well known that pain can be modulated by distraction, and also which areas of the brain are frequently activated by noxious stimuli. The research reported here expands upon this knowledge. The first study found that when subjects were engaged in a <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> task (the Counting Stroop task) their attention was distracted away from thermal painful stimuli. They reported a significantly (p= 0. 006) lower pain intensity rating for stimuli during the interference (<b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding)</b> task compared to the neutral (less <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding)</b> task. The interference task was confirmed to be more difficult than the neutral task by significantly increased reaction times in the former compared to the latter. The reduced perception of painful thermal stimuli applied during the interference task compared with those felt in the neutral task was accompanied by a reduced activation in some key components of the pain matrix (insula, mid-cingulate, thalamus). Some key pain processing regions showed an increase in signal during the interference task compared with the neutral task (perigenual cingulate, orbitofrontal regions).

A beneficial effect for fluid intake was strongest when athletic performance involved continuous exercise tasks. Further, the magnitude of improvement appeared greater when the continuous exercise was performed at elevated environmental temperatures and over longer exercise durations. Whilst the volume of fluid consumed (relative to BM lost) did not appear to influence the size of the treatment effect, fluid intake at levels complying with current recommendations for completely replacing lost fluid (1.25 – 1.50  L kg BM lost− 1) [16, 17] are yet to be thoroughly investigated. Evidence for a beneficial effect of fluid intake on intermittent, resistance and sport-specific exercise performance and cognitive function or mood is less apparent and requires further elucidation.|$|R

In an exploratory study, we examined whether patterns of computer mouse movements obtained from routine home computer use discriminated between older adults with and without MCI. MethodsParticipants were 42 cognitively intact and 20 older adults with MCI enrolled in a longitudinal study of in-home monitoring technologies. Mouse pointer movement variables were computed during one week of routine home computer use using algorithms that identified and characterized mouse movements within each computer use session. ResultsMCI was associated with making significantly fewer total mouse moves (P < . 01) and making mouse movements that were more variable, less efficient, and with longer pauses between movements (P < . 05). Mouse movement measures {{were significantly associated with}} several cognitive domains (P values <. 01 –. 05).

40|$|In {{cognitive}} aging research, the “engagement hypothesis” {{suggests that}} the participation in <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>activities</b> helps maintain better cognitive performance in later life. In differential psychology, the “investment” theory proclaims that age differences in cognition are influenced by personality traits that determine when, where, and how people invest their ability. Although both models follow similar theoretical rationales, they differ in their emphasis of behavior (i. e., activity engagement) versus predisposition (i. e., investment trait). The current study compared a cognitive activity engagement scale (i. e., frequency of participation) with an investment trait scale (i. e., need for cognition) and tested their relationship with age differences in cognition in 200 British adults. Age was negatively associated with fluid and positively with crystallized ability but had no relationship with need for cognition and activity engagement. Need for cognition {{was positively related to}} activity engagement and cognitive performance; activity engagement, however, was not associated with cognitive ability. Thus, age differences in cognitive ability were largely independent of engagement and investment...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{consensus}} on how to characterize humans' capacity for belief reasoning has been brought into sharp focus by recent research. Children fail critical tests of belief reasoning before 3 to 4 years of age (H. Wellman, D. Cross, & J. Watson, 2001; H. Wimmer & J. Perner, 1983), yet infants apparently pass false-belief tasks at 13 or 15 months (K. H. Onishi & R. Baillargeon, 2005; L. Surian, S. Caldi, & D. Sperber, 2007). Nonhuman animals also fail critical tests of belief reasoning but can show very complex social behavior (e. g., J. Call & A Tomasello, 2005). Fluent social interaction in adult humans implies efficient processing of beliefs, yet direct tests suggest that belief reasoning is <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding,</b> even for adults (e. g., I. A. Apperly, D. Samson, & G. W. Humphreys, 2009). The authors interpret these findings by drawing an analogy with the domain of number cognition, where similarly contrasting results have been observed. They propose {{that the success of}} infants and nonhuman animals on some belief reasoning tasks may be best explained by a cognitively efficient but inflexible capacity for tracking belief-like states. In humans, this capacity persists in parallel with a later-developing, more flexible but <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> theory-of-mind abilities...|$|R
40|$|Several {{judgment}} and decision-making tasks {{are assumed to}} involve memory functions, but significant knowledge gaps on the memory processes underlying these tasks remain. In a study on 568 adults between 25 and 80 years of age, hypotheses were tested on the specific relationships between individual differences in working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory, respectively, and 6 main components of decision-making competence. In line with the hypotheses, working memory was positively related with the <b>more</b> <b>cognitively</b> <b>demanding</b> tasks (Resistance to Framing, Applying Decision Rules, and Under/Overconfidence), whereas episodic memory was positively associated with a more experience-based judgment task (Recognizing Social Norms).
