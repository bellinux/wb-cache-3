Through new agricultural regulation 2015 in Germany the industry must develop new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader systems because the ammonia and methane emission are limited. In a research project the University of Applied Sciences Zwickau and some other industry partners will develop such a new innovative <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader. The new <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> spreader should use pulsating air to distribute the <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> exactly. The pulsating air, which flows through the pipelines, should be analysed at a test station. For examinations at this test station it is important to find another substitute fluid because <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> smells strong, is not transparent and is also not homogeneous enough for scientific investigations. Furthermore it is important to ensure that the substitute fluid is, like <b>liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> a non-Newtonian fluid. The substitute fluid must be a shear-thinning substance - this means the viscosity decrease at higher shear rate. Many different samples like soap-water-farragoes, jelly-water-farragoes, agar-water-farragoes, soap-ethanol-farragoes and more are, for the project, examined in regard of their physical properties to find the best substitute fluid.

The objective {{of this study was}} to survey the <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> facilities of farms in eastern Switzerland and find the incidence of accidents related to manure in the region. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study and cross sectional survey of 210 farms in eastern Switzerland. RESULTS: The incidence of accidents related to manure was found to be 10. 4 / 1000 person-years.

However, although the degradability of biogas slurry was highest among the organic amendments, <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> application resulted in the highest respiration rates in the soil samples. This was likely due to the organic waste borne easily decomposable substrates which were most dominant in <b>liquid</b> <b>manure.</b> Organic waste applications were found to generally increase the activity of numerous enzymes but did not change the soil enzyme patterns.

40|$|An {{experimental}} field was established during 1982 - 83 on a sandy soil at Mellby in the south-western part of Sweden. The field {{was divided into}} ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. An investigation was carried out during a five year period wight the objective to elucidate the effects of different nitrogen fertilizer regimes on leaching losses of nitrogen from the root zone. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples collected twice monthly for analysis of pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus and ptassium. The losses of nitrogen by water percolating to the groundwater were estimated with a simulation model. The fertilizer regimes were: unfertilized, commercial N-fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 N kg/ha), <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> in spring (110 total-N kg/ha) with and without winter rye as a catch crop sown after the main crop, liquid maure in the early autumn; (55, 110 and 220 total-N kg/ha) and lage autumn (110 total-N kg/ha). All the manure treatments recived a complementary addition of commersial N-fertilizer in the spring according to 50 % of the general recommendations. The nitrogen losses from the unfertilized treatment were slightly reduced compared with the spring fertilized treatments. The amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil {{as well as the}} leaching losses were of the same order of magnitude from the treatment with commersial fertilizer and the treatment with spring application of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> without catch crop. The catch crop reduced the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil during the late autumn and winter and thereby reduced the leaching losses by almost half, providning the catch crop was well established in the autumn. Spreading of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> in autumn resulted in high enrichment of leachable nitrate nitrogen in the soil during winter time. As a consequence, the leaching losses were always higher compared to spring application. There were only small and variable differences in leaching losses between the treatments with <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> application in early and late autumn. Increasing doses of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> strongly increased leaching losses of nitrogen from the soil profile. The harvest from the unfertilized treatment was reduced to almost half of the spring fertilized treatments. The harvest from the treatments with commercial fertilizer and spring application of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> with and without cath crop, were of the same order of magnitude. Harvest from treatment with autumn application of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure</b> were reduced {{as a result of the}} nitrogen losses. Only in the treatment with the largest dose of <b>liquid</b> <b>manure,</b> was the harvest of approximatley the same order of magnitude as in spring fertilized treatments. Kväveutlakningen från åkermark är en av flera bidragande orsaker till de rapporterade algblomningarna och därav följande döda havsbottnar, som under längre eller kortare perioder förekommer längs kusterna (DSH 1989 : 2).
