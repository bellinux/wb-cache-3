2500|$|French nuclear deterrence, (formerly {{known as}} [...] "Force de Frappe"), relies on {{complete}} independence. The current French nuclear force {{consists of four}} Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, {{it is estimated that}} France has about 60 ASMP <b>medium-range</b> <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> with nuclear warheads, of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead.|$|R
50|$|Deployment: 54 warheads {{carried by}} the ASMPA {{equipping}} the Mirage 2000 N with the French Air Force and Dassault Rafale of Naval Aviation. The airborne nuclear warheads (TNA) that are carried on the new improved <b>medium-range</b> <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> (in French ASMPA) are now loaded underneath the Rafale aircraft. Each TNA has a declared destructive power of 300 kilotonnes. This amounts to over 20 times {{the power of the}} bomb that destroyed Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and caused some 250 000 deaths then or in the aftermath (De Gaulle gave the figure as 300 000). In comparison, therefore, each ASMPA missile could by itself cause 5 million deaths (not counting wounded) and annihilate the population of a city like Paris and its agglomeration.|$|R

50|$|The {{final version}} of the C-101, the C-101DD was {{demonstrated}} by CASA in 1985, featuring vastly improved avionics and the capability to carry the AGM-65 Maverick <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missile,</b> but failed to attract any orders.|$|R

25|$|During late 1981, it {{was soon}} clear that the modern Mirage F-1s and the Soviet MiG-25s were {{effective}} against the Iranians. The IQAF began to use their new Eastern weaponry which included Tu-22KD/KDP bombers, equipped with Kh-22M/MP <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles,</b> MiG-25s equipped with Kh-23 <b>air-to-ground</b> <b>missiles</b> as well as Kh-25 and Kh-58 anti-radar missiles and also MiG-23BNs, equipped with Kh-29L/T missiles. In 1983, to satisfy the Iraqis waiting for their upgraded Exocet-capable Mirage F-1EQ5s, Super Etendards were leased to Iraq. The Iranian oil tanker fleet (see Tanker War) and gunboats suffered severe damage at {{the hand of the}} 5 Super Etendards equipped with Exocet anti-ship missiles. One of these was lost during their 20-month combat use and 4 returned to the Aeronavale in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Bina (بینا) is an Iranian laser guided dual-capability surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missile.
