5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the <b>Milky</b> Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the <b>Milky</b> Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the <b>Milky</b> Way. Given that the <b>Milky</b> Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the <b>Milky</b> Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Milky</b> Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the <b>Milky</b> Way has never {{collided}} with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the <b>Milky</b> Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E
5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the <b>Milky</b> Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the <b>Milky</b> Way. The rate of supernovae in the <b>Milky</b> Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the <b>Milky</b> Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the <b>Milky</b> Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{proof of}} the <b>Milky</b> Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the <b>Milky</b> Way and discovered that it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the <b>Milky</b> Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the <b>Milky</b> Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because there is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), {{concerning}} {{the nature of the}} <b>Milky</b> Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the <b>Milky</b> Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the <b>Milky</b> Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the <b>Milky</b> Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the <b>Milky</b> Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the <b>Milky</b> Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E
5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the <b>Milky</b> Way Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the <b>Milky</b> Way. However, some <b>Milky</b> Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from the <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the <b>Milky</b> Way was not detectable.|$|E
5|$|Only three <b>Milky</b> Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the <b>Milky</b> Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the <b>Milky</b> Way, and that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the <b>Milky</b> Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the <b>Milky</b> Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the <b>Milky</b> Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Milky</b> Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} <b>Milky</b> Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the <b>Milky</b> Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the <b>Milky</b> Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Milky</b> Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The <b>Milky</b> Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the <b>Milky</b> Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Milky</b> Way {{runs through}} the constellation, {{featuring}} prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the <b>Milky</b> Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.|$|E
5|$|The closest analogs {{within the}} <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy {{of the stars}} {{producing}} long gamma-ray bursts are likely the Wolf–Rayet stars, extremely hot and massive stars, which have shed {{most or all of}} their hydrogen to radiation pressure. Eta Carinae and WR 104 have been cited as possible future gamma-ray burst progenitors. It is unclear if any star in the <b>Milky</b> Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma-ray burst.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the <b>Milky</b> Way passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards {{the rim of the}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{globular}} clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters {{have now been}} discovered in the <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20. These additional, undiscovered globular clusters {{are believed to be}} hidden behind the gas and dust of the <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy {{in a few seconds}} as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater flares, are associated with magnetars within the <b>Milky</b> Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the <b>Milky</b> Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E
5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, {{and that it could}} be the largest in the Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that the Andromeda galaxy contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the <b>Milky</b> Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the <b>Milky</b> Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 study, {{analyzing}} gravitational microlensing data, estimates {{an average}} of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the <b>Milky</b> Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the <b>Milky</b> Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the <b>Milky</b> Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the <b>Milky</b> Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the <b>Milky</b> Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the <b>Milky</b> Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda's {{most celebrated}} open cluster is NGC 752 (Caldwell 28) at an overall {{magnitude}} of 5.7. It is a loosely scattered cluster in the <b>Milky</b> Way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars, although more than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in a telescope. It {{is considered to}} be one of the more inconspicuous open clusters. The other open cluster in Andromeda is NGC 7686, which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the <b>Milky</b> Way. It contains approximately 20 stars in a diameter of 15 arcminutes, making it a tighter cluster than NGC 752.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed from}} Earth, the visible {{region of the}} <b>Milky</b> Way's Galactic plane {{occupies}} {{an area of the}} sky that includes 30 constellations.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} <b>Milky</b> Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the <b>Milky</b> Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the <b>Milky</b> Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the <b>Milky</b> Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the <b>Milky</b> Way, the Andromeda Galaxy {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the <b>Milky</b> Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5|$|Earth, {{along with}} the Solar System, is {{situated}} in the <b>Milky</b> Way and orbits about 28,000light-years from its center. It is about 20light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 a dwarf galaxy, {{also named}} Coma Berenices, was {{discovered}} in the constellation. The galaxy is a faint satellite of the <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Milky</b> Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the <b>Milky</b> Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} end of Tucana, the Small Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy that is one of the nearest neighbors to the <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, tidal forces from the <b>Milky</b> Way have distorted it. Along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, it lies within the Magellanic Stream, a cloud of gas that connects the two galaxies. NGC 346 is a star-forming region located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system HD 5980, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.|$|E
5|$|<b>Milky</b> is {{a popular}} dairy pudding that comes in chocolate, vanilla and mocha flavors {{with a layer of}} whipped cream on top.|$|E
5|$|NGC 4651, {{about the}} size of the <b>Milky</b> Way, has tidal stellar streams gravitationally {{stripped}} from a smaller, satellite galaxy. It is about 62 million light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the <b>Milky</b> Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the <b>Milky</b> Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
