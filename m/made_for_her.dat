5|$|Female virtue {{was tied}} to {{literary}} knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century {{they had come to}} symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kanō Tan'yū as a wedding gift in 1649.|$|E

25|$|On May 9, 1608, she was canonized by Pope Paul V, {{and in the}} {{following}} decades a diligent search was <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> remains, which had been hidden due to the troubled times in which she lived.

25|$|In 1940, Russell {{was signed}} to a seven-year {{contract}} by film mogul Howard Hughes, {{and made her}} motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that {{went to great lengths}} to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, she was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to wear during filming. According to Jane's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts.|$|E

She claimed to have been forced into carrying the drugs by a gang who had threatened to harm members of her family if she did not comply with their demands. When informed she could receive the death penalty for drug trafficking she broke down and told police that she had been asked to carry the drugs for Julian Ponder, a British antiques dealer living in Bali, and his partner Rachel Dougall, and agreed to help in a sting operation to arrest them. Sandiford was booked into a hotel with an undercover police officer, where she went about contacting members of the alleged syndicate. Arrangements were <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to meet Ponder, and another man, Paul Beales at the hotel, where police arrested them on suspicion of drug trafficking. Dougall was arrested after a subsequent search of the property she shared with Ponder uncovered 48.94 grammes of cocaine, while 3.1 grammes of hashish were found at Beale's house. Sandiford and Ponder were charged with drug trafficking. However, police failed to find evidence linking the other two to the crime, and they were charged with less serious offences.|$|E
25|$|Adams's first {{literary}} work {{was the result}} of her dissatisfaction with the prejudice of most writers on the various religious sects. Her mind had been turned to the subject by reading a manuscript from Broughton's Dictionary giving an account {{of some of the most}} common of the sects. The publication of A View of Religions was published in 1784, in accordance with the custom of the time, after subscriptions had been obtained to the' proposal' of the work, sufficient in number to warrant its issue. It was fairly profitable, but owing to a bad bargain with the printer the author's returns were slight, A second edition with additions, secured by copyright, then newly established by law, was published in 1791, at the instance of influential Boston friends whom the first issue had <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> This edition was dedicated to John Adams, then Vice-President of the United States, who had headed its list of subscribers, which included such leading names as Samuel Adams, John Hancock, President Joseph Willard of Harvard College, Rt Rev. John Carroll, D.D., the Roman Catholic Bishop of Baltimore, the Rev. Henry Ware, and the Rev. Adoniram Judson. Her father was an enthusiastic seller of the book, traveling about the country on horseback with saddlebags filled with the volumes. A fourth edition of her first work, with further additions, appeared in 1817, under the broader title of A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations. Jared Sparks gave it his stamp of approval.|$|E
