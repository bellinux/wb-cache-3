Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) is particularly appealing due to its well-established processing protocols in high-speed and high-frequency applications. This dissertation investigates various metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices using InGaAs as the substrate material. II-VI gate dielectric stacks consisting of ZnSe, ZnS and ZnMgS were used in this research as an alternative to conventional oxide-based gate insulators for InGaAs devices. II-VI gate dielectric materials have been chosen due to their high k values, wider band gaps and similar lattice constants to InGaAs for a lattice-matched semiconductor-insulator interface. Multi-state field-effect transistors were also fabricated incorporating germanium-oxide-cladded germanium quantum dots (QDs) at the gate regions. These QDs have the ability to store charges and providing an additional output state (in additional to the ON and the OFF states).

A binary-valued logic netlist would first be decomposed into <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> nodes (with <b>multi-valued</b> inputs as well as outputs). For an arbitrary <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> node, this paper presents a circuit and layout design approach. We first synthesize the <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> node, using <b>multi-valued</b> decision diagrams (MDDs) to represent each output value of the <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> node. Each such MDD represents a binary valued output function, on one-hot multi-valued inputs.

In addition, mixed signal architectures using SWSFET are explored. Simulations for the memory, logic and mixed signal designs are presented. BSIM 3 equivalent channel models were used for SWSFET. Cadence Spectre Simulator and Advanced Design Simulator were used as the simulation tools. Quaternary to binary and binary to quaternary conversion circuits are also designed and presented. This helps the quaternary and binary circuits to co-exist on the same die. Multi Valued Logic (MVL) has been in research for many decades. MVL offers benefits and opportunities but it has its own challenges. Quaternary SRAM using SWSFET reduces the number of transistors needed by 75 %. Similar savings are shown for implementing quaternary logic when compared to implementation using CMOS based binary logic. In addition, significant reduction in gate delays is achieved by implemented logic using quaternary algebra. Also, logic implementation using quaternary algebra leads to about 50 % reduction in interconnect metal density for data signals. This is helpful in reducing the congestion in metal signal routing layers. Metal density, number of metal layers and pressure to use low resistivity materials have added to the die cost over recent years.

40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} CMOS technology, to reduce device size while also increasing device performance, {{has reached a}} point where continuing improvement is becoming increasingly problematic and alternative routes for the development of future memory and processing devices may be necessary; in this thesis the use of phase-change and carbon based materials as one such alternative route is investigated. As pointed out by Ovshinsky [1, 2] some phase-change material should be capable of non-binary arithmetic processing, <b>multi-value</b> <b>logic</b> and biological (neuromorphic) type processing. In this thesis, generic, nanometre-sized, phase-change pseudodevices were fabricated and utilised to perform various types of computational operations for the first time, including addition, subtraction, division, parallel factorization and logic using a novel resistive switching accumulator-type regime in the electrical domain. The same accumulator response is also shown to provide an electronic mimic of an integrate-and-fire type neuron. The accumulator-type regime uses fast electrical pulses to gradually crystallize a phase-change device in a finite number of steps and does not require a multilevel detection scheme. The phase-change materials used in this study were protected by a capping layer of sputtered amorphous carbon. It was found that this amorphous carbon layer also underwent a form of resistive switching when subjected to electrical pulses. In particular, sputtered amorphous carbon layers were found to switch from an initially high resistivity state to a low resistivity state when a voltage pulse was locally applied using a Conductive Atomic Force Microscope (CAFM) tip. Further experiments on amorphous carbon vertical pseudo-devices and lithographically defined planar devices showed that it has potential as a new material for Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRam) applications. The switching mechanism was identified as clustering of the sp 2 hybridized carbon sites induced by Joule heating. It was not possible to reset the devices back to their initial high resistivity state presumably due to the highly conductive nature of sputtered amorphous carbon...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{data sets}} for processing, {{there is a}} requirement to build faster and smaller arithmetic circuits. One {{of the ways to}} improve the performance of higher order arithmetic units is to reduce the carry propagation levels. <b>Multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> enables this by reducing the number of digits required to represent a range of numbers. Area reduction is also obtained through fewer operations and signals required to realise a function. Though theoretically <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> has these advantages, implementation of the <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> using CMOS has not been efficient. The main reason is because <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> is emulated in CMOS using binary switches. Two main approaches are followed in CMOS in implementing <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> using CMOS. Voltage mode logic, where the logic states are encoded using the node voltages suffer from low noise margins and limitation of radix due to the power supply. Current mode logic, where the branch currents are used to represent the logic levels suffer from high power consumption due to static current flow and requirement of restoration devices. The mindset of the post-CMOS approaches explored so far for <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> circuit design has been to replace the CMOS switches with their novel nano switches. Hence they too suffer from the same issues as CMOS implementation. Our value proposition is {{through the use of a}} truly multi-state device based on electron spin. Spin waves, which are a collection of electron spins of an atom enables <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> by allowing encoding information in the amplitude and phase of the wave. Another advantage of the spin wave fabric is that the computation is through wave propagation and interference which does not involve any movement of charge. This enables building low energy,smaller and faster multi-valued circuits. In this thesis, implementation of the basic building blocks of <b>multi-valued</b> <b>logic</b> using these novel spin wave based devices is shown. Building of arithmetic circuits like adders using these building blocks have also been demonstrated. To quantify the benefits of spin wave based multi-valued circuits, they are benchmarked with CMOS. For 32 -bits, our projected comparisons show a 5 X increased performance, 125 X area improvement and 1717 X power reduction for hexa-decimal spin wave based adders compared to binary CMOS. Similarly there is a 4 X increase in performance of hexa-decimal SPWF multiplier compared to CMOS for 16 bits.

40|$|In vivo, long {{bones are}} {{formed by the}} {{developmental}} process of endochondral ossification. This developmental process is robust and behaves as an autoregulatory module. These characteristics are highly desirable in an in vitro tissue engineering process that aims to grow bone tissue {{for the treatment of}} large bone defects. In order to control and regulate such a biomimetic process it is paramount to be able to interpret and analyze the regulatory signalling pathways. During endochondral ossification, BMP signalling plays a crucial role by regulating chondrocyte growth and differentiation. Due to the many cross talks and feedback mechanisms present between signalling pathways, they display a network like structure. Boolean or logical modelling has become a promising approach to capture the qualitative behaviour of such complex networks. 	 In this study, a large-scale literature-based Boolean model of the growth plate network was developed. The incorporation of BMP downstream effectors, such as Dlx 5 and MEF 2 C, is crucial in describing the BMP regulation in growth plate chondrocytes. BMP regulation is dependent on interaction with many other local signalling pathways, including Wnt, TGFβ, the Ihh/PTHrP feedback loop and FGF. The use of <b>multi-value</b> <b>logic</b> was indispensable to capture the behaviour of the growth plate network. The model is implemented in GINsim (Gene Interaction Network simulation), a program geared towards Boolean modelling. Spatial migration through the growth plate was modelled by altering the expression level of external ligands (Ihh/PTHrP, TGFβ & Wnt) that are expressed locally in prehypertrophic chondrocytes or the perichondrium surrounding the growth plate. The network is able to capture the different stable states (resting, proliferating and hypertrophic) the chondrocytes go through as they progress through the growth plate. The prehypertrophic state was predicted to be an unstable state at the transition between proliferation and hypertrophy, similar to experimental observations. In a first corroboration step, the effect of mutations in various signalling pathways, including a Smad knockout, of the growth plate network was investigated. Simulation results were compared to experimental observations in the corresponding mutant mouse models displaying phenotypes similar to various bone related conditions from achondroplasia to osteoarthritis. The model was able to successfully predict the changes in the growth plate structure for all simulated cases. These first corroboration results indicate that the introduced growth plate network provides a comprehensive and coherent description of the growth plate network behaviour. status: publishe...|$|E

Chapter 1 : Introduction and {{literature}} overview [...] Chapter 2 : Combinatorics in Superexpertise [...] Chapter 3 : Multi-valued Logic Superexpertise [...] Chapter 4 : Negotiation Superexpertise [...] Chapter 5 : Conclusion. This thesis considers {{the nature of}} expertise, focusing on expertise beyond normal human capabilities; such expertise is called, by the author, superexpertise. The question asked in this thesis is: how can people manage problems that require superexpertise? A model of superexpertise is constructed through an exploration of aspects of this concept set out in seven published papers on the subject. In the first paper, published in 2007, the concept of superexpertise was identified with the characteristic of automation of large scale combinatorics by a legal expert system shell, eGanges. Further contributions to the model are added in the remaining six papers so that conclusions can be drawn as {{to the nature of}} superexpertise. The notion of superexpertise has evolved from the work of expert systems, knowledge based systems, knowledge representations and problem solving methods. It is particularly useful for problems involving large-scale combinatorics and sorting according to a prescribed multi-valued logic. To manage superexpertise, it must be elicited from expert epistemology. An expert epistemology is a theory about the knowledge bound up, encompassed and contained in the expertise and includes knowledge representation, semantics, specifications, heuristics, reasoning, etc; it is concerned with 'How we know what we know', and deals with the means of producing knowledge, including how knowledge is acquired. Specifically, the aim of this thesis was to show the applicability of two epistemologies, called eGanges and NeGame (a complement to eGanges), for three particular types of problems, namely, Quality Control problems, Adversarial problems and Negotiation problems. Initially a qualitative methodology of case studies of superexpertise is relied on, but quantitative methodologies are also used as mathematical characteristics of superexpertise are revealed and developed. An introductory definition of superexpertise is expanded into a model with two major features: (1) large scale combinatorics that require (2) <b>multi-value</b> <b>logic</b> processing. The NeGame epistemology was introduced in this thesis, but requires further work and refinement, along with a logical verification more detailed than can be provided by these limited case studies.
