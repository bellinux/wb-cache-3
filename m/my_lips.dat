25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept <b>my</b> <b>lips.</b> And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

He is then comforted by a noblewoman, Drusilla; realising that he can never regain Poppea he offers to marry Drusilla, who joyfully accepts him. But Ottone admits to himself: [...] "Drusilla is on <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> Poppea is in my heart." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} {{her debut}} single [...] "Take Me Home", Polydor Records issued her first studio album Read <b>My</b> <b>Lips</b> on 27 August 2001 which primarily tended towards a disco and electronica-inspired sound. The album and its reissue spawned four singles, including the worldwide success [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor".

For the album, Ellis-Bextor worked with many musicians, including Alex James and Bernard Butler, {{which resulted in}} a Europop-influenced sound. It spawned the successful singles [...] "Mixed Up World" [...] and [...] "I Won't Change You", which reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} song, Sophie Muller filmed a music video for [...] "Take Me Home" [...] which was {{released}} on the song's CD single. The video was also included in her video album Watch <b>My</b> <b>Lips</b> (2002).' It opens with Ellis-Bextor, {{dressed in a black}} one-strap dress, in front of a yellow-toned painting of a woman with red lips. Throughout the music video, Ellis-Bextor is seen in a variety of dresses and outfits—she appears {{standing in front of a}} green mural with a flowery large tablecloth, while dressing a see-through shirt, which reveals her black bra; other scene shows her with a dark green gown; other shows her with a flower and leaves pattern and holding a in front of a projected image which shows the Eiffel Tower from far. She also appears dressed in a green trench coat in another scene. Usually, costume and location scenes are accompanied by a change of gradient color, which are projected onto Ellis-Bextor. By the middle of the video, she walks across a street, surrounded by formally-dressed men, who dance around her and lift her. After the song's middle 8 plays, the lights of the street turn on and various French event posters are shown. The video concludes as they all enter a disco club. She also performed the track at the Read <b>My</b> <b>Lips</b> Tour (2002–03), serving as its encore. Ellis-Bextor would shortly introduce the song, with green eye makeup and red lipstick, dressed in a cream-colored dress and pink heels. As the backing track started playing, she would start singing and clapping her hands as the public imitated her, and the audience was showered with confetti.|$|E

Instrumentation consists of [...] "a storm of drums" [...] and [...] "clattering synths." [...] Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust described the song's percussion as [...] "huge." [...] The song samples the melody of The xx's song [...] "Intro", which was included on their debut album xx. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy noted that Rihanna describes herself as someone who wants to be loved in the lyric [...] "I just wanna be in love" [...] as she sings about being a [...] "hopeless romantic". He also described the lyric [...] "I wear my heart on my sleeve/ Always let love take the lead" [...] as Talk That Talks [...] "most thoughtful" [...] line. St. Asaph described the lyric [...] "I love the way you taste on <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> when we kiss" [...] as [...] "PG-13 at best," [...] and wrote that {{it is not possible to}} be [...] "lovelorn" [...] as well as filthy at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Vex them no longer," [...] Niam said, [...] And sighing {{bowed her}} gentle head, [...] And sighing laid the pearly tip [...] Of one long finger on <b>my</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Though I'd {{my finger}} on <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> [...] What could I but take up the song? [...] And fish and crowd and gaudy ship [...] Cried out the whole night long, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Silent you stand--nor would I {{hear you}} tell [...] What--speak not--breathe not--for I know it well-- [...] Yet would I ask--almost <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> denies [...] The--quick your answer--tell me where he lies." ...|$|R
500|$|According to {{the digital}} sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal {{range in the}} song span from the note of Eb3 to Cb5. Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes my breath away, b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> our energy connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E
500|$|Fenton {{arrives at}} the oak tree and sings of his {{happiness}} ("Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola" [...] / [...] "From <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> a song of ecstasy flies") ending with [...] "Lips that are kissed lose none of their allure." [...] Nannetta enters to finish the line with [...] "Indeed, they renew it, like the moon." [...] The women arrive and disguise Fenton as a monk, telling him that they have arranged to spoil Ford's and Caius's plans. Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, instructs her helpers ("Sul fil d'un soffio etesio" [...] / [...] "On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, nimble spirits") before all the characters arrive on the scene. Falstaff's attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching, and the men, disguised as elves and fairies, soundly thrash Falstaff. At length he recognises Bardolfo in disguise. The joke is over, and Falstaff acknowledges that he has received his due. Ford announces that a wedding shall ensue. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, also in masquerade, ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well. Ford conducts the double ceremony. Caius finds that instead of Nannetta, his bride is the disguised Bardolfo, and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Ford accepts the fait accompli with good grace. Falstaff, pleased to find himself not the only dupe, proclaims in a fugue, which the entire company sings, that all the world is folly, and all are figures of fun (Tutto nel mondo è burla... Tutti gabbati! / [...] "Everything {{in the world is}} a jest...").|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
6000|$|... ''Fat {{lot of good}} that'll do my face at tea,' Vernon grunted. 'Why couldn't you {{say there}} was {{something}} wrong with you instead of lamming out like a lunatic? Is <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> puffy?' ...|$|R
60|$|For all reply {{she raised}} her eyebrows in token of surprise; Canaples looked askance; I bit <b>my</b> <b>lip,</b> and an awkward silence followed, which, luckily, was quickly ended by the {{appearance}} of Andrea.|$|R
5000|$|The last aria {{speaks of}} proclaiming the miracles of Jesus. The bass is {{accompanied}} by the full orchestra: [...] "" [...] (I will sing of Jesus' wonders and bring <b>my</b> <b>lip's</b> offering to Him).|$|R
2500|$|On April 30, it was {{announced}} that BoA would be releasing her 8th Korean studio album, titled Kiss <b>My</b> <b>Lips,</b> on May 12. This is BoA’s first entirely self-written, self-produced album; where she worked alongside [...] American producers The Underdogs and Stereotypes.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the reading}} or {{chanting}} of the Gospel, the priest prays: [...] "Cleanse {{my heart and}} <b>my</b> <b>lips,</b> O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias...", a reference to Isaiah [...] In this passage, after being cleansed by the angel, Isaiah was instructed to prophesy.|$|E

50|$|Biting <b>My</b> <b>Lip</b> was {{the swan}} song for guitarist Johnny Smoke. Heavily reliant on the harmonies {{produced}} between Brown and Smoke, the remaining members exhaustively {{searched for a}} replacement. Frankie Cacciato joined the band in late 2002.|$|R
6000|$|I bit <b>my</b> <b>lip.</b> 'Well, if you {{succeed in}} evading him,' I said, '{{you will have}} cleared your character. And if you don't--then, Harold, our time will have come: you will have your longed-for chance of trying me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He put his {{handkerchief}} to it. 'Is it bleeding still? It is {{a trick of}} mine to bite <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> when I am vexed. It seems to help to keep down words. There! I have given myself a mark of this hateful outbreak.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Patricia Neal had {{a problem}} saying the phrase, though {{she was proud of}} the film overall. [...] "I do think it's the best science fiction film ever made, {{although}} I admit that I sometimes had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Michael would patiently watch me bite <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> to avoid giggling and ask, with true British reserve, 'Is that the way you intend to play it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|She then {{leaves the}} church in deep anguish: [...] "I have abandoned, not love, but hope", she cries. (Aria: Ciel pietoso, in sì crudo momento, / Al mio labbro perdona un lamento / [...] "Merciful Heaven, in such a cruel moment, / Forgive <b>my</b> <b>lips</b> if they utter a lament"). Then {{religious}} music is heard from within the church with the choir singing blessings to the couple. Alaide's torment continues, until—suddenly—there is silence, followed by chaotic sounds from within.|$|E
2500|$|Tkautz {{was signed}} to Westside Records, a label created by E Streets producers, and {{recorded}} her debut single, [...] "Read My Lips". Redlich described why Tkautz was chosen {{ahead of her}} fellow actresses [...] "I thought it was too raunchy for Toni Pearen and too teeny-bopper for Alyssa-Jane Cook".

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] I answered, biting <b>my</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "But we {{must not}} give way. We must put a bold face upon it. Their bark, after all, may be worse than their bite. We may still persuade them to let us go back again." ...|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to land a}} {{recording}} contract, Split Habit, continued to tour the midwest releasing Biting <b>My</b> <b>Lip,</b> a five-song EP that garnered {{a great deal of}} attention locally and airplay on Q101.

60|$|It {{would have}} been shameful had I shown fear when this lad who knew nothing {{of life on the}} {{frontier}} remained unmoved, and I stiffened <b>my</b> <b>lip</b> as best I might, resolved that neither he nor Simon Kenton should guess of that which was in my heart.|$|R
