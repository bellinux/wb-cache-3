5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} a variety of visual {{repellent}} and harassment techniques used in airport wildlife management. They include using birds of prey and dogs, effigies, and lasers. Birds of prey have been used with great effectiveness at landfills were there were large populations of feeding gulls (Cook et al. 2008). Dogs have also been used with success as visual deterrents and means of harassment for birds at airfields (DeVault et al. 2013). However airport wildlife managers <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> risk of knowingly releasing animals in the airport environment. Both birds of prey and dogs must be monitored by a handler when deployed and must be cared for, when not deployed. Airport wildlife managers <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> economics of these methods (Seamans 2001).|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{wastewater}} treatment plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play. Wastewater treatment is highly capital intensive, restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race {{that is difficult to}} win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain {{wastewater treatment}} plants even if they are successfully developed.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{students}} adjust {{the same way}} to their new setting. One student may take only three months, while others may take four years. One study found that even in their fourth year of schooling, Lao and Vietnamese refugee students in the US were still in a transitional status. Refugee students will continue to encounter difficulties throughout their years in schools that can hinder their ability to learn. Furthermore, educators <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> experiences of students pre-settlement in the US {{in order to provide}} them with the proper support.|$|E
25|$|Although {{acquisition}} planning can {{be useful}} to governments, there are several problems that must be considered. Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.|$|E

The reader <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> direction in which the asymmetrical hieroglyphs are turned {{in order to determine}} the proper reading order. For example, when human and animal hieroglyphs face to the left (i.e., they look left), they must be read from left to right, and vice versa, the idea being that the hieroglyphs face the beginning of the line.|$|E
25|$|In a line {{of cases}} {{beginning}} with Crawford v. Washington, decided in 2004, Thomas has joined with Justice Scalia and several liberals on the court in reasserting {{the importance of the}} Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, by declaring testimonial statements inadmissible at trial unless the witness is unavailable and there has been ample opportunity for cross-examination; however, his decisions in these cases had not always aligned with Scalia's. In his concurring opinion in the 2011 case Michigan v. Bryant, for example, Thomas explains that in deciding whether a statement is testimonial, one <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> formality of the circumstances in which it was given.|$|E

The bank must also satisfy the supervisor that the data used to build these models are representative of its exposures, and there is no distortion in the calculation of regulatory capital due to the use of these models. Banks must also have in place a system governing the use of these models and whether they are fit for purpose for ongoing use; such a system <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> stability of the model as well as its ability to predict default accurately.|$|E

25|$|In {{evaluating}} {{these signs}} and symptoms, one <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> frequency of repetition, {{whether or not}} the movements can be suppressed voluntarily (either by cognitive decisions, restraint, or sensory tricks), the awareness of the affected individual during the movement events, any urges to make the movements, and if the affected individual feels rewarded after having completed the movement. The context of the movement should also be noted; this means that a movement could be triggered in a certain posture, while at rest, during action, or during a specific task. The movementâ€™s quality can also be described in observing {{whether or not the}} movement can be categorized as a normal movement by an unaffected individual, or one that is not normally made on a daily basis by unaffected individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} principle {{is that a}} member of the Court Constitutional Court cannot be dismissed. Decisions to dismiss a Court members must be taken by the person or body (i.e. the President of the Republic or the National Assembly; in the latter case, by a majority vote {{of the total number of}} Deputies) having appointed the member in question. Where such a question has been raised, the Constitutional Court <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> case in the memberâ€™s absence, and must issue a conclusion- on the termination of the memberâ€™s office by a majority of at least two thirds of the Court membership (i.e. 6 out of 9). Once the conclusion has been issued, the actual decision on the Constitutional Court memberâ€™s dismissal must be taken by the authority having appointed him or her (although in fact no member of the Constitutional Court has ever been dismissed since its inauguration). The independence of the members of the Constitutional Court is guaranteed by their submission to the Constitution and the Law on the Constitutional Court. It is prohibited to influence {{a member of the}} Constitutional Court, and anyone attempting to do so is liable to prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The {{humidity}} and temperature determines {{the amount of}} foraging that occurs in Parachartergus fraternus nests. There was almost double the amount of foraging on sunny days than on cloudy days. This means {{that the number of}} wasps leaving and returning to the nest was lower on cloudy days than on sunny days. On cloudy days there was a milder temperature and a higher relative humidity. On sunny days there was lower humidity, a warmer temperature, and higher brightness levels. The temperature has positive effects on foraging while humidity had negative effects. Wasps are also less likely to forage on windy days. They <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> amount of energy it takes to leave the nest, find and subdue the prey, and carry it back to the nest. Windier weather makes this harder. There may be metabolic adjustments to seasonal changes of temperature and humidity. Time of day also factors into foraging behavior. Longer days are more favorable for flight. Wasps are also exposed to more predation on sunny days because predators are usually more active too. This variation in foraging levels is also seen in other wasp species like P. lanio lanio.|$|E
