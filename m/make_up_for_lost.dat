On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with rear brake failure a few laps later.

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of light therapy for treating SAD {{may be linked}} to the fact that light therapy <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> sunlight exposure and resets the body's internal clock. Studies show that light therapy helps reduce the debilitating and depressive behaviors of SAD, such as excessive sleepiness and fatigue, with results lasting for at least 1 month. Light therapy is preferred over antidepressants in the treatment of SAD because it is a relatively safe and easy therapy.|$|R

25|$|The {{speed and}} {{punctuality}} of many LB passenger services {{was the subject}} of widespread criticism in the technical and popular press during the 1890s. This was in part {{due in part to the}} complexity of the system between London and Croydon, with a large number of signals and junctions, the sharing of stretches of line with the SER, and the relatively short routes, which gave little opportunity to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time. The LB gradually began to rebuild its reputation during the twentieth century through improvements to main-line infrastructure and electrification of suburban services.|$|E
25|$|The {{top speed}} of {{some parts of the}} main lines allow trains to travel at 180km/h, these are however small {{sections}} of the main lines which are quickly passed onto slower sections around 140â€“160km/h. Most parts of the rail network are unelectrified - thus slowing acceleration and top speed. Since 2007 it has been common practice for the infrastructure provider Banedanmark to pad the timetables with extra time to a near European record, resulting in railway companies which only utilize the top speeds to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} {{self-treatment}} of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> time by producing more glutamine than it needs.|$|E
25|$|Workers obtain {{information}} about colony needs from the environment, and must respond {{to changes in}} colony structure. Activity in the colony seems to be decentralized, {{with the majority of}} interactions initiated by workers, not the queen. Workers that are more dominant tend to pressure subordinates to forage by dominance interactions, and thus subordinates do the majority of foraging. Those who are foragers must respond to intrinsic and extrinsic changes in colony need in order to maintain levels of food, water and building materials. The job of collecting water seems to belong to a small number of fixated foragers. When water foragers are removed from the nest, the remaining individuals will increase their search rate rather than recruit other workers to become water foragers. This indicates that foraging for water is a specialized job. Nectar collection, however, depends on a larger number of workers. When nectar foragers are removed from the nest, new individuals are recruited to replace them. This may be because the location of nectar is not always known, and nectar foragers are not able to increase their search rate to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> workers.|$|E

Despite this, the Olympic champion was only 6 points behind Nathan Chen (in first) and less than 3.5 points behind Shoma Uno (in second). During his free skating, he started strong with a quadruple loop and a quadruple Salchow, followed by a triple flip, but then popped his second quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop combination attempt to a double Salchow.

25|$|Korean {{courts have}} ruled {{that it may}} violate the {{constitution}} {{for the government to}} limit the amount of money hagwon can charge. In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. Along with these restrictions, hagwon also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of hagwon caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwon are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwon added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> study time. Other hagwon simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67percent of hagwon sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.|$|E
