5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> an affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, {{and eight}} booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} involves two teams, each competing {{to shoot}} a lacrosse ball into the opposing team's goal. A lacrosse ball {{is made out of}} solid rubber, measuring 7.75 to 8inches (19.7–20cm) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5.25ounces (140–149g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> a lacrosse stick (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.|$|E
5|$|Other {{minorities}} lack bumiputera status. 24.6 {{per cent}} of the population are of Chinese descent, while those of Indian descent comprise 7.3 per {{cent of the}} population. The Chinese have historically been dominant {{in the business and}} commerce community, and form a plurality of the population of Penang. Immigrants from India, the majority of them Tamils, began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century. Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia, but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia. Dual citizenship is not permitted. Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card known as MyKad at the age of 12, and <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> the card at all times.|$|E

5|$|Within Singapore, the {{national}} flag {{takes precedence over}} all other flags, subject to international practice. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse <b>must</b> <b>carry</b> a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E
