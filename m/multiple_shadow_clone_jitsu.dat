5000|$|The <b>Shadow</b> <b>Clone</b> Jutsu (English manga: [...] "Art of the Shadow Doppelganger") {{is one of}} Naruto Uzumaki's {{signature}} techniques, {{invented by}} Tobirama Senju with the instructions placed in a forbidden scroll that Naruto was tricked into stealing by a ninja named Mizuki. Unlike regular <b>clone</b> jutsus, the <b>Shadow</b> <b>Clones</b> are physical clones of the user capable of cohabiting with their surroundings, performing jutsu, and engaging in battle before dispersing in {{a puff of smoke}} when sufficiently damaged or at the user's discretion. When clones are created, the user's chakra is evenly distributed among them, making it easy for the user to quickly expend their chakra. While most ninja limit themselves to only making a few clones because of this, Naruto can create thousands of clones due to his large amount of chakra. He can also combine it with his [...] "Sexy Jutsu" [...] to produce the [...] "Harem Jutsu". During Part II, having been unaware of this fact until Kakashi explains it, Naruto learns that any knowledge his clone possesses will be transferred to him at the moment that the jutsu is canceled.

The Rayan can deal large amounts of melee damage in combination with enhancing buffs and their shadow. Their styles of skill primarily focus on pure assassination techniques, mostly focused on taking down their targets quickly with dark slashes and traceless strikes.

At around this time, the program also became 'abandonware'.

It is a spinning ball of compressed chakra formed in the user's hand that tears and grinds with great force at anything it contacts.

40|$|The {{relation}} between two time physics (2 T-physics) and the ordinary one time formulation of physics (1 T-physics) {{is similar to}} the {{relation between}} a 3 -dimensional object moving in a room and its <b>multiple</b> <b>shadows</b> moving on walls when projected from different perspectives. The <b>multiple</b> <b>shadows</b> as seen by observers stuck on the wall are analogous to the effects of the 2 T-universe as experienced in ordinary 1 T spacetime. In this paper we develop some of the quantitative aspects of this 2 T to 1 T relationship in the context of field theory. We discuss 2 T field theory in d+ 2 dimensions and its shadows in the form of 1 T field theories when the theory contains Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Yang-Mills fields, such as the Standard Model of particles and forces. We show that the shadow 1 T field theories must have hidden relations among themselves. These relations take the form of dualities and hidden spacetime symmetries. A subset of the shadows are 1 T field theories in different gravitational backgrounds (different space-times) such as the flat Minkowski spacetime, the Robertson-Walker expanding universe, AdS(d-k) x S(k) and others, including singular ones. We explicitly construct the duality transformations among this conformally flat subset, and build the generators of their hidden SO(d, 2) symmetry. The existence of such hidden relations among 1 T field theories, which can be tested by both theory and experiment in 1 T-physics, is part of the evidence for the underlying d+ 2 dimensional spacetime and the unifying 2 T-physics structure.

For instance, Naruto Uzumaki is able to use his signature <b>Shadow</b> <b>Clone</b> Technique, and Rock Lee utilizes many of his Strong Fist style techniques.

T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews claimed that it was in [...] "fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades", and praised the [...] "invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques [...] manage to continuously infuse action sets with life". However, it criticized the [...] "overemployment of certain special techniques" [...] such as Naruto Uzumaki's <b>Shadow</b> <b>Clone</b> Technique, noting that the fights became [...] "bland and repetitive" [...] over time. Anime News Network (ANN) considered the structure of battles [...] "repetitive to a fault – a series of competing power-ups followed by an elegiac coda", but mollified by the series' [...] "winning formula: the villains are vile, the heroes sympathetic, and the stakes high".|$|R

Photographic splicing, herein defined as a cut-and-paste of image regions from one image onto another image, is difficult to be detected due to the absence of a reference object. To carry out such forensic analysis, we present a novel shadow-based method, with which the fake shadow of the composites can be detected. We show how to estimate the shadow scale factors with a shadow removal technique and, further, how to estimate the growth rate of the penumbra width (GRPW). Inconsistencies in the shadows are then used as evidence of tampering. Compared with other shadow-based forensic methods, the proposed method can not only deal with the problem of <b>shadow</b> <b>cloning</b> in the same image, but also expose the fakery containing the real shadow, which benefit from the estimation of shadow scale factors and GRPW.
