Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation.

25|$|In general, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that smaller colonies are less aggressive than larger ones. There are differing observations of the D. arenaria’s personality, one stating that they are quarrelsome and then other arguing that they are not. But this difference <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that the first observation was observing the behavior when approaching a D. arenaria nest, whereas the other was describing behavior of workers away from their nest individually. Smaller colonies’ colony defense behavior is said to be unpredictable and erratic.|$|E

25|$|There {{are very}} few {{historical}} details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because {{of the use of}} the Persian period term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515BC. Malachi was apparently known to the author of Ecclesiasticus early in the 2nd century BC. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between Haggai and Zechariah, slightly before Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445BC.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a steady {{increase}} in female graduates in agricultural sciences {{since the turn of}} the century. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, numbers of female graduates in agricultural science have been increasing steadily, with eight countries reporting a share of women graduates of 40% or more: Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The reasons for this surge are unclear, although one explanation <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing emphasis on national food security and the food industry. Another possible explanation is that women are highly represented in biotechnology. For example, in South Africa, women were underrepresented in engineering (16%) in 2004 and in ‘natural scientific professions’ (16%) in 2006 but made up 52% of employees working in biotechnology-related companies.|$|E
25|$|Maximising funding {{permitted}} under pre-emption rules. For countries, {{such as the}} UK, where {{companies are}} subject to limits {{on the number of}} shares that can be offered to non-shareholders non-pre-emptively, convertibles can raise more money than via equity issues. Under the UK’s 1989 Guidelines issued by the Investor Protection Committees (IPCs) of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Fund Managers (NAPF), the IPCs will advise their members not to object to non pre-emptive issues which add no more than 5pct to historic non-diluted balance sheet equity in the period from AGM to AGM, and no more than 7.5pct in total over a period of 3 financial years. The pre-emption limits are calculated on the assumption of 100pct probability of conversion, using the figure of undiluted historic balance sheet share capital (where there is assumed a 0pct probability of conversion). There is no attempt to assign probabilities of conversion in both circumstances, which would result in bigger convertible issues being permitted. The reason for his inconsistency <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Pre Emption Guidelines were drawn up in 1989, and binomial evaluations were not commonplace amongst professional investors until 1991-92.|$|E

The reason behind such discrepancy between phenotypical traits and genetic ancestry <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low African contribution found within the Mexican population relative to Brazil and Colombia. In addition, the samples used in Mexico's case were highly unproportional, as the northern and western regions of Mexico contain 45% of Mexico's population, but no more than 10% of the samples used in the study came from the states located in these regions. For the most part, the rest of the samples hailed from Mexico City and southern Mexican states.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{itself may}} explain why the Shulchan Aruch became an authoritative code, despite significant opposition, and even against the will of its author, while Maimonides' (1135–1204) Mishneh Torah rulings were not necessarily accepted as binding among the Franco-German Jews, perhaps owing to Abraham ben David's (1110–1180) (known as the [...] "Ravad") criticism and influence. The answer <b>may</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that the criticism by Ravad undermined confidence in Maimonides' work, while Isserles (who actually corresponded with Karo) does not simply criticize, but supplements Karo's work extensively, {{with the result that}} the Ashkenazim then accepted the Shulchan Aruch, assuming that together with Isserles' glosses it was a reliable authority. This then became broadly accepted among Jewish communities around the world as the binding Jewish legal code.|$|E
