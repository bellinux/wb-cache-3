I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E
5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, <b>my</b> <b>letter,</b> I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
500|$|During Arnold's time in Virginia, {{two things}} {{happened}} {{that had a}} negative impact on his reputation. [...] He wrote a letter to Lord George Germain, the British colonial secretary, criticizing Clinton's conduct of the war. [...] Word of this communication reached Clinton, and Arnold was met with a frosty reception on his return to New York, and with assignments to perform menial administrative tasks. [...] Arnold attempted to make amends, writing to Germain, [...] "I find <b>my</b> <b>letter</b> has given umbrage; I am extremely sorry for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams {{made his}} first {{official}} visit to the nation's new seat of government in early June 1800. Amid the [...] "raw and unfinished" [...] cityscape, the president found the public buildings [...] "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected." [...] He moved into the nearly completed President's Mansion (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, [...] "Before I end <b>my</b> <b>letter,</b> I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof." [...] The Senate of the Sixth Congress {{met for the first}} time in the new Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. Several days later, on November 22, Adams delivered his fourth State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Senate chamber. This would be the last annual message any president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} NAVSEA responsibility, he further states: [...] "I {{always felt that}} the {{investigators}} closed their eyes to the most likely cause {{because they did not}} want to acknowledge their own involvement in this tragedy.

2500|$|Survival was a moral {{as well as}} a {{physical}} struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was [...] "not sure that I shall not be one by the time <b>my</b> <b>letter</b> reaches you." [...] The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.|$|E
2500|$|I was to {{have dinner}} that night with [...] Cadogan.

[...] It seemed a long time ago. [...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the book's publication, {{legal counsel}} for Cruise made {{statements}} to the press regarding the author's research. [...] When an attorney for Tom Cruise read reports that Morton had obtained letters asserting Cruise had a homosexual affair while filming Eyes Wide Shut, he commented on a November 2005 letter he had written to Morton: [...] "I {{wrote a letter to}} Mr. Morton back in November and said he obviously was entitled to write the book but 'make sure you check your facts'. If he tries to use <b>my</b> <b>letter</b> to create the impression that Mr. Cruise did have a gay affair, we will certainly sue … because the story is false. Mr. Cruise is not gay." [...] In an interview with InTouch Weekly, Cruise's attorney Bertram Fields commented on the book: [...] "To the extent that Mr. Morton's book sticks to the truth, it can't 'ruin' or 'harm' Tom … My guess is this book will be dull except for those parts that are lies." [...] Cruise's publicist also stated that the book will consist of fabricated lies.|$|E

The Capelin and Mackeral will not be launched until the middle of next month and I fear will not be ready to proceed to Newfoundland this winter. There being no iron ballast sent out for the schooners is of great inconvenience and the Navy Board have positively forbid any being purchased. The schooners being very buoyant obliges us to fill the hold with stone and carry all the water and provisions between decks so that the men have very little room. They are fine vessels of the kind and have the appearance of fast sailors. I beg leave to observe to your excellency that there being no establishment for the supply of necessaries, we are supplying them on the most reasonable terms possible and mean to forward the vouchers to the victualling board.

2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received <b>my</b> <b>letter,</b> he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E

2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer <b>my</b> <b>letter</b> soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
