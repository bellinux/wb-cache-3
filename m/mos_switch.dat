40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to demonstrate the feasibility of the implementation of wideband RF CMOS PLLs with high spectral purity using deep sub-micron technologies. To achieve wide frequency coverage, this dissertation proposed a 45 -nm SOI-CMOS RF PLL with a wide frequency range to support multiple standards. The PLL has small parasitic capacitance {{with the help of a}} SOI technology, increasing the frequency tuning range of a capacitor bank. A designed and fabricated chip demonstrates the PLL supporting almost all cellular standards with a single PLL. This dissertation also proposed a third order sample-hold loop filter with two <b>MOS</b> <b>switches</b> for high spectral purity. Sample-hold operation improves in-band and out-of-band phase noise performance simultaneously in RF PLLs. By controlling the size of the <b>MOS</b> <b>switches</b> and control time, the nonideal effects of the <b>MOS</b> <b>switches</b> are minimized. The sample-hold loop filter is implemented within a 45 -nm RF PLL and the performance is evaluated. Thus, this research provides a solution for wideband CMOS frequency synthesizers for multi-band, multi-mode, and multiple-standard applications in deep sub-micron technologies.

40|$|Summary form only given. The analog <b>MOS</b> <b>switch</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{building}} blocks in switched-data circuits (switched capacitor, current-copier, track-and-hold, etc.). Their main limitation regarding accuracy is linked to the problem of charge injection that induces output voltage errors. Several physical studies recently addressed the charge injection problem in bulk MOSFETs under low-voltage conditions (considering the weak inversion contribution) or in SOI MOSFETs under large voltage transients. In this paper we compare charge injection in bulk and SOI MOS switches from a low-voltage circuit point of view, using MEDICI 2 -D simulations, for three different MOS processes: typical bulk with a threshold voltage (VT) of 0. 72 V, comparable fully-depleted SOI with VT= 0. 74 V, and low-voltage SOI. Our analysis has demonstrated significant differences in the charge components injected by bulk and SOI MOS switches and their dependence on process and circuit conditions.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a wideband 2 13 -bit in-phase/ quadrature-phase (I/Q) RF digital-to-analog converter-based all-digital modulator realized in 65 -nm CMOS. The isolation between I and Q paths is guaranteed employing 25 % duty-cycle differen-tial quadrature clocks. With a 1. 3 -V supply and an on-chip power combiner, the digital I/Q transmitter provides more than 21 -dBm RF output power within a frequency range of 1. 36 – 2. 51 GHz. The peak RF output power, overall system, and drain efficiencies of the modulator are 22. 8 dBm, 34 %, and 42 %, respectively. The mea-sured static noise floor is below 160 dBc/Hz. The digital I/Q RF modulator demonstrates an IQ image rejection and local oscillator leakage of 65 and 68 dBc, respectively. It could be linearized using {{either of the}} two digital predistortion (DPD) approaches: a memoryless polynomial or a lookup table. Its linearity is examined using single-carrier 4 / 16 / 64 / 256 / 1024 quadrature amplitude mod-ulation (QAM), as well as multi-carrier 256 -QAM orthogonal fre-quency-division multiplexing baseband signals while their related modulation bandwidth can be as high as 154 MHz. Employing DPD improves the third-order intermodulation product by more than 25 dB, while the measured error vector magnitude for a “single-carrier 22 -MHz 64 -QAM ” signal is better than 28 dB.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Two {{aspects of}} ADC system {{performance}} are {{addressed in this}} work. First, {{the combination of the}} ADC and its associated reference are co-designed for an energy constrained remote sensing system. Second, sampling linearity is mathematically analyzed as a function of frequency to provide enhanced understanding into an ADC's requisite sampling network. Low energy analog design techniques for emerging systems powered by energy scavenging are demonstrated {{in the context of an}} analog-to-digital converter system. It is composed of a variable gain sample-and-hold amplifier, a low voltage reference, a 1. 5 bit per stage 9 -b cyclic ADC, clock generation, reference buffers, and control logic. A novel Class-AB current mirror amplifier together with correlated level shifting enable wide swing and enhanced gain operation at low supply voltages while reducing current draw. The use of subthreshold MOSFETs instead of bipolar junction transistors allows the use of traditional bandgap circuit techniques to be employed for a 530 mV reference that is less than a diode voltage drop. Operating from a 750 mV supply voltage and 20. 48 kSPS, the ADC and reference consume 9. 5 μA and 1. 5 μA, respectively. The measured 7. 9 -bit ENOB results in an FoM of 2. 24 pJ/step. The total energy consumption is 535 pJ per conversion for the entire system. A novel model predicts tracking nonlinearity (NL) in the form of harmonic distortion (HD) for weakly NL (i. e. SFDR> 30 dBc) first order open-loop sampling circuits. The mechanisms for the NL are exponential settling, amplitude modulation, phase modulation and discrete-time modulation. The model demonstrates that HD typically increases at 20 dB per decade over most standard operating ranges and is a function of input frequency, sampling bandwidth, input amplitude, the sample rate and component nonlinearity. Application of the model is reduced to the equivalent of frequency-independent nonlinearity analysis over this range, requiring only a Taylor series expansion of the NL time constant. Design insight is given for common <b>MOS</b> <b>switch</b> types, revealing a high correlation between HD and bandwidth. The first method to quantify the trade-off between thermal noise (SNR) and linearity (SFDR) for sampling circuits is presented.
