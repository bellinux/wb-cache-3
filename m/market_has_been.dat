It {{was not until}} 2006 that BSkyB's monopoly on Premier League television rights was broken; this came after {{an investigation by the}} European Commission which concluded that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Setanta Sports was awarded two packages, but encountered financial difficulties by 2009 and went into administration. Their rights were sold to ESPN, who showed a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season and subsequently 23 from 2010–11 to 2012–13. In June 2012, the Premier League awarded BT rights to 38 games over three seasons, starting from 2013–14. BT's introduction into the football broadcasting <b>market</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> considered a threat to BSkyB's dominance, particularly as the company was awarded exclusive rights to live UEFA Champions League football in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Unger’s {{critique}} of Marginalism begins with Walras’ equilibrium theory, which attempted {{to achieve a}} certainty of economic analysis by putting aside normative controversies of social organization. Unger finds three weaknesses that crippled the theory: foremost, the theory claimed that equilibrium would be spontaneously generated in a market economy. In reality, a self-adjusting equilibrium fails to occur. Second, the theory puts forth a determinate image of the market. Historically, however, the <b>market</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown to be indeterminate with different market arrangements. Third, the polemical use of efficiency fails {{to account for the}} differences of distribution among individuals, classes, and generations.|$|E
25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the <b>market</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
