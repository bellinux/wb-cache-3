5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E
5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Lebrón {{was hospitalized}} {{multiple}} times, the first being {{due to a}} fall that fractured her hip and an arm, requiring surgery. On September 18, 2009, she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory affection. Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> issued a press release in appreciation for the public's support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón's death, praising her activism. Her life was eulogized even in European papers.|$|E

Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|During late 1536, Farel {{drafted a}} {{confession}} of faith, and Calvin wrote separate articles on reorganizing {{the church in}} Geneva. On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council. The document described the <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> frequency of their celebrations of the Eucharist, the reason for, and the method of, excommunication, the requirement {{to subscribe to the}} confession of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws. The council accepted the document on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} 27th Battalion {{returned}} to Egypt, where the AIF undertook {{a period of}} training and re-organisation as reinforcements arrived from Australia. During this time the AIF was expanded from two infantry divisions to four– with a fifth forming in Australia– and many infantry battalions that had seen service at Gallipoli were split up to provide cadre staff for the newly raised battalions. The battalions of the 2nd Division, however, were not split up in this <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> the 27th Battalion remained intact.|$|E

Occasionally his easy <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo in the same <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E

5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible <b>manner,</b> <b>and</b> adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant.

The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history.

On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British <b>manner,</b> <b>and</b> referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.|$|E

Between 1966 and 1970, this system operated in the same <b>manner</b> <b>and</b> served the same purposes as the much better known Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese) which ran through the southeastern portion of the Kingdom of Laos. The name is of American derivation, since the North Vietnamese considered the system integral to the supply route mentioned above. U.S. attempts to interdict this system began in 1969.|$|E
