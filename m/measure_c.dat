Measure A, issued by 3rd Army headquarters, called for {{the withdrawal of the}} interval troops on 15 June, protected by the casemates and ouvrages. Measure B was the withdrawal of artillery forces from the intervals late that day and into the 16th, protected by the ouvrages. <b>Measure</b> <b>C</b> was the withdrawal of all but skeleton forces from the fortifications.
