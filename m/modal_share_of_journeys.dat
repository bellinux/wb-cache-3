40|$|Imperatives {{to improve}} the {{sustainability}} of cities often hinge upon plans to increase urban residential density to facilitate greater reliance on sustainable forms of transport and minimise car use. However there is ongoing debate about whether high residential density land use in isolation results in sustainable transport outcomes. Findings from surveys with residents of inner-urban high density dwellings in Brisbane, Australia, suggest that solo car travel accounts for the greatest <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> typical work <b>journeys</b> and attitudes toward dwelling and neighbourhood transport-related features, residential sorting factors and socio-demographics, alongside land use such as public transport availability, are significantly associated with work travel mode choice. We discuss the implications of our findings for transport policy and management including encouraging relatively sustainable intermodal forms of transport for work journeys...|$|R

30|$|The National New Urbanization Plan (2014 – 2020) {{proposed}} {{that the proportion of}} urban public transport travel will account for 60 % of total motorized travel by 2020. How is the <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> passenger transport capacity that urban rail transit should take as the backbone of urban public transport? In most metropolitan cities, urban rail transit accounts for more than 50 % [3, 4, 5], whereas in Tokyo, New York, and Hong Kong, the proportion is as high as 80 – 90 % [6, 7]. However, in Mainland China, Shanghai has the world’s largest urban rail transit system, but its <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> is only 50 %, while the national average <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> is only approximately 10 % [8]. Therefore, it is necessary to substantially increase both the proportion of public transport commute and the <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> urban rail transit over the 5  years. The substantial increases in these two areas would promote the development of urban rail transit.|$|R

30|$|Additionally, the European Commission {{is aiming}} to shift road freight {{transport}} to more sustainable transport modes [10, 11]. Policy makers on national and regional levels and port authorities have made significant efforts to shift goods from road to rail, inland navigation and short sea shipping. In many cases, these modal shift policies aim at a wide audience of potential beneficiaries, using policy instruments such as taxation, regulation, infrastructural measures or the granting of financial incentives [12]. In countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, policy makers also demand transport consultants to approach individual companies and assist them in the start-up of using intermodal transport services [13, 14]. Unfortunately, however, the current <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> these alternative modes remains modest in most European regions. In the Flanders region in Belgium for instance, the 2011 <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> {{road freight transport}}, expressed in ton-km, was still estimated to be around 81  % compared to 9  % for rail and 10  % for inland waterways [15].|$|R

The aim of this dissertation is to analyse freight transport flows in order to provide operational solutions to increase the <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> railways transport through a better use of intermodal terminals. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation a theoretical survey of freight transport models is provided, in order to show the linkage between freight transport and economic activities. A comprehensive analysis of data sources at European, national and regional levels is also provided. In the second part of the dissertation an application to the case of railway intermodal terminals in France is provided, with some comparisons to other European countries. The scope of the analysis is to estimate the potential demand of combined transport, to assess the productivity of intermodal terminals and to evaluate the socio-economic and financial impact of new investments in terminals, also through new project financing schemes (PPPs). The results show a large potential for railway intermodal transport, especially in connection with maritime ports, and low productivity in existing terminals. As a consequence it’s fundamental to concentrate new investments in a few high potential locations, in order to attract private investments and to provide a better use of public funds. The policy implications of this analysis are multiple: it concerns first the railway companies and the infrastructure managers, which should better plan their investments according to commercial needs. It concerns also governments and regional authorities which should better concentrate public funds on optimal terminal locations. RFF Réseau Ferré de Franc...|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1950s, Copenhagen {{experienced}} {{a decline in}} utility cycling due to increasing wealth and affordability of motor vehicles. While no bike paths were actually removed at the time, new road construction omitted bicycle infrastructure, and many bike lanes were curtailed at intersections to increase the throughput of cars by adding turn pockets and other car related infrastructure in its place. At the same time car traffic increased dramatically on existing streets without bicycle infrastructure, decreasing the cyclists sense of safety on those streets.

40|$|In recent years, the {{interest}} of companies for mobility has steadily increased through both public policies aiming at involving the companies in the mobility issue and business objectives mobility can achieve. As a result, {{a growing number of}} companies have implemented an Employer Transport Plan (ETP). However, the research literature has brought only a limited attention to ETPs. In addition, existing studies on commuting are often based on the analysis of one specific mode of transport. Hence, the aim {{of this paper is to}} find out whether ETPs change the commuting behaviour of workers by simultaneously analysing the <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> each mode of transport use to commute in Belgium. To achieve this objective data of the Belgian 2 ̆ 018 home to work travels' diagnosis is used. This diagnosis is performed ever 3 years by the FPS Mobility and Transport and is mandatory: each company located in Belgium and employing at least 100 workers have to fill in a mobility questionnaire. Two diagnoses (in 2005 and in 2008) are available to date, and are used in this research. The database contains information on the modal split and its evolution at 4459 workplaces, as well as on the ETP which was implemented by those workplaces at both dates. Spatial econometrics techniques are then used in order to explain the modal splits at each workplace. In fact, spatial autocorrelation has been detected in the data and spatial econometrics allow taking into account similar unobserved environmental characteristics. A single equation (SE) is firstly estimated to explain the <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> each mode of transport. Statistical tests are performed on these SE in order to find out the model specification and the weight matrices to be used. Then, the <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> are simultaneously estimated thanks to a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). The results show that the estimated coefficients of the SUR model do not differ from those estimated in the SEs and that the promotion of alternative modes of transport increases their use. The SUR model will also be estimated with an adding-up constraint in order to ensure that the sum <b>of</b> the estimated <b>modal</b> <b>shares</b> do not exceed hundred percents. The results of this model will then be compared with the SE and SUR models...|$|R

These include widening cycle tracks to 3 lanes to allow for conversational cycling and increase the sense of safety on the cycle tracks, while at the same time allowing for higher speeds among commuters. The city further plans to decrease travel times by expanding the use of green waves adjusted to cycling speeds, and building additional bicycle and pedestrian only bridges across busy streets and over the harbour and canals. The city also plans to increase safety by redesigning a number of intersections with a high number of accidents, and rebuilding school routes with safer infrastructure, and speed decreasing measures. Finally the strategy also aims to improve the chaotic bicycle parking conditions, by greatly expanding the number of parking spaces, especially in and around stations.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the support}} of the EU {{in the form of the}} Railway Reform Packages 1 through 4, actual rail freight {{performance}} as a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the market has been variable. At EU level, rail’s <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the freight market has consistently fallen, against a background of rising total volumes. In the the new member states (EU 12) – in many of which rail freight was dominant under Communism [11] –a downward trend can be noted, whereas in western member states (EU 15) rail’s share has slightly increased or remained the same [12]. Overall, rail’s <b>modal</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the freight movement in tonne-km declined from 13.6 % in 1995, to 11.9 % in 2011 [13] and further declined to 11.7 % in 2014 [14]. With this reality in mind, in its 2011 Transport White Paper the European Commission set a target of 50 % modal shift from road to rail (and waterways) transport, by 2050, for distances over 300  km. It continues to support this aspiration through policy, regulation, and research and innovation [6].|$|R
