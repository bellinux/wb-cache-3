25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied <b>me</b> <b>then</b> was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E

[...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that {{would come in and}} do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her.

500|$|In the conclusion, the soloist {{repeats the}} earlier phrase, {{but this time}} the chorus finally joins {{in the words of the}} appellation. The soloist {{introduces}} a new wording [...] (Forget them not, the dead). The chorus repeats this phrase, marked espressivo, dolcissimo, on the melody of the chorale , five stanzas of which Bach used in his St Matthew Passion. The melody is not repeated as in the original, but continued for half a line. Reger is known for quoting chorales in general and this one in particular, most often referring to its last stanza , which Bach included in the Passion right after the death of Jesus. The corresponding text would then be [...] (When I must depart one day, do not part from <b>me</b> <b>then.</b> When the greatest anxiety...).|$|E

It was a memorable experience because it occurred to <b>me</b> <b>then</b> that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing.

Lang was most strongly influenced by Caird, who gave the boy's mind [...] "its first real awakening". Lang recalled how, in a revelation as he was passing through Kelvingrove Park, he expressed aloud his sudden conviction that: [...] "The Universe is one and its Unity and Ultimate Reality is God!" [...] He acknowledged that his greatest failure at the University was his inability to make any progress in his understanding of mathematics, [...] "to <b>me,</b> <b>then</b> and always, unintelligible".|$|E
