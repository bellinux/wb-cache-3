25|$|In 1963, Evans {{recorded}} Conversations with <b>Myself,</b> <b>an</b> innovative {{solo album}} using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself. In 1966, he met bassist Eddie Gómez, {{with whom he}} would work for eleven years. Many successful albums followed, in trio, duo, and solo settings, such as Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Alone, and The Bill Evans Album, among others.|$|E

In 1963, {{after having}} {{switched}} from Riverside to {{the much more}} widely distributed Verve (for financial reasons related to his drug addiction), he recorded Conversations with <b>Myself,</b> <b>an</b> innovative album which featured overdubbing, layering up to three individual tracks of piano for each song. The album won him his first Grammy award.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, {{in search of a}} change from his unrewarding {{clerical}} job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket. He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, {{he would be able to}} finance his winter studies of music and literature. His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright. Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: [...] "Because of Alington I call <b>myself...</b> <b>an</b> old Salopian". Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea. In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.|$|E

In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God.

2500|$|Lee was {{identified}} as an agnostic on several occasions, notably during an interview with Goh Keng Swee in 1983 when the latter identified S. Rajaratnam and Lee as agnostics. Lee personally stated his agnosticism during an interview with The New York Times in 2010, but elaborated that he had practised Chinese folk religion while growing up. Lee ceased religious practices of Chinese folk religious customs {{following the death of}} his father in 1997. He reinforced his religious views in his autobiography, stating, [...] "I wouldn't call <b>myself</b> <b>an</b> atheist. I neither deny nor accept that there is a God." [...] In 2009, Lee Kuan Yew identified himself as a member of the Buddhist/Taoist community in an interview with Mark Jacobson for the National Geographic Magazine. Two of his younger brothers, Freddy Lee and Lee Suan Yew, have been active members of the Anglican and Methodist churches respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Palmer {{sought the}} Democratic Party's {{nomination}} for President in 1920. In a crowded field of candidates, he presented {{himself as the}} most American of all. Campaigning during the Georgia primary, he said: [...] "I am <b>myself</b> <b>an</b> American and I love to preach my doctrine before undiluted one hundred percent Americans, because my platform is, in a word, undiluted Americanism and undying loyalty to the republic." [...] Journalist Heywood Broun pretended to investigate: [...] "We assumed, of course, from the tone of Mr. Palmer's manifesto that his opponents for the nomination were Rumanians, Greeks and Icelanders, and weak-kneed ones at that....We happened into Cox's headquarters wholly by accident and were astounded to discover that he, too, is an American. ... Thus encouraged we went to all camps {{and found that the}} candidates are all Americans." [...] Palmer had considerable support among party professionals, but no track record as a campaigner or a vote winner. He won delegates in the Michigan and Georgia primaries but did so without demonstrating voter appeal. He also faced strong opposition from labor for his use of an injunction against striking coal miners in the fall of 1919. Though he probably never had a chance of winning the nomination, he ran a respectable third until his support collapsed on the convention's 39th ballot and the nomination shortly thereafter went to Ohio Governor James Cox.|$|E
