50|$|This {{submerged}} atoll {{is named}} after Dr. Alden Partridge Colvocoresses who developed in 1973 - 1979 the Space-oblique Mercator projection with John P. Snyder and John L. Junkins. The least charted depth is 9 m above the reef.

5000|$|Landsat {{missions}} 1 through 5 {{carried the}} Landsat <b>Multispectral</b> <b>Scanner</b> (MSS), while missions 4 and 5 used the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scanner. The <b>Multispectral</b> <b>Scanner</b> had a 230 mm (9 in) fused silica dinner-plate mirror epoxy bonded to three invar tangent bars mounted to {{base of a}} Ni/Au brazed Invar frame in a Serrurier truss that was arranged with four [...] "Hobbs-Links" [...] (conceived by Dr. Gregg Hobbs), crossing at mid-truss. This construct ensured the secondary mirror would simply oscillate about the primary optic axis to maintain focus despite vibration inherent from the 360 mm (14 in) beryllium scan mirror. This engineering solution allowed the United States to develop LANDSAT {{at least five years}} ahead of the French SPOT, which first used CCD arrays to stare without need for a scanner. However, LANDSAT data prices climbed from $250 per computer compatible data tape and $10 for black-and-white print to $4,400 for data tape and $2,700 for black-and-white print by 1984, making SPOT data a much more affordable option for satellite imaging data. This was {{a direct result of the}} commercialization efforts begun under the Carter administration, though finally completed under the Reagan administration.|$|E
