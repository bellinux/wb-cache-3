50|$|Certain long-acting {{growth hormone}} secretagogues, such as CJC-1295 and {{ibutamoren}} (MK-677), {{are capable of}} reliably and effectively increasing serum GH and IGF-1 concentrations in humans. Alternatively, exogenous, pharmaceutical GH and IGF-1 (as <b>mecasermin</b> or <b>mecasermin</b> rinfabate) themselves, or analogues of IGF-1 such as des(1-3)IGF-1 and IGF-1 LR3, may be employed to increase GH/IGF-1 axis function. A number of dietary supplements, including L-arginine, L-ornithine, L-lysine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and creatine, {{may be able to}} significantly increase GH levels, although evidence is mixed. Vitamin D has been found to increase IGF-1 levels in both healthy subjects and individuals with GHD, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with low IGF-1 levels. However, there is evidence that vitamin D may also potently inhibit breast growth via activation of the vitamin D receptor.|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Growth failure associated with severe primary {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) deficiency (SPIGFD), a condition defined as basal IGF- 1 standard deviation score (SDS) {{less than or}} equal to- 3 and height SDS less than or equal to- 3 in a child with normal or elevated levels of growth hormone, can be successfully treated with the recombinant human IGF- 1 <b>mecasermin.</b> In this review, we describe the most safe and effective way to use <b>mecasermin</b> in the treatment of patients with SPIGFD, including how to initiate dosing, key side effects, and how to monitor treatment. Finally, mention of how to reinitiate therapy is made, given the recent drug shortage with <b>mecasermin.</b> Key Points It is important to achieve a stable therapeutic dose, ideally within 1 month, as both first-year growth and long-term outcomes are best at doses C 0. 1 mg/kg/ dose given twice daily. Extensive family discussions are needed to emphasize the importance of compliance and monitoring for side effects. Doses should be adjusted for weight gain at regular intervals as growth progresses. ...|$|E
40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RTT) is {{a severe}} X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder mainly affecting females and {{is associated with}} mutations in MECP 2, the gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2. Mouse models suggest that recombinant human {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) (rhIGF 1) (<b>mecasermin)</b> may improve many clinical features. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of IGF- 1 in 12 girls with MECP 2 mutations (9 with RTT). In addition, we performed a preliminary assessment of efficacy using automated cardiorespiratory measures, EEG, a set of RTT-oriented clinical assessments, and two standardized behavioral questionnaires. This phase 1 trial included a 4 -wk multiple ascending dose (MAD) (40 – 120 μg/kg twice daily) period and a 20 -wk open-label extension (OLE) at the maximum dose. Twelve subjects completed the MAD and 10 the entire study, without evidence of hypoglycemia or serious adverse events. <b>Mecasermin</b> reached the CNS compartment as evidenced by the increase in cerebrospinal fluid IGF- 1 levels {{at the end of the}} MAD. The drug followed nonlinear kinetics, with greater distribution in the peripheral compartment. Cardiorespiratory measures showed that apnea improved during the OLE. Some neurobehavioral parameters, specifically measures of anxiety and mood also improved during the OLE. These improvements in mood and anxiety scores were supported by reversal of right frontal alpha band asymmetry on EEG, an index of anxiety and depression. Our data indicate that IGF- 1 is safe and well tolerated in girls with RTT and, as demonstrated in preclinical studies, ameliorates certain breathing and behavioral abnormalities.

40|$|Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF- 1) is a {{neurotrophic}} polypeptide with crucial {{roles to}} play in Central Nervous System (CNS) growth, development and maturation. Following interrogation of the neurobiology underlying several neurodevelopmental disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), both recombinant IGF- 1 (<b>mecasermin)</b> and related derivatives, such as (1 - 3) IGF- 1, have emerged as potential therapeutic approaches. Clinical pilot studies and early reports have supported the safety/preliminary efficacy of IGF- 1 and related compounds {{in the treatment of}} Rett Syndrome, with evidence mounting for its use in Phelan McDermid Syndrome and Fragile X Syndrome. In broader ASD, clinical trials are ongoing.

40|$|Background and Aims. Interest {{in growth}} hormone (GH) is {{inextricably}} linked {{to the need for}} in depth understanding of the somatomedins (insulin-like growth factors) which are polypeptides structurally similar to insulin and with broad physiological activity. To date, the most commonly known is Insulin-Like Growth Factor I (IGF-I). Despite considerable current knowledge of IGF-I, however, its bioactivity is incompletely understood. Measurement of IGF-I is of the utmost importance in the diagnosis and treatment of, for example acromegaly and growth hormone deficiency. The develop-ment of recombinant IGF-I, has allowed its use in such cases. Clinical practice, however, shows that few young/adult patients will benefit from treatment with the rIGF-I, <b>mecasermin,</b> given the number of adverse effects found. This review focuses on current knowledge mainly related to IGF-I and the use of its recombinant form (rIGF-I) in clinical practice. Several functions of IGI-II have been elucidated but their clinical significance is unclear...|$|E
40|$|Background: Human insulin-like {{growth factor}} type 1 (hIGF- 1) is a protein {{consisting}} of 70 amino acids (MW= 7. 6 kDa) and mainly synthesized by liver. <b>Mecasermin</b> (Trade name INCRELEX) is the synthetic {{form of the}} protein which is used as an effective treatment for particular disorders such as short stature, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and wound healing.

40|$|Rett Syndrome (RTT) is {{a severe}} neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} apparently normal development followed by an arrest and subsequent regression of cognitive and psychomotor abilities. At present, RTT has no definitive cure and the treatment of RTT represents a largely unmet clinical need. Following partial elucidation of the underlying neurobiology of RTT, a new treatment has been proposed, <b>Mecasermin</b> (recombinant human Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1), which, in addition to impressive evidence from preclinical murine models of RTT, has demonstrated safety in human studies of patients with RTT. The present clinical study examines the disease severity as assessed by clinicians (International Scoring System: ISS), social and cognitive ability assessed by two blinded, independent observers (RSS: Rett Severity Score), and changes in brain activity (EEG) parameters of ten patients with classic RTT and ten untreated patients matched for age and clinical severity. Significant improvement in both the ISS (p= 0. 0106) and RSS (p= 0. 0274) was found in patients treated with IGF 1 in comparison to untreated patients. Analysis of the novel RSS also suggests that patients treated with IGF 1 have a greater endurance to social and cognitive testing.

Methods: Controlled clinical experimental trial, level I evidence. Critical peripheral nerve injuries repair through acellular muscle graft alone versus its enrichment with IGF- 1 (10 mg/ml <b>mecasermin).</b> Clinical and functional control for 3 months. Animals were sacrificed at 90 - 100 days, obtaining samples for macro and microscopy with blue toluidine staining, hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome. Results: Regenerating axons can pass through a defect length of 15 mm {{with the addition of}} an acellular skeletal muscle graft and repopulate the distal nerve. Basal lamina tubes, acting as matrices for the axonal growth, appears that sensory recovery exceeds the rate of motor nerve fibers growth. Finding a number of regenerating axons greater than healthy sciatic, ensures the functional connection of distal axons to their target innervation. In contrast, grafts myelinated fibers are smaller than those of healthy sciatic nerve. Discussion: Acellular muscle fibers basal lamina define tubes that could support axonal regeneration, acting as matrices for the growth of axons, when grafted into a nerve defect.

40|$|Spinal and bulbar {{muscular atrophy}} is an X-linked {{motor neuron disease}} caused by polyglutamine {{expansion}} in the androgen receptor. Patients develop slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness, muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Affected individuals often show gynecomastia, testicular atrophy and reduced fertility {{as a result of}} mild androgen insensitivity. No effective diseasemodifying therapy is currently available for this disease. Our recent studies have demonstrated that insulinlike growth factor (IGF) - 1 reduces the mutant androgen receptor toxicity through activation of Akt in vitro, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy transgenic mice that also overexpress a noncirculating muscle isoform of IGF- 1 have a less severe phenotype. Here we sought to establish the efficacy of daily intraperitoneal injections of <b>mecasermin</b> rinfabate, recombinant human IGF- 1 and IGF- 1 binding protein 3, in a transgenic mouse model expressing the mutant androgen receptor with an expanded 97 glutamine tract. The study was done in a controlled, randomized, blinded fashion, and, to reflect the clinical settings, the injections were started after the onset of disease manifestations. The treatment resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation and reduced mutant androgen receptor aggregation in muscle. In comparison to vehicle-treated controls, IGF- 1 –treated transgenic mice showed improved motor performance, attenuated weight loss and increased survival. Our results suggest that peripheral tissue can be targeted to improve the spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy phenotype and indicate that IGF- 1 warrants further investigation in clinical trials as a potentia...|$|E

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a difficult}} to diagnose, fatal, progressive degenerative disease with an average survival time of 2 to 5 years. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy (PEG) and bi-level intermittent positive pressure (BIPAP) ventilation may be the major interventions leading to longer survival of patients with ALS. Riluzole {{has been shown to}} have modest effects on survival (as opposed to functional) gains and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of ALS. There is conflicting evidence with regard to the ability of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor (rhIGF-I) to retard ALS progression. Mechanical ventilation (via a tracheostomy tube) is expensive, but is widely used in later stage patients with ALS in the US. A review of nine cost-effectiveness studies of riluzole and one of rhIGF-I found the following: drug costs and survival gains are the major drivers of cost effectiveness; survival gains are estimated from truncated databases {{with a high degree of}} uncertainty; more accurate stage-specific utility weights based on patients who agreed to treatment are needed; case incidence-based evaluations should be carried out; cost-effectiveness ratios are insensitive to discount rates; employment and caregiver issues or externalities have been widely ignored; threshold acceptance cost-effectiveness values are ill-defined and evaluations are not generalisable to other countries because of cost and treatment style differences. On account of the high degree of uncertainty pertaining to survival gains and the relatively high costs per life years or quality-adjusted life-years gained, and while acknowledging that not every therapy has to be cost effective (e. g. orphan drugs), it is still inconclusive as to whether or not riluzole or rhIGF- 1 can be considered as cost-effective therapies for ALS.
