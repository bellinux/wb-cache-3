Soil containing an exaggerated rimsulfuron concentration was incubated in the laboratory, in order to adjust the analytical procedures. To evaluate the role of different <b>manuring</b> <b>managements,</b> rimsulfuron was applied postemergence (10 g ha(- 1) on a corn field in 1994 and 1995) on plots treated with (1) green manure, pig slurry applied in (2) November and (3) March, and cow manure applied in (4) November and (5) March and (6) untreated control plots without organic fertilizer. Neither rimsulfuron nor its metabolites were detected at soil depths lower than 8 cm. The results show that <b>manure</b> <b>managements</b> prolong rimsulfuron half-life in the 0 - 8 cm surface soil layer from a minimum of 14 days (control) {{to a maximum of}} 46 days (pig slurry in March). At corn harvest, rimsulfuron and its metabolites were not detected in soil. Similar soil degradation pathways were observed in the field as in the laboratory. N-(4, 6 -Dimethoxypyrimidin- 2 -yl) -N-[3 -(ethylsulfonyl) - 2 -pyridinyl]urea 2 was a transient soil degradation product. N-[3 -(ethylsulfonyl) - 2 -pyridinyl]- 4, 6 -dimethoxy- 2 -pyrimidineamine 3 attained a maximum soil concentration after 20 days of incubation and then progressively disappeared and could not be detected after 40 days. The high-molecular weight amine 3 did not accumulate in soil, eliminating the concern for potential formation of nitroso amino compounds. 2 -Hydroxy- 3 -(ethylsulfonyl) pyridine 4 became the major rimsulfuron soil degradation product. The soil concentrations increased and attained a maximum after 40 days of incubation and then decreased; its isomerization into 2 -pyridone, followed by hydrolysis, could transform it into low molecular weight nontoxic products.

French specificity resides in high proportions of dairy buildings including straw- based deep litter. Because little is known about emissions from these systems, the aim of our experiment was to compare gas emissions from two contrasted <b>manure</b> <b>managements</b> in controlled conditions: a tie-stall (TS) producing slurry and a straw-based deep litter (DL) producing farmyard manure. Two groups of three dairy cattle were offered both treatments in a Latin-square design during two periods of six weeks. Mean daily emissions were 78 %, 33 %, 25 % and 85 % higher for DL compared to TS, respectively, for C-CO 2, C-CH 4, N-NH 3 and N-N 2 O. These emissions were high compared to the literature, which could be partly due to overestimation of ventilation rates and/or polluted air entering the rooms through gutters. CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from DL increased throughout accumulation time because of anaerobic conditions. At the end of the experiment, without animals and new fresh manure input, emissions from the litter alone rapidly decreased.

25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right <b>manure</b> <b>management</b> system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|E
40|$|Over-applying manure {{nutrients}} to land {{is considered to}} be a major cause of nitrates, converted from manure ammonia sources while in the soil, leaching to groundwater and contributes to surface runoff of N and P that contaminate surface waters. If land application rates are limited to agronomic application rates, manure nutrients are recycled by plants into forages, other feeds, or fiber products. Manure is well recognized for its fertilizer value but we don’t often calculate that value. Too often in the past it has been assumed that recovery costs were greater than value and manure nutrients were not fully utilized. However, environmental concerns mandate manure utilization regardless of costs. The plan for utilization needs to use manure resource value to pay for its implementation to the fullest extent possible. Several faculty from the University of Florida and one from the University of Georgia are developing and Extension Circular that will provide worksheets for use by dairymen to help them develop <b>manure</b> nutrient <b>management</b> plans.

40|$|The archaeological {{interpretation}} of past land management practices can be greatly enhanced through examination of soil thin sections. Features relating to manuring practice {{are among those}} key to interpreting agricultural practices. The sources and the pro¬cesses leading to the distribution of these manure materials may further improve knowledge of the past landscape utilisation. The use of quantitative analyses to examine soil thin sections opens the possibility of considering these relationships between manured areas in greater detail and to extract more subtle spatial and temporal changes in past management. In this study the validation of this methodology has been tested with quantitative image analysis methods used to examine manure inputs to a well-documented historical landscape of Papa Stour, Shetland, where intensive manuring has been practised until the 1960 s. By using both historic and ethnographic evidence to validate the image analysis protocol, diﬀerences in spatial and temporal distribution are examined for the practices of manuring with both fuel residues and with turf.

25|$|As {{measured}} in phosphorus, the waste output of 5,000 cows roughly equals a municipality of 70,000 people. In the U.S., dairy operations {{with more than}} 1,000 cows meet the EPA definition of a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation), and are subject to EPA regulations. For example, in the San Joaquin Valley of California a number of dairies have been established on a very large scale. Each dairy consists of several modern milking parlor set-ups operated as a single enterprise. Each milking parlor {{is surrounded by a}} set of 3 or 4 loafing barns housing 1,500 or 2,000 cattle. Some of the larger dairies have planned 10 or more series of loafing barns and milking parlors in this arrangement, so that the total operation may include as many as 15,000 or 20,000 cows. The milking process for these dairies is similar to a smaller dairy with a single milking parlor but repeated several times. The size and concentration of cattle creates major environmental issues associated with manure handling and disposal, which requires substantial areas of cropland (a ratio of 5 or 6 cows to the acre, or several thousand acres for dairies of this size) for manure spreading and dispersion, or several-acre methane digesters. Air pollution from methane gas associated with <b>manure</b> <b>management</b> also is a major concern.

2500|$|Development of the New England barn began {{early in}} the 19th century, but they usually date from after 1830. They were the most popular barn type in New England by 1860. The {{construction}} {{is very different from}} the English barn [...] typically being built using the square rule method of joinery, raised in bents, [...] increasingly of sawn rather than hewn timbers, common rafter roof framing with purlin plates, designed to be used with a , straight posts rather than flared (gunstock) posts, and dropped tie beam framing rather than the English tying joint. The doors are mounted on the gable end rather than the sidewall and after the 1840s mounted on rollers so they slide sideways rather than being mounted on hinges and swinging outward. Sometimes they have interior sliding doors. Doors on rollers are believed to have been a development from rail cars which had sliding doors. A full basement became standard and was used primarily for <b>manure</b> <b>management</b> with trap doors in the floor of the tie-up so manure was easily shoveled into the basement for later use on the fields. This is a significant difference between the Pennsylvania Barn where the cows were housed on the basement level. The basements also had sliding doors, sometimes arranged as a drive through passage. The foundation is dry laid stone, some of which may have been split rather than just being field-stone; and some barns have a top course of large, rectangular, quarried stones. The drive floor was not needed for hand threshing since threshing machines were available by this time. Scarf joints were needed to join timbers longitudinally because these barns are larger in size and the timber supply was more limited so full length timbers were not available. Roof overhangs of a foot are typically built in on the gables and eaves protecting the walls from water. Later in the 19th century these barns may also have ventilators or a cupola on the roof to help reduce moisture build-up inside. Stairways are sometimes found in New England barns but built-in ladders are common but less prevalent than ladders found in the New World Dutch barn. The number and size of cows were larger and were given more headroom so the New England barns were not just longer and wider but taller. Also the New England barn was popular during the period in northern New England when the connected farm building arrangement was popular and so were more likely to be connected to the house through a series of smaller rooms. Some New England barns have an indoor silo. These barns are easier to add on to by adding more bays. The New England barn almost always has a gable roof, but a gambrel roof form may be found on some New England barns. Sometimes the New England barn is framed with studs in the walls and horizontal sheathing boards instead of the more common rails with vertical sheathing.|$|E

To later analyse and plan European GHG mitigation scenario for the livestock sectors, a particular effort of description of the Livestock Production Systems (LPS) in place in Europe is necessary, livestock production is differing largely over Europe according to the local farming particularities and to the specific practices in vigour. The previous statements asked for considering spatial as well as strategic diversity of LPS existing in Europe and for the classification of LPS. For that, Work Package 2 (WP 2) of the GGELS project has {{to focus on the}} conceptualisation and build up of a new LPS typology allowing policy makers to precisely identify LPS diversity. Regarding the main scales at which LPS datasets are available to date, LPS typology is planed to be performed at NUTS 2 level (region level) in EU 27. The dimensions to be considered in the LPS typology must reflect the strategies decided by the breeders according to market and regional (mainly biotic) constraints met in regions; these dimensions have also to point out the major livestock production steps responsible for GHG emission variation between regions such as <b>manures</b> <b>management</b> practices. Concerning <b>manures</b> <b>management</b> practices, since no specific information existed at region level, while JRC expertise on this issue was insufficient, it has been decided to launch a call for tender to select academic parties for a specific study on this issue following a questionnaire approach. To facilitate this task, DG JRC decided to perform a preliminary classification of the NUTS 2 zones according to the remaining dimensions plus other regional descriptors such as regional meteorological particularities, economic intensity of the LPS, stocking density or again the potential autonomy to feed reared animals from local crops production. For that, official statistics contained inside databases of the CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact Analysis) Modelling System have been used to describe diversity and particularities of the LPS (by specie) in every one of the European regions. Independently, by using Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS) datasets, classification of the climatic conditions met in Europe have been mapped. All classifications were performed using multivariate statistical procedures such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and two-way Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC). Results of the by-specie LPS classifications have been then confronted to the clusters describing climate conditions in regions to interpret LPS diversity. In parallel, other statistics such as regional farm types repartition provided by Eurostat were used to verify of the pertinence of the results obtained from the purely statistical method applied. Then, clusters verified were interpreted by relating all dimensions together to give a picture as reliable as possible of the reality following a more subjective approach; finally, to ease the comprehension of the reader, by-specie LPS clusters were mapped in a GIS environment. Despite possible improvements, the preliminary zoning performed here allowed us to identify and describe reliably the specificities of the LPS in every one of the European regions (EU 27). From this, we proposed a by-specie and by-LPS type sampling of the regions. This was undertaken to help the academic party to decide later of the minimum sample size necessary to obtain reliable information on the regional manures¿ management practices in vigour regarding the particularities of the LPS pointed out in this report.
