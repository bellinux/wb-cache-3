40|$|Resistant starch (RS) {{is defined}} as the sum of starch and {{products}} of starch degradation not absorbed in the small intestine of healthy individuals. RS appears to confer considerable health benefits. Processing conditions and ingredients may influence the formation of RS in foodstuffs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate some of the factors that might influence RS formation in wheat bread, namely (1) formulation; (2) loaf size; (3) baking conditions; and (4) storage conditions. Seven bread formulations were prepared: reference recipe (control) and six experimental formulations. The effect of the loaf size and the baking conditions was also tested. Finally, the effect of storage was tested by keeping control breads under different storage conditions (temperature/time). <b>Moisture</b> and <b>resistant</b> starch contents were evaluated in all breads. A higher level of moisture in the dough and a larger loaf size enhanced the RS content. An extended baking process also favored significantly the formation of RS. Storing the bread at room temperature for 3 days was shown to further increase the RS content. It is possible to increase the RS content of bread by modifying the ingredients ratio and processing conditions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} {{considerable}} concern about the consumption of high fat and low fiber foods. The objective was to develop instant noodles (IN) with functional properties by adding 10 % green banana flour (GBF), and {{determine the effect of}} this on the dough rheological properties. Noodles were obtained through sheeting, steaming and frying process. The IN were characterized for their <b>moisture,</b> fat, <b>resistant</b> starch (RS), texture and color. The proximate composition showed that GBF was rich in ash (3. 16 %), fiber (8. 88 %) and RS (45. 70 %), being an attractive raw material for the production of functional IN. When 10 % GBF was added, rheological properties of dough changed because of dilution of gluten, making it weaker, but with enough extensibility and elasticity for functional IN production. The addition of 10 % GBF significantly reduced the oil content in all the frying times, when compared to the control noodles, increasing also RS content. Ban 10 noodles showed a lower L* value (78. 12), indicating a darker color than the control noodles (92. 36). In analyzing the firmness of Ban 10 noodles, a decrease was observed due to dilution of gluten. However, Ban 10 noodles showed a better nutritional profile due to the increase in ash and dietary fiber contents. In conclusion it can be affirmed that Ban 10 noodles can be considered as functional IN, due to the presence of fiber (5. 79 %) and RS (3. 98 %) contents in the final product...|$|R
50|$|These {{finishes}} are {{a historical}} finish for wood, primarily as means {{of making it}} weather or <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant.</b> Finishing oils are easily applied, by wiping with a cloth. They are also simply made, by extraction from plant sources with relatively simple processing. Historically, both of these were considerable advantages over varnishes, that depended upon exotic imported plant resins, complex preparation and careful application with expensive brushes.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been conducted}} on the influence of landform features on the distribution of vegetation on floodplains of major rivers. Considerably less work has examined this relationship along smaller channels in mountainous terrain. We utilized multivariate statistical techniques {{to examine the relationship between}} landform types and riparian plant floristics along small streams at the Cedar River Municipal Watershed in western Washington, USA. Riparian geomorphic surfaces were assigned to one of four landform classes based on topographic characteristics and position relative to the stream channel: low floodplain, high floodplain, terrace and hillslope. Landform exerted a strong influence on the distribution of tree, shrub and understory plant species. Certain taxa were found only on one or two of the landforms. Other species displayed a gradient in abundance across landforms. No single species occupied all landforms at the same level of abundance. The distribution patterns of species among the landforms suggested that primary drivers in the organization of the plant communities were moisture and susceptibility to disturbance. Plants preferring high <b>moisture</b> levels and <b>resistant</b> to the effects of fluvial disturbance typically were found on the floodplain landforms. Communities with hardwood-dominated overstories and dense shrub understories were prevalent on these sites. Slopes and terraces supported species able to cope with drier conditions and those unable to persist with frequent disturbance. Conifers were prevalent only on these drier, infrequently-disturbed landforms. These results indicate that restoration measures to increase the presence of conifer trees in riparian areas, a common activity in the Pacific Northwest, should be applied only on landforms that would naturally support these species...|$|R
5000|$|These {{materials}} {{often are}} blended with a tackifier to produce permanent tack(“grabbing power”) at room temperature, are somewhat deformable, have low surface energy, and are <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant.</b> To meet these requirements, these materials are typically low cross-linking density, low viscosity (η < 10,000 cP), and broad {{molecular weight distribution}} [...] to enable deformation of the adhesive material to the rough surface of the substrate under various temperatures and peel conditions.|$|E
50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of particleboard {{is that it}} is very prone to expansion and discoloration due to moisture, particularly when it is not covered with paint or another sealer. Therefore, it is rarely used outdoors or in places where there are high levels of moisture, with the exception of some bathrooms, kitchens and laundries, where it is commonly used as an underlayment - in its <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> variant - beneath a continuous sheet of vinyl flooring.|$|E

50|$|Oriented strand {{board is}} {{manufactured}} in wide mats from cross-oriented layers of thin, rectangular wooden strips compressed and bonded together with wax and synthetic resin adhesives (95% wood, 5% wax and resin). The resin types typically used include Phenol formaldehyde (PF), melamine fortified Urea Formaldehyde (MUF) or isocyanate (PMDI), {{all of which}} are <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> binders. In Europe, it is common to use a combination of binders, typically PMDI would be used in the core and MUF in the face layers and this has the advantage of reducing press cycles whilst imparting a bright appearance {{to the surface of the}} panel.|$|E
50|$|The {{corrugated}} fiberboard {{consists of two}} kraft liner board outer surfaces with a corrugated interior that is bonded together with adhesive or glue. This bonded material provides the necessary strength for the push-pull device to clamp the slip sheet once or twice. There are several disadvantages associated {{with this type of}} slip sheet material including that it is not very durable, <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant,</b> resistant to high humidity or usable in cold storage areas. The advantages associated with this material are low cost, one-way use, and its ability to be moved by a conveyor or lift truck with a slip sheet device.|$|E
5000|$|Eben Norton Horsford, {{a student}} of Justus von Liebig, who began his studies on baking powder in 1856, {{eventually}} developed a variety he {{named in honor of}} Count Rumford. By the mid-1860s [...] "Horsford's Yeast Powder" [...] was on the market as an already-mixed leavening agent, distinct from separate packages of calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate. His product was packaged in bottles, but Horsford was interested in using metal cans for packing; this meant the mixture had to be more <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant.</b> This was accomplished by the addition of corn starch, and in 1869 Rumford began the manufacture of what can truly be considered baking powder. In 2006 Rumford Baking Powder was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of its significance for making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.|$|E
50|$|The kang {{is said to}} {{be derived}} from the concept of a heated bed floor called a huoqiang found in China in the Neolithic period, {{according}} to analysis of archeological excavations of building remains in Banpo Xi'an. However, archeological sites in Shenyang, Liaoning, show humans using the heated bed floor as early as 7,200 years ago. The bed at this excavation is made of 10 cm pounded clay on the floor. The bed was heated by zhidi which is simply the process of placing an open fire on the bed floor and clearing the ashes before sleeping. It is mentioned by Tang poet Meng Jiao in his poem titled Handi Baixing Yin. 'No fuel to heat the floor to sleep, standing and crying with cold at midnight instead'. In the excavated example the repeated burning is believed to have turned the bed surface hard and <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Glassine is also {{recommended}} {{for protecting the}} surface of stored acrylic paintings. Philatelists use glassine envelopes to store stamps, and stamp hinges are made of glassine. Amateur insect collectors use glassine envelopes to store specimens temporarily in the field before they are mounted in a collection. Entomologists collecting for research may likewise use such envelopes to store whole specimens in the field. Glassine envelopes are used to carry pharmacy reformulated drugs and illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin.In the mid-20th century, potato chips were packaged in glassine bags. Glassine {{is also used to}} pack firecrackers, as it is <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant.</b> It is used for its transparent qualities to fold origami tessellations. Glassine is an outer covering on paperboard tubes, particularly those used in model rocketry, for water protection.

5000|$|The {{elementary}} school, middle school, {{and high}} school are located in one large building near the downtown. [...] "It's very unusual to have one campus for all three schools," [...] said John Chambers, the former superintendent. [...] "It creates an interconnectedness and allows students to really {{get to know each}} other. And it allows teachers to track students over the years, which all studies show is very beneficial to education." [...] The school, located on Pondfield Road, is located in a low point in the town; during particularly heavy rains in the past, the school has experienced flooding. There was a period when the school was closed for several weeks as a result of flooding. As a result, boilers and heating equipment have been moved to higher levels, and basement areas have been remodeled with <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> substances in case the building is flooded again.|$|E
50|$|Tar {{paper is}} more {{accurately}} a Grade D building paper (the Grade D designation derives {{from a federal}} specification in the United States), which is widely used in the West. Building paper is manufactured from virgin kraft paper, unlike felts, and then impregnated with asphalt. The longer fibres in the kraft paper allow for a lighter weight product with similar and often better mechanical properties than felt. Grade papers are rated in minutes—the {{amount of time it}} takes for a moisture sensitive chemical indicator to change colour when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10, 20, 30, and 60 minute. The higher the rating the more <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> and the heavier. A typical 20 minute paper will weigh about 3.3 lbs per square, a 30-minute paper 3.75, and a 60-minute paper about six. The smaller volume of material however does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or crimped connection. The seal between the shell and insert may be <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> or a hermetic seal. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. Cable clamps and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.|$|E
50|$|The {{finished}} floor is typically raised off the concrete basement floor. In {{countries such as}} Canada, laminate flooring is an exception: It is typically separated from the concrete by only a thin foam underlay. Radiant heating systems may be embedded within the concrete floor. Even if unfinished and unoccupied, basements are heated {{in order to ensure}} relative warmth of the floor above, and to prevent water supply pipes, drains, etc. from freezing and bursting in winter. It is recommended that the basement walls be insulated to the frost line. In Canada, the walls of a finished basement are typically insulated to the floor with vapor barriers to prevent moisture transmission. However, a finished basement should avoid wood or wood-laminate flooring, and metal framing and other <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> products should be used. Finished basements can be costly to maintain due to deterioration of waterproofing materials or lateral earth movement etc. Below-ground structures will never be as dry as one above ground, and measures must be taken to circulate air and dehumidify the area.|$|E
50|$|Floors may be {{built on}} beams or joists or use {{structures}} like prefabricated hollow core slabs. The subfloor builds on those and attaches by various means particular to the support structure but the support and subfloor together always provides {{the strength of a}} floor one can sense underfoot. Nowadays, subfloors are generally made from at least two layers of <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> ('AC' grade, one side finished and sanded flat) plywood or composite sheeting, jointly also termed Underlayments on floor joists of 2x8, 2x10, or 2x12's (dimensional lumber) spaced generally on 16 in centers, in the United States and Canada. Some flooring components used solely on concrete slabs consist of a dimpled rubberized or plastic layer much like bubble wrap that provide little tiny pillars for the 1/2 in sheet material above. These are manufactured in 2 x 2 ft squares and the edges fit together like a mortise and tenon joint. Like a floor on joists not on concrete, a second sheeting underlayment layer is added with staggered joints to disperse forces that would open a joint under the stress of live loads like a person walking.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays pulps for the {{industrial}} manufacture of medium density fibre boards (MDF) are prepared {{by using the}} thermo-mechanical technique. Thermo-mechanical pulps (TMP) are mostly bonded with acid curing urea formaldehyde resins (UF-resins) and melamine modified urea formaldehyde resins (MUF-resins). During thermo-mechanical pulping wood is degraded by hydro-thermal treatment leading to formation of different chemical compounds. Evidence has been adduced that degradation products have a negative bearing on the bondability of the fibres with binders such as alkaline curing phenol formaldehyde resins (PF-resins) or polymers based on 4, 4 ´-diphenylmethandiisocyanat (PMDI) for making <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> bonded boards. Results of research work {{carried out by the}} University of Göttingen, the Fraunhofer-Institute of Wood Research (WKI) in Braunschweig and the Institute of Wood Technology Dresden (IHD) have proved that chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps (CTMP) are superior to TMP on bonding with <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> binders including PF-resins and PMDI binders. MDF made from CTMP pulps are of higher mechanical strength and superior hydrolysis resistance compared to boards from TMP. The paper explains the difference in behaviour of TMP and CTMP towards bonding and elucidate in depth the possibilities of using the chemo-thermo-mechanical pulping method for making <b>moisture</b> <b>resistant</b> bonded MDF...|$|E
