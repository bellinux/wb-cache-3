The purpose of the present work is to study the morphology of primary austenite intest casting with a high tendency to form shrinkage porosity and <b>metal</b> expansion <b>penetration.</b> Simplified testmodels simulating the thermal and geometrical conditions similar to the conditions existing in complex shapedcasting have been successfully used to provoke shrinkage porosity and <b>metal</b> expansion <b>penetration.</b> Stereological investigation of the primary dendrite morphology indicates a maximum interdendritic space inconnection to the casting surface where the porosity and the penetration defect appear. Away from the defectformation area the interdendritic space decreases. Furthermore the local solidification times of the investigatedsamples were calculated in a 3 D simulation software. Comparison of the simulated local solidification timesand measured interdendritic space indicates a strong relation of the same shape as it is known from theliterature when dynamic coarsening mechanism is characterized. The main outcome of the present paper is theobserved gradient of increasing interdendritic space from sections with high local solidification to sectionswith low solidification time. The mechanism of increasing the interdendritic phase can be explained by thedynamic ripening process. The unfortunate thermal conditions with the slowest local solidification timesituated in the border between the casting surface and its surrounding are considered the reason to form anaustenite morphology which can promote the mass flow between dendrite provoking shrinkage porosity ormetal expansion penetration.

40|$|In some {{grey cast}} iron {{components}} which are cast in sand moulds, the metal sometimes penetrates into the mould producing defects and causing difficulties when cleaning the components. To improve knowledge of the <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> mechanism a series of test castings was performed at ITT Flygt’s foundry where the influence of chemical composition was studied. The chemical composition of the melt was changed in the ladle before pouring. The result showed that the carbon and phosphorus content had an influence on <b>metal</b> <b>penetration.</b> The <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> tendency decreased when decreasing the carbon content as well as when increasing the phosphorus content. The penetration areas were analysed in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Analysis (EDS).

Consequently, no significant macro segregation of carbon or phosphorous could be observed.

During simulation it is possible to detect the areas where porosities are likely to be formed.

40|$|The {{production}} of quality castings requires the casting surface {{to be clean}} and free from defects. In some grey cast iron components which are cast in sand moulds, the metal sometimes penetrates into the mould, producing difficulties in cleaning the components. The defect causes very high costs due to component rejection and increased fettling in the casting industry. Most of the grey iron foundries {{around the world have}} problems with <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> on applicable components. In this work the problem of <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> has been studied using a commercial casting component. Eight castings were mounted on the pattern plate and five different inoculants were investigated. The experiments show that the inoculation of grey cast iron will influence the <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> in areas with late solidification times and where the melt is in contact with the sand mould. In all experiments 0. 14 % inoculant was added in the pouring ladle. The experiments show that the best results to reduce <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> have been obtained when using the inoculant which contained silicon, aluminium and zirconium. Using this inoculant, the average penetration area was only about 20 % of what was found using the worst inoculant. However, this inoculant also gave rise to a large tendency to formation sinks. The experiments also show two main classes of eutectic cell size. One class nucleated {{at the beginning of the}} eutectic solidification and one at the end of the solidification. Two other inoculants, both containing Al and Si have about the same base composition. From the measurements of penetration areas, one can draw the conclusion that the inoculant with the smallest grain size gives nuclei with the shortest lifetime. The coarser grains give a longer dissolution time and this promotes the survival of the nuclei. At the end of solidification, a larger amount of graphite will precipitate at higher temperatures if new nuclei can be activated. If the hot spot is located close to the metal surface, the metal will expand into the mould; resulting in metal expansion penetration.

40|$|Lamellar {{cast iron}} {{is a very}} {{important}} technical alloy and the most used material in the casting production, and especially in the automotive industry which is the major consumer. Beside the many great properties, it is inclined to form casting defects of which some can be prevented, and some may be repaired subsequently. Shrinkage porosity is a randomly returning problem, which is difficult to understand and to avoid. This defect is a volumetric deficiency which appear as cavities inside the casting in connection to the casting surface. Another frequent defect is the <b>metal</b> expansion <b>penetration.</b> This defect is a material surplus squeezed to the casting surface containing sand inclusion from the mold material. Shrinkage porosity is usually mentioned together with <b>metal</b> expansion <b>penetration</b> as the formation mechanism of both defects have common roots. It is also generally agreed, that these type of defects are related to the volumetric changes occurring during solidification. Additionally, the formation of these defects are in connection with the coherency of the primary austenite dendrites. The purpose of this work was to develop knowledge on factors affecting a volume-change related casting defect formation in order to minimize the presence of these defects in engine component production. This was done by extending the existing solidification investigation methods with novel solutions. Introduction of expansion force measurement in the determination of dendrite coherency combined with multi axial volume change measurement refine the interpretation of the solidification. Comparison of registered axial and radial linear deformation in cylindrical samples indicated an anisotropic volume change. Different methods for dendrite coherency determination have been compared. It was shown that the coherency develops over an interval. Dependent on the added inoculant the coherency is reached at different levels of fractions of a solidified primary phase. It is also shown, that inoculation has an effect on the nucleation and growth of the primary phase. Quantitative image analysis has been performed on the primary phase in special designed samples designed to provoke shrinkage porosity and <b>metal</b> expansion <b>penetration.</b> It was found, that the inter-dendritic space varies within a casting.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the inoculant, containing different elements, as well as inoculant amount {{have been shown to}} play an important role in solidification of cast iron. Three different inoculant amounts and different pouring temperatures were used on a commercial casting. From the results of the ocular inspection of the castings, the eutectic cell size and distribution measurements, it can be concluded that nucleation of the eutectic cells plays an important role in formation of the expansion penetration. The castings show two different types of surface defects; namely, bulb and metal expansion penetration. The mechanisms of bulb and formation metal expansion penetration seems to be related. The influence of the melt casting temperatures showed the following results; by using a lower temperature the degree of <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> was reduced but the bulb formation is unchanged. This is applies to experiments using 0. 15 % and 0. 30 % inoculant.

The low temperature did not show any tendency to form white solidification in this casting components. The pouring temperature seems to have a large influence in combination with high additions of inoculants. A low pouring temperature seems to increase the formation of bulbs caused by excess material at solidification. 2 The mechanism of bulb formation is proposed to depend on formation of a thin solidified layer when the metal has filled the mould. The shell is thin, and a later expansion of the metal, during solidification pushes the shell outward and forms a bulb, instead of bursting and <b>metal</b> <b>penetration</b> of the sand mould...|$|E

40|$|In the {{abandoned}} mine of Ingurtosu (SW Sardinia, Italy) a field experimental trial {{was carried out}} in the frame of the UMBRELLA project (7 FP EU). The idea of this project was to couple microorganisms with plants to favour metals accumulation in plants and reduce the effects of metal pollution in soils of heavy metals contaminated sites. Euphorbia pithyusa was selected as an endemic pioneer plant. About two years after the beginning of the experiment, exploration of the processes occurring at the soil-root interface was carried out by combing X-ray fluorescence mapping (S-XRF) and X-ray absorption spectrometry (XAS) to X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We observed that Si and Al are mainly concentrated in the epidermis of the roots forming a rim that represent a physico-chemical barrier against organic and inorganic stresses. In addition, Si is able to bind Zn by forming an amorphous Zn-silicate in the epidermis zone. This process leads to the decrease of Zn concentration from the epidermis to the internal part of the root, where Zn is bonded to other Zn atoms. In the case of Fe, the Si-Al rim seems to be more efficient and, as observed in LEXRF maps, Fe is mainly concentrated in the external zone of the roots. EXAFS analysis reveals that the coordination environment of Fe is comparable to that of hematite. The exact cause of Fe precipitation around roots or in the epidermis zone is unknown, but the oxidizing activity of roots, together with the action of microorganisms, is thought to be involved. Si and Al particles of the rim can act as a nucleus for hematite precipitation (Batty et al., 2000) that, in turn, could act as a barrier against <b>metals</b> <b>penetration.</b> Although Si and Al are not regarded as essential nutrients and the later is an important growth-limiting factor (Rout et al., 2001), obtained results suggest that these elements are fundamental for controlling metal migration through the roots, and their beneficial function for plant need to be reassessed. The addition of microorganisms to the soil at the Ingurtosu mine seems to have no effect on biominerals features, and on Zn and Fe speciation.
