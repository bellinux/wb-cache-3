5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results {{in the production of}} a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic <b>megacolon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (<b>megacolon</b> and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, <b>megacolon</b> and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and <b>megacolon.</b> Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with HIV/AIDS, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis {{is the leading}} cause of toxic <b>megacolon</b> and emergency laparotomy. CMV may also increase the risk of toxic <b>megacolon</b> in non-HIV/AIDS {{patients with}} IBD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Megacolon</b> can be {{associated}} with Chagas disease.|$|E
25|$|Risperidone, an anti-psychotic medication, {{can result}} in <b>megacolon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Corticosteroids {{and other}} {{anti-inflammatory}} medication {{is used in}} toxic <b>megacolon.</b>|$|E
25|$|When <b>megacolon</b> worsens and the {{conservative}} measures fail to restore transit, surgery may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|A <b>megacolon</b> can {{be either}} acute or chronic. It can also be {{classified}} according to cause.|$|E
25|$|External {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} are constipation of very long duration, abdominal bloating, abdominal tenderness and tympany, abdominal pain, palpation of hard fecal masses and, in toxic <b>megacolon,</b> fever, low blood potassium, tachycardia and shock. Stercoral ulcers are sometimes observed in chronic <b>megacolon,</b> which may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall in approximately 3% of the cases, leading to sepsis and risk of death.|$|E
25|$|Bethanechol {{can also}} be used to treat <b>megacolon</b> by means of its direct {{cholinergic}} action and its stimulation of muscarinic receptors which bring about a parasympathetic like effect.|$|E
25|$|Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) is a symptomatic infection {{due to the}} spore-forming bacterium, Clostridium difficile. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. It {{makes up}} about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis, toxic <b>megacolon,</b> perforation of the colon, and sepsis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat <b>megacolon,</b> {{such as a}} colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileum and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Megacolon</b> is an {{abnormal}} dilation {{of the colon}} (also called the large intestine). The dilation is often accompanied by a paralysis of the peristaltic movements of the bowel. In more extreme cases, the feces consolidate into hard masses inside the colon, called fecalomas (literally, fecal tumor), which can require surgery to be removed.|$|E
25|$|Toxic <b>megacolon</b> {{is mainly}} seen in {{ulcerative}} colitis and pseudomembranous colitis, two chronic inflammations {{of the colon}} (and occasionally, in the other type of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease). Its mechanism is incompletely understood. It is probably due to an excessive production of nitric oxide, at least in ulcerative colitis. The prevalence {{is about the same}} for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Complications include toxic <b>megacolon,</b> {{dehydration}} and sepsis. Such complications generally {{occur in}} young children (< 1 year of age) and immunocompromised people. A chronic course of the disease is possible; this disease process is likely to develop without a distinct acute phase. Chronic campylobacteriosis features {{a long period of}} sub-febrile temperature and asthenia; eye damage, arthritis, endocarditis may develop if infection is untreated.|$|E
25|$|Fulminant disease {{correlates}} {{with more than}} ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal tenderness and distension, blood transfusion requirement and colonic dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic <b>megacolon.</b> If the serous membrane is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue. Unless treated, the fulminant disease will soon lead to death.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a {{long-term}} condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The primary symptom of active disease is abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood. Weight loss, fever, and anemia may also occur. Often symptoms come on slowly and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms typically occur intermittently with periods of no symptoms between flares. Complications may include <b>megacolon,</b> inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|Too Hui Min, 18, {{attached}} to Kem Geo Kosmo, Behrang, Selangor. Died on 7 May at Slim River Hospital, Perak, {{three days after}} she started complaining of constipation. The {{cause of death was}} later determined as being toxic <b>megacolon</b> – her colon had been swollen and the lining had thinned due to septicaemia. Her death was the 16th National Service death, and was followed by several DAP leaders calling for the suspension or even the scrapping of the National Service programme.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Crohn's disease, the {{gastrointestinal}} {{aspects of}} ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical {{removal of the}} large intestine, though extraintestinal symptoms may persist. This procedure is necessary in the event of: exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma. Surgery is also indicated for patients with severe colitis or toxic <b>megacolon.</b> Patients with symptoms that are disabling and {{do not respond to}} drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic <b>megacolon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute <b>megacolon,</b> ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|Refractory {{ulcerative}} colitis. Patients with toxic <b>megacolon</b> (colonic dilation > 6cm {{and toxic}} appearing) {{who do not}} respond to steroid therapy within 72 hours should be consulted for colectomy. Those with less severe disease but {{do not respond to}} IV steroids within 7–10 days should be considered for colectomy or IV cyclosporine. IV cyclosporine at a rate of 2mg/kg/day and if no response in 7–10 days, colectomy should be considered. If response is seen, oral cyclosporine at 8mg/kg/day should be continued for 3–4 months while 6-MP or azathioprine is introduced. Those already on 6-MP or azathioprine should continue with these medications. A cholesterol level should be checked in patients taking cyclosporine as low cholesterol may predispose to seizures. Also, prophylaxis against PCP (Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia is advised.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{patients}} typically {{present with}} rectal bleeding, diarrhea, tenesmus (urgent desire {{to evacuate the}} bowels but {{with the passage of}} little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Patients with mildly active disease will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC have more frequent bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of patients with ulcerative colitis will have moderately active disease at presentation. Patients with severely active disease will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. Patients with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic <b>megacolon</b> often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate colectomy because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or <b>megacolon,</b> with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
500|$|Early in life, Dewey was {{diagnosed}} with <b>megacolon,</b> which was expected to shorten his lifespan. The condition was aggravated by his refusal to eat foods that would ease his condition, as he was a notoriously finicky eater. In later years he was also afflicted with arthritis. In October 2006 he was discovered to be suffering from hyperthyroidism. Shortly before November 18, he {{was diagnosed}} with a painful stomach tumor. Myron had Dewey euthanized on November 29. He had achieved an age equivalent to a human in his nineties.|$|E

2500|$|In Central and South America, {{the most}} common {{incidence}} of chronic <b>megacolon</b> is that observed in about 20% of patients affected with Chagas disease. Chagas is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellate protozoan transmitted by the feces of a hematophagous insect, the assassin bug, when it feeds. Chagas can also be acquired congenitally, through blood transfusion or organ transplant, and rarely through contaminated food (for example garapa). There are several theories on how <b>megacolon</b> (and also megaesophagus) develops in Chagas disease. The [...] Austrian-Brazilian physician and pathologist Fritz Köberle {{was the first to}} propose the neurogenic hypothesis based on the documented destruction of the Auerbach's plexus in the walls of the intestinal tracts of Chagas patients. In this, the destruction of the autonomic nervous system innervation of the colon leads to a loss of the normal smooth muscle tone of the wall and subsequent gradual dilation. His research proved that, by extensively quantifying the number of neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the Auerbach's plexus, that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Crohn's disease, which {{cannot be}} cured/eliminated by surgically {{removing}} the diseased {{portions of the}} intestine and reconnecting the healthy ends, ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical removal of the large intestine. [...] Surgical removal of the large intestine will not get rid of extra-intestinal symptoms. This procedure is necessary {{in the event of}} exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma. Surgery is also indicated for patients with severe colitis or toxic <b>megacolon.</b> Patients with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life. Depending on the type of surgery performed, the patient may still require periodic lower endoscopies to assess the pouch for dysplasia.|$|E
50|$|Toxic <b>megacolon</b> (<b>megacolon</b> toxicum) is {{an acute}} form of colonic distension. It is {{characterized}} by a very dilated colon (<b>megacolon),</b> accompanied by abdominal distension (bloating), and sometimes fever, abdominal pain, or shock.|$|E
