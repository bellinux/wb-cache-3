The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song the Vitaphone vitalizes the production enormously. The dialogue is not so effective, for it does not always catch the nuances of speech or inflections of the voice so that one is {{not aware of the}} mechanical features.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for {{the album}} began shortly after Adele {{separated}} from her lover. Within a day of her break-up, she contacted producer Paul Epworth, intent on capturing her emotion in a song: [...] "We'd had a fuming argument the night before ... I'd been bubbling. Then I went into the studio and screamed." [...] Although she had initially planned on completing a ballad that she had begun writing with Epworth <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> the producer suggested that she aim for a more aggressive sound. Together, they restructured the song and re-wrote lyrics to reflect Adele's recent experience, deciding on the title [...] "Rolling in the Deep." [...] The instrumentation evolved organicallyâ€”after trying out various jazz riffs, Adele attempted the first verse a cappella, inspiring Epworth to improvise a melody on his acoustic guitar. A thumping drum beat was set to mimic her racing heartbeat. In two days, a demo was recorded to be produced by Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin later that year. However, Adele re-approached Epworth months later to complete production of the song.|$|E
