5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defect</b> or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Original Soundtrack {{released}} on November 18, 2009 {{as a single}} CD release under the catalog number COCX-35945. It was published by Nippon Columbia. A bonus soundtrack containing music from the game was included with launch copies {{of the game in}} North America. After the game's release, it was discovered that the bonus disc had a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defect</b> that made it unplayable. Once the issue was raised, Atlus and its manufacturing partner moved to enable players to receive free replacements. Reviews of the original soundtrack release have been positive, with reviewers noting its change in style compared to previous Megami Tensei games.|$|E
5|$|The RN's {{final order}} was for 44 ASW aircraft, {{originally}} designated Merlin HAS.1 but soon changed to Merlin HM1. The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were {{delivered by the}} end of 2002, and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS, all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational Evaluation Unit from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defect.</b> An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{high-tech}} product, automobile show {{defects in}} various categories and patterns. The paper introduces five categories of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> based on 978 recalls in 2012 in China, USA and Japan.

5000|$|Under <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects,</b> a {{plaintiff}} needs {{to show that}} the autonomous car failed to work as specified by the manufacturer. In the case of autonomous cars, however, this presents a major hurdle because no court has applied <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> to software, which is not something tangible that is manufactured. If a crash stems from a software error, then the traditional product liability law on <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> may not suffice. A greater understanding of how software will be treated under this liability law, particularly when a software error causes physical parts to malfunction, needs to be explored.|$|R

5|$|In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating {{under the}} name TRV$DJAM. They {{performed}} at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defect</b> on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects,</b> our {{interest}} is the calculation methodologies {{that are used to}} quantify these <b>defects.</b> The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> can be divided into two categories: machining defects and positioning defects. A double measurement method is principally used to quantify separately machining and positioning defect. The first measurement is operated inside a machine tool just after the final cutting step. The second measurement is realised outside of the machine tool (e. g. on a coordinate measuring machine - CMM). However, data processing method and precision between two different machines are different. Consequently, the measurement results obtained from these machines may be not comparable to quantify precisely the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects.</b> Several solutions are proposed and analysed in this paper to estimate comparable capability of the measurement results obtained by the two different measurement means...|$|R
25|$|On 17 June 1989, an Ilyushin Il-62 {{aircraft}} of Interflug (registration DDR-SEW) {{bound for}} Moscow crashed shortly after take-off {{into a field}} near the airport and caught fire. 21 people on board {{as well as one}} person on the ground were killed. The East German authorities feared an act of sabotage due to the anniversary of the East German uprising, which led to a delayed aid for injured people. West German rescuers offering help were denied access to the scene. The cause for the accident was later given as a jammed rudder due to a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defect.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} {{inherent}} vice, the intrinsic instability {{of the fabric}} and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within {{the fabric of the}} material and therefore is a natural occurrence. Deterioration of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects in the piece. This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defect</b> includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} in Daubert was expanded in Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, where {{the evidence in}} question was from a technician and not a scientist.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{structural}} {{proof testing}} methods {{for the detection}} of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> in aircraft composite components. A static proof test method based on compliance and surface strain mapping and a dynamic (vibration) method based on mode shape curvature (MSC) analysis are evaluated {{for the detection of}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects.</b> The evaluation of these structural proof methods was performed using finite element analysis to identify the test conditions best suited for damage/defect detection. The finite element modelling was validated by structural proof tests performed on T-joint composite specimens containing the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>defects</b> of large voids, porosity and delaminations. The coupled compliance and surface strain mapping technique was able to detect a delamination crack along the stiffener-skin bond-line or a void within the fillet region when the joint was elastically loaded, but failed to detect porosity at the concentrations which typically occur in joints with defects. The MSC technique successfully detected voids, porosity and delaminations in the T-joint excited by elastic stress waves induced by random frequency vibrations...|$|R
