40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of contemporary <b>development</b> <b>management</b> scholarship, suggesting that a longstanding division between radical and reformist <b>development</b> <b>management</b> research continues to exist. The article offers a closer examination of critical <b>development</b> <b>management</b> (CDM), the most recent example of radical <b>development</b> <b>management</b> thought that is connecting scholars in critical management studies to those identifying with post-development theory. CDM's suggestion that all <b>development</b> <b>management</b> is perniciously managerial is scrutinised and challenged on both theoretical and normative grounds. Overall, an argument is sketched out to support a future for <b>development</b> <b>management</b> that is neither defined nor destined for failure. The future of <b>development</b> <b>management</b> scholarship can and should concern itself with a non-managerial development practice that bridges the divide between radicals and reformers. ...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} <b>management</b> <b>development</b> {{has been}} the stringent control of deer in the Murchison Mountains and other takahē areas of Fiordland National Park. Following the introduction of deer hunting by helicopter, deer numbers have decreased dramatically and alpine vegetation is now recovering from years of heavy browsing. This improvement in its habitat has helped to increase takahē breeding success and survival. Current research aims to measure the impact of attacks by stoats and thus decide whether stoats are a significant problem requiring management.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 it was {{reported}} that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or {{are in a state of}} dereliction, with several squatter camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by vandalism, graffiti or strewn with rubbish. These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the Athens Olympics are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics <b>management,</b> <b>development</b> and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.
