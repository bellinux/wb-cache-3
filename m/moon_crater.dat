5|$|In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society, which {{promotes}} the exploration, settlement, {{and development of}} the Moon, named a <b>Moon</b> <b>crater</b> after Jackson. In the same year, for Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In 2010, two university librarians found that Jackson's influence extended to academia, with references to Jackson in reports concerning music, popular culture, chemistry and an array of other topics.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{thought the}} thing was an {{elaborate}} practical joke by some one who had seen the manuscript of my narrative. I answered Mr. Wendigee jestingly, but he replied {{in a manner that}} put such suspicion altogether aside, and in a state of inconceivable excitement I hurried from Algiers to the little observatory upon the Monte Rosa in which he was working. In the presence of his record and his appliances--and above all of the messages from Cavor that were coming to hand--my lingering doubts vanished. I decided at once to accept a proposal he made to me to remain with him, assisting him to take down the record from day to day, and endeavouring with him to send a message back to the moon. Cavor, we learnt, was not only alive, but free, {{in the midst of an}} almost inconceivable community of these ant-like beings, these ant-men, in the blue darkness of the lunar caves. He was lamed, it seemed, but otherwise in quite good health--in better health, he distinctly said, than he usually enjoyed on earth. He had had a fever, but it had left no bad effects. But curiously enough he seemed to be labouring under a conviction that I was either dead in the <b>moon</b> <b>crater</b> or lost in the deep of space.|$|E

50|$|The unit used in {{the object}} {{diameter}} results in the smallest resolvable features at that unit. In the above example they are approximated in kilometers resulting in the smallest resolvable <b>Moon</b> <b>craters</b> being 3.22 km in diameter. The Hubble Space Telescope has a primary mirror aperture of 2400 mm that provides a surface resolvability of <b>Moon</b> <b>craters</b> being 174.9 meters in diameter, or sunspots of 7365.2 km in diameter.|$|R

50|$|In {{the distant}} future a planet settled by humans was once all airless moon rock. Human {{terraforming}} {{has transformed the}} moon {{into a world of}} shallow oceans and islands which are the peaks for the former <b>moon</b> <b>craters.</b>|$|R

40|$|Power law {{distributions}} describe naturally-occurring {{events such}} as the magnitude of earthquakes, the diameter of <b>moon</b> <b>craters</b> or the complexity of the nervous system (Albert Lazslo Barabasi & Albert, 1999; Newman, 2005).

50|$|In {{the early}} days, {{only a very}} limited number of {{features}} could be seen on other Solar System bodies other than the <b>Moon.</b> <b>Craters</b> on the <b>Moon</b> could be observed with {{even some of the}} earliest telescopes, and 19th-century telescopes could make out some features on Mars. Jupiter had its famous Great Red Spot, also visible though early telescopes.|$|R

5000|$|At {{this point}} manager Ray Danniels scraped {{together}} an additional $9,000 for producer Terry Brown to professionally re-mix {{all of the}} recordings for better sound quality. This remix version was used for later releases most of which used the Mercury [...] "skyline" [...] record label instead of the red label.

5|$|From 1969 to 1972, NASA {{visited the}} real Moon through the Apollo program {{and found that}} its surface does not closely {{resemble}} this part of Idaho. NASA astronauts discovered that real <b>Moon</b> <b>craters</b> were almost all created by meteorites while their namesakes on Earth were created by volcanic eruptions. Apollo astronauts performed part of their training at <b>Craters</b> of the <b>Moon</b> Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in an unfamiliar and harsh environment.|$|R
50|$|X-linked endothelial corneal {{dystrophy}} (XECD) {{is a rare}} form of {{corneal dystrophy}} described first in 2006, based on a 4-generation family of 60 members with 9 affected males and 35 trait carriers, which led to mapping the XECD locus to Xq25. It manifests as severe corneal opacification or clouding, sometimes congenital, {{in the form of}} a ground glass, milky corneal tissue, and moon crater-like changes of corneal endothelium. Trait carriers manifest only endothelial alterations resembling <b>moon</b> <b>craters.</b>|$|R

5000|$|I {{originally}} came to East St. Louis {{to discuss}} the design and possible realization of the Old Man River's City, having been asked {{to do so by}} East St. Louis community leaders themselves... It is moon-crater-shaped: the crater's truncated cone top opening is a half-mile in diameter, rim-to-rim, while the truncated mountain itself is a mile in diameter at its base ring. The city has a one-mile (1.6 km)-diameter geodesic, quarter-sphere transparent umbrella mounted high above it to permit full, all-around viewing below the umbrella's bottom perimeter. The top of the dome roof is [...] high. The bottom rim of the umbrella dome is [...] above the surrounding terrain, while the crater-top esplanade, looks [...] radially inward from the umbrella's bottom, is at the same [...] height. From the esplanade the truncated mountain cone slopes downwardly, inward and outward, to ground level below.The <b>moon</b> <b>crater's</b> inward and outward, exterior-surface slopes each consist of fifty terraces - the terrace floors are tiered vertically ten feet above or below one another. All the inwardly, downwardly sloping sides of the <b>moon</b> <b>crater's</b> terraced cone are used for communal life; its outward-sloping, tree-planted terraces are entirely for private life dwelling.

50|$|The museum's {{collection}} {{includes a}} genuine moon rock from Apollo 16 {{on loan from}} NASA in return for using the Nordlingen crater for training for the Apollo 14 astronauts due to its similarities to a <b>moon</b> <b>crater.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Half <b>Moon</b> <b>Crater</b> (...) is {{a crater}} 0.5 nmi km {{southwest}} of Castle Rock on Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island, Antarctica.

500|$|Grimm gives further {{examples}} from Germanic folklore {{until the time}} of his writing (the 19th century) and notes a potential connection between the German word wadel (meaning the full moon) and the dialectal employment of the word for [...] "brushwood, twigs tied up in a bundle, esp fir-twigs, wadeln to tie up brushwood", and the practice of cutting wood out in the full moon. Benjamin Thorpe agrees with the theory of Hjúki and Bil as the personified shapes of <b>moon</b> <b>craters.</b>|$|R
