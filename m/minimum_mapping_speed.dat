40|$|We {{present the}} design, {{fabrication}} and measured {{performance of a}} hierarchical sinuous-antenna phased array coupled to transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers for measurements of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB). To efficiently cover a broader range of frequencies, many CMB experiments have begun to deploy multichroic pixels. For a given cryogenic and optical design, the pixel size that optimizes the <b>mapping</b> <b>speed</b> is frequency-dependent and increases with wavelength. If a multichroic pixel is the same size at all frequencies, then the <b>mapping</b> <b>speed</b> will be optimal in at most one frequency band. To achieve optimal <b>mapping</b> <b>speed</b> at all frequencies, a pixel size that varies with frequency is needed. This can be accomplished by creating phased arrays from neighboring pixels, where the size of each phased array is chosen independently for each frequency band. As the array unit, we choose a lenslet-coupled sinuous antenna on account of its wide bandwidth, dual polarization and constant beam waist. We find that the array factor tends to compensate for beam non-idealities, so that the sinuous antenna can be substantially undersized relative to the single-element case; this frees up valuable focal-plane area for bolometers, bandpass filters, summing networks, readout circuitry, etc. An additional benefit of a hierarchical phased array is the reduced readout requirement: since the low frequencies are arrayed to increase their <b>mapping</b> <b>speeds,</b> the detector count scales approximately logarithmically with the number of frequency bands. Here we present measurements from a prototype device, in which hierarchical triangular arrays are used at 90, 150 and 220 GHz to keep the effective pixel size and, therefore, the beam width roughly constant across the entire frequency range.

ALandsat ETM+ satellite image (acquired {{in the year}} 2000) {{and the results of}} field sampling were combined as mapping method. Given the constraints of the <b>minimum</b> <b>mapping</b> unit chosen, 17 classes were identified in the field and designated to corresponding polygons created by the classification of satellite image. Thirteen classes were plant communities or their combinations, while remaining four denoted various types of land cover (coniferous plantations, mixed rural landscapes, settlements and quarries). In the overall area of the Nature Park (344 km 2), the most frequent type of cover was Lamio orvalae – Fagetum forest (38. 4 %of total area), while the most frequent non-forest community was Bromo – Plantaginetum mediae (7. 9 %). According to this research, as much as 77. 3 %of Park area is covered with forest, which is a significant increase compared to the old data of 61 % of forests. Analyses of mapped polygons showed that almost a quarter of all polygons has an area equal to, or just little bigger than the <b>minimum</b> <b>mapping</b> unit, while more than three quarters of all polygons have their area smaller or equal to 9 ha (corresponds to 300 x 300 meters square).

40|$|We are {{developing}} multi-chroic antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometer detectors for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarimetry. Multi-chroic detectors increase focal plane area efficiency, {{and thus the}} <b>mapping</b> <b>speed</b> per focal plane area, and provide greater discrimination against polarized galactic foregrounds with no increase in weight or cryogenic cost. In each pixel, a silicon lens-coupled dual-polarized sinuous antenna collects photons over a two-octave frequency band.

Separate TES bolometers detect the power in each frequency band and linear polarization state. We will describe the design and performance of these devices and present optical data taken. Our measurements of dual-polarization pixels in multiple frequency bands show beams with percent-level ellipticity, and percent-level cross-polarization leakage.

40|$|We {{are using}} Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors in a sub/millimeter camera for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. These {{detectors}} are microwave resonators {{that rely on}} submillimeter and millimeter-wave photons to break Cooper pairs, changing the surface impedance.

The camera will be divided into 16 independent readout tiles, each of which will fit 144 resonators at different frequencies into 360 MHz of bandwidth. We discuss the effect of readout power and single pixel frequency responsivity on the NEP of the detectors. Finally, we consider the <b>mapping</b> <b>speeds</b> of a full tile {{as a function of}} Q, which is controlled through the detector volume. A lower Q at fixed optical power implies greater responsivity, while a higher Q decreases the collision probability - the likelihood that any two resonators will have close enough resonant frequencies for crosstalk to be unacceptably high.

40|$|Abstract. Fire {{frequency}} in 21 forest planning regions of Portugal {{during the period}} 1975 – 2005 was estimated from historical burnt area maps generated with semi-automatic classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery. Fire return interval distributions were modelled with the Weibull function and the estimated parameters were used to calculate regional mean, median andmodal fire return intervals, as well as regional hazard functions. Arrangement of the available data into three different time series allowed for assessment {{of the effects of}} <b>minimum</b> <b>mapping</b> unit, time series length and use of censored data on the Weibull function parameter estimates. Varying the <b>minimum</b> <b>mapping</b> unit between 5 and 35 ha had a negligible effect on parameter estimates, whereas changing the time series length from 22 to 31 years substantially affected the estimates. However, the strongest effect was caused by censored data. Its exclusion led to substantial overestimation of fire frequency and of burning probability dependence on fuel age. We estimated a country-widemean fire interval of 36 years and an annual burnt area of 1. 2 %. Regional variations in fire frequency descriptors were interpreted in terms of land cover and land use practices that affect the contemporary fire regime in Portugal...|$|R

Despite the value and usefulness of CLC, its <b>minimum</b> <b>mapping</b> unit of 25 hectares considerably limits its applications at large scales of analysis.
