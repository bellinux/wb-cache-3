The TCP protocol slowly increases its sending rate until episodes of congestion occur, and then it quickly reduces its rate to remove congestion. However, <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> can be sensitive to even brief episodes of congestion. In this paper, we are interested in protecting <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> from TCP-induced congestion while maintaining their TCP friendliness. In particular, we consider <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> carried over the TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) protocol and we design algorithms that dynamically adapt the level of forward error correction (FEC) based on the congestion state of the network. To this end, first, we investigate the loss and delay characteristics of TFRC flows in several TCP-induced congestion scenarios, and we develop novel predictors of loss events based on packet delay information. Second, we use these predictors to dynamically adapt the level of FEC protection based on the predicted level of congestion. We showthat this technique can significantly improve the overhead versus reliability trade-off compared to fixed FEC. Third, we select the FEC and original media packets within each FEC block, in a rate-distortion optimized way, and we show that this technique significantly improves media quality.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a protocol for end-to-end handoff management in heterogeneous wireless IP-based networks. The protocol {{is based on}} the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP), and employs a soft-handoff mechanism that uses end-to-end semantics for signaling handoffs and for transmitting control messages. The objective of this protocol is first to reduce the home registration delay, and second, to eliminate the tunneling cost that exist in the current IP-based handoff management protocols. While the multihoming feature of SCTP has been suggested as way to realize soft-handoffs, our study is the first one the presents the relative merits of this handoff approach through an analytical methodology. After our theoretical analysis, we evaluate the performance the soft-handoff mobile-SCTP protocol, when <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> with stringent QoS requirements are employed.

40|$|In recent years, {{unofficial}} and/or illegal {{forms of}} online file sharing have been increasingly used by audiences worldwide to consume foreign TV programmes {{which would not}} previously have been available to {{them at the time}} when such shows were first broadcast in their original regions. This form of consumption shortens the time-and-space gap between foreign broadcast and local consumption, highlighting audiences’ desires for borderless, transnational viewing. Taking Taiwanese audiences as an example, this research studies the implications which transnational foreign television consumption via online sharing may bring. Based on in-depth interviews with thirty-six audience members conducted from 2010 to 2011, I focus on two issues: 1. 	The meaning of television for its audiences: This research examines how and why audiences employ online sharing to bypass temporal, spatial and legal constraints on consuming foreign programmes, and elaborates the ways in which such consumption is becoming an emerging norm of television experience. It sheds light on how our existing understandings have changed, regarding what is meant by “watching TV”, and what television’s role is in providing a sense of liveness, shaping audiences’ sense of social togetherness and their cultural identity. 2. 	Transnational <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> and cultural power relationships: This research looks at the implications of this cross-border Taiwanese consumption of television for transnational <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> in the post-colonial East Asian contexts. It examines cultural power relationships between East Asian countries, as well as those between the East and the West. Furthermore, by elaborating how audiences’ sense of co-temporality with (and understanding of) other cultures develop via their consumption, this research analyses how such consumption shapes the direction of <b>media</b> <b>flows</b> and cultural power relationships of Taiwan with other countries and thus offers a contemporary understanding of what television means as a cultural form, and what features television audiences have, in the post-network era today...|$|R
