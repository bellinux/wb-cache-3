In this paper, we {{depict a}} model dedicated to <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases.</b> The approach we present designs decisional information through a constellation of facts and dimensions. Each dimension is possibly shared between several facts and it is organised according to multiple hierarchies. In addition, we define a comprehensive query algebra regrouping the more popular multidimensional operations in current commercial systems and research approaches. We introduce new operators dedicated to a constellation. Finally, we describe a prototype that allows managers to query constellations of facts, dimensions and multiple hierarchies. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractÐIn {{the last}} several years, large <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases</b> have become common {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} such as data warehousing and scientific computing. Analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. Because {{of the size of the}} data sets, dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts. Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. In this paper, we present Polaris, an interface for exploring large <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases</b> that extends the well-known Pivot Table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table-based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations.

40|$|Résumé. To {{optimize}} queries in relational databases, {{two categories}} of optimization techniques have been proposed: the Rule-Based Approach (RBA), and the Cost-Based Approach (CBA). In the RBA, the optimizer uses rule transformations using the relational algebra. In the CBA, the optimizer uses a cost model to estimate the potential cost of each operation using statistics about the database and the tables involved in the query. Usually both categories are implemented by commercial DBMSs and are often intermixed. In <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases</b> however, most of query optimization techniques follow only the CBA to select optimization structures such as: materialized views, advanced indexing schemes and data partitioning. No approach has been proposed yet to rewrite OLAP queries using a multidimensional algebra. In this paper, we show that the RBA {{can be applied to}} <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases</b> by rewriting each OLAP query to obtain an efficient rewritten query that can be executed using a CBA. In particular, we show that the RBA can be used to take into account one of the specificities of OLAP which is the visualization of the OLAP query result. We propose a multidimensional algebra that represents the core of our RBA optimization, and we show how rewritten queries can be processed using the CBA proposed for <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Dimensional {{modeling}} (DM) names a set {{of techniques}} and concepts used in data warehouse design. It {{is considered to be}} different from entity-relationship modeling (ER). Dimensional modeling does not necessarily involve a relational database. The same modeling approach, at the logical level, can be used for any physical form, such as <b>multidimensional</b> <b>database</b> or even flat files. According to data warehousing consultant Ralph Kimball, DM is a design technique for databases intended to support end-user queries in a data warehouse. It is oriented around understandability and performance. According to him, although transaction-oriented ER is very useful for the transaction capture, it should be avoided for end-user delivery.|$|E

40|$|Protecting data against {{inferential}} disclosure is {{a significant}} research challenge. With the increasing pervasiveness of data warehouses and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) applications, disclosure limitation in <b>multidimensional</b> <b>databases</b> is especially important. Recent research has proposed efficient methods for inferential disclosure detection in <b>multidimensional</b> categorical <b>databases</b> but has not addressed the problem of disclosure elimination. Disclosures are removed by additive noise data perturbation. The goal is to minimize information loss due to data perturbation. This dissertation formulates the disclosure elimination problem in <b>multidimensional</b> categorical <b>databases</b> as a constrained optimization model. Since finding optimal solutions to the resulting problem is computationally hard, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to identify good feasible solutions. A greedy algorithm is developed to solve an important special case of the problem that involves non-zero disclosures. Results indicate that the proposed GA based approach and the greedy algorithm can efficiently identify good feasible solutions that require low levels of data perturbation. Extensive computational experiments are performed to validate these results...|$|R

Facts have associated numerical measures that capture the properties of the facts that are to be studied, e. g., the total sales price.
