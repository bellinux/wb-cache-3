5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the number of plebeian senators.|$|E

At Palmyra Atoll, adults avoid patrolling tiger sharks by staying out of the central, deeper lagoon. Their known parasites include the tapeworms Anthobothrium lesteri, Nybelinia queenslandensis, Otobothrium alexanderi, and Platybothrium jondoeorum, a myxosporidian in the genus Unicapsula, and the monogenean Dermophthirius melanopteri. One of the few documented examples of infectious disease in a shark was a fatal case of hemorrhagic septicemia in a blacktip reef shark, caused by the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.|$|E

5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N.pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N.javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct—the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from some individuals of N.coucang and N.bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> species. The authors suggest that this result {{may be explained by}} introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N.bengalensis and N.coucang, and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species.|$|E

5|$|Although Allosaurus {{may have}} hunted in packs, {{it has been}} argued that Allosaurus and other theropods had largely {{aggressive}} interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among vertebrates in general, and modern diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple Allosaurus individuals at the same site, e.g. in the Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that Allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in Allosaurus, including Allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D-loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including the pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus), Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis) and the Javan slow loris (N.javanicus)) were shown to be genetically distinct, the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from selected individuals of Sunda slow loris (N.coucang) and Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) shared a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> respective species. The authors suggest that this result {{may be explained by}} introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known.

5|$|In 342 BC, two {{significant}} laws were passed. One {{of these two}} laws made it illegal to hold more than one office at any given point in time, and the other law required an interval of ten years to pass before any magistrate could seek reelection to any office. As {{a result of these}} two laws, the military situation quickly became unmanageable. During this time period, Rome was expanding within Italy and beginning to take steps beyond Italy, and thus it became necessary for military commanders to hold office for several years at a time. This problem was resolved with the creation of the pro-magisterial offices, so that when an individual's term in office ended, his command might be prorogued (prorogatio imperii). In effect, when a magistrate's term ended, his imperium was extended, and he usually held the title of either Proconsul or Propraetor. This constitutional device was not in harmony with the underlying genius of the Roman constitution, and its frequent usage eventually {{paved the way for the}} empire. In addition, during these years, the Plebeian Tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realized the need to use Plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals, and so to win over the Tribunes, the senators gave the Tribunes a great deal of power, and unsurprisingly, the Tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the Tribunes and the senators grew closer, Plebeian senators were often able to secure the Tribunate for <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> families.

25|$|In the Creature Stage, {{the player}} has a home nest where <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> species are located. The nest {{is where the}} player respawns {{following}} death, and acts as a recovery point for lost HP. Other species' nests are spread throughout the continent. While interacting with them, the player can choose to be social or aggressive; how the player interacts with other creatures will affect their opinion of the player's species. For instance, by mimicking their social behaviors (singing, dancing etc.), NPC creatures will eventually consider the player an ally, but if the player harms members of their species, they will flee or become aggressive upon sighting them. Epic creatures, which are rare, aggressive creatures more than twenty times the player's height, feature prominently in the Creature Stage. There are also Rogue creatures which may be befriended or attacked. Additionally, spaceships may appear in this stage and abduct a creature.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{as members}} of various gangs of outlaws, Jesse and Frank robbed banks, stagecoaches, and trains across the Midwest, gaining {{national}} fame and often popular sympathy despite the brutality of their crimes.

On April 3, 1882, Jesse James was shot and killed by Robert Ford, a new recruit to the gang who hoped to collect a reward on James' head. Already a celebrity in life, James became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death.|$|E

Romney supported a legislative measure (the Blunt amendment) {{that would have allowed}} employers and health insurance companies to deny coverage for contraceptives and other services that they object to on religious or moral grounds; the amendment failed passage in the Senate. Romney subsequently said that if elected president, he would rescind the contraception coverage requirement.|$|E
