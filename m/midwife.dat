40|$|OBJECTIVE: As {{part of an}} {{evaluation}} of a team midwifery scheme we assessed the satisfaction of community and hospital <b>midwives</b> and their views about working practices and care provided. DESIGN: Survey of complete enumeration of community <b>midwives</b> (most working in teams) and hospital <b>midwives</b> providing antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care to a population of women. SETTING: Community and district general hospital, in the UK. MEASUREMENTS: Socio-demographic data about <b>midwives,</b> ratings on Likert-type scales of job satisfaction, quality of care variables, relationships with other professionals and women; Glasgow Midwifery Process Questionnaire. FINDINGS: 80 out of 92 <b>midwives</b> (87 %) responded. Community <b>midwives</b> were younger, more recently qualified, employed on lower grades, {{less likely to be}} married and have children than hospital <b>midwives.</b> The Glasgow Midwifery Process Questionnaire revealed that <b>midwives,</b> particularly hospital <b>midwives,</b> had low morale. Community <b>midwives</b> {{were more likely to report}} that their job was satisfying, offered a variety of work, enabled them to use skills and knowledge fully, and offered opportunities for professional development. Hospital <b>midwives</b> were more likely to report following strict guidelines. Community <b>midwives,</b> however, disliked the long on call and unsociable hours, and reported disruption to family/social life. Forty-one per cent of hospital <b>midwives</b> (12) and 28 % of community <b>midwives</b> (14) reported regularly working beyond their shift. Whilst <b>midwives</b> thought that team midwifery was, in theory, a good idea, in practice it was not working well because of the size of teams and caseload. About half the community <b>midwives</b> felt that teams had detrimentally affected the quality and continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst team midwifery aims to improve continuity of maternity care, in this instance, it does not appear to achieve this aim. Many <b>midwives</b> reported it had adversely affected care. Team midwifery is a source of disillusionment for <b>midwives,</b> since the continuity of carer ideal is unachievable in a system based on teams of seven or more. Attendance at the delivery may be a luxury provided at the expense of antenatal and postnatal continuity. IMPLICATIONS: <b>Midwives</b> recommended remedial measures: reducing team sizes, reducing caseloads, ensuring teams were fully staffed, reducing 'on call' and labour ward hours. It remains to be seen whether these will have the desired effects on continuity of care...|$|R

40|$|Summary Background: In {{spite of}} caring being {{the core of}} midwifery and nursing, there is a {{constant}} public outcry about uncaring behaviours of <b>midwives</b> towards clients. Local media reports and recent discussion in the health system have highlighted the concerns regarding caring behaviours of <b>midwives.</b> Thus, {{there is a need to}} compare the meaning of caring from the perspectives of student <b>midwives,</b> <b>midwives</b> and educators. Aims: The aim of this article was to determine the meaning of caring from the perspectives of the undergraduate student <b>midwives,</b> the professional <b>midwives,</b> and the educators teaching midwifery in Tshwane. Setting: The study was conducted at healthcare institutions which the undergraduate student <b>midwives</b> attended for work integrated learning and at nursing education institutions in Tshwane, South Africa. Methods: The strategy was qualitative and exploratory in nature. The population comprised student <b>midwives,</b> professional <b>midwives</b> and educators. Purposive sampling was done. Focus group discussions were held with student <b>midwives</b> and professional <b>midwives,</b> whilst the naïve sketch form was used as data-collection instrument for educators. Content data analysis was done. The total sample realised was 38. Results: The findings revealed that ‘caring’ was taken to mean being well conversant, upto- date and proficient in the field of work as well as considerate and respectful to others. The professional <b>midwives</b> indicated that they have seen colleagues demonstrate uncaring behaviour whilst educators emphasised respect as caring. Conclusion: The student <b>midwives,</b> professional <b>midwives</b> and educators described caring as being a competent nurse with compassion and respect for others...|$|R
