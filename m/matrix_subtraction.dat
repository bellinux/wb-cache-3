40|$|The Aero-Physics Branch at NASA Ames Research Center {{utilizes}} a 32 - by 48 -inch subsonic {{wind tunnel}} for aerodynamics research. The feasibility of acquiring acoustic measurements with a phased microphone array was recently explored. Acoustic characterization of the wind tunnel was carried out with a floor-mounted 24 -element array and two ceiling-mounted speakers. The minimum speaker level for accurate level measurement was evaluated for various tunnel speeds up to a Mach number of 0. 15 and streamwise speaker locations. A variety of post-processing procedures, including conventional beamforming and deconvolutional processing such as TIDY, were used. The speaker measurements, with and without flow, were used to compare actual versus simulated in-flow speaker calibrations. Data for wind-off speaker sound and wind-on tunnel background noise were found valuable for predicting sound levels for which the speakers were detectable when the wind was on. Speaker sources were detectable 2 - 10 dB below the peak background noise level with conventional data processing.

40|$|Background {{noise in}} wind tunnel environments poses a {{challenge}} to acoustic measurements due to possible low or negative Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) present in the testing environment. This paper overviews the application of time domain Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) to microphone array signals with an intended application of background noise reduction in wind tunnels. An experiment was conducted to simulate background noise from a wind tunnel circuit measured by an out-of-flow microphone array in the tunnel test section. A reference microphone was used to acquire a background noise signal which interfered with the desired primary noise source signal at the array. The technique s efficacy was investigated using frequency spectra from the array microphones, array beamforming of the point source region, and subsequent deconvolution using the Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) algorithm. Comparisons were made with the conventional techniques for improving SNR of spectral and Cross-Spectral <b>Matrix</b> <b>subtraction.</b> The method was seen to recover the primary signal level in SNRs as low as - 29 dB and outperform the conventional methods. A second processing approach using the center array microphone as the noise reference was investigated for more general applicability of the ANC technique.

This approach could possibly improve conventional testing methodology but must be investigated further under more realistic testing conditions...|$|E

The {{phase time}} in quantum {{tunneling}} can be disentangled into a dwell time plus a term arising {{due to the}} interference of the reflected and incident waves {{in front of the}} barrier.

40|$|The type of ions {{detected}} after in-source decay (ISD) in a MALDI source differs {{according to}} the ion source pressure and on the mass analyzer used. We present the mechanism leading to the final ISD ions for a Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR MS). The MALDI ion source was operated at intermediate pressure to cool the resulting ions and increase their lifetime during the long residence times in the FTICR ion optics. This condition produces not only c′, z′, and w fragments, but also a, y′, and d fragments. In particular, d ions help to identify isobaric amino acid residues present near the Nterminal amino acid. Desorbed ions collide with background gas during desorption, leading to proton mobilization from Arg residues to a less favored protonation site. As a result, {{in the case of}} ISD with MALDI FTICR, the influence of the Arg residue in ISD fragmentation is less straightforward than for TOF MS and the sequence coverage is thus improved. MALDI-ISD combined with FTICR MS appears to be a useful method for sequencing of peptides and proteins including discrimination of isobaric amino acid residues and site determination of phosphorylation. Additionally we also used new software for in silico elimination of MALDI matrix peaks from MALDI-ISD FTICR mass spectra. The combination of high resolving power of an FTICR analyzer and <b>matrix</b> <b>subtraction</b> software helps to interpret the low m/z region of MALDI-ISD spectra. Finally, several of these developed methods are applied in unison toward a MALDI ISD FTICR imaging experiment on mouse brain to achieve better results. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Launch {{vehicles}} consume {{large quantities}} of propellant quickly, causing the mass properties and structural dynamics of the vehicle to change dramatically. Currently, structural load assessments account for this change with a large collection of structural models representing various propellant fill levels. This creates a large database of models complicating the delivery of reduced models and requiring extensive work for model changes. Presented here is a method to account for these mass changes in a more efficient manner. The method allows for the subtraction of propellant mass as the propellant {{is used in the}} simulation. This subtraction is done in the modal domain of the vehicle generalized model.

40|$|Introduction: Hydronephrosis {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{referring}} infants for nuclear medicine investigation. Renal dynamic study is the most reliable investigation for such children. However direct evaluation of renogram leads to generation of parameters that have no physiological interpretation. The configuration of renogram is very much dependent upon the rate at which radiopharmaceutical enters the kidney. In order to decrease such effect, the radiopharmaceutical has to be injected in a small volume and very fast into the vein, which is not always possible, especially in the infants. Deconvolution is a method in which the injection quality does not have any effect upon renogram decreasing the diagnostic errors. The renal retention function (RRF) is independent of input function and derived parameters have physiological significance and clinical values. Materials & methods: In this study 54 patients data were evaluated. All the patients were under 6 month of age, suspicious for hydronephrosis referred to our imaging center for 99 mTc-DTPA renal dynamic studies. All data were transformed into interfile format.

40|$|Efficient {{iterative}} solution {{methods are}} being developed for the numerical solution of two- and three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Iterative time marching methods have several advantages over classical multi-step explicit time marching schemes, and non-iterative implicit time marching schemes. Iterative schemes have better stability characteristics than non-iterative explicit and implicit schemes. Thus, the extra work required by iterative schemes can also be designed to perform efficiently on current and future generation scalable, missively parallel machines. An obvious candidate for iteratively solving the system of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations arising in CFD applications is the Newton method. Newton's method was implemented in existing finite difference and finite volume methods. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} problem, the number of Newton iterations needed per step to solve the discretized system of equations can, however, vary dramatically from a few to several hundred. Another popular approach based on the classical conjugate gradient method, known as the GMRES (Generalized Minimum Residual) algorithm is investigated. The GMRES algorithm was used in the past by a number of researchers for solving steady viscous and inviscid flow problems with considerable success. Here, the suitability of this algorithm is investigated for solving the system of nonlinear equations that arise in unsteady Navier-Stokes solvers at each time step. Unlike the Newton method which attempts to drive the error in the solution at each and every node down to zero, the GMRES algorithm only seeks to minimize the L 2 norm of the error. In the GMRES algorithm the changes in the flow properties from one time step to the next are assumed to be the sum of a set of orthogonal vectors. By choosing the number of vectors to a reasonably small value N (between 5 and 20) the work required for advancing the solution from one time step to the next may be kept to (N+ 1) times that of a noniterative scheme. Many of the operations required by the GMRES algorithm such as matrix-vector multiplies, <b>matrix</b> additions and <b>subtractions</b> can all be vectorized and parallelized efficiently...|$|R
