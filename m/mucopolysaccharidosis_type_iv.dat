40|$|Morquio′s syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder, caused by deficiency of n-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulphate. Anesthetic management of this syndrome is a great challenge, especially in pediatric age group as "cannot ventilate, cannot intubate" scenario can be encountered by anesthesiologist due {{to the possibility of}} total airway collapse. Herewith, we are reporting a case of child with Morquio′s syndrome where I-gel assisted fiber-optic intubation was used for safe endotracheal intubation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{anaesthetic}} {{management of}} patients with Morquio syndrome is complicated {{by a number of}} factors including odontoid hypoplasia, atlantoaxial instability, thoracic kyphosis, and deposition of mucopolysaccharides in the soft tissue of the oropharnyx. Case presentation: Herein we describe the anaesthetic considerations and management of a 26 year old adult with Morquio syndrome, who presented for an elective hip replacement. Conclusion: This report details an awake fiberoptic intubation in an adult with Morquio syndrome. We recommend that this approach be considered in patients with Morquio syndrome undergoing general anaesthesia. Background Morquio’s syndrome also known as <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of n-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulphate.

40|$|Background: Thoracolumbar {{kyphosis}} {{has been}} considered as the first presenting deformity and is often a key diagnostic clue noted in children with <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> (MPS) <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> (Morquio′s syndrome). However, we observed that the progressive irregularities of the epiphyses of the long bones were the most prominent skeletal pathology, causing effectively the development of diverse forms of lower limbs deformities with extreme variation in age of onset. Materials and Methods: Ten patients (seven children and three adults) {{with an average age}} of 15 years have been enrolled in this study. Age of diagnosis of MPS IVA has a variable age of onset and a MISLEADING rate of severity. Hip dislocations, genu valgum, protrusio acetabuli and osteoarthritis were the most common lower limbs deformities in these patients. Clinical and radiographic phenotypes were the baseline tools of documentation. Urinary screening and genotypic characterizations have been applied accordingly. Results: Combined pelvic and femoral procedures for hip dislocation, epiphysiodeses and supracondylar osteotomy for genu valgum and hip arthroplasty for protrusio acetabuli have been performed. All patients manifested insufficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulphate sulphatase, an enzyme that degrades keratin sulphate and chondroitin- 6 sulphate. Conclusion: The extensive clinical heterogeneity contributed significantly in the delay in establishing the diagnosis particularly in adult patients with MPS IV. The epiphyseal irregularities of the long bones and the progressive flattening pathology of MPS IV A were the reason to falsely diagnose some patients as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital and/or tarda. Proximal femoral osteotomy, realignment osteotomy and total hip arthroplasty have been performed for coxa vara, genu valgum and protrusio acetabuli, respectively, in children and adult group of patients. The importance of early diagnosis on MPS IV A is to receive enzyme replacement therapy and plan for other therapeutic measures...|$|R

Autosomal recessive mutations in DYM {{are known to}} cause this disease through its role in Golgi organisation and intracellular traffic, but genetic heterogeneity is suspected. Methods A family with DMC and normal intellectual development underwent clinical evaluation followed by autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing.

Exome sequencing revealed a missense mutation in RAB 33 B, which encodes a Rab protein with an established role in retrograde Golgi traffic. The mutation qualitatively replaces the invariant lysine residue in the guanine nucleotide-binding domain of this small GTPase protein and leads to marked protein deficiency, making it the likely causative mutation of DMC in this family.

40|$|Background: Lysosomal storage {{diseases}} (LSD) often manifest with cherry red macular spots. Diagnosis {{is based}} on clinical features and specific biochemical and enzymatic patterns. In uncertain cases, genetic testing with next generation sequencing can establish a diagnosis, especially in milder or atypical phenotypes. We report on the diagnostic work-up in a boy with sialidosis type I, presenting initially with marked cherry red macular spots but non-specific urinary oligosaccharide patterns and unusually mild excretion of bound sialic acid. Methods: Biochemical, enzymatic and genetic tests were performed in the patient. The clinical and electrophysiological data was reviewed and a genotype-phenotype analysis was performed. In addition a systematic literature review was carried out. Case report and results: Cherry red macular spots were first noted at 6  years of age after routine screening myopia. Physical examination, psychometric testing, laboratory investigations as well as cerebral MRI were unremarkable at 9  years of age. So far no clinical myoclonic seizures occurred, but EEG displays generalized epileptic discharges and visual evoked potentials are prolonged bilaterally. Urine thin layer chromatography showed an oligosaccharide pattern compatible with different LSD including sialidosis, galactosialidosis, GM 1 gangliosidosis or <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> <b>IV</b> B. Urinary bound sialic acid excretion was mildly elevated in spontaneous and 24  h urine samples. In cultured fibroblasts, α-sialidase activity was markedly decreased to A, p. S 233 R in exon 4 and c. 803 A>G; p. Y 268 C in Exon 5 in NEU 1 transcript NM_ 000434. 3), leading to amino acid changes predicted to impair protein function. Discussion: Sialidosis should be suspected in patients with cherry red macular spots, even with non-significant urinary sialic acid excretion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural history of the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{with varying}} degrees of phenotypic severity caused by mutations in IDUA. Over 200 disease-causing variants in IDUA have been reported. We describe the profile of disease-causing variants in 291 individuals with <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I for whom IDUA sequencing was performed, focussing on the UK subset of the cohort. A total of 63 variants were identified, of which 20 were novel, and the functional significance of the novel variants is explored. The severe form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I is treated with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, known to have improved outcomes with earlier age at treatment. Developing genotype-phenotype relationships would therefore have considerable clinical utility, especially {{in the light of the}} development of newborn screening programs for <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>Type</b> I. Associations between genotype and phenotype are examined in this cohort, particularly in the context of the profile of variants identified in UK individuals.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease, a {{progressive}} manifestation of α-L-iduronidase deficiency or <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I, continues in patients both untreated and treated with {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation or intravenous enzyme replacement. Few {{studies have examined the}} effects of α-L-iduronidase deficiency and subsequent glycosaminoglycan storage upon arterial gene expression to understand the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Gene expression in carotid artery, ascending, and descending aortas from four non-tolerized, non-enzyme treated 19 month-old <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I dogs was compared with expression in corresponding vascular segments from three normal, age-matched dogs. Data were analyzed using R and whole genome network correlation analysis, a bias-free method of categorizing expression level and significance into discrete modules. Genes were further categorized based on module-trait relationships. Expression of clusterin, a protein implicated in other etiologies of cardiovascular disease, was assessed in canine and murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I aortas via Western blot and in situ immunohistochemistry. Gene families with more than two-fold, significant increased expression involved lysosomal function, proteasome function, and immune regulation. Significantly downregulated genes were related to cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal elements, and calcium regulation. Clusterin gene overexpression (9 -fold) and protein overexpression (1. 3 to 1. 62 -fold) was confirmed and located specifically in arterial plaques of mucopolysaccharidosis-affected dogs and mice. Overexpression of lysosomal and proteasomal-related genes are expected responses to cellular stress induced by lysosomal storage in <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> I.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> IIIA is a {{neurodegenerative}} lysosomal storage disorder {{characterized by}} progressive loss of learned skills, sleep disturbance and behavioural problems. Absent or greatly reduced activity of sulphamidase, a lysosomal protein, results in intracellular accumulation of heparan sulphate. Subsequent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration typify this and many other lysosomal storage disorders. We propose that intra-cerebrospinal fluid protein delivery represents a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of this and other neurodegenerative conditions; however, technical restraints restrict examination of its use prior to adulthood in mice. We have used a naturally-occurring <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>type</b> IIIA mouse model to determine the effectiveness of combining intravenous protein replacement (1 mg/kg) from birth to 6 weeks of age with intra-cerebrospinal fluid sulphamidase delivery (100 μg, fortnightly from 6 weeks) on behaviour, the level of heparan sulphate-oligosaccharide storage and other neuropathology. Mice receiving combination treatment exhibited similar clinical improvement and reduction in heparan sulphate storage to those only receiving intra-cerebrospinal fluid enzyme. Reductions in micro- and astrogliosis and delayed development of ubiquitin-positive lesions were seen in both groups. A third group of intravenous-only treated mice did not exhibit clinical or neuropathological improvements.
