5|$|This was Bowie's {{first tour}} where {{wireless}} microphone technology was available, allowing Bowie considerable freedom {{to move around}} the stage during a concert. This allowed him {{to interact with the}} dancers and musicians much <b>more</b> <b>freely,</b> and as such the set included 3-story high mobile scaffolding, onto which Bowie and his dancers would occasionally climb during the show.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were {{the early days of}} the world when the groups mingled <b>more</b> <b>freely</b> than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, School Rumbles Japanese license holder, Media Factory, {{declared}} its titles off-limits to fan-made subtitled translations—a practice known as fansubbing.2}} The directory website AnimeSuki later removed all links to fansubs of Media Factory's work {{in response to}} a cease-and-desist notice issued by the license holder, although fansub group 'Wannabe Fansubs' continued their fansubbing regardless. Media Factory-owned anime {{has been the subject of}} debate over the validity of fansubbing practice. Proponents believe School Rumble would have more quickly received an English license had fansubs been allowed to circulate <b>more</b> <b>freely,</b> generating viewer interest.|$|E

50|$|Swenson always {{maintained}} a very liberal policy of sharing breeding selections, sending cuttings {{to just about}} anyone who asked. Five of his hybrids were patented, but many <b>more</b> were <b>freely</b> distributed, and many cultivars were even named by other people, which {{has resulted in a}} degree of confusion.|$|R

5|$|Johnny Rioux, who had {{produced}} Flatfoot 56's last album, Black Thorn, {{was chosen as}} the album's producer. The band felt that having the same producer improved communication and allowed the band to work <b>more</b> <b>freely.</b> According to frontman Tobin Bawinkel, this familiarity allowed Rioux to encourage the band to advance musically and think differently. During January 2012, the band recorded the entire album at the Atlas Studios in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions <b>more</b> <b>freely.</b> It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1893, Fields married Dora McDavid; {{the couple}} had six children. At age 21, he was elected constable of Carter County, but three years later, he fell short in his bid to capture a seat in state legislature. Following the loss, {{he took a job}} at a grocery store in Ashland, Kentucky that would allow him to travel the state <b>more</b> <b>freely,</b> make acquaintances, and better {{position}} himself for a run for higher office.|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} to the castle {{as quickly as he}} could, and told the Fairy that her commands were obeyed. She was even more amazed than she had been before, and asked him again if he had either seen or spoken to the black girl; but the Prince knew better than to betray his word, and once <b>more</b> lied <b>freely.</b>|$|R

5|$|The cycle {{consists}} of sixteen sonatas (thirteen {{of which are}} cast in binary form, the remaining three in ternary form) and four <b>more</b> <b>freely</b> structured interludes. The aim of the pieces is to express the eight permanent emotions of the rasa Indian tradition. In Sonatas and Interludes, Cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions {{to a new level}} of complexity. In each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines the structure of the work and that of its parts, informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} Byzantine army {{decided on}} a less ambitious plan, Vahan now aimed to break the Muslim army at specific points. He decided to press upon the relatively exposed right flank, where his mounted troops could maneuver <b>more</b> <b>freely</b> {{as compared to the}} rugged terrain at the Muslims' left flank. And it was decided to charge at the junction between the Muslim right center and its right wing held by Qanatir's Slavs, to break the two apart and to fight them separately.|$|E
5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow <b>more</b> <b>freely.</b> The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E

5|$|To {{overcome}} {{the constraints of}} the bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver <b>more</b> <b>freely,</b> although the effectiveness of the devices was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams {{while they}} were both visiting Percy Shelley's friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley's shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw {{each other at the}} Gisborne {{household}} regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December he went back to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother's house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother's house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her <b>more</b> <b>freely.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a later arc, Hitsugaya leads a {{group of}} Soul Reapers {{assigned}} to defend Karakura Town against the Arrancar that Aizen has enlisted to his cause. He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue has followed the Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society {{to help in the}} preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen. From there, Hitsugaya engages Aizen, and is tricked into stabs Momo in the chest with Aizen taking advantage of the youth's rage of being tricked to cut his left limbs off. After Aizen's defeat and healed, Hitsugaya resolves to train so that he can <b>more</b> <b>freely</b> use his strongest move as a Soul Reaper, bankai, to protect Hinamori.|$|E

60|$|In {{the third}} book, he once <b>more</b> {{breathes}} <b>freely,</b> and in recounting the {{various kinds of}} exercise by which the human frame may be invigorated, his poetic faculty again finds room to play. Joseph Warton, in his Essay on Pope, has justly commended the Episode on the Sweating Sickness, with which it concludes. In the fourth and last, on the Passions, {{he seems to have}} grown weary of his task; for he has here less compression and less dignity.|$|R
60|$|Long and {{habitual}} {{deference to}} the mandates of his superiors had taught the scout the virtue of obedience. Throwing a last and lingering glance at the distant canoes, he laid aside his rifle, and relieving the wearied Duncan, resumed the paddle, which he wielded with sinews that never tired. His efforts were seconded by those of the Mohicans, and a very few minutes served to place such a sheet of water between them and their enemies, that Heyward once <b>more</b> breathed <b>freely.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later in the war, Young's {{farmhouse}} and Four Corners {{were the}} site of the largest military engagement near the river. By 1780, the Continentals were operating much <b>more</b> <b>freely</b> around northern Westchester, although they had to stay on the move to avoid attack. In January, one company of about 250 troops from Massachusetts lingered long enough at Four Corners for local Loyalists to inform the British, who raised a force of about 100 cavalry and 400 to 500 infantry at Fort Washington, today on the northern tip of Manhattan. The force marched to Yonkers and up the Saw Mill overnight, arriving at Four Corners the next morning. The outnumbered Continentals put up stiff resistance, aided by the cold, heavy snow cover and their opponents' fatigue, but most were ultimately killed or taken prisoner. The British and their Loyalist and Hessian allies celebrated by burning down the Young house; the Continentals retreated {{to the north of the}} Croton River for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than his}} stays in hospital, Hess {{spent the rest}} of his life in Spandau prison. His fellow inmates Konstantin von Neurath, Walther Funk and Erich Raeder were {{released}} because of poor health in the 1950s; Karl Dönitz, Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer served their time and were released; Dönitz in 1956, Schirach and Speer in 1966. The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move <b>more</b> <b>freely</b> around the cell block, setting his own routine and choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening. A lift was installed so he could more readily access the garden, and he was provided with a medical orderly from 1982 onward.|$|E

She settled into a monogamous relationship with her husband Naihe (her stepbrother, since her father married his mother).She returned to Kealakekua Bay in the spring of 1823, but wanted to continue her education. She would send boats up to Kailua to pick up a preacher for Sunday services.|$|R
50|$|Most global nomads {{come from}} Western countries.
