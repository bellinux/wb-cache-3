There are many {{differences among the}} Nine <b>Major</b> <b>Rivers</b> basins of China {{in the construction of}} dikes, reservoirs, floodgates, flood discharge projects, flood diversion projects, water ecological construction, water conservancy management, etc. The shadow prices of water resources for Nine <b>Major</b> <b>Rivers</b> can provide suggestions to the Chinese government. This article develops a dynamic shadow prices approach based on a multiperiod input–output optimizing model. Unlike previous approaches, the new model is based on the dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE) model {{to solve the problem of}} marginal long-term prices of water resources. First, definitions and algorithms of DCGE are elaborated. Second, the results of shadow prices of water resources for Nine <b>Major</b> <b>Rivers</b> in 1949 – 2050 in China using the National Water Conservancy input–holding–output table for Nine <b>Major</b> <b>Rivers</b> in 1999 are listed. A conclusion of this article is that the shadow prices of water resources for Nine <b>Major</b> <b>Rivers</b> are largely based on the extent of scarcity. Selling prices of water resources should be revised via the usage of parameters representing shadow prices...|$|R
5|$|Although Coatbridge has no <b>major</b> <b>river</b> {{running through}} it, the North Calder Water runs east-west {{to the south}} and the now defunct Monkland Canal used to run {{straight}} through the centre of the town toward Glasgow. The canal route through Coatbridge can still be seen today. There are also several smaller burns which run through Coatbridge, most of which drain to the North Calder Water. Coatbridge has four significant public parks. Dunbeth park, West End park, Whifflet park and Drumpellier Country park. Woodend and Witchwood Loch are situated on the north-west edge of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{along the}} eastern border and {{deposition}} along the north coast altered {{the shape of the}} East Anglian coastline during Roman and Anglo-Saxon times (and continues to do so today). During Saxon times the sea inundated the naturally low-lying Fens.

5|$|Rifting {{started to}} create the Gulf of California far to the south 6 to 10million years ago. Around the same time, {{the western edge of}} the Colorado Plateau may have sagged slightly. Both events changed the {{direction}} of many streams toward the sagging region and the increased gradient caused them to downcut much faster. From 5.5million to 5million years ago, headward erosion to the north and east consolidated these streams into one <b>major</b> <b>river</b> and associated tributary channels. This river, the ancestral Lower Colorado River, started to fill the northern arm of the gulf, which extended nearly to the site of Hoover Dam, with estuary deposits.|$|E
5|$|The Laramide orogeny {{affected}} all {{of western}} North America {{by helping to}} build the American cordillera. The Kaibab Uplift, Monument Upwarp, the Uinta Mountains, San Rafael Swell, and the Rocky Mountains were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide orogeny. This major mountain-building event started {{near the end of}} the Mesozoic, around 75million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a <b>major</b> <b>river.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{form one}} of the four {{watersheds}} of India, feeding the perennial rivers of India. The <b>major</b> <b>river</b> systems originating in the Western Ghats include Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, Thamiraparani and Tungabhadra. Majority of streams draining the Western Ghats join these rivers and carry large volume of water during the monsoon months. These rivers flow to the east due to the gradient of the land and drain out into the Bay of Bengal. Major tributaries include Kali, Bhadra, Bhavani, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi and Kabini. Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi and Zuari rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, draining into the Arabian Sea and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28December and 1January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near <b>major</b> <b>river</b> systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
5|$|England had {{a diverse}} {{geography}} {{in the medieval}} period, from the Fenlands of East Anglia or the heavily wooded Weald, through to the upland moors of Yorkshire. Despite this, medieval England broadly formed two zones, roughly divided by the rivers Exe and Tees: {{the south and east}} of England had lighter, richer soils, able to support both arable and pastoral agriculture, while the poorer soils and colder climate of the north and west produced a predominantly pastoral economy. Slightly more land was covered by trees than in the 20th century, and bears, beavers and wolves lived wild in England, bears being hunted to extinction by the 11th century and beavers by the 12th. Of the 10,000 miles of roads that had been built by the Romans, many remained in use and four were of particular strategic importance—the Icknield Way, the Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street—which criss-crossed the entire country. The road system was adequate for the needs of the period, although it was significantly cheaper to transport goods by water. The <b>major</b> <b>river</b> networks formed key transport routes, while many English towns formed navigable inland ports.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} difficult to separate the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every <b>major</b> <b>river</b> in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rest}} of his army, Theophilos then marched to interpose himself between the Cilician Gates and Ancyra, camping on the north bank of the river Halys, close to one of the <b>major</b> <b>river</b> crossings. Ashinas crossed the Cilician Gates on 19 June, and the caliph himself with his main army set out on the march two days later. The Arab advance was slow and cautious. Anxious to avoid an ambush and learn the emperor's whereabouts, Mu'tasim forbade Ashinas to advance too deeply into Cappadocia. Ashinas sent out many {{scouting}} detachments to take captives, and from them finally learned of Theophilos's presence at the Halys, where he awaited the Arab approach to give battle. At the same time, around mid-July, Theophilos learned of the arrival of Afshin's army, comprising some 30,000 men, at the plain of Dazimon. Leaving a part of his army under a relative to watch the crossings of the Halys, Theophilos immediately departed with most of his army, some 40,000 men according to Michael the Syrian, to confront the smaller Arab force. Mu'tasim learned of Theophilos's departure from captives and tried to warn Afshin, but the emperor was faster and met Afshin's army in the Battle of Anzen on the plain of Dazimon on 22 July. Despite initial success, the Byzantine army broke and scattered, while Theophilos with his guard were encircled and barely managed to break through and escape.|$|E
