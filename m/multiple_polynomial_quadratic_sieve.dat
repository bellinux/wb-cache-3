40|$|The {{subject of}} our study is the single large prime {{variation}} of the quadratic sieve algorithm. We derive a formula for the average numbers of complete and incomplete relations per polynomial, directly generated by the algorithm. The number of additional complete relations from the incomplete relations is then computed by a known formula. Hence practical hints for the optimal choice of the parameter values can be derived. We further compare theoretical estimates for {{the total number of}} smooth integers in an interval with countings in practice.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our distributed implementation of two factoring algorithms. the elliptic curve method (ecm) and the <b>multiple</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> algorithm (mpqs). Since {{the summer of}} 1987. our erm-implementation on a network of MicroVAX processors at DEC’s Systems Research Center has factored several most and more wanted numbers from the Cun-ningham project. In the summer of 1988. we implemented the <b>multiple</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> algorithm on rhe same network On this network alone. we {{are now able to}} factor any!@I digit integer, or to find 35 digit factors of numbers up to 150 digits long within one month. To allow an even wider distribution of our programs we made use of electronic mail networks For the distribution of the programs and for inter-processor communicatton. Even during the mitial stage of this experiment machines all over the United States and at various places in Europe and Ausnalia conhibuted 15 percent of the total factorization effort. At all the sites where our program is running we only use cycles that would otherwise have been idle. This shows that the enormous computational task of factoring 100 digit integers with the current algoritluns can be completed almost for free. Since we use a negligible fraction of the idle cycles of alI the machines on the worldwide elecnonic mail networks. we could factor 100 digit integers within a few days with a little more help...|$|E

We provide evidence that, for this number and our implementation, using three large primes is approximately 1. 7 {{times as fast as}} using only two. The gain in efficiency comes from a sudden {{growth in the number of}} cycles arising from relations which contain three large primes. This effect, which more than compensates for the false reports, was not anticipated by the authors of [6] [10] but has become quite familiar from factorizations obtained using the number field sieve. We characterize the various types of cycles present, and give a semi-quantitative description of their rather mysterious behaviour...|$|E
