The pathogen’s presence in cadavers of the rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, in collapsed colonies prompted studies of its potential to control stored-product insects. Respective mortality rates in fourth instar C. ferrugineus and C. pusillus were 15. 3 and 17. 7 % at 102 oocysts/g of diet and 89. 4 and 80. 5 % at 105 oocysts/g. The mortality of fourth instar O. surinamensis exposed to 105 oocysts/g was only 12 %. For C. ferrugineus larvae, {{there were no significant}} differences in mortality and infection between exposure to Mattesia dispora and exposure to M. oryzaephili (P/ 0. 05), but for C. pusillus larvae, both responses were significantly higher for M. oryzaephili than M. dispora. Adult C. ferrugineus and O. surinamensis were similar in their responses to M. oryzaephili, with mortality not exceeding 20 %, but differed in their responses to M. dispora, with O. surinamensis being more susceptible. The median lethal doses for larval <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> <b>moths,</b> Ephestia kuehniella, were 7. 9 / 107 M. oryzaephili oocysts/g of diet and 2. 7 / 103 M. dispora oocysts/g of diet.

Auf diese Weise sind sie die Auslöser eines Kompostierungsprozesses. Durch ihr hervorragendes Orientierungsvermögen entlang eines Duftstoffgradienten finden sie sich regelmäßig in Vorratslagern und Gebäuden der Lebens- und Futtermittelverarbeitung ein, falls sie nicht bereits mit befallenen Produkten passiv eingeschleppt wurden. In der Praxis der Schädlingsbekämpfung in Deutschland werden zunehmend auch Verfahren der Hitzeentwesung in Gebäuden angeboten, die der Begasung mit giftigen Gasen Konkurrenz machen und auch in Betrieben des Ökolandbaus eingesetzt werden können. Einen Überblick über den Einsatz extremer Temperaturen im Vorratsschutz vermitteln die Arbeiten von Fields (1992), Burks et al. (2000) und Adler & Rassmann (2000). Laborversuche unter definierten Temperaturen hatten zum Ziel, die Widerstandsfähigkeit bestimmter Arten und ihrer Entwicklungsstadien zu überprüfen.

Data presented here are from laboratory studies and practical heat treatments from 2001 - 2006 and summarize the relative sensitivity of immature and adult <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> <b>moths</b> Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae), tobacco beetles Lasioderma serricorne (Coleoptera, Anobiidae), lesser grain borers Rhizopertha dominica (Col., Bostrychidae), granary weevils Sitophilus granarius and maize weevils S. zeamais (Col., Curculionidae), flat grain beetles Cryptolestes pusillus (Col., Cucujidae) and rustred flour beetles Tribolium castaneum (Col., Tenebrionidae). While the moth larvae proved rather sensitive towards high temperatures, the larvae and pupal stages of lesser grain borer and tobacco beetle where quite tolerant with 370 min required in lab studies for complete control at 50 °C for both species. At 55 °C complete control was achieved in up to 45 min. Experiences from practical treatments showed {{that it is difficult to}} achieve uniform temperatures at all locations in a large flour mill. In a number of cases, lethal temperatures could not be reached close to the outside walls in areas with faulty insulation, in narrow corners in the cellar or roof construction, and in insulating materials such as bag stacks of flour, packaging material, tightly packed electric cables, larger amounts of grain, malt, dust or garbage.

The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) is a polyphagous insect pest that attacks many crops including cotton, maize, soybean, tomato, etc. The bollworm egg is a suitable target for many Trichogramma species. Factitious hosts such as eggs of the <b>flour</b> <b>moth,</b> Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) and cereal moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Hubner) are used for mass rearing purposes.

Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller), the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>flour</b> <b>moth,</b> is of major economic importance as a flour and grain feeder and is often a severe pest in flourmills. This study provides a suitable route for the direct preparation of thiosulfonates 2 and 3 from thiols, under mild conditions, with good yields; these thiosulfonates were tested for their regulatory effect on insect growth. The chronic ingestion of thiosulfonates resulted in a significant reduction in larval survival and weight. In addition, the tryptic activity of larvae was sensitive to these thiosulfonates.
