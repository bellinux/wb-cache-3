50|$|Cultural Controls Raising the mowing {{height is}} {{an easy way to}} reduce stress on a turfgrass plant and make the plant less {{susceptible}} to attack by disease, but there is a fine line. Turf mowed, less than 2.5 inches and above 3 inches makes the plant more susceptible to disease. Managing the moisture available to the plant is another way to help reduce the incidence of disease. The pathogen that causes Microdochium Patch requires and thrives in moist, cool conditions, therefore <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> aren't overwatering the turf when conditions are right for infection is very important. Giving the plant only enough water for normal plant function {{is the best way to}} ensure disease pressure is reduced as much as possible. Also, starving the turf of moisture can be damaging as this increases susceptibility to infection. Managing the amount of nitrogen available to the plant is another key to decreasing incidence of this disease. Avoiding excess fall nitrogen application will greatly reduce disease pressure of Microdochium nivale. On top of that excess nitrogen available to plant produces rapid growth of above ground tissue. This tissue often has thin cell walls and is prone to attack by disease. Managing thatch and soil drainage are two other important ways of controlling this disease as both of these affect the amount of moisture that is available to create a favorable environment to the disease, giving the plant only enough water for normal plant function is the best way to ensure disease pressure is reduced as much as possible. Despite the fact that the above cultural controls cannot completely control Microdochium Patch, when they are all used to reduce disease pressure, they can have a noticeable impact and will help to reduce the amount of chemical control that is required.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{an ancient}} Ibizan legend there is a rather ugly bad {{tempered}} pixie that can be both good and bad. This pixie's appearance could only be conjured up by the picking and the instant bottling of a flowering herb which could only be found under the Pont Vell's arches. These herbs shelter the spirits of Fameliars. The pixies {{were said to have}} only two aims during their apparitions: to work or eat. If you had a particular task which required some hard work, capturing one of the pixies was a good way to complete your job. The drawback was that if the work stopped, the pixie would then spend all its time eating. The legend dictates that to capture the Familiar you must first go under the bridge at first light {{on the day of the}} festival of Saint Juan (June 24) and collect the flowers of the herb, <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> pick the herbs quickly, as they can appear and disappear at a glance. Placing the crop in the black bottle the vessel should then be closed tightly. The bottle could then be kept and opened when hard work was required to be done quickly and properly. Once liberated, the Familiar will cry: [...] "Soc es familiar, vull veina o menjar", which means [...] "I am a Familiar! I would like work or food!" [...] The drawback of the releasing of this spirit is that if you do not give the Familiar work to do, it will eat you out of house and home. Although this story is a subject of myth, an unfortunate man from Santa Eulària was sent to prison by the Holy Office in 1744. He had sworn under oath to owning a Familiar and that he knew of many people in the area who also had possession of the spirits.|$|R

The rapid development and evolution of phishing techniques pose a big challenge in Web identity security for researchers over all phishing attacks spoof users from the visual level and semantic level, and then make the appearances of web pages look similar to the real ones and make the web links and web page contents semantically related to the real ones.
