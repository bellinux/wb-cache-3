40|$|Modern {{information}} dissemination services can dynamically produce real-time data that is valid and useful depending on users ’ on-demand data requests. Information servers must adopt a scheduling approach to maintain timely data access and system performance. Most previous studies on scheduling such data discuss on-demand data broadcasting and real-time task processing with various performance metrics. This paper exploits the attrib-utes of request urgency, service productivity, and access fairness, and proposes an adap-tive scheduling scheme for delivering on-demand, time-critical data objects over a data broadcast channel. In terms of request satisfaction and <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>time,</b> performance re-sults {{show that the}} proposed scheduling approach is amenable under dynamic on-demand time-critical requests, simultaneously achieving a low <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>time</b> and request dead-line miss rate...|$|E

For fast shortcuts (f/F≫ 1) and low shortcut densities, traversal time data collapse onto an universal curve, while a crossover behavior {{that can be}} related to the percolation threshold of the scale-free network component is identified at higher shortcut densities, in analogy to similar observations reported recently in Newman-Watts small-world networks. Furthermore, we observe that random walk traversal times are larger for networks with a higher degree of inhomogeneity in their shortcut distribution, and we discuss <b>access</b> <b>time</b> distributions as functions of the initial and final node degrees. These findings are relevant, in particular, when considering the optimization of existing information networks by the addition of a small number of fast shortcut connections.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} efficient information retrieval in asymmetric communication environments where multiple clients with limited resources retrieve information from a powerful server who periodically broadcasts its information repository over a communication medium. The cost of a retrieving client consists of two components: (a) access time, defined as {{the total amount of}} time spent by a client in retrieving the information of interest, and (b) tuning time, defined as the time spent by the client in actively listening to the communication medium, measuring a certain efficiency in resource usage. A probability distribution is associated with the data items in the broadcast, representing the likelihood of a data item's being requested at any point of time. The problem of indexed data broadcast is to schedule the data items interleaved with certain indexing information in the broadcast so as to minimize simultaneously the <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>time</b> and the mean tuning time. Prior work on this problem thus far has focused only on some special cases.

Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, clinical study performed in a tertiary ED between August 2003 and May 2005 on patients requiring central venous access. Ultrasonographically guided catheters were inserted under real time using the Sonosite ultrasonographic system with a 10 to 5 MHz 38 -mm linear array transducer. Standardized data were collected on operator experience, method of insertion, reason for central venous access, and comorbidities. Outcome measures included successful insertion of an internal jugular vein catheter, number of attempts, <b>access</b> <b>times,</b> and complications. Results: One hundred thirty patients were enrolled. Cannulation of the internal jugular vein was successful in 61 of 65 patients (93. 9 %) using ultrasonography and in 51 of 65 patients (78. 5 %) using the landmark technique, a significant difference of 15. 4 % (P!. 009, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 8 % to 27. 0 %). Fifty of 61 (82. 0 %) of the successful ultrasonographically guided catheters were inserted on the first attempt compared with 36 of 51 (70. 6 %) of the successful landmark catheters. <b>Mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>times</b> to venipuncture and successful insertion were 138 and 281 seconds by ultrasonographic guidance and 132 and 271 seconds by the landmark technique. There was a 10. 8 % complication rate, with 11 complications (16. 9 %) in the landmark group and 3 (4. 6 %) in the ultrasonographic group, a difference of 12. 3 % (95 % CI 1. 9 % to 22. 8 %).

Recently {{the emergence of a}} multi-channel broadcast paradigm has attracted much research attention in the data broadcast community.

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} aortic arch calcification and it’s relationship with procedural times, angiographic recanalization, and discharge outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing endovascular treatment. Methods—The thoracic component of computed tomographic (CT) angiogram were reviewed by an inde-pendent reviewer to determine presence of any calcification; and the severity of calcification was graded as follows: mild, single small calcifications; moderate, multiple small calcifications; or severe, one or more large calcifications. Results—Aortic arch calcification was present in 120 (62. 4 %) of 188 patients and severity was graded as mild (n= 24), moderate (n= 44), and severe (n= 52). Compared with patients without calcification, the <b>mean</b> intracranial <b>access</b> <b>time</b> (minutes ± SD) was similar among patients with aortic arch calcification (70 ± 31 versus 64 ± 31, p= 0. 9). The <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> intracranial <b>access</b> <b>time</b> increased with increasing severity of aortic arch calcification (61 ± 27, 67 ± 29, and 74 ± 34, p= 0. 3). Patients with aortic arch calcification had similar rates of complete or partial recanalization [85 (71 %) versus 50 (76 %) ], p= 0. 6) but lower rates of favorable outcomes [modified Rankin scale 0 – 2] at discharge 27 (22 %) versus 26 (39 %), p= 0. 02). Conclusions—A high proportion of acute ischemic stroke patients have aortic arch calcification which is associated with lower rates of favorable outcome following endovascular treatment.

During the past few years, monitoring of central venous pressure has become an important aid in the management of critically ill patients. Doppler ultrasound was first used to assist central venous catheter insertion in 1984. Ultrasound has been applied to describe the anatomy of the IJV and to evaluate various techniques for percutaneous cannulation. Real time sonography improves access to the vein compared with the traditional method. Ultrasound guided cannulation limits complications and also the decreases the cannulation time. For reducing the complication in traditional method we have conducted the study through ultrasound guide and observed the complications in new method.

OBJECTIVE [...] To assess the influence of age at and type and technique of previous cardiac catheterisation on the ease of vascular access for subsequent study of paediatric and adolescent patients. SETTING [...] Tertiary referral centre for paediatric cardiology. PATIENTS [...] 478 Consecutive patients aged 1 day to 19 years undergoing cardiac catheterisation over a 12 month period, including 131 patients who had had previous catheterisation(s). METHODS [...] Prospective study, recording for each patient the age, weight, diagnosis, vascular access (artery, vein, or both), vessels eventually catheterised, <b>access</b> <b>time,</b> total duration of the procedure, and details of any previous catheter studies. RESULTS [...] Of 131 patients who had had previous catheterisations, 80 (61 %) had been studied once previously, 38 (29 %) twice, and 13 (10 %) on three or more occasions. The right femoral vessels were cannulated without difficulty in 72 cases (55 %). Elective cannulation of left femoral vessels (because of scar tissue on the right side) or upper body vessels was undertaken in 18 cases (14 %). Problems cannulating the right femoral vessels were encountered in 41 cases (31 %); the vein was blocked in 29, the artery in six and the femoral veins were blocked bilaterally in six cases. The <b>mean</b> (SD) <b>access</b> <b>time</b> was significantly prolonged in these 41 children (41 (18) v 21 (13) minutes, p < 0. 001) as was total duration of the procedure (116 (31) v 94 (34) minutes, p < 0. 001). Children who had had a saphenous vein cut down as neonates subsequently had a blocked ipsilateral femoral vein in 10 / 15 cases (67 %). Risk factors for problematic cannulation also included a higher number of previous catheterisation procedures. CONCLUSIONS [...] Difficulties with vascular access are common in children and adolescents who have had previous cardiac catheterisations.

The canonical class of such moves are the subtree-prune-regraft (SPR) moves that remove a subtree and reattach it somewhere else via the cut {{edge of the}} subtree. Phylogenetic trees and such moves naturally form the vertices and edges of a graph, such that tree search algorithms perform a (potentially stochastic) traversal of this SPR graph. Despite the centrality of such graphs in phylogenetic inference, rather {{little is known about}} their large-scale properties. In this paper we learn about the rooted-tree version of the graph, known as the rSPR graph, by calculating the Ricci-Ollivier curvature for pairs of vertices in the rSPR graph with respect to two simple random walks on the rSPR graph. By proving theorems and direct calculation with novel algorithms, we find a remarkable diversity of different curvatures on the rSPR graph for pairs of vertices separated by the same distance.

Some examples of strategies supported by databases in mobile computing include location dependent queries, long-lived transactions that require migration of data into the portable devices, form-based transactions, and online information report. Within a mobile computing environment, {{the need for a}} realtime database management model is strong, because one of the basic requirements in mobile data management is to provide real-time response to transactions of the underlying strategies. However, the resource constraints of mobile computing systems make it difficult to satisfy timing requirements of supported strategies. Low bandwidth, unreliable wireless links, and frequent disconnections increase the overhead of communication between mobile hosts and fixed hosts of the system. There are many situations in which we need to incorporate real-time constraints in broadcasting systems for mobile environments. In this paper, we study broadcast scheduling strategies for pushbased broadcast with timing constraints in the form of deadlines. Unlike previously proposed scheduling algorithms for broadcast systems which aim to minimize the <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>time,</b> our goal is to identify scheduling algorithms for broadcast systems that ensure requests meet their deadlines. We present a study of the performance of traditional real-time strategies and mobile broadcasting strategies, and demonstrate that traditional realtime algorithms do not always perform the best in a mobile environment. We propose a multichannel model based on pushbased real-time broadcast system and also provide an efficient scheduling algorithm, called dynamic adjustment with time constraint (DATC), which is designed for timely delivery of data to mobile clients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nomadic Service {{has emerged}} rapidly as an {{exciting}} new paradigm {{that offers a}} challenging model of cyber-physical services and poses fascinating problems regarding distributed resource management, ranging from information sharing to cooperative computing. This special issue is intended to foster state-of-the-art {{research in the area}} of nomadic services and related applications, cloud computing technologies and services, including the topics of collaboration environment, implementation and execution of real-world architectures, and novel applications associated with this new paradigm. The published papers are expected to present high quality results for tackling problems arising from the ever-growing cloud computing technologies. The issue will serve as a landmark source for education, information, and reference to professors, researchers and graduate students interested in updating their knowledge about or active in cloud computing technologies and services. Nine papers are included in this special issue.     In the first paper entitled “Broadcasting Data Items with Time Constraints Based on On-Demand Multichannel in Ubiquitous Environments”, Dr. Ding-Jung Chiang and Timothy K. Shih proposes mobile services with time constraints in ubiquitous computing environments based on on-demand multichannel broadcasting. This study provides on-line scheduling strategies for mobile data with timing constraint on multichannel broadcasting environments based on on-demand mode. The goal of this study ensures the most requests meeting their deadlines, which differs from previously proposed scheduling algorithms that aim to minimize the <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>time.</b> The experimental results show the proposed algorithm, called on-demand broadcast program with time constraint (BPTC), outperforms miss rate for data timely delivery to mobile clients.     In order to illustrate a real-time hand gesture recognition system by using shape context matching and cost matrix, the second paper entitled “Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition by Shape Context Based Matching and Cost Matrix” by Prof. Lawrence Y. Deng, Jason C. Hung, Huan-Chao Keh, Lin Kun-Yi, Yi-Jen Liu, and Nan-Ching Huang tried to develop a perceptual interface for human-computer-interaction based on real-time hand gesture recognition. User could interact with computer program by performing body gesture instead of physical contact. The image of hand gesture was captured from CCD. The hand gesture image was transformed into proper instruction according to the shape information respectively.     Prof. Jiung-yao Huang, Huan-Chao Keh, Wai Shu-Shen, Ji-jen Wu, and Chung-Hsien Tsai purposed to enable users in a physical place to receive ubiquitous services from the environment while they communicate with each other unwittingly. In the third paper entitled “Research of Place-based 3 D Augmented Community-Taking The 3 D Virtual Campus as an Example”, with the help of the augmented reality technique, on-the-spot member can visually sense the remote users by their representing avatars. To achieve this goal, the ambient communication environment is required to support message flow among the remote users and people on site. The context issues and context-awareness approaches of PDA community are fully discussed in the paper. Finally, the infrastructure of this PDA community is also presented along with preliminary result of the prototyping environment.     “Interactive E-diagnosis: An Efficient Scheme for Medical Diagnosis Supporting System” written by Rong-Chi Chang aims to design a prototype medical diagnostic support system, in which DICOM-based image analysis algorithms are utilized to develop an image browser and graphical user interface (GUI), allowing medical personnel to read X-ray, CT scan, MRI or other medical imaging files via a simple browser interface. The system also combines Internet functionality to provide remote medical diagnosis and patient data query features, all of which are conducive for doctors or medical personnel in different regions to cooperate and get hold of real-time test images and information of the patient. Follow-up studies can seek to incorporate a more convenient patient information entry and update interface into the system for automatic image analysis and information retrieval, where the data can be stored in the patient's personal information for up-to-date medical records.     In “A Web-based E-learning Platform for Physical Education”, Prof. Chun-Hong Huang, Su-Li Chin, Li-Hua Hsin, Jason C. Hung, Yi-Pei Yu developed a Web-based E-learning Platform for physical education. The Platform provides sports related courseware which includes physical motions, exercise rules and first-aid treatment. The courseware is represented using digital multimedia materials which include video, 2 D animation and 3 D virtual reality. The design concept of this project is based on ADDIE model with the five basic phases of analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Via the usage of this Web-based E-learning platform, user can learn the relative knowledge about sports at anytime and in everyplace. Authors hope to let players perform efficient self learning for sports skills, indirectly foster mutual help, cooperation, nice norms of law-abiding via the learning of exercise rules, and become skilled at accurate recreation knowledge and first-aid expertise.     Prof. Shih-Yang Yang, Ching-Ming Chao, Po-Zung Chen and Chu-Hao Sun proposed the ICspan algorithm to continue mining sequential patterns through an incremental approach and to acquire a more accurate mining result. In addition, due to the algorithm constraint in closed sequential patterns mining, the generation and records for sequential patterns will be reduced, leading to a decrease of memory usage and to an effective increase of execution efficiency. In the sixth paper entitled “Incremental Mining of Closed Sequential Patterns in Multiple Data Streams”, the experiment results also support that ICspan algorithm will effectively reduce the sequential pattern records and consequently reducing the memory usage, while maintaining a sound mining efficiency under continuous data entries.     “Developing a Web-based and Competition-based Quiz Game Environment to Improve Student Motivation” written by Prof. Kuan-Cheng Lin, Ting-Kuan Wu and Yu-Bin Wang. In this study, authors develop a web-based and competition-based multi-player quiz game environment (WCMQGE) by incorporating DGBL into the web-based e-learning system. During the process of the game, the WCMQGE system can help players (students) review what they learned from school and use their knowledge to compete with their peers.     In “Using Active RFID to Realize Ubi-media System”, Prof. Jason C. Hung purposed a human computer interface which is based on Active Radio frequency identification (Active RFID) technique to let human communicate with computer by analyzing the signal from tags. For retrieving those signals from tags, how to decreasing the noises created by surrounding environment and detecting useful information from variant signals are the most important. Author adopted a train procedure as pre-processing to categorize all of signals into two categories: noise and real data. After the real data is retrieved, we use “Music Director” and “DJ Scratch” as applications to let user play with computer.     In the ninth paper entitled “On the Design of A Contribution-based, Flexible Locality-Aware P 2 P Streaming Network”, Yu-Wei Chan proposed the design of a two layered hybrid tree-push/mesh-pull overlay network with considering the problems of locality-aware of peers and incentive schemes. Prof. Chan proposed the schemes and algorithms to overcome the mismatch problem between the overlay network and the physical network, reduce the transmission latency, and provide a fully cooperative and reliable P 2 P streaming environment.  </p...|$|E
