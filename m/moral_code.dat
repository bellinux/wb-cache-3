His teachings concentrate on a <b>moral</b> <b>code</b> of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru.

Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous <b>moral</b> <b>code</b> of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her <b>moral</b> <b>code</b> because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{agree that}} societal-level <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> that promote social trust also promote wealth creation.   However, what {{specific}} kinds of societal-level <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> promote social trust?  Also, by what specific kind of competitive process does social trust promote wealth creation?  Because societal-level <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> {{are composed of}} or formed from peoples’ personal <b>moral</b> <b>codes,</b> this article explores a theory of ethics, known as the “Hunt-Vitell” theory of ethics, that illuminates the concept of personal <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> and uses the theory to discuss which types of personal <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> foster trust and distrust in society.   This article then uses resource-advantage (R-A) theory, {{one of the most}} completely articulated dynamic theories of competition, to show the process by which trust-promoting, societal-level <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> promote productivity and economic growth.   That is, they promote wealth creation...|$|R

5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities {{and the role of}} women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its <b>moral</b> <b>code</b> with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
5|$|The <b>moral</b> <b>code</b> {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E
40|$|Moral {{rules are}} an {{important}} aspect of culture. Yet to date, no published scale exists to measure the endorsement of different <b>moral</b> <b>codes.</b> We report the development of the Community, Autonomy, and Divinity Scale (CADS), based on Shweder’s <b>moral</b> <b>codes,</b> as a means to measure cross-cultural, subcultural, and individual differences in the contents of morality. Scale development, confirmatory factor analysis, and convergent and discriminant validity are reported in Studies 1 and 2, as well as analysis for structural invariance and meaningful differences across British and Brazilian cultural contexts. The authors find the CADS to be a reliable and valid scale, thereby enabling the cross-cultural quantitative study of similarities and differences in endorsement of <b>moral</b> <b>codes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper, conceptually mainly {{informed}} by Michel Foucault’s notion of morality, ethics, and ethical practice, illustrates the power {{program and the}} <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> which currently govern the professional field of the arts. Building on empirical material {{from the field of}} theatre, the paper discusses how the <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> and subject ideals that are promoted through the ‘culturepreneurial’ program affect and shape the subjectivity of artists and their specific modes of organizing ethical relations to self and others (Foucault 1984, 1986). The insights of the study emphasize that subjectification presents a dynamic and precarious process. Discursively promoted <b>moral</b> <b>codes</b> are used by the artists in a variety of ways; they are accepted, undermined, and re-created. While doing so, artistic professionals contribute to both their own subjection and in-subordination...|$|R

5|$|The Friday the 13th novella storyline was not {{connected}} to the Jason X series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character of Jason in its own way. Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in Friday the 13th: Hell Lake. In Hate-Kill-Repeat, two religious serial killers attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that {{the three of them}} share the same contempt for those that break the <b>moral</b> <b>code.</b> In The Jason Strain, Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in Carnival of Maniacs. Pamela is in search of Jason, who is now part of a traveling sideshow and about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.|$|E
5|$|Before Burebista became king, the Dacians {{experienced}} {{a succession of}} kings through the period of 450 to 60 BC. The kings included Dromichaetes, Oroles and Rubobostes {{in the third and}} second centuries BC. From the 4th century BC to the 2nd century BC the La Tène Celts of the Danube, Alpines and Balkans influenced the Dacian culture. La Tène material culture was found in the central and north-west of Dacia. The development of a La Tène based economy in 3rd–2nd century BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found both among the Transylvanian Dacians under the rule of Rubobostes, and the Moldavian and Wallachian Getae in Argedava. It is from the La Tène that the Dacians were introduced to the potter's wheel, superior metal-working techniques and probably a tradition of coinage. Homes were a combination of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and certain Celtic style graves contain Dacian style vessels. This suggests a sort of co-existence and fusion between the cultures. Sometime after around 150 BC, however, evidence of La Tène culture peters out, around the same time the Dacian culture began to mature as evidenced by population and economic growth. Under Rubobstes the authority of the Dacians appears to have increased, thus ending the dominance of the Celtic culture, and leading to the Celts being expelled from the area or merged into the culture, or both at once. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that relations between Dacians and Celts living in the areas north and west of Dacia continued. Painted ceramics of late La Tène-style have been found in Dacian sites in west and central Dacia. Some of these were imported while others were made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic style. A stable monarchy, however, only developed when Burebista became king. Burebista's accession came with the expulsion of Celts around 60 BC when his forces moved through to the middle Danube region, and {{with the support of the}} religious establishment and leaders in Dacia which brought around a stricter <b>moral</b> <b>code</b> in the Dacian kingdom. Around this time pottery of the Dacian style began appearing in Celtic settlements in Central Europe, including former Yugoslavia including in Gomolava, Yugoslavia and Budapest, Hungary.|$|E
