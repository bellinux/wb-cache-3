5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E

The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy also {{blamed the}} capitalists for their control of machineries, {{creating}} difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, {{which has to}} lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge. An example he gave was the West sending <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him.

5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, {{timed to}} explode in mid-air, were used to send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih or Illustrated Military Encyclopedia written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill {{is sent to the}} governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E

In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E
