40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining {{is not well}} defined in South Africa; {{therefore}} this dissertation investigates the lack of rules in <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining and the possible development of a <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining strategy or policy. Subsequently, the research has resulted in five major actions and consequently {{a summary of the}} research process to identify <b>and</b> formulate a <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining strategy framework. The first action was to evaluate relevant concepts in the <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal environment. It also looked at the policy environment and environmental policy in mining and sustainable development. It was also imperative to evaluate strategy within the <b>marine,</b> coastal <b>and</b> mining environment on both international and national level. This resulted in the second action to analyse these evaluations. Five major gaps in the South African policy environment were identified with specific reference to <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining. The next question was to identify possible solutions for South Africa for these gaps, therefore the third action was aimed at formulating three options to address the <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining gap. The option preferred is a strategy framework to implement a meaningful <b>marine</b> mining <b>and</b> coastal mining strategy. The <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining strategy framework includes: 1) Scope, objectives <b>and</b> principles; 2) <b>Marine</b> mining strategy; 3) Coastal mining strategy; and 4) Implementation strategy. The <b>marine</b> mining strategy <b>and</b> coastal mining strategy do not only identify actions but also identify the introduction of joint authority approach, further research, development of specific technical guidelines and dealing with conflicts. The investigation concludes by elaborating on the process followed and achieving the research goal of a strategy. The investigation is finally rounded off by formulating five recommendations which should be considered and executed by the Department of Minerals and Energy. It includes {{the development and implementation of}} the <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining strategy framework, conduct research on <b>marine</b> mining <b>and</b> coastal mining matters, develop guidelines for both <b>marine</b> mining <b>and</b> coastal mining, initiate the development of future rules for <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal mining, and also initiate the development of mine environmental policy and an exclusive economic zone strategy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis adopts an {{interdisciplinary}} approach. It examines {{the development of}} <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal policy in Indonesia and explores how well Indonesia is governing its <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal space and resources and with what effects and consequences. This thesis uses a policy analysis framework, with legislative and institutional activity as the basic unit of analysis. Three factors are identified as having been the major influences {{on the evolution of}} <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal policy in Indonesia. These are international law, <b>marine</b> science <b>and</b> “state of the art” <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal management. The role of these factors in the management of the coastal zone, living <b>and</b> non-living <b>marine</b> resources, <b>marine</b> science <b>and</b> technology, the <b>marine</b> environment <b>and</b> relevant international relations are analysed and discussed in the Indonesian case. This thesis concludes that Indonesia’s major challenges in terms of sustainable <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal development are (a) to establish an appropriate management regime, and (b) to formulate and implement a combination of measures in order to attain the objectives of sustainable development. The basic problem is the fact that currently, Indonesia is not a “marine oriented” nation. Therefore, <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal affairs are not {{at the top of the}} public policy agenda. Principles of international instruments have influenced the establishment of <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal policy and management in Indonesia. However, in the implementation of sound management practices, Indonesia faces many challenges. The distinctive characteristics of Indonesia as an archipelagic nation underpin the basic philosophy of <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal policy and management. With the increasing priority of <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal policy in national development, science and environmental aspects have been able to play a greater role in policy development. ii A number of lessons can be taken from the Australian experience that may have some relevance to how Indonesia meets the challenges of implementing its new <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal policy. For example, Indonesia needs to follow the lead of Australia, establishing national principles, goals and objectives for the sustainable of Indonesia’s <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal resources and the conservation, protection and restoration of the <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal environment. The solution for major <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal management problems between federal and states, such as Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) and Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE), offer an attractive alternative for the implementation of regional autonomy in Indonesia. Also, there is a need for multi-stakeholder involvement throughout the policy development process. In readiness for the 21 st Century, the Guidelines of State Policy (GBHN) 1999 stated a shift of paradigm from ‘terrestrial oriented’ towards ‘marine oriented’ development. Indonesia started to give more priority to <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal development and now faces the challenges posed by the transition from issue analysis and planning to the implementation of policies. One way or the other, it is reasonable to conclude that new forces and new needs are likely to bring change <b>and</b> improvement to <b>marine</b> <b>and</b> coastal governance in Indonesia over the next decade or so. ii...|$|R
