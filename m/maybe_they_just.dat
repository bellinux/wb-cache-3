Matt from Dick Army started this band, {{and to say that}} I was looking forward to it would be a huge understatement. It lived up to my expectations. Where Dick Army mostly played simple, sloppy three-chord punk, FOUR DEADLY QUESTIONS sound a lot more oiriginal and hard-to-pin-down. It's still fun and scrappy, to be sure, and it's not like they turned into Hawkwind or anything, but the choppy rhythms and female backups make this stand out a whole lot. Me likey.|$|R

30|$|Both {{the boys}} (n =  10) and girls (n =  10) {{expressed}} concern over exposing {{parts of their}} bodies. For these participants, they were concerned that their clothes were too tight, too short, or too revealing based on material or cut of the garments. Much of this concern centered on movement during physical activity. For example, Imani explained, “Whenever I lift my hand up to catch the ball my shirt will go up. Sometimes when I lifted my hand my shirt goes up and all my stuff hangs out. It worries me a lot”. Other participants felt that the fit of their clothes exposed their bodies. Amaka stated, “Well, if my clothes are too tight then <b>maybe</b> because <b>they</b> <b>just</b> press against me and it shows like my rolls and stuff like that. I get uncomfortable. I {{do not like to}} wear those clothes because it shows”.|$|R
5000|$|..... We didn't sing it anymore, {{my father}} and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used {{to come back to}} me a lot. Being older, I began to {{understand}} the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it's an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer's lover must {{have had something to do}} with the killing, or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> were <b>just</b> going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That's weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it's not until the third verse that 'The Hanging Tree' begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He's still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she's coming to meet him. The phrase 'Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free' is the most troubling because at first you think he's talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it's clear that that's what he's waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.|$|R

40|$|Holocaust is a {{major event}} that strike world’s history. It has been the content of {{literature}} and many authors have taken {{us back to the}} horrors of holocaust, to terrifying labor camps. In my essay, I wanted to examine the different techniques that the authors used and their effects on the conveyance of the horrors of the holocaust to their respective audiences. I started with choosing two novels that have taken holocaust from two different points. I examined “how effective are “Schindler’s List” and “The Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas” in conveying the horrors of the holocaust to their respective audiences? Compare the techniques used by the authors to achieve their aims. ” “Schindler’s List”, considers the suffer that the Jews had to endure, signifies the importance of real life heroes by giving the message; “you can always find a light in the darkness. ” Opposed to that, I chose a children’s novel {{in order to make a}} comparison about the language and the metaphors used. “Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas” shows how ignorant people can be to the world around them, or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> choose to close their eyes; except the children. The novel shows how for children, nationality and sex does not matter, what matter is the common interests that they share. In both books I examined the themes and the symbols that are used in order to touch the inner conscience of the readers. Despite the different natures of the books, both of them set up an ironic scene by creating a German savior for the Jews. Even though the techniques they use are different, both of the books give the message that holocaust has destroyed many lives and no matter what the age is a hero can rise...|$|E
40|$|Improved hive {{management}} Cue: Beehives come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. Traditional beehives are often made from hollowed out logs. A more modern type of beehive is the top-bar beehive, {{and the most}} sophisticated beehive is called a Langstroth beehive. This was designed by an American, the Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth, back in 1851. One {{of the advantages of}} the Langstroth hive is that the bees construct their honeycombs in frames which can be removed from the hive. This allows beekeepers to extract the honey without damaging the honeycomb, and then put the comb back into the hive. As a result, they can make more harvests each year, and get top quality honey. However, Langstroth hives are also more difficult to make. Carpenters may need specialised equipment and training, as the measurements of the structures in the hive must be extremely accurate. Many attempts to introduce Langstroth hives in Africa, particularly among rural communities, have failed. One organisation that has had some success however, is Honey Care Africa, which not only manufactures the hives, but also trains community members in beekeeping skills. Eric Kadenge visited their workshop in Nairobi, and spoke to operations manager Margaret Mimoh about their work. IN:		?This is the workshop, this is where ? OUT:		?are going to a group in Mount Kenya. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Margaret Mimoh, operations manager for Honey Care Africa, an organisation that promotes sustainable community beekeeping in East Africa. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	This is the workshop, this is where we do the manufacture of hives and we are promoting Langstroth beehives. But when it comes to marketing, we are also helping or supporting the farmers who have different, other types of hives, through our own training, and we help them to improve on the techniques in handling the honey so that they come up with quality honey that conforms to the requirements of the market. Kadenge	Now why do you specifically concentrate or promote Langstroth beehives? Mimoh	Because we came to realise that Langstroth beehives give quality honey and also the production in Langstroth hive is a bit high as compared to the other hives. And especially it is women friendly, because the women can also take up beekeeping. Kadenge	What makes it more friendly to women? Mimoh	Because when it comes to inspections, the hives are placed on hanging stands, which are a bit lower compared to the log hives which were being placed up on top of trees and women cannot climb on top of trees to do inspections. And it is also next to the homestead, and it is very easy for women to carry out inspections. Kadenge	So take us through some of the steps that one needs to take. Mimoh	In fact what has to happen is the beekeeper has to ensure that he has the right equipment to help him manage the hives effectively. So we are talking in terms of the bee suit which is the protective clothing, and we have the smoker, we have the protective gloves and we have the gumboots. So he puts them on and goes to the hive, opening up the hive and checking inside to know what is the progress in the hive, and this will give him the indication of what to do next. Kadenge	And when it comes to observation, what do you need to observe and at what times? Mimoh	Normally inspection is done in the evening because the bees are quite cool at that particular time. So what will happen is, once the farmer goes to the hive in the evening, he has to check the strength of the colony. In that case he will also even see the laying pattern of the queen, which will give him an indication of whether the queen is active or not active. Because if the queen is not active then the laying pattern is so poorly done and the colony is so weak, so getting some good amounts of honey becomes a problem and also the building pattern of the bees becomes too slow. Kadenge	In the event that the laying patterns are poor, what would the farmer need to do? Mimoh	He will definitely know that the colony is a bit weak so he can also do the merging of the colonies or re-queening of the hive. Kadenge	Any other thing that the farmer would observe? Mimoh	If the farmer observes things like pests, he will definitely know what is the remedy I have to take or the action I have to take against this. In case of ants, crawling ants, he should definitely manage his apiary by cutting long grass. He can put also some ash or used oil around the post or modify a pond of water around the post so that the bees can use the water and the pests can drown in the water. Kadenge	Is there any other thing {{that you would like to}} add regarding management of beehives? Mimoh	If you don?t manage your hives then don?t expect a harvest. And this has been a practice that has been taken into account by most of the beekeepers who are born beekeepers. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> hang their hive, wait for six months and think that they are going to get honey out of it. But we have realised, or that is a challenge we have faced, if you don?t manage your hive very well you don?t get the honey. And you find that is why we are saying the Langstroth hive is women friendly, and the women are really doing very well. And in this case you find that they really take into account the inspections of the hive. And the moment they do that, they are really assured of the harvest and the quality of the honey they produced and the income that is going to be generated from that. You are also promoting nutrition within the families, because they get to know the value of using honey as a nutritional factor within the communities. Kadenge	So how many hives do you manufacture in this particular room in a given time? Mimoh	What I would say is that we work in partnership with non governmental organisations, community based organisations and even the government of Kenya. So what happens with the NGOs and the community groups on the ground, they would give us an order of the hives. So let?s say they have given us an order for 200 hives. We would take even two weeks to manufacture it and send it out. Kadenge	So right now we are looking at how many hives here? Mimoh	Right now we have three hundred. Kadenge	And they are destined to go where? Mimoh	About fifty of them are going to a group in Sudan and some are going to a group in western Kenya and some are going to a group in Mount Kenya. End of track. What beekeepers need to look for when they are inspecting their hives...|$|E
