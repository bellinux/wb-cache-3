40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to document laboratory testing of <b>magnesium</b> <b>mono</b> potassium phosphate grouts for P-Reactor vessel in-situ decommissioning. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>mono</b> potassium phosphate cement-based grout was identified as candidate material for filling (physically stabilizing) the 105 -P Reactor vessel (RV) because it is less alkaline than portland cement-based grout (pH of about 12. 4). A less alkaline material ({<=} 10. 5) was desired to address a potential materials compatibility issue caused by corrosion of aluminum metal in highly alkaline environments such as that encountered in portland cement grouts. Information concerning access points into the P-Reactor vessel and amount of aluminum metal in the vessel is provided elsewhere. Fresh and cured properties were measured for: (1) commercially blended <b>magnesium</b> <b>mono</b> potassium phosphate packaged grouts, (2) commercially available binders blended with inert fillers at SRNL, (3) grouts prepared from technical grade MgO and KH{sub 2 }PO{sub 4 } and inert fillers (quartz sands, Class F fly ash), and (4) Ceramicrete{reg_sign} <b>magnesium</b> <b>mono</b> potassium phosphate-based grouts prepared at Argonne National Laboratory.

It crystallizes in the triclinic system, {{space group}} P 1, Z = 1, {{with the following}} unit-cell-parameters: a = 7. 0026 (2) angstrom, b 7. 3297 (2) angstrom, c = 7. 7885 (3) angstrom, a = 81. 229 (1) degrees, beta = 71. 064 (1) degrees, gamma = 88. 172 (1) degrees, V = 373. 64 (2) angstrom(3). The structure was obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, and a full-matrix least-squares refinement based on F- 2 gave a final R- 1 index of = 0. 0447 (wR(2) = 0. 1336), utilizing 2055 observed reflections with I > 2 sigma(I). The crystal packing consists in a three-dimensional network made by layers parallel to ab plane of ZnO 6 octahedra sharing four vertices with H 2 P 2 O 7 double tetrahedra: (NH 4) (+) cations fill up the cavities between tetrahedra and octahedra; strong hydrogen bonds stabilize the framework. The dihydrogendiphosphate anion (H 2 P 2 O 7) (2 -) shows bent eclipsed conformation and the Zn 2 + ion lies on inversion centre. Raman and infrared spectra of (NH 4) (2) Zn(H 2 P 2 O 7) (2) - 2 H 2 O have been collected and interpreted using factor group analysis. No coincidences observed between most of Raman and IR spectral bands confirmed the centrosymmetric structure of the title compound; the vibrational spectra point to a bent POP bridge angle...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} 48 canine cystine urinary stones were determined by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron dispersive X-ray analysis. The infrared analysis showed that about 45 % of the specimens were composed of pure cystine.

The infrared study of several samples heated at 620 degrees C and 750 degrees C revealed the presence of apatitic calcium phosphate. This compound was difficult to detect in the spectrum of the original samples due to the small proportion of phosphate contained in the calculi and to band overlapping.
