5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its towering Buddhist pagodas, enormous stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces.

40|$|Character {{association}} studies {{among various}} vegetative and reproductive trains in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) are important, {{because of the}} subterranean nature of pod development. Ninety-seven advanced generation selections derived from intersubspecific and intrasubspecific crosses were grown under high and low fertility environments for two years at ICRISAT to study the association among sixteen vegetative and reproductive traits.

5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts <b>maturing</b> first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees {{actually}} accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E
5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's <b>maturing</b> and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|Different {{authors have}} {{variously}} reported the birth length at between , and the maturation length at between , with females usually <b>maturing</b> at a slightly larger size than males. This range of sizes may reflect life history differences in crossback stingarees across {{different parts of}} its range. Both sexes mature at around six years of age, and can live to at least 11 years. The crossback stingaree may hybridize naturally with the closely related yellowback stingaree off southern New South Wales, where the distributions of the two species overlap and apparent hybrid offspring with intermediate color patterns have been found. If true, this would represent {{one of the few}} known cases of hybridization among cartilaginous fishes.|$|E

40|$|Two <b>mature</b> {{female and}} three <b>mature</b> males were sampled by {{trawling}} with a pelagic trawl at depths {{of more than}} 800 m off northem Norway. A third female were sampled with bottom trawl at 970 m off mid Norway. The females had a flabby, swollen appearance and degenerated tentacles and from 5 to 12 <b>mature</b> eggs on the ovary. The <b>mature</b> eggs had a largest diameter varying from 4 to 6 mm. The females were all larger than the <b>mature</b> males and the smallest had a DML of 260 mm. The females seems to <b>mature</b> at lengths between 200 and 250 mm. The <b>mature</b> males had spermatophores, 7 to 9 mm long, in the spermatophoric sac and in the penis, showing {{that they had not}} copulated. The smallest male had a DML of 190 mm. The males seems to <b>mature</b> at smaller length than the females. Assuming the same growth rate as observed at West Greenland, Gonatus fabricii seems to <b>mature</b> at an age of 2 to 2, 5 years. Other recordings of larger <b>mature</b> males could indicate a second mating at an age of three years. The recordings of <b>mature</b> females at bottom indicate spawning at bottom. Recordings of <b>mature</b> females from summer to end of November indicate that spawning takes at least place during this period. The recordings of <b>mature</b> females at bottom indicate spawning at bottom. Recordings of <b>mature</b> females with emty spermatophores more than 500 m above bottom arise questions of a second mating or pelagic spawning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRat eosinophils contain eosinophil-associated ribonucleases (Ears) {{in their}} granules. Ears {{are thought to}} be {{synthesized}} as pre-forms and stored in the granules as <b>mature</b> forms. However, the N-terminal amino acid of <b>mature</b> Ear- 1 and Ear- 2 is still controversial. Therefore, we prepared two recombinant <b>mature</b> forms of Ear- 1 and Ear- 2 in which the N-terminal amino acids are Ser 24 (S) [Ear- 1 (S) and Ear- 2 (S) ] and Gln 26 (Q) [Ear- 1 (Q) and Ear- 2 (Q) ], and analyzed their biological activities by comparing them with those of pre-form Ear- 1 and pre-form Ear- 2. The four <b>mature</b> Ears showed RNase A activity as well as bovine pancreatic RNase A activity, but pre-Ear- 1 and pre-Ear- 2 showed no RNase A activity. <b>Mature</b> Ear- 1 (Q) and <b>mature</b> Ear- 2 (Q) showed more potent RNase A activity than <b>mature</b> Ear- 1 (S) and <b>mature</b> Ear- 2 (S), respectively. The RNase A activities of <b>mature</b> Ear- 1 (Q) and <b>mature</b> Ear- 2 (Q) were reduced by treatment at 96 °C for 20 min or with RNase inhibitor. The growth of Escherichia coli was inhibited by both pre-Ears and <b>mature</b> Ears in a concentration-dependent manner, and was almost completely suppressed at 1. 0 μM. The bactericidal activities of <b>mature</b> Ear- 1 (Q) and <b>mature</b> Ear- 2 (Q) were not inhibited by RNase inhibitor, but was increased by treatment at 96 °C for 20 min...|$|R
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds.

5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded <b>maturing</b> three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for <b>maturing</b> Cheddar cheese.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts referring to a gardener and the purchase of some seeds.

5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered.

5|$|Two {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, {{referred to as}} the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8and 3.0million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte magmas to erupt during the pre-explosive phase suggest they were relatively fluid as shown by their areal extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a <b>maturing</b> plumbing system underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, cupola-type magma chambers.|$|E
