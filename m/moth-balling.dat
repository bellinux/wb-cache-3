40|$|Purpose: This paper {{reflects}} {{on the notion of}} flexibility {{from the perspective of the}} major liner operators in the container shipping sector and asks how flexible strategies can be deployed to maintain the stability of the maritime component in the international supply chain. Flexibility strategies which may be adopted by liner operators to better adapt to the commercial scenario they face are identified (developed from Naim et al’s (2006) typology of transport flexibility). From this foundation the principal flexibility types which may be used to restrict supply capacity by container shipping companies in their attempts to restore a better equilibrium to the market for international container shipping movement are explored. Research approach: The study will use secondary data taken from industry sources to reflect the empirical developments taking place in the sector to address this. Knowledge will also be supplemented by a case study based on a semi-structured interview with the UK Managing Director of a leading shipping logistics company. Findings and Originality: Naim et al’s (2006) typology of definitions for transport flexibility (internal types), are refined in the context of container liner shipping. Contributions include a revised menu of flexibility method/tools for use by container liner shipping operators and three new flexibility types:  Horizontal Inter-organisational Flexibility - the degree to which the use of infrastructure can be coordinated between users (previously this was part of Naim et al’s (2006) Temporal flexibility type)  Mobility Flexibility – the ability to re-deploy a transport asset – for container liner shipping this includes an ability to switch container ships to other shipping lanes  Ownership Flexibility – the ability to utilise outsourced agents to minimise risk of under-utilisation of asset exposure – in shipping this involves the degree to which chartering arrangements can be set up. On examining the flexibility types it is found that although certain flexibility tactics have been deployed, for example, Ownership Flexibility through chartering, Capacity Flexibility via <b>moth-balling</b> and other tactics and Temporal Flexibility by delaying new builds, these largely reactive strategies have not been enough to stabilise the supply side of the market. Research impact: The paper adds to the understanding of flexibility application in transport and logistics with particular reference to the container liner shipping industry. Practical impact: The liner companies lost around 11 billion for 2009. A more refined understanding of how flexibility tactics can be deployed to contain future losses and inform future strategy development is highly relevant to the operators in this sector...|$|E

25|$|Belfast's skyline {{is still}} {{dominated}} today by Harland & Wolff's famous twin gantry cranes, Samson and Goliath, built in 1974 and 1969 respectively. There is also speculation about a resurgence in {{the prosperity of}} the shipyard thanks to the company's diversification into emerging technologies, particularly in renewable energy development, such as offshore wind turbine and tidal power construction, which may {{provide an opportunity to}} further improve the company's fortunes in the long term. For example, the United Kingdom planned to build 7,500 new offshore wind turbines between 2008 and 2020, creating great demand for heavy assembly work. Unlike land-based wind turbines, where assembly occurs on site, offshore wind turbines have part of their assembly done in a shipyard, and then construction barges transport the tower sections, rotors, and nacelles to the site for final erection and assembly. As a result of this, in late 2007, the 'Goliath' gantry crane was re-commissioned, having been <b>moth-balled</b> in 2003 {{due to the lack of}} heavy-lifting work at the yard.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{suggest that}} Zetsche's tenure was a mixed success, with Chrysler still relying heavily on gas-guzzling SUVs, {{and most of}} its product lineup was unsuccessful, despite using Mercedes-derived technologies. Despite radical {{restructuring}} and improved models, analysts said that it was difficult to expect a solid recovery at Chrysler, due to the negative dynamics of the U.S. auto market and Chrysler's legacy labor and health care costs. In 2006, Zetsche had starred in the [...] "Dr. Z" [...] ad campaign which cast him as an all-knowing, German-accented wizard of the auto industry, in TV spots and a website. The strategy was to communicate that Chrysler was backed up by the same Teutonic know-how and discipline that has long made Mercedes-Benz one of the world's most prestigious brands. However, the campaign was <b>moth-balled</b> in 2007. Eight years since the merger, most customers did not know that Chrysler was owned by the same company that also produces Mercedes-Benz luxury cars. Some surveyed thought Zetsche was so smooth on screen—even to the point of head-butting a soccer ball perfectly in one take—that he was an actor and not the actual CEO.|$|R

The Southern Region was highly impressed with the [...] "little-ED" [...] JA & JB/class 73 locomotives and were keen to see a higher power locomotive with the same flexibility. In 1965, discussions were opened with English Electric (builders of the production JB/Class 73) to produce a high powered electro-diesel. Originally a centre-cab locomotive was envisaged similar in concept to the Clayton Class 17 but details on this are scant.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} air traffic {{after the war and}} heavier commercial shipping traffic the Ebasco Study recommended that the Coast Guard retain the responsibilities for LORAN stations and ocean stations that had been assumed during the war. The chains of LORAN stations maintained by the Coast Guard were modernized and the utilized by both aircraft and ships for navigation purposes. The ocean station program provided up-to-date weather information and search and rescue for both aircraft and ships in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The initial attempt by the Coast Guard to operate enough stations to satisfy the demands of the airlines and shipping industry failed because of manpower limitations required in the Coast Guard budgets. The situation changed with the [...] rescue of the Bermuda Sky Queen, in September 1947. The Queen was a flying boat that was caught in gale-force winds that caused her to increase fuel consumption and as a result she could not reach her destination. The captain of the aircraft turned around and flew to the Bibb and successfully landed near the cutter. After a rescue lasting for several hours, all aboard the Queen were rescued without injury and Bibb was received in Boston to a hero's welcome. This demonstrated to Congress that the ocean station program was valuable to the fledgling trans-oceanic airline industry and funds were added to the Coast Guard budget to acquire the cutters and manpower needed to operate the program. At Farley's request, the Navy loaned a total of eighteen <b>moth-balled</b> [...] Cascoclass seaplane tenders that would serve as ocean station cutters as well as two [...] cargo ships for supply of LORAN stations. The Army supplied three FS-class cargo ships for the same purpose. Farley was instrumental in establishing and maintaining both post-war plans for LORAN and ocean stations. Development of helicopters as a rescue vehicle continued during Farley's term as Commandant with the establishment of the Rotary Wing Development Unit at Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, British {{engineer}} Frank Haigh {{developed his}} Haigh Report for the Iraqi government which laid out drainage infrastructure for the Mesopotamian Marshes {{in order to}} reclaim the land for agriculture. His report recommended a complex of canals, sluices and dikes on the lower portions of both the Tigris and Euphrates. In 1953, construction began on the Main Outfall Drain, {{also known as the}} Third River, which would drain water from the Central Marshes through a canal and eventually into the Persian Gulf. Construction on the Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station, which would serve to pump the water to a siphon under the Euphrates, did not begin until 1983. A Brazilian contractor worked on the pump station until 1986 when political upheaval forced a construction halt. Construction continued in 1992, the same year the MOD was completed, but was intermittent until 1999 because of flooding and structural failures. Aside from agriculture, the MOD was viewed as a tool for Saddam Hussein to drain the Central Marshes in order to deny a refuge for Shia Muslims after the 1991 uprisings in Iraq.After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded Washington International Inc. a $78 million contract to complete the pump station. The original contract had included digging out the <b>moth-balled</b> pump station along with installing the internal electronic system, nine of the pumps, gates, and completing a major portion of the concrete siphon. Construction began again in August 2005 but problems with concrete and electrical components put the project over budget at $80 million. The increased costs led the Corps of Engineers and U.S. Government to terminate construction at 70% completion and transfer the project to the Government of Iraq. After the Iraq Government agreed, it was transitioned to their control on March 1, 2007. Later, in June 2007, Iraq's Ministry of Water Resources signed grant agreement for $20 million in U.S. funding that would help complete the pump station. The pump station opened on December 1, 2008 and was eventually completed in February 2009 but was originally projected to be completed on December 31, 2007.|$|R

40|$|Between 1906 and 1924 the Conservative party only {{won three}} {{parliamentary}} elections in North-east Wales - the Denbigh Boroughs division twice in 1910 {{and the county}} seat in Flintshire in 1924. Conversely the Liberal party won all the other elections throughout the period, {{with the exception of}} Wrexham which fell to Labour in 1922 and 1923. This, however, says more about the vagaries of the British 'first past the post' electoral system than it does about the true strength of the political parties in the region. Indeed, between 1906 and 1924 the Conservative party never averaged below 39 per cent of the electorate in the constituencies it contested. Given this impressive but unrecognised electoral position, what this study set out to do was to analyse the strength of Conservatism in a region where failure was the norm. The period was chosen because it saw the last Liberal administration in this country, and marked the start of the Conservative dominance of government for much of the twentieth century. It also saw one of the biggest cultural and social upheavals in British history {{with the advent of the}} First World War, and witnessed the enfranchisement of women for the first time. The general election of 1906 returned no Conservatives for Wales. In North Wales a conference was called to examine the situation and evaluate future prospects. This led to a review of party organisation in the region, the intention being not only to attract more working class people and women, but also to lessen the autocratic domination by the landed classes. In 1910 the Conservatives won the Denbigh Boroughs constituency with a large swing against the Liberals, and came very close to winning the Flint Boroughs by-election of 1913. The period of War, 1914 - 1918, saw all political parties <b>moth-balled</b> until the end of hostilities, but during the period of Coalition Government from 1918 to 1922 in which Liberal representation went almost unchallenged in North-east Wales, the Conservatives reorganised their Constituency Associations. By 1924 the landed domination of the party had diminished significantly, and in Flintshire the Conservatives won their first seat in an industrial working class area. Underpinning this success was a long-standing popular support, which after 1906 was better organised and mobilised for the Conservative cause through a variety of loosely attached organisations, societies and clubs. The Primrose League, an organisation that had been founded in 1883 to rally Conservative support, had a very high membership in the region compared to the rest of Wales. For example, the Denbigh Primrose League had over 800 members in 1912. A network of Conservative clubs existed in the region and as early as 1905 a thriving Workingmen's Association had been founded in Wrexham. The Conservative party was also well represented in local government; in Flintshire between 1907 and 1913 it had more county councillors than the Liberal party. In addition, the upheaval of War and the attraction of socialism to the newly enfranchised masses meant that the Conservative party had to widen its appeal to those people who had acquired the vote in 1918. By recruiting women and working class members the Conservative party was able to lay the foundations for a number of parliamentary successes in North-east Wales that lasted until the 1990 s. It is therefore the contention of this thesis that the Conservative party not only survived a very difficult period, but that it emerged a strengthened and invigorated force.

40|$|H{sub 2 }Gen, {{with the}} support of the Department of Energy, {{successfully}} designed, built and field-tested two steam methane reformers with 578 kg/day capacity, which has now become a standard commercial product serving customers in the specialty metals and PV manufacturing businesses. We demonstrated that this reformer/PSA system, when combined with compression, storage and dispensing (CSD) equipment could produce hydrogen that is already cost-competitive with gasoline per mile driven in a conventional (non-hybrid) vehicle. We further showed that mass producing this 578 kg/day system in quantities of just 100 units would reduce hydrogen cost per mile approximately 13 % below the cost of untaxed gasoline per mile used in a hybrid electric vehicle. If mass produced in quantities of 500 units, hydrogen cost per mile in a FCEV would be 20 % below the cost of untaxed gasoline in an HEV in the 2015 - 2020 time period using EIA fuel cost projections for natural gas and untaxed gasoline, and 45 % below the cost of untaxed gasoline in a conventional car. This 20 % to 45 % reduction in fuel cost per mile would accrue even though hydrogen from this 578 kg/day system would cost approximately $ 4. 14 /kg, well above the DOE hydrogen cost targets of $ 2. 50 /kg by 2010 and $ 2. 00 /kg by 2015. We also estimated the cost of a larger, 1, 500 kg/day SMR/PSA fueling system based on engineering cost scaling factors derived from the two H{sub 2 }Gen products, a commercial 115 kg/day system and the 578 kg/day system developed under this DOE contract. This proposed system could support 200 to 250 cars per day, similar to a medium gasoline station. We estimate that the cost per mile from this larger 1, 500 kg/day hydrogen fueling system would be 26 % to 40 % below the cost per mile of untaxed gasoline in an HEV and ICV respectively, even without any mass production cost reductions. In quantities of 500 units, we are projecting per mile cost reductions between 45 % (vs. HEVs) and 62 % (vs ICVs), with hydrogen costing approximately $ 2. 87 /kg, still above the DOE's 2010 $ 2. 50 /kg target. We also began laboratory testing of reforming ethanol, which we showed is currently the least expensive approach to making renewable hydrogen. Extended testing of neat ethanol in micro-reactors was successful, and we also were able to reform E- 85 acquired from a local fueling station for 2, 700 hours, although some modifications were required to handle the 15 % gasoline present in E- 85. We began initial tests of a catalyst-coated wall reformer tube that showed some promise in reducing the propensity to coke with E- 85. These coated-wall tests ran for 350 hours. Additional resources would be required to commercialize an ethanol reformer operating on E- 85, but there is no market for such a product at this time, so this ethanol reformer project was <b>moth-balled</b> pending future government or industry support. The two main objectives of this project were: (1) to design, build and test a steam methane reformer and pressure swing adsorption system that, if scaled up and mass produced, could potentially meet the DOE 2015 cost and efficiency targets for on-site distributed hydrogen generation, and (2) to demonstrate the efficacy of a low-cost renewable hydrogen generation system based on reforming ethanol to hydrogen at the fueling station...|$|R
