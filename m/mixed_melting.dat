40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Achlys triphylla, {{a member}} of a medicinally active family {{containing}} alkaloids, was examined phytochemically to determine its possible value as a source of medicinal agents. Pharmacological testing of the crude ethanol extract exhibited a competitive inhibition of acetylcholine and histamine. Purification of alkaloid 'A' from the crude ethanol extract and subsequent pharmacological testing showed a lack of any biological activity. The alkaloid responded to typical alkaloid reagents and was isolated by means of alumina column chromatography. Preliminary data indicated that the alkaloid's identity was magnoflorine, a quaternary alkaloid commonly occurring in the plants of this family. However, its IR spectrum was different from that of magnoflorine and it could be precipitated from its acidic solution by ammonium hydroxide. Similarly, its iodide salt could not be prepared by the method commonly used for preparing the derivative for quaternary bases. The data suggested the alkaloid may be the tertiary analog of magnoflorine, namely, corytuberine. Co-chromatography and the UV spectrum of alkaloid 'A' and authentic corytuberine showed that the two compounds were not identical. The empirical formula C₁₈H₁₉O₄N was determined for alkaloid 'A' (melting point 243 - 5 °C. decomp.) from elemental analysis and available spectral data. The presence of the simple quaternary base, choline, in the ethanol extract was noted by a characteristic purple coloration with Dragendorff's reagent. This simple base was not isolated, but its identity was established by means of extensive co-spotting experiments. Four different TLC developing systems (three acidic and one alkaline) and four different visualizing reagents were used to identify the choline spots. A carbohydrate was isolated from the ethanol extract. Its identity was concluded to be sucrose from its melting point, its behavior on acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis, and the melting points of its osazone and octa-acetate derivatives.

Bibliography: leaves 51 - 55. ii, 55 l illusThe genus Charpentiera {{belongs to}} the plant family Amaranthaceae and is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiian name of the {{several members of the}} genus is papala. An {{investigation}} for alkaloids in the species Charpentiera obovata Gaud. was undertaken for several reasons. There is a reference to the general use of various species of this family against skin diseases. This {{is an example of the}} general phenomenon that physiological activity is frequently linked to the presence of alkaloids. Secondly, no structural work has been reported in the literature on alkaloids from the plant family Amaranthaceae. Thirdly, the plant family Amaranthaceae is one of several families referred to as the Centrospermae plants. A common characteristic of eight of these families is the unusual occurrence of nitrogenous pigments called betacyanins, structurally different from the other well-known class of pigments, anthocyanins. It was therefore felt that an investigation of the alkaloidal constituents of the species Charpentiera obovata might show whether a structural relationship exists between the alkaloids and the betacyanins. Surprisingly, only one alkaloid could be isolated, and that in a very small yield of ca. 0. 0005 %, by solvent extraction and column chromatography. The alkaloid crystallized as pale yellow needles from an ethanol-acetone-hexane mixture, but could be sublimed to a white feathery substance, m. p. 220 - 221 °. The molecular formula of C 15 H 10 N 2 O 2 was supported by combustion analysis and by mass spectrum. The compound possesses one methoxyl group, one olefinic proton and six aromatic protons as shown by proton magnetic resonance spectrum. This information coupled with the ultraviolet spectrum in methanol sufficed to suggest that the alkaloid was probably 4 -methoxycanthin- 6 -one, the structure of which is shown below. Final confirmation was provided by a synthesis of 4 -methoxycanthin- 6 -one along lines described previously and by comparison of ultraviolet and infrared spectra and of Rf-values (thin-layer chromatogram) and by <b>mixed</b> <b>melting</b> point determination which showed no depression. This is the first instance that this alkaloid, 4 -methoxycanthin- 6 -one has been isolated from natural sources. The significance of this finding to chemotaxonomic study is discussed.

40|$|Since it {{was first}} {{discovered}} that cell elongation in the Avena coleoptile is controlled by a hormone, {{our understanding of the}} nature and rôle of this substance has progressed considerably. Apart from the elucidation of its functions in promoting growth, tropisms, and other reactions of the plant, the chemical nature of the substance has been extensively studied. The active substance produced by cultures of the mold Rhizopus suinus was shown by Nielsen (1930) to be ether-soluble, and by Dolk and Thimann (1932) to be an unsaturated organic acid, decomposed by strong acids but not by alkalies, and readily inactivated by oxidation. Its dissociation constant, as measured by Dolk and Thimann, is 10 ^- 4. 75. Previously, Went (1928) had shown the molecular weight of the active substance in Avena coleoptiles to be about 376. The active substance in human urine was isolated by Kögl and Haagen-Smit (1931) and by Kögl, Haagen-Smit, and Erxleben (1933), and shown to be an acid, C 17 H 28 O(OH) COOH (auxin A), whose lactone is also active, while from malt these workers later isolated (1933) a ketohydroxy acid, C 17 H 28 O(OH) COOH (auxin B), which had the same activity per unit weight. On account of the rather small amount of substance available from Rhizopus cultures, and also since the bulk of the partially purified product was lost through spontaneous inactivation (see section, “Concluding stages”), the chemical investigation of the active substance, begun earlier, was dropped. However, the many experiments on purification which had meanwhile been carried out showed that the active substance from Rhizopus did not behave in quite the same way as that from urine. Recently, however, it was shown by Kögl, Erxleben, and Haagen-Smit (1934) that there is in urine a second active substance, identical with β-indolylacetic acid, and Kögl and Kostermans (1934) showed that the molecular weight of the substance produced by Aspergillus and by Rhizopus is that of β-indolylacetic acid rather than that of the C 18 compounds. Since preparations from Rhixopus have been extensively used for physiological work, both in this laboratory and elsewhere, the exact nature of the active substance is of considerable interest. The present paper will give evidence that the active substance produced by Rhizopus suinus is in fact β-indolylacetic acid. Identification by the preparation of derivatives and by <b>mixed</b> <b>melting</b> points with the pure synthetic substance was not possible on account of the small amount of material available. Nevertheless, the evidence given below is fairly conclusive. The method of purification, since it differs to some extent from that adopted by Kögl and his coworkers, will also be outlined. Finally, it will be shown that some of the peculiar conditions previously found to be necessary for the production of this growth substance (Thimann and Dolk, 1933) find a simple explanation on this basis...|$|E
40|$|Boiling 1, 1 -dimethylnitrosamine or {{unsymmetrical}} dimethylnitrosamine {{several times}} with 25 % NaOD in D 2 O promoted the complete exchange of the nitrosamine’s alpha protons for deuterium. The deuterated nitrosamine was reduced by LiAlH 4, in anhydrous diethyl ether to the corresponding 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine-d 6. An in-process {{production of the}} oxalate salt was necessary due to the air sensitivity of the free base hydrazine. After recrystallization from absolute ethanol and extensive drying, the oxalate salt was evaluated for purity by <b>mixed</b> <b>melting</b> point, high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography. When protonated hydrazine-oxalate salt (mp= 146 °C) was mixed {{with a sample of}} the exchanged hydrazine salt there was no melting point depression. Several chromatographic procedures were used to investigate the presence of impurities in the sample. Each process revealed only the presence of the free base hydrazine and oxalic acid. Complete deuterium exchange was characterized by mass spectrometry and 1 H-nmr The mass spectum of the 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine-d 6 had a molecular ion peak at mass 66 relative to the protonated free base hydrazine and the protonated hydrazine-oxalate salt whose molecular ion peak was at mass 60. The subsequent 1 H-nmr spectra of both the protonated and deuterated hydrazine-oxalate salts, when dissolved in D 2 O, exhibited peaks specific for the two protons on the oxalic acid but only the protonated form had two additional absorbance peaks due to the two sets of alpha methyl protons. Using difference absorbance spectroscopy, the interaction of both protonated and deuterated 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine with microsomal cytochrome P- 450 was examined. As enzyme substrates, both hydrazines exhibited identical difference absorbance spectra when added to suspensions of rat liver microsomes. Also, the resulting difference absorbance spectra were similar to many nitrogenous ligands to cytochrome P- 450. With the addition of NADPH, the enzyme suspension containing the hydrazine, formed a time and oxygen dependent microsomal hemoprotein spectral-complex. Both hydrazines formed a spectral-complex that exhibited a Soret absorbance maximum at 438 nm with alpha and beta absorbance bands at 575 and 547 nm. Upon standing the suspensions were depleted of oxygen thus causing a bathochromic shift of the Soret absorbance to give a second complex with a maximum absorbance at 449 nm. Upon subsequent oxygenation of the suspension the 438 nm absorbance was re-established which is consistent for ferric to ferrous transition of the hemoprotein. Both the protonated and deuterated form of the hydrazine formed the 438 nm-complex suggesting that the presence of deuterium had little effect on the mechanism of substrate reduction. Vmax for both substrates was so great however, that kinetic evaluation of the reaction mechanism could not be done. Normally, 1, 1 -dimethylnitrosamine exhibits a type I difference binding spectra when added to rat liver microsomal suspensions. However, this was not observed for either the protonated or the deuterated form of the nitrosamine. Further changes in the reaction environment failed to yield the type I binding spectra or a 438 nm-complex. Inverse kinetic isotope effects on Vmax and Vmax/Km were observed when 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine-d 6, instead of 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine, was added to o purified liver microsomal flavin-containing monoxygenase, the Zeigler enzyme. Isotope effects on VmaxH/VmaxD, DV were 0. 76 without the presence of n-octylamine and 0. 82 when n-octylamine was present in the reaction mixture. Isotope effects on Vmax/Km, DV/K were 0. 36 without the presence of n-octylamine and 0. 55 when n-octylamine was present in the reaction mixture. The inverse isotope effect was observed relative to the protonated substrate when each were added, as substrate, to the purified enzyme and in the presence of NADPH. n-Octylamine, known to increase the rate of Ziegler enzyme reaction, had little effect on the magnitude of the inverse kinetic effect. Possible explanations for this inverse kinetic effect {{may be due to the}} deuterium affecting the binding rate of substrate to enzyme. Examination of the acid quenched reaction products revealed the presence of monomethylhydrazine. The formation of the monomethylhydrazine supports the findings by Prough, (11). Prough found the enzyme promoted the formation of a 1, 1 -dimethyldiazene intermediate, possibly from the dehydration of an N-hydroxymetabolite. Under acid conditions, this tautomerization of the diazene via an azo-intermediate to a methylhydrazone and then on to the monomethylhydrazine is favored over a possible bimolecular reaction involving the diazene which would promote the formation of a corresponding tetramethyltetrazene...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityAlthough the 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acids {{have been}} known for sixty years, the {{assignment}} of configuration of these acids has not been definite. All of the pertinent arguments have been based either on the known stereospecificity of the reagents used to produce these acids from oleic acid, or on physical measurements on the product. The purpose {{of this research was}} to demonstrate the configuration of these acids by unequivocal means. The methods starting from the stereospecificity of reagents, have as their basis the analogy that the stereospecificity would be carried over to this new reactant. The interpretation of the physical measurements requires an assumption of a certain conformation that is reasonable on the basis of X-ray diffraction measurements on similar compounds but has never been demonstrated in the compounds studied in this investigation. Both of these methods give concordant results in assigning the threo configuration to the lower melting 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic. The method of attack on this problem was the synthesis of an eighteen carbon compound having the elements of symmetry lacking in 9, 10 -dihydro:xystearic acid and capable of conversion to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid. The compound chosen was 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid. This acid exists in two forms, meso and racemic. The configuration at the nine and ten positions could be demonstrated unequivocally in this case by the actual resolution of the racemic mixture. Conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid would produce the threo configuration if no inversion took place at the nine and ten positions. In this manner, a total synthesis of 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid would also be accomplished. The synthesis of the desired 9, 10 -dibydroxyoctadecanedioic acid was accomplished as outlined below. 8 -Chlorooctyne- 1 and 1 -iodo- 6 -chlorohexane were prepared from hexamethylene glycol. Condensation of these compounds afforded 1, 14 -dichlorotetradecyne- 7. This, after conversion to the diiodo compound and reaction with ethyl malonate in sodium ethoxide solution, afforded 1, 1, 16, 16 -tetracarbethoxyhexadecyne- 8. A partially saponified and decarboxylated byproduct was also isolated but its constitution was not definitely established. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the pure tetraester afforded 9 -octadecynedioic acid. From the yield data from reactions with tetraester of different history, {{it was found that the}} highest yield of pure 9 -octadecynedioic acid was obtained when the tetraester had been exposed least to alkali. Migration of the acetylenic bond under alkaline conditions is a possible explanation for this observation. The position of the acetylenic bond in the 9 -octadecynedioic acid was determined by ozonolysis. Hydrogenation of 9 -octadecynedioic acid afforded cis 9 -octadecenedioic acid, agreeing in physical constants with those reported in the literature. A remarkable example of a poisoned palladium catalyst was discovered in developing this reaction. Analytically pure 9 -octadecynedioic acid absorbed two molar equivalents of hydrogen with the rate of hydrogen absorption slower during the absorption of the second mole. However, material that had a wider melting point range absorbed only molar equivalent of hydrogen even on prolonged exposure to hydrogen. The cis 9 -octadecynedioic acid was hydroxylated (a) with potassium permanganate and (b) with performic acid. These two methods had been used to produce the two forms of 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid from oleic acid. In this case, two different dihydroxy acids, m. p. 's 157 ° and 122 °, were produced. The acid, m. p. 122 ° (phloionic acid) was also isolated from cork. Two methods were emplqyed to determine the configuration, meso or racemic, of these 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acids. One method involved the formation of a cyclic benzylidene compound by reaction with benzaldehyde. Consideration of the geometry of these molecules indicated that the meso compound would afford a mixture of two compounds that should be separable whereas the racemic modification would afford only one compound. Experiment showed that only one compound was isolated when the 122 ° acid was used whereas the 157 ° acid afforded material that melted over a wide range. The analytical figures for this mixture were in agreement with those expected for the benzylidene compound. Crystallization from several solvents, and chromatography on several adsorbents were tried but with no success in separating the mixture. Since separation of the mixture was not accomplished, this proof of configuration is not conclusive. However, the method indicated that the 122 ° acid is racemic and the 157 ° acid is the meso modification. The configuration of the 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acids was established definitely by resolution of the 122 ° acid as its brucine salt. The resolution was accomplished by equilibrating the salt of the racemic acid with small amounts of cold ethanol. The residue after eight equilibrations differed in specific rotation from the starting material. The salt was decomposed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the free acid was isolated. This acid was optically active with a specific rotation of + 4. 4 ± 1. 1 °. No claim is made that this material is optically pure since no further resolution attempts were made. For the purpose of the establishment of configuration, the demonstration of optical activity is sufficient. This activity was enhanced by benzoylation. The activity was not due to impurities since this acid was analytically pure. Examination of the alcoholic solution from the equilibration afforded an acid that had a specific rotation of - 0. 5 ± 1. 0 °. This activity is within experimental error and is not too significant. Naturally occurring phloionic acid was found to be optically inactive. This material would appear to originate from non-enzymatic processes since otherwise it would be optically active. The optically active acid appears resistant to racemization. No further work was done on the state or origin of phloionic acid in cork and cork wax. The last part of the problem was the conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid (phloionic acid) to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid which would be the threo modification. This conversion was accomplished in the following way: Phloionic acid was converted to the monoester by transesterification with ethyl acetate and sulfuric acid. Normal Fischer esterification afforded the diester mainly even when the reaction was interrupted at shorter time intervals. Hydrolysis of the diester with sodium hydroxide afforded phloionic acid with very small amounts of monoester being formed at the point of half hydrolysis. These facts would indicate that the rate of hydrolysis of the monoester is faster than the diester, and that the monoester is hydrolyzed as rapidly as it is formed. In the transesterification reaction, unchanged starting material was always recovered, a fact indicating that this reaction involved no change in the configuration at the nine and ten positions. The ethyl hydrogen phloionate was reduced to 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid by a modification of the Bouvealt-Blanc procedure with sodium in absolute ethanol. The reaction proceeded smoothly and in good yield. A sample of phloionic acid was subjected to these conditions and was recovered unchanged. This observation demonstrated that the nine and ten positions were not involved in this reaction. The 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid isolated from this reaction differed in physical constants from the values reported by Zetsche in 1938 for a trihydroxystearic isolated from cork wax and called phloionolic acid. The structure proof was not very conclusive since the degradation products were not compared directly with the known compounds. Phloionolic acid may possibly have the other configuration (erythro). However, this research makes it doubtful that the erythro form would have a lower melting point than the threo form. If this conclusion is correct, Zetsche has incorrectly assigned the 9, 10, 18 -tribydroxystearic acid structure to phloionolic acid. The conversion of threo 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxystearic acid to threo 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid was accomplished in a manner analogous to the conversion of glucose to 6 -desoxyglucose. The 18 -tosyl ester was formed without protection of the vicinal hydroxyl groups by isopropylidene formation. The ester grouping was converted to the 18 -iodo compound by reaction with sodium iodide in acetone. Iodine was replaced by hydrogen by reaction with zinc and hydrochloric acid in glacial acetic acid solvent. The material isolated was identical in analysis, melting point, and <b>mixed</b> <b>melting</b> point with authentic 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid, m. p. 95 °. Both forms of 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid were carried through this process unchanged. The conversion of the racemic 9, 10 -dihydroxyoctadecanedioic acid to 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid without alteration of configuration at the nine and ten positions definitely establishes the low-melting 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid as the threo form. In summary, the accomplishments of this research are: 1. The definite assignment of the three configuration to the low-melting 9, 10 -dibydroxystearic acid. 2. The first recorded total synthesis of tb. e 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acids from materials that are not derived from fats and oils. 3. A synthesis of oleic and elaidic acids, since Ames and Bowman have shown that the dihydroxystearic acids can be converted to the unsaturated acids in a stereospecific manner so that the erythro acid affords oleic acid exclusively and threo, elaidic. 4. The demonstration of configuration of the 9, 1. 0 -dibydroxyoctadecanedioic acids. 5 · The questioning of the assignment assigned by Zetsche to phloionolic acid as a 9, 10, 18 -tribydroxyetearic acid. 6. The assignment of configuration to aleurtic acid, 9, 10, 16 -trihydroxypalmitic acid, as threo as a corollary of this work. The assignment is made on the basis of the formation of a trans unsaturated acid when treated in the manner of Bowman, the ease of isoproproylidene formation analogous to the reactivity of the now known threo 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid, and its lower melting point than its isomer...|$|E

40|$|Isotopic {{relationships}} between parent mantle and daughter MORBs {{have been used}} to reveal the composite nature of the source tracking the missing components in their isotopic fingerprints. An opportunity to address this issue is given by temporal sections of single ridge segments where MORB and residual parent mantle peridotites can be assessed together. The possibility has been offered by the flexured and uplifted lithospheric slab that exposes, on the sea floor along a seafloor spreading flow line, a zero to 26 Ma relatively undisturbed lithospheric section (Vema Lithospheric Section or VLS) generated at the 80 km long Mid Atlantic ridge segment (EMAR) at 11 °N. Temporal variations of the Nd isotopic composition of crustal basalts and parental mantle along the VLS reveal a large dispersion of residual isotopic composition with respect to the melt products. Equilibration with partially <b>mixed</b> <b>melts</b> can account for the observed relationships in the mantle rocks. The mean MORB isotopic composition and the average composition of the residues do not match because of the preferential extraction of the low-melting component. The compositional difference in both isotopic and elemental distribution {{is a function of the}} average degree of melting of the mantle. This observation can only be justified by progressive melting of composite lithologies where mantle potential temperature and amount of dispersed low-melting lithologies control the relative extent of melting of the mantle host and that of the dispersed heterogeneities resulting in differential fractions of <b>mixed</b> <b>melts</b> in the final products. This observation is confirmed by global correlations in Nd isotopes and chemical indicators of degree of melting from other portions of the mid ocean ridge system...|$|R
