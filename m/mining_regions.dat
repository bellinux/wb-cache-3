5|$|During the AprilAugust 1832 Black Hawk War, {{between white}} {{settlers}} in the lead <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> and Sauk Chief Black Hawk's British Band, Hamilton again served in the volunteer militia. Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often {{in charge of the}} militia's indigenous allies. At the war's onset it was known that many of the Sioux and Menominee were eager to join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory, north of Prairie du Chien, to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> of the Empire {{were the}} Iberian Peninsula (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive {{large-scale}} mining—of alluvial deposits, and {{by means of}} open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production. The gold mines of Dacia, for instance, were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.|$|E

25|$|The methods {{had been}} {{developed}} by the Romans in Spain in 25 AD to exploit large alluvial gold deposits, the largest site being at Las Medulas, where seven long aqueducts tapped local rivers and sluiced the deposits. Spain {{was one of the}} most important <b>mining</b> <b>regions,</b> but all regions of the Roman Empire were exploited. In Great Britain the natives had mined minerals for millennia, but after the Roman conquest, the scale of the operations increased dramatically, as the Romans needed Britannia's resources, especially gold, silver, tin, and lead.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1827, the 16-year-old Gardner rented and planted {{eighteen}} acres of land, and worked on side jobs between planting and harvest. He went into St. Louis, Missouri on an unsuccessful quest for more work; so he hired on to a keelboat bound for Galena, Illinois, whose captain abandoned him there without pay after he was taken sick with fever. Weak with fever (so weak that he was obliged to lay down several times on his route to gain a little rest), he followed an Indian trail {{that led to a}} cabin owned by a half brother and a cousin in the <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> near Galena, stumbling upon their place at midnight. The fever and subsequent shaking ague lasted nearly a year.|$|E
25|$|While {{the largest}} European-American {{population}} in Montana overall is German, pockets of significant Scandinavian ancestry are prevalent {{in some of}} the farming-dominated northern and eastern prairie regions, parallel to nearby regions of North Dakota and Minnesota. Farmers of Irish, Scots, and English roots also settled in Montana. The historically mining-oriented communities of western Montana such as Butte have a wider range of European-American ethnicity; Finns, Eastern Europeans and especially Irish settlers left an indelible mark on the area, as well as people originally from British <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> such as Cornwall, Devon and Wales. The nearby city of Helena, also founded as a mining camp, had a similar mix in addition to a small Chinatown. Many of Montana's historic logging communities originally attracted people of Scottish, Scandinavian, Slavic, English and Scots-Irish descent.|$|E

25|$|Until the 18th century {{most of the}} {{territory}} {{of what is now}} Santiago de Cali was occupied by haciendas (cattle farms and plantations of food, with some sugar cane), and the city was only a small town near the Cali River. In 1793, Santiago de Cali had 6,548 inhabitants, 1,106 of whom were (African) slaves. The haciendas were the property of the dominant noble class with many slaves dedicated mostly to stockbreeding and raising sugar cane crops. Many of these haciendas became zone of the present city like Cañaveralejo, Chipichape, Pasoancho, Arroyohondo, Cañasgordas, Limonar and Meléndez. Santiago de Cali was strategically positioned for trade, centrally located in relation to the <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> of Antioquia, Chocó, and Popayán. In the colonial period, the first trail for mules and horses between Santiago de Cali and the port of Buenaventura was completed.|$|E
25|$|Doty {{named the}} city Madison for James Madison, the fourth President of the U.S. {{who had died}} on June 28, 1836, and he named the streets for the other 39 signers of the U.S. Constitution. Although the city existed only on paper, the {{territorial}} legislature voted on November 28 in favor of Madison as its capital, largely because of its location halfway between the new and growing cities around Milwaukee {{in the east and}} the long established strategic post of Prairie du Chien in the west, and between the highly populated lead <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> in the southwest and Wisconsin's oldest city, Green Bay, in the northeast. Being named for the much-admired founding father James Madison, who had just died, and having streets named for each of the 39 signers of the Constitution, may have also helped attract votes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of central Mexico, {{there were only two}} major Indian revolts {{challenging}} Spanish rule. In the Mixtón war in 1541, the viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza led an army against an uprising by Caxcanes. In the 1680 Pueblo revolt, Indians in 24 settlements in New Mexico expelled the Spanish, who left for Texas, an exile lasting a decade. The Chichimeca war lasted over fifty years, 1550-1606, between the Spanish and various indigenous groups of northern New Spain, particularly in silver <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> and the transportation trunk lines. Non-sedentary or semi-sedentary Northern Indians were difficult to control once they acquired the mobility of the horse. In 1616, the Tepehuan revolted against the Spanish, but it was relatively quickly suppressed. The Tarahumara Indians were in revolt in the mountains of Chihuahua for several years. In 1670 Chichimecas invaded Durango, and the governor, Francisco González, abandoned its defense.|$|E
50|$|In July 1858, {{gold was}} {{discovered}} along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County of the Territory of Kansas (now in the State of Colorado). This discovery precipitating the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. To provide local {{government for the}} gold <b>mining</b> <b>region,</b> the Kansas Territorial Legislature split Arapahoe County into six counties on February 7, 1859: a much smaller Arapahoe County, Broderick County, El Paso County, Fremont County, Montana County, and Oro County. Oro County was named for the Spanish language name for gold, {{despite the fact that}} the county lay to the east of the gold <b>mining</b> <b>region.</b> None of these six counties were ever organized. Many residents of the <b>mining</b> <b>region</b> felt disconnected from the territorial government, and they formed their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859.|$|R

25|$|His {{return to}} the Americas also {{occurred}} {{under the tutelage of}} Humboldt. In 1822, Francisco Antonio Zea delivered a Simon Bolívar's letter to Humboldt. There Bolívar asked Humboldt to send a scientific mission to both investigate the natural resources of the new Republic of the Gran Colombia and to establish a museum of natural history as well as a mining school. The German scholar, who saw Rivero as a prominent disciple, named him head of the mission. After three years in which he maintained a constant correspondence with his European colleagues, Rivero left Colombia {{because of a lack of}} economic and political support. Bolívar then recommended his recruitment to the Peruvian government for the development of similar projects. From 1826 onwards, Rivero undertook several enterprises in his home country: he fostered a scientific journal, founded the first National Museum, created the School of Mines, served as prefect in <b>mining</b> <b>regions,</b> published extensively on mineral resources, and wrote the first antiquarian study of postcolonial Peru: Antigüedades peruanas. This book was published in Vienna in 1851 upon his return to Europe and was translated into English, French, and German soon after. Reinserted in the European academic world, he gave several talks on Peruvian resources and antiquities until he died in Paris in 1857, directly after publishing a collection of his scientific memoirs in Brussels.|$|E

500|$|As a result, in 1835 the U.S. Federal Government {{established}} three branch mints: the Charlotte Mint in North Carolina, the Dahlonega Mint in Georgia and the New Orleans Mint. [...] Dahlonega and Charlotte were in gold <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> {{and these}} mints produced only gold coins. [...] New Orleans {{was selected because}} of the city's strategic location along the Mississippi River which made it a vitally important center for commercial activity, including the export of cotton from the area's plantations. Large quantities of gold from Mexico also passed through its port annually.|$|E

500|$|Back in Pretoria Kruger {{introduced}} a draft law {{to give the}} <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven-year residency period for voting rights. This would not be retroactive, but up to two years' prior residence would be counted towards the seven, and uitlanders already {{in the country for}} nine years or more would get the vote immediately. Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient. After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty. Chamberlain issued an ultimatum in September 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions, else the British would [...] "formulate their own proposals for a final settlement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Containerization has {{its origins}} in early coal <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> in England {{beginning}} in the late 18th century. In 1766 James Brindley [...] designed the box boat 'Starvationer' with 10 wooden containers, to transport coal from Worsley Delph (quarry) to Manchester by Bridgewater Canal. In 1795, Benjamin Outram opened the Little Eaton Gangway, upon which coal was carried in wagons built at his Butterley Ironwork. The horse-drawn wheeled wagons on the gangway took the form of containers, which, loaded with coal, could be transshipped from canal barges on the Derby Canal, which Outram had also promoted.|$|E

2500|$|Rudolf's Kunstkammer was not {{a typical}} [...] "cabinet of curiosities" [...] – a {{haphazard}} collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine Kunstkammer was systematically arranged in an encyclopaedic fashion. In addition, Rudolf II employed his polyglot court physician, Anselmus Boetius de Boodt (c. 1550–1632), to curate the collection. De Boodt was an avid mineral collector. He travelled widely on collecting trips to the <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> of Germany, Bohemia and Silesia, often accompanied by his Bohemian naturalist friend, Thaddaeus Hagecius. Between 1607 and 1611, De Boodt catalogued the Kunstkammer, and in 1609 he published Gemmarum et Lapidum, {{one of the finest}} mineralogical treatises of the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|Bingham Canyon {{has proven}} {{to be one of the}} world's most {{productive}} mines. As of 2004, its ore yielded more than 17 million tons (15.4Mt) of copper, 23 million ounces (715t) of gold, 190 million ounces (5,900t) of silver, and 850 million pounds (386kt) of molybdenum. [...] The value of the resources extracted from the Bingham Canyon Mine is greater than the Comstock Lode, Klondike, and California gold rush <b>mining</b> <b>regions</b> combined. [...] Mines in Chile, Indonesia, Arizona, [...] and New Mexico now exceed Bingham Canyon's annual production rate. [...] High molybdenum prices in 2005 made the molybdenum produced at Bingham Canyon in that year worth more than the copper.

2500|$|Finally {{free from}} {{financial}} problems, the D now possessed a direct route from Denver to Salt Lake City (the detour south through Pueblo and Tennessee Pass {{was no longer}} required for direct service), but a problem still remained: for transcontinental service, the Union Pacific's more northerly line was far less mountainous (and, as a result, several hours faster). The D's solution was its [...] "fast freight" [...] philosophy, which employed multiple diesel locomotives pulling short, frequent trains. This philosophy helps {{to explain why the}} D, despite its proximity to one of the nation's most productive coal <b>mining</b> <b>regions,</b> retired coal-fueled steam locomotives as quickly as new, replacement diesels could be purchased. By 1956, the D's standard-gauge steam locomotives had been retired and scrapped. The reason for this was that unlike steam locomotives, diesel locomotives could easily be combined, using the diesels' multiple unit (MU) capabilities, to equip each train with the optimum horsepower which was needed to meet the D's aggressive schedule.|$|E
