5000|$|As {{with other}} {{insurance}}, {{an insurance policy}} {{is part of the}} insurance transaction. In mortgage insurance, a <b>master</b> <b>policy</b> issued to a bank or other mortgage-holding entity (the policyholder) lays out the terms and conditions of the coverage under insurance certificates. The certificates document the particular characteristics and conditions of each individual loan. The <b>master</b> <b>policy</b> includes various conditions including exclusions (conditions for denying coverage), conditions for notification of loans in default, and claims settlement. The contractual provisions in the <b>master</b> <b>policy</b> have received increased scrutiny since the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. Master policies generally require timely notice of default include provisions on monthly reports, time to file suit limitations, arbitration agreements, and exclusions for negligence, misrepresentation, and other conditions such as pre-existing environmental contaminants. The exclusions sometimes have [...] "incontestability provisions" [...] which limit the ability of the mortgage insurer to deny coverage for misrepresentations attributed to the policyholder if twelve consecutive payments are made, although these incontestability provisions generally don't apply to outright fraud.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} an interoperability solution (tool) for {{the internal}} management {{of a policy}} decision engine located {{at the level of}} the au-thorization layer of a service oriented environment. The tool aims to support federated access control in the context of distributed architectures, in which a local authorization policy is not able to recognize all the attributes in the authorization decision requests. The approach is based on an ontology-based interoperation service (OBIS) whose role is to translate security attributes (name-value pairs) from local security vocabularies into the attributes recognized by the central (<b>Master</b> <b>Policy</b> Decision Point) vocabulary based on a security ontology and its domain-specific extensions which provides semantic reasoning services. The approach is validated in an e-Health scenario for the access of patient data for diabetes patient monitoring and disease management...|$|E

Users with multimode terminals in HWNs {{are able to}} initiate connectivity that best suits their attributes and the requirements of their applications. There are many complexities in hybrid wireless networks due to changing data rates, frequency of operation, resource availability, QoS and also, complexities in terms of mobility management across different technologies. A superstore {{is a very large}} retail store that serves as a one-stop shopping destination by offering a wide variety of goods that range from groceries to appliances. It provide all types services such as banking, photo center, catering, etc. The good examples of superstores are: Tesco (hypermarkets, United Kingdom), Carrefour(hypermarkets, France), etc. Generally, the mobile customer communicates with superstore server using a transaction. A transaction corresponds to a finite number of interactive processes between the customer and superstore server. A few superstore transactions, examples are, product browsing, Technical details inquiry, Financial transactions, billing, etc. This thesis aims to design and develop the following schemes to solve some of the above indicated problems of a hybrid wireless superstore network: 1 	Transaction based bandwidth management. 2 	Transaction-based resource management. 3 	Transaction-based Quality of Service management. 4. Transactions-based topology management. We, herewith, present these developed schemes, the simulation carried out and results obtained, in brief. Transaction-based bandwidth management The designed Transaction-Based Bandwidth Management Scheme (TB-BMS) operates at application-level and intelligently allocates the bandwidth by monitoring the profit oriented sensitivity variations in the transactions, which are linked with various profit profiles created over type, time, and history of transactions. The scheme mainly consists of transaction classifier, bandwidth determination and transactions scheduling modules. We have deployed these scheme over a downlink of HWNs, since the uplink caries simple quires from customers to superstore server. The scheme uses transaction scheduling algorithm, which decides how to schedule an outgoing transaction based on its priority with efficient use of available BW. As we observe, not all superstore transactions can have the same profit sensitive information, data size and operation type. Therefore, we classify the superstore transactions into four levels based on profit, data size, operation type and the degree of severity of information that they are handling. The aim of transaction classification module is to find the transaction sensitivity level(TSL) for a given transaction. The bandwidth determination module estimates bandwidth requirement for each of the transactions. The transactions scheduling module schedules the transactions based on availability of bandwidth as per the TSL of the transaction. The scheme schedules the highest priority transactions first, keeping the lowest priority transaction pending. If all the highest priority transactions are over, then it continues with next priority level transactions, and so on, in every slot. We have simulated the hybrid wireless superstore network environment with WiFi and GSM technologies. We simulated four TSL levels with different bandwidth. The simulation under consideration uses different transactions with different bandwidth requirements. The performance results describe that the proposed scheme considerably improves the bandwidth utilization by reducing transaction blocking and accommodating more essential transactions at the peak time of the business. Transaction-based resource management In the next work, we have proposed the transaction-based resource management scheme (TB-RMS) to allocate the required resources among the various customer services based on priority of transactions. The scheme mainly consists of transaction classifier, resource estimation and transactions scheduling modules. This scheme also uses a downlink transaction scheduling algorithm, which decides how to schedule an outgoing transaction based on its priority with efficient use of available resources. The transaction-based resource management {{is similar to that of}} TB-BMS scheme, except that the scheme estimates the resources like buffer, bandwidth, processing time for each of transaction rather than bandwidth. The performance results indicate that the proposed TB-RMS scheme considerably improves the resource utilization by reducing transaction blocking and accommodating more essential transactions at the peak time. Transaction-based Quality of Service management In the third segment, we have proposed a police-based transaction-aware QoS management architecture for the downlink QoS management. We derive a policy for the estimation of QoS parameters, like, delay, jitter, bandwidth, transaction loss for every transaction before scheduling on the downlink. We use Policy-based Transaction QoS Management(PTQM) to achieve the transaction based QoS management. Policies are rules that govern a transaction behavior, usually implemented in the form of if(condition) then(action) policies. The QoS management scheme is fully centralized, and is based on the ideas of client-server interaction. Each mobile terminal is connected to a server via WiFi or GSM. The <b>master</b> <b>policy</b> controller (MPDF) connects to the policy controller of the WiFi network (WPDF) and the GSM policy controller(PDF). We have considered the simulation environment similar to earlier schemes. The results shows that the policy-based transaction QoS management is improves performance and utilizes network resources efficiently at the peak time of the superstore business. Transactions-Aware Topology Management(TATM) Finally, we have proposed a topology management scheme to the superstore hybrid wireless networks. A wireless topology management that manages the activities and features of a wireless network connection. It may control the process of selecting an available access points, authentication and associating to it and setting up other parameters of the wireless connection. The proposed topology management scheme consists of the transaction classifier, resource estimation module, network availability and status module and transaction-aware topology management module. The TATM scheme is to select the best network among available networks to provide transaction response(or execution). We have simulated hybrid wireless superstore network with five WiFi and two GSM technologies. The performance results indicate that the transaction-based topology management scheme utilizes the available resources efficiently and distributed transaction loads evenly in both WiFi and GSM networks based on the capacity...|$|E
