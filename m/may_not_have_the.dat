25|$|As of 2009 {{holders of}} COMEX gold futures have {{experienced}} problems taking delivery of their metal. Along with chronic delivery delays, some investors have received delivery of bars not matching their contract in serial number and weight.

25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as lymphangitis and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop inguinal lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise.

25|$|Selecting {{carefully}} {{the plant}} material {{with emphasis on}} getting a high genetic diversity rather than aiming at producing a uniform stand of trees, is essential for sustainable use of FGR. Considering the provenance is crucial as well.

A different population from further away, which may have experienced selection under conditions more like those forecast for the site to be reforested, might represent a more suitable seed source.|$|E
25|$|During development, Kojima Productions and Konami {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} {{their decision to}} include microtransactions; a system that allows players to pay for access to content in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players who <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions. Further controversy emerged following the publication of an early review claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a paywall, which Konami refuted saying that microtransactions acted as an accelerator rather than a paywall.|$|E
25|$|Age. Age {{can also}} be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care {{expenses}} difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet. This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via Medicare.|$|E

25|$|Promotion {{from one}} geup {{to the next}} can proceed rapidly in some schools, since schools often allow geup {{promotions}} every two, three, or four months. Students of geup rank learn the most basic techniques first, {{and then move on}} to more advanced techniques as they approach first dan. Many of the older and more traditional schools often take longer to allow students to test for higher ranks than newer, more contemporary schools, as they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> required testing intervals. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. In fact, some styles impose age or time-in-rank limits on dan promotions. For example, the number of years between one dan promotion to the next may be limited to a minimum of the practitioner's current dan-rank, so that (for example) a 5th dan practitioner must wait 5 years to test for 6th dan.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those who <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
25|$|Journalists {{were able}} to play The Last Guardian at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 and the 2016 Tokyo Game Show {{in the months before}} the game's release, and several {{expressed}} further concerns {{about the nature of the}} game's lengthy development period. Patrick Garrett, writing for VG247, found that the visuals felt flat and aged considering modern hardware capabilities, and expressed concern that while older gamers would readily purchase the title, The Last Guardian may not draw in enough newer gamers to be a commercial success. Philip Kollar for Polygon, though still impressed with the characters, graphics, and core gameplay, found controlling the character difficult and managing the game's camera tricky, elements that made the game feel like a PlayStation 2 title rather than something on modern hardware. Wireds Chris Kohler found much of the demo to require patient observation of Trico's movements and puzzle solving, which, he commented, some players would appreciate but were elements that have slowly been phased out of action games over the last console generation, and other players <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> patience for these. Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku also noted that the demo's pace was often set by how fast Trico would respond or react, which may test the patience of players looking for a more action-based experience.|$|E
