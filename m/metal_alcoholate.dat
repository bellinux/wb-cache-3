40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the technique of preparing oxide glasses from <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> through hydrolysis and gelling processes have been reviewed. <b>Metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> undergo hydrolysis to form clear gels, which are converted to the corresponding oxide glasses on heating at considerably low temperatures compared to those required for {{the preparation of the}} equivalent glasses by the conventional melting technique. On the basis of the present technique, (1) the glasses with very high purity can be obtained, and (2) the glasses which are difficult to obtain by the conventional melting techniques because of extremely high melting temperature or high tendency toward crystallization and/or phase separation during cooling can be easily obtained. The glasses with attractive properties, e. g. low thermal expansion glasses of the TiO 2 -SiO 2 system, high alkali-resistance glasses of the ZrO 2 -SiO 2 system, high melting glasses of the Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system and many other useful single or complex oxide glasses have been prepared from the corresponding <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates.</b> Approprite control of the hydrolysis condition led us to the alcoholate solution sitable for making either glass films, glass fibers or monolithic glasses : (1) Slow hydrolysis based on the exposure of the alcoholate solution to atmosphere, or addition of the insufficient water and catalyst led to the solution of linearly polymerized alcoholates suitable for fiber drawing. (2) The careful addition of relatively large amounts of water and catalyst changed the alcoholate solution on the three-dimensional polymer gels suitable for preparing monolithic glasses. It has been revealed that the glasses derived from <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> often contain a relatively large amount of water. The removal of the water out of the glasses remains to be accomplished, since the incorporated water would decrease their mechanical strength and increase the tendency toward crystallization. It is hoped that further detailed informations on the polymerization process of <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> will provide us with castable gels which might form the glasses having any desired shapes. Then the present technique of preparing glasses from <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> will be a powerful one for glass production...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe synthesis, {{structural}} characterization, electrochemistry and luminescence {{properties of}} a series of alkali <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> and Sm(III) alkoxides with thiophene−based−OR substituents are presented. The alkali <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> 7 - 15 have been obtained by deprotonation of the carbinol with NaH or KH. Their molecular structures consist of tetranuclear alkali <b>metal</b> <b>alcoholates</b> with a distorted cubane−like M 4 O 4 core (X-ray structure analyses). Each alkali metal is surrounded by three carbinolate ligands and (depending on the derivative) by additional tetrahydrofuran molecules. The mononuclear samarium alkoxides {Sm[OC(C 4 H 3 S) 3] 3 (thf) 3 } * thf (16) and {Sm[OC(C 16 H 13 S) ] 3 (thf) 3 } * thf (17) were synthesized by the salt metathesis reactions between {[KOC(C 4 H 3 S) 3] 4 (thf) 2 } * thf (7), [NaOC(C 4 H 3 S) 3] 4 (thf) 2 (8) or {[KOC(C 16 H 13 S) ] 4 (thf) 3 } * ½ thf (11), respectively, and SmCl 3 in thf solution. The molecular structures of these air−sensitive base adducts have been determined by single−crystal X−ray crystallography and reveal an approximately octahedral coordination sphere around the samarium metal centres with three methoxido ligands and three facially arranged thf molecules. The electrochemical properties are essentially dominated by the oxidation of the thienyl units. The emission spectra of the carbinols and their derived potassium and sodium compounds display broad bands attributed to the π*→π transitions of the aromatic ligands. Luminescence studies performed on complexes 16 and 17 reveal the typical f−f transitions of the Sm(III) ion. The photophysical data suggest that an energy transfer from the ligand to the metal centre operates...|$|R

The used procedure is suitable to prepare LDHs with Al molar fractions, x(Al) =Al/(Al+Mg), as low as 0. 1. The same LDH preparation procedure, for x(Al) < 0. 1, produces thermally stable intercalates with alkoxy anions, exhibiting layers {{similar to those of}} brucite, which maintain a high degree of order only in the hexagonal packing of the hydroxide groups. In particular, the basal periodicity increases from nearly 0. 8 nm up to nearly 1. 3 nm, due to the parallel staking of hexanolate groups in the clay galleries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

The promotion of the hydrolysis by the addition of pure water to the alcoholate mixtures could not be applied to the present method of fiber drawing, because it caused the precipitation of the hydrolyzed product. Mixture of the alcoholate solutions and water added as alcoholic solution showed no precipitation and promoted hydrolysis of the alcoholates, but it did not show spinnable state {{in the course of}} hydrolysis.

Alcohol derivatives selected high-boiling alcohols tetra (hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine (lapromol 294) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (TGFS).
