5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and <b>mechanical</b> <b>factors.</b> Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
500|$|Chest-wall defects {{are usually}} evident {{in cases of}} injury to the chest wall, such as stab or bullet wounds ("open pneumothorax"). In {{secondary}} spontaneous pneumothoraces, vulnerabilities in the lung tissue are caused {{by a variety of}} disease processes, particularly by rupturing of bullae (large air-containing lesions) in cases of severe emphysema. Areas of necrosis (tissue death) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax, although the exact mechanism is unclear. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) has for many years been thought to be caused by [...] "blebs" [...] (small air-filled lesions just under the pleural surface), which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax (tall males) due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>factors.</b> In PSP, blebs can be found in 77% of cases, compared to 6% in the general population without a history of PSP. As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later, the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes; furthermore, pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs. It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption (porosity) in the pleural layer, which are prone to rupture. Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of small airways, which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers. Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity, it is gradually reabsorbed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely <b>mechanical</b> <b>factors</b> cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a new {{methodology}} for comparing high power performance of different piezoelectric materials is presented. When comparing high power performance of piezoelectric materials of varying compositions and vibration modes, there exists an inherent problem in comparing the <b>mechanical</b> quality <b>factor</b> directly. Typically {{the behavior of}} the <b>mechanical</b> quality <b>factor</b> is reported as a function of tip vibration velocity of the sample. This paper shows why this approach can be inherently problematic and proposes an energy approach to characterize the <b>mechanical</b> quality <b>factor</b> as the solution. By utilizing mechanical energy density (u_e), the mass density of the material system (ρ), and the vibration mode shape (e. g. k_ 31 and k_p) of the sample are accounted for. Therefore, a better method to compare high power performance of varying piezoelectric compositions is introduced. Furthermore, the new method is applied to various compositions by using data available in the literature. As a result, the high power behavior of the materials appear to be significantly different when the new "energy density approach" is used to compare the <b>mechanical</b> quality <b>factor</b> rather than vibration velocity. Also, the technique's ability to be utilized to consolidate data from different resonators to determine anisotropic loss factors is demonstrated on hard and soft PZT samples of k_ 31 and k_p geometries...|$|R
2500|$|Claude Bernard, a French {{physiologist}} of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, formulated {{the concept}} of the milieu interieur in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state: [...] "... there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism" [...] (Bernard, 1865). Walter Cannon, a professor of physiology at Harvard University coined the commonly used term, homeostasis, in his book The Wisdom of the Body, 1932, from the Greek word homoios, meaning similar, and stasis, meaning position. In his work with animals, Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as anxiety, distress, or rage, was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage, 1915). These studies looked into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system, namely the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses that initiated the recognition of the freeze, fight or flight response. His findings were published {{from time to time in}} professional journals, then summed up in book form in The <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Factors</b> of Digestion, published in 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Duane {{syndrome}} is most probably a miswiring {{of the eye}} muscles, causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldn't and other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Alexandrakis and Saunders found that {{in most cases the}} abducens nucleus and nerve are absent or hypoplastic, and the lateral rectus muscle is innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve. This view is supported by the earlier work of Hotchkiss et al. who reported on the autopsy findings of two patients with Duane's syndrome. In both cases the sixth cranial nerve nucleus and nerve was absent, and the lateral rectus muscle was innervated by the inferior division of the third or oculomotor nerve. This misdirection of nerve fibres results in opposing muscles being innervated by the same nerve. Thus, on attempted abduction, stimulation of the lateral rectus via the oculomotor nerve will be accompanied by stimulation of the opposing medial rectus via the same nerve; a muscle which works to adduct the eye. Thus, co-contraction of the muscles takes place, limiting the amount of movement achievable and also resulting in retraction of the eye into the socket. They also noticed <b>mechanical</b> <b>factors</b> and considered them secondary to loss of innervation: During corrective surgery fibrous attachments have been found connecting the horizontal recti and the orbital walls and fibrosis of the lateral rectus has been confirmed by biopsy. This fibrosis can result in the lateral rectus being 'tight' and acting as a tether or leash. [...] Co-contraction of the medial and lateral recti allows the globe to slip up or down under the tight lateral rectus producing the up and down shoots characteristic of the condition.|$|E
