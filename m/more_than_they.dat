5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> {{had in the}} previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, and Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E

Throughout these adventures, Cutter and his companions learn about the world and themselves in profound ways.|$|R
60|$|Considering men in {{relation}} to money, there are three kinds whom I dislike: men who have <b>more</b> money <b>than</b> <b>they</b> can spend; men who have <b>more</b> money <b>than</b> <b>they</b> do spend; and men who spend <b>more</b> money <b>than</b> <b>they</b> have. Of the three varieties, I believe I have the least liking for the first. But, as a man, I liked Spencer Grenville North pretty well, although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions-- I've forgotten exactly how many.|$|R
5|$|First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the}} Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase {{of his career}} with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian side on a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{finished}} third in the gold and overall medal count, behind host nation China and Great Britain. The finish was an improvement from the 2004 Paralympics, where the U.S. finished fourth in the gold and overall medal count. The U.S. saw significant gains in Paralympic swimming, winning 17 gold medals and 44 total medals, 9 <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> took home from Athens. U.S. swimmers set a total of 16 world records, 23 Paralympic records, 48 Pan American records and 99 American records. U.S. coverage of the Games was provided by the Universal Sports Television Network and the official website of the U.S. Paralympic Team.|$|E
5|$|Upon Tallon's {{return to}} Australia, {{he made an}} unbeaten 146 in Bradman's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948. He {{featured}} in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with Geff Noblet, who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively. This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match. Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match. Queensland lost <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> won during the season, but Tallon continued to be productive, scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's {{first team}} have competed {{in a number}} of national, and {{in the early part of}} the club's history, {{regionally}} contested leagues such as the United League, the Southern District Combination and the London League Premier Division. Their record against each club faced in these discontinued competitions, in addition to the Football League and Premier League is listed below. Arsenal's first Football League match was against Newcastle United, and they met their 85th and most recent different league opponent, A.F.C. Bournemouth, for the first time in the 2015–16 Premier League season. The team that Arsenal have played most in league competition is Manchester United, who they first met in the 1894–95 Football League season; the 81 defeats from 196 meetings is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> have lost against any other club. Liverpool have drawn 50 league encounters with Arsenal, more than any other club. Arsenal have recorded more league victories against Everton than against any other club, having beaten them 94 times out of 192 attempts.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed that was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would ever need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E
5|$|Many in the {{conservation}} movement urged {{the state to}} buy back the land, especially after the Curtiss-Wright lease was canceled. In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, golf courses, and honeymoon resort; a Penn State game preserve stocked with exotic animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste disposal site. By November 1967, all of the land {{was back in the}} state forests and state game lands.|$|E

5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E
5|$|When this {{announcement}} reached the UK, the NUWSS was {{divided on the}} one hand by patriots such as Millicent Fawcett who were devoted to war work and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> were peace-minded. They rejected a resolution favored by internationalists Helen Bright Clark and Margaret Bondfield which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague. Because of this, women such as Margaret Ashton, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague, some 180 women in total. Macmillan was the only internationalist executive of NUWSS who did not resign; she was away performing relief work. Volunteering near The Hague, Macmillan prepared to join the ex-NUWSS members after the group crossed the English Channel.|$|E
