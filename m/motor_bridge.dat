25|$|The BEF paused before {{attacking the}} Sambre–Oise Canal. On 5 November, 46th Division renewed the advance, the divisional {{engineers}} throwing a pontoon {{bridge across the}} canal for the artillery and transport to cross. The approaches to this bridge soon became a sea of mud, and 465th Fd Co built a Corduroy road across the fields. The heavy rain made the Petite Helpe stream impassable, but on 7 November, 468th Fd Co threw three bridges across it {{before the end of}} the day, and 465th Fd Co was brought up from crater-filling to build a <b>motor</b> <b>bridge,</b> which was completed before dark on 9 November. Meanwhile, on 8 November, 466th Fd Co commenced a bridge at Cartignies for 60-pounder guns, which were urgently needed in the pursuit of the beaten enemy. The signal company, too, was heavily involved in maintaining communications, a detachment advancing ahead of the leading brigade headquarters to prepare cables for its arrival (often re-using stretches of captured German systems). Wireless sets were also leap-frogged forwards.|$|E
