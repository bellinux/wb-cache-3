40|$|When {{competition}} authorities {{struggle to}} assess abusive practices by online multi-sided platforms, the issue {{does not appear}} to be defining markets or determining market power; rather, the difficulty is finding a fitting theory of abuse. In the search for such theories, one candidate has been overlooked: <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze.</b> This infringement has for the most part been confined to the telecom sector, but its potential reaches beyond. Indeed, the conduct of online platforms could force <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> out of retirement. This presentation starts from the foundations of <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> theory, laying out the core principles and addressing possible misconceptions.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the role of irreversibility, flexibility, and uncertainty in assessing the financial implications of regulated access pricing in the telecommunications market (Pindyck 2004, 2005).

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the United States, Germany decided to add <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> as a legal offense to German competition law.

Afterwards the problems in applying the concept in case of the gasoline market, for which it was initially designed, are discussed. On the one hand, there are very few obvious cases in the gasoline market in which retail prices and wholesale prices are a clear indicator for <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze.</b> On the other hand, applying the "equally-efficient" approach always involves assumptions of having knowledge of the companies' cost functions. When applying the "equally-efficient"-approach, there are cases of margin squeezes at the cost of having only educated guesses and no solid proof. When considering the wholesale price to detect <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> cases on the gasoline retail market, there are nearly no cases of margin squeezes. The difficulty to find a proper way of calculating equal efficiency or reasonable efficiency and the lack of <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> cases when referring to wholesale and retail prices of gasoline constitute the dilemma of the element of offence "margin squeeze"...|$|E

Received the The Institute of Competition Law 2015 Concurrences PhD Award. A <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> is an exclusionary form {{of abuse}} of a {{dominant}} position that a vertically integrated firm can implement when it sells its upstream bottleneck input to its downstream competitors. Because it is vertically integrated, the dominant incumbent {{can reduce the}} margin between the input price charged to competitors and the retail price charged to end-users by either raising {{the price of the}} input and/or lowering the price of its retail product/services {{to such an extent that}} the remaining margin of profit is insufficient for its rivals to remain competitive. Although the scenario of <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> seems to be rather simple, the underlying economic and legal theories are not. Consequently, detecting a <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> requires competition authorities to apply a complex imputation test, which in turn requires various methodological choices that can determine the outcome of the investigation. The principal purpose of the dissertation is to determine whether the European Commission's <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> decisions are consistent with EU case law. The dissertation examines two alternative hypotheses. Under hypothesis A, <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> is presented as a deviation from the essential facilities doctrine, which could be seen as an expression of regulatory competition law. Hypothesis B assumes that it constitutes another form of vertical foreclosure, the main question then being under what exact conditions foreclosure is likely in network industries where the <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> doctrine traditionally applies. Two conclusions follow from the analysis. First, <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> constitutes another theory of vertical foreclosure, and accordingly cannot be seen as an unjustified deviation from refusal to deal and essential facilities cases. Second, to ensure that the theory of harm in <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> cases is credible, competition authorities could enhance their current analytical framework by regularly reviewing various additional elements, in particular the extent to which the wholesale product is important for downstream competition...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse how the <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> {{developed}} within the reasoning of the European Union. <b>Margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> is a special type of abuse of dominant position. This type of abuse has massively developed in last years. However, we cannot {{say that it is}} totally new form of abuse as we can find certain cases that concern <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> already in the 70 s. Nevertheless, especially because of the liberalisation of network industries in the 90 s, this abuse has substantially spread up and because of that there was a necessity to answer certain questions that were unclear until that time. This thesis is composed of four main chapters that are further composed of particular subchapters for the purpose to analyse this development. Chapter one is dedicated to general characteristic of the <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze.</b> This abuse is first of all classified as a special type of the abuse of dominant position according to article 102 TFEU. Afterwards, the chapter concerns about the definition of this abuse and its particular legal and economical characters. This all from theoretical point of view.

40|$|From its {{inception}} {{the computer industry}} has been characterised by fast paced change and future uncertainty. The rapid growth and profitability experienced by companies in the 70 ’s and 80 ’s have been replaced by: • Growth, in terms of profitability, is slowing rapidly. • Competition has intensified as entry barriers and boundaries drop. Product segments have shifted from large scale computers to PCs and workstations. • Profit <b>margins</b> have been <b>squeezed.</b> The advent of the direct selling manufacturers with their lower costs brought with them ‘Price wars’, which still continue as prices drop constantly, <b>squeezing</b> <b>margins.</b> The traditional three tier structure came under threat when Michael Dell pioneered the direct selling model for PCs. It was since copied by other companies most notably Gateway 2000. Even established companies like Digital and IBM experimented with it {{before returning to the}} indirect dealer channel. However, now it is not as straightforward as direct and indirect. All the players in this fiercely competitive market are looking to other channels to increase their customer base and consequently their market share.

40|$|Over 100 GPS sites {{measured}} in 2008 - 2013 in Peru provide {{new insights into}} the present-day crustal deformation of the 2200 km long Peruvian margin. This <b>margin</b> is <b>squeezed</b> between the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate at the South America trench axis and the westward continental subduction of the South American Plate beneath the Eastern Cordillera and Subandean orogenic wedge. Continental active faults and GPS data reveal the rigid motion of a Peruvian Forearc Sliver that extends from the oceanic trench axis to the Western-Eastern Cordilleras boundary and moves southeastward at 4 - 5 mm/yr relative to a stable South America reference frame. GPS data indicate that the Subandean shortening increases southward by 2 to 4 mm/yr. In a Peruvian Sliver reference frame, the residual GPS data indicate that the interseismic coupling along the Nazca megathrust is highly heterogeneous. Coupling in northern Peru is shallow and coincides with the site of previous moderate-sized and shallow tsunami-earthquakes. Deep coupling occurs in central and southern Peru, where repeated large and great megathrust earthquakes have occurred. The strong correlation between highly coupled areas and large ruptures suggests that seismic asperities are persistent features of the megathrust. Creeping segments appear at the extremities of great ruptures and where oceanic fracture zones and ridges enter the subduction zone, suggesting that these subducting structures {{play a major role in}} the seismic segmentation of the Peruvian margin.

40|$|Notwithstanding {{assertions of}} greater {{harmonization}} and convergence between U.

In contrast, in a series of decisions in liberalized telecommunications markets, the EU courts, in applying an “as efficient competitor test,” have focused on the preservation of competitive rivalry as “equality of opportunity. ” This significantly broadens the potential liability for a <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> in the European Union and reconstitutes EU competition law as a form of de facto regulation in liberalized markets.

This article evaluates this divergence in the approach to the regulation of a price or <b>margin</b> <b>squeeze</b> in the United States and the European Union and traces these approaches to differing conceptions of dominant firm regulation, which in turn have informed different understandings of the regulation of a refusal to supply and the intersection of competition law with sector-specific regulation...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 3 rd World Aviation Congress and Exposition, Anaheim, CA, September 28 - 30, 1998. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine ways in which to implement probabilistic design methods in the aircraft engine preliminary design process. Specifically, the focus is on analytically determining the impact of uncertainty in engine component performance on the overall performance of a notional large commercial transport, particularly the impact on design range, fuel burn, and engine weight. The emphasis is twofold: first is to find ways to reduce the impact of this uncertainty through appropriate engine cycle selections, and second is on finding ways to leverage existing design <b>margin</b> to <b>squeeze</b> more performance out of current technology. One of the fundamental results shown herein is that uncertainty in component performance has a significant impact on the overall aircraft performance (it is on t he same order of magnitude as the impact of the cycle itself). However, this paper shows that uncertainties in component efficiencies, pressure losses, and cooling flow losses do not have a significant influence on the variance of aircraft performance. This paper also shows that the probabilistic method is very useful for formulating direct trades of design margin against performance or other figures of merit such as engine weight, thus enabling the existing design margin to be capitalized upon in the interest of obtaining better system performance. In terms of a comparison between techniques, one can conclude that the probabilistic approach is inherently more computationally intensive that the deterministic approach. It therefore behooves the designer to choose wisely when setting up the problem in order to avoid unnecessary work. However, a properly formulated probabilistic method provides a much clearer picture of how the various system trades another and enables the ultimate cycle selection to be analytically determined based on the level of risk that is consistent with program objectives...|$|R

The core of which is due to regional ecological differences among other factors. In addition, the purported ability of marketing participants to influence the conduct of the market and respond to certain price shocks more faster/slowly than others warrants examining the regional maize market linkages within the past decade. Using regional monthly wholesale price data from 2002 – 2010, the consistent threshold autoregressive model is employed for the study considering the robustness and the limitations of other approaches. Results indicate that regional maize markets are integrated. Bidirectional market interdependence was found between market pairs both in the short and long run. The long run causality was however heterogeneous with respect to positive and negative shocks. The nature of price adjustment is asymmetric and traders respond quickly when market <b>margins</b> are <b>squeezed</b> than when stretched for all market pairs except between Brong Ahafo and Greater Accra market pairings. The time path needed for adjustment ranged from 7 to 26 months. The minimum adjustment time was 7 months occurring between Brong Ahafo - Greater Accra markets linkage for positive deviations and Brong Ahafo - Ashanti market for negative deviations. The recent expansion in communication infrastructure motivates the regional market integration. This implies that resources should be allocated to transportation development; the main hindrance to trade. The suboptimal condition of asymmetry is also motivated by inventory behaviour of traders but this remains a testable hypothesis. Traders in Greater Accra are slow in passing on price increases for the fear of loss of goodwill and/or loss of customer share given the multiple sources of supply. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of powerful, big box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot has enhanced the interest among both academics and non-academics in {{the effects of}} countervailing power. One of the major concerns expressed by some commentators is that rising countervailing power will lead to poorer product selection for consumers. They believe that manufacturers of some product varieties {{will be forced to}} exit as their profit <b>margins</b> are <b>squeezed</b> by the power retailers. From the perspective of economic theory, however, it is not obvious that a retailer with countervailing power would have incentives to reduce the variety of products available to its customers. Indeed, so far there has been no formal analysis to determine whether such concern over product diversity is warranted. The existing theoretical analyses of countervailing power focus on the price effects, i. e., whether consumer prices will increase or decrease as a result of increased buyer {{power in the hands of}} retailers (von Ungern-Sternberg 1996, Dobson and Waterson 1997, Chen 2003). The objective of this paper is to analyse the effects of countervailing power on product diversity. In the model, product diversity is measured by the number of differentiated products sold by retailers in equilibrium. There are several retailers, but only one is large enough to possess countervailing power against the manufacturer(s). In the upstream market, I consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, there is a monopolist manufacturer who sets the number of product varieties to be produced. In the second scenario, products are supplied by monopolistically competitive firms, with each firm selling one variety. The focus of my analysis will be on how a rise in the large retailer's countervailing power, measured by its ability to capture a larger share of the joint profit, will affect the equilibrium number of varieties produced.

The country’s banks face <b>squeezing</b> <b>margins</b> due to their heavy reliance on interest income, while their non-interest income remains small. To compensate, they are under increasing pressure to expand into non-banking activities like insurance (KB Financial Group) and derivatives (e.g. Woori Finance) rather unsuccessfully. South Korean banks remain weak in investment banking, which requires thorough risk control. Consumer credit offers little room for growth, given the already high levels of debt among Korean households. Also, penetrating foreign markets has been a difficult, due to their lack of brand value and international networks (Jung-a, 2013). Moreover, the profitability of the four main Seoul-based companies, Shinhan Financial Group Co. Ltd., Hana Financial Group Inc., KB Financial Group Inc. and Woori Bank dropped for two consecutive years from 2013. Their combined profit declined by half, to 4.78 trillion won (US$ 4 billion) at the end of 2013 from 9.19 trillion won (US$ 8 billion) 2 years earlier.|$|R
40|$|With {{slowdown}} in {{the growth rate of}} petroleum product consumption, petroleum business is maturing and becoming commoditized. In maturing industries, cost leadership and operational excellence is important, but it is not sustainable. Inevitably, competition will <b>squeeze</b> <b>margins,</b> even for the cost leaders. In order to sustain growth, companies should continuously explore potential enlargement of its offering vis-a-vis its competitors and customers' expectation. A set of industry case studies in petroleum, energy utility, steel and airline industries have been performed to identify opportunities for differentiation and to examines how the successful companies manage the innovation in developing sustainable growth strategy. Analysis of industry case study identified some important differentiating factors and approaches. It suggests, in general, that successful companies focus on Customer Solution. The customer solution reflects a shift in strategic attention from product to customer-from product economics to customer economics and customer's experience. To capture a value position and enhance profitability-in other words, to decommoditize the commodity product/service-they redefine its services to reach into the customer's own business to solve more fundamental problems. They segmented the market to better design and deliver tailored, customer-specific services bundled with commodity products. Unless companies are going to compete mainly on price, value added solutions are a necessity. Innovation, and more importantly effective implementation of innovation, is a prerequisite for a sustainable growth. In conclusion, I made suggestion for one company to achieve sustainable growth and recommendations for future research. by YongTae Lee. Thesis (S. M. M. O. T.)
