5|$|Diamonds {{can also}} form under other {{naturally}} occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of <b>micrometer</b> and nanometer sizes, known as microdiamonds or nanodiamonds respectively, {{have been found}} in meteorite impact craters. Such impact events create shock zones of high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond formation. Impact-type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters. Popigai crater in Russia may have the world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|Electron-beam {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a <b>micrometer.</b> This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|The Creppings were lords of {{the manor}} {{followed}} by the Leigh or Legh family. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, held the manor from 1363 to 1370 and Simon Simeon, whose will mentioned coal mines, from 1401–1406. The Leighs held the manor {{for much of the}} time between 1300 until 1697 when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling of Felling in Durham. The Leighs once occupied New Hall whose name is recalled in the street names in the area. William Gascoigne, who invented the <b>micrometer</b> and died fighting for the Royalists at Marston Moor in 1644, was another resident of New Hall.|$|E

5|$|The membrane-bound {{form of an}} {{antibody}} may {{be called}} a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It {{is part of the}} B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of signal transduction. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 <b>micrometer</b> in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, <b>micrometer</b> and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 <b>micrometer</b> moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E

40|$|Spectra of 3 <b>micrometers</b> {{emission}} features {{have been}} obtained at several positions within the reflection nebulae NGC 1333 SVS 3 and NGC 2023. Strong variations of the relative intensities of the 3. 29 <b>micrometers</b> feature and its most prominent satellite band at 3. 40 <b>micrometers</b> are found. It is shown that (i) the 3. 40 <b>micrometers</b> band is too intense {{with respect to the}} 3. 29 <b>micrometers</b> band at certain positions to arise from hot band emission alone, (ii) the 3. 40 <b>micrometers</b> band can be reasonably well matched by new laboratory spectra of gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with alkyl (-CH 3) side groups, and (iii) the variations in the 3. 40 <b>micrometers</b> to 3. 29 <b>micrometers</b> band intensity ratios are consistent with the photochemical erosion of alkylated PAHs. We conclude that the 3. 40 <b>micrometers</b> emission feature is attributable to -CH 3 side groups on PAH molecules. We predict a value of 0. 5 for the peak intensity ratio of the 3. 40 and 3. 29 <b>micrometers</b> emission bands from free PAHs in the diffuse interstellar medium, which would correspond to a proportion of one methyl group for four peripheral hydrogens. We also compare the 3 <b>micrometers</b> spectrum of the proto-planetary nebula IRAS 05341 + 0852 with the spectrum of the planetary nebula IRAS 21282 + 5050. We suggest that a photochemical evolution of the initial aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture formed in the outflow is responsible for the changes observed in the 3 <b>micrometers</b> emission spectra of these objects...|$|R
5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a <b>micrometer</b> in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E

Optical components fabricated on Si are restricted to operation at wavelengths below 1. 1 <b>micrometers.</b> However, the incorporation of SiGe in Si devices enables operation to be extended to the communications wavelengths of 1. 3 <b>micrometers</b> and 1. 5 <b>micrometers.</b> Optical modulation in a Si/Si 0. 85 Ge 0. 15 /Si, MBE grown, waveguide p-i-n diode was experimentally investigated at a wavelength of 1. 3 <b>micrometers.</b> When the waveguide p-i-n diode is forward biased, the injected free carriers absorb the light propagating in the intrinsic layer thereby giving a strong modulation of the device output intensity. The modulator, grown on a 2 X 1019 cm- 3 n++-Si substrate, consists of a 2. 5 <b>micrometers</b> thick, 7 X 1015 cm- 3 n-Si layer, a 0. 1 <b>micrometers</b> thick i-Si 0. 85 Ge 0. 15 guiding layer, a 2 mumm thick, 2. 5 X 1016 cm- 3 p-Si layer and a 0. 1 <b>micrometers</b> thick, 2 X 1020 cm- 3 p++) -Si contact layer.

The effect of shape, size and spacing of features has been studied for structures plated into Laminar AX moulds.
