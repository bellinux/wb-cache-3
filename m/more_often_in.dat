5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> {{people with}} epilepsy, depending {{partly on the}} epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.|$|E
5|$|HSP occurs <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an {{upper respiratory tract}} infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common vasculitis in children.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs missed more cricket with {{injuries}} and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed {{more than a}} third of Surrey's matches. However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> singles than in his earlier years.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{believed}} to occur when there is susceptibility, {{or a lack of}} immune system resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several genes that are found predominantly in individuals of East Asian descent. The highest incidence occurs among Japanese people, followed by Koreans. DPB occurs <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> males, and usually begins around age 40. It was recognized as a distinct new disease in the early 1960s, and was formally named diffuse panbronchiolitis in 1969.|$|E

Active {{infection}} occurs <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> {{two or more}} stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E

5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> lesbians, but it {{is unclear}} if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|Birds forage singly or {{in pairs}} in summer, and <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> larger flocks in autumn and winter, {{during which time}} {{they are more likely}} to loiter around people and urban areas. They {{occasionally}} associate with Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) or common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with grey currawongs (S.versicolor) and satin bowerbirds (Ptilinorhynchus violaceus). The species has been reported stealing food from other birds such as the Australian hobby (Falco longipennis), collared sparrowhawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus), and sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the Australian National University showed that white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) nestlings became silent when they heard the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.|$|E

Isolated optic involvement, preservation of the optic nerve configuration, smaller tumour size, absence of symptoms, stability or slow growth, and even spontaneous regression are <b>more</b> <b>often</b> observed <b>in</b> patients with NF 1. In comparison, chiasmal involvement, altered optic nerve configuration, greater tumour size, presence of symptoms, and local growth are <b>more</b> <b>often</b> encountered <b>in</b> patients without NF 1 [45, 47].|$|R

5|$|Chapman was {{unavailable}} for the Test series in South Africa {{in the winter}} of 1927–28, but was a certainty to lead the MCC team to Australia in 1928–29. The selectors wished him to play more regularly, so he played <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> 1928 than any other season. He began in good form, but was never as effective as in 1927. Although his captaincy continued to be highly regarded, there were concerns in the press over his increasing weight, although these were offset by his impressive fielding in that season's Tests. He captained England to a 3–0 series win over West Indies, who were playing their first Test matches, and scored one fifty. In total, he scored 967 first-class runs at 37.19.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (<b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
