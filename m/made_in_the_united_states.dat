25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, work resumed again. Although Roebling {{operated}} his own wire mill at Trenton, New Jersey, the bridge company purchased one million pounds of wire from Richard Johnson at Manchester, England for the cables that would span {{the width of the}} river. Roebling had used Johnson's wire for one of his other bridges. He preferred it over wire <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> because it was of better quality and greater tensile strength. Anchorages on both shores were constructed of limestone base and a freestone finish. Eleven ton iron anchors were embedded in each block, securing cables with wrought iron chain links of Roebling's patent. These links resembled almost exactly the ones his son, Washington Roebling, would use {{in the construction of the}} Brooklyn Bridge. The Civil War depleted the work force on the project, hindering speed and efficiency until its end.|$|E

25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

[...] The animals and parts of animals had to be searched for in corners and under boxes in the park district storage building. Besides a large number of horses, 2more giraffes, a lion, and a tiger were found. Photographs of the animals were sent to Frederic Fried, an expert in carousels, who confirmed that the animals were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> not Germany, probably before 1900.

500|$|On 17 January 2012, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie {{signed into}} law a bill that legalized direct {{shipping}} from wineries to consumers, and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 offsite retail sales outlets in the state. The law allows wineries that make less than 250,000 gallons of wine annually, which includes all of New Jersey's wineries, to ship up to 12 cases of wine to per year to any person over 21 in New Jersey or any other state that allows wine shipments. Because this prohibits 90% of wine <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> but does not affect New Jersey's small wineries, proponents of the law fear that {{this section of the}} law will be struck down as unconstitutional.
