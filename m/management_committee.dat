40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of Natal, 2002. The study explores {{communication}} links {{existing in}} the management of primary schools in Lesotho. The frequency of the links as well as the content and channels used in the transmission of messages between the principals, advisory school <b>committees</b> and <b>management</b> <b>committees</b> were investigated. The Lesotho primary education management system involves the principals, advisory school <b>committees</b> and <b>management</b> <b>committees.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>committees</b> in Lesotho manage all primary schools under their jurisdiction. Principals manage schools on daily basis on behalf of the <b>management</b> <b>committees.</b> Advisory school <b>committees</b> advise the <b>management</b> <b>committees</b> on all matters relating to education. Questionnaires, interviews and school record books were the research tools used in this study. The responses revealed that links exist between the above bodies even though the links are inadequate in most instances. The way through which messages are sent vary from link to link but most of the links are in the form of meetings. These meetings are often below the stipulated number in the country's Education Act...|$|R

40|$|Literature on {{effectiveness}} {{indicates the}} interest of researchers in the role that teams play within organisations. The conclusion is that different variables affect team performance effectiveness. A further analysis of literature on team effectiveness enabled the researcher to develop a matrix of assessment of team effectiveness from these variables {{to serve as a}} benchmark. In addition to this, a matrix consisting of perceived variables of team effectiveness was constructed from the outcome of in-depth interviews and focus group sessions with the members of <b>management</b> <b>committees</b> of community-based organisations (CBOs) based within Port Elizabeth townships. These matrixes were used by the researcher to assess the operationalisation of these variables within the CBO <b>management</b> <b>committees.</b> The research indicates that <b>management</b> <b>committees</b> either did not operationalise these variables within their teams or did not do so to their fullest capacity. The overall outcome of these assessments indicates the areas that require attention, and provides opportunity for group practitioners to assist CBO <b>management</b> <b>committees</b> to enhance their effectiveness as teams. It is suggested that group practitioners together with members of CBO <b>management</b> <b>committees,</b> embark as a task team project to develop a strategy to refine the perceived variables guided by those emphasised by experts within this field, to strategise a clear path towards enhanced team effectivenes...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{political}} economy critique that contributes to current scholarship on community radio and development by examining {{the question of the}} management of six networks from Mali, Mozambique and Uganda.

The article also examines how <b>management</b> <b>committees</b> approach their work in the age of new Information Communication Technologies (especially mobile phones, computers and the Internet), and whether there is a gender digital divide within such committees. At the centre of the current discussion, therefore, is an attempt to understand the flow and contestation of power within community radio <b>management</b> <b>committees.</b> </p...|$|R
5|$|Even before Bradford City were {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the Football League, the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May. These were followed by four more players joining the club; Sam Bright, George Robinson, Peter O'Rourke and Jimmy Millar. Despite not having enough players to field a full side, four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league <b>management</b> <b>committee</b> meeting, when the club was elected into the Second Division. Money was raised to fund the club, including at least £2,000 from sponsors, a balance of £500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament. Bradford City also took over Manningham's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures.|$|E

However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams from the highest tier of a nation's league system could enter.

5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the <b>management</b> <b>committee</b> {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which he was supposed to play dance music, to rehearse his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E

On June 23, 2008, the Brazilian president formed the Government Action <b>Management</b> <b>Committee,</b> under the patronage of the Minister of Sport Orlando Silva, which coordinated Federal government actions during the bid process. Another act created the Olympic Development Authority (ODA) on January 17, 2009, to coordinate public services and infrastructure delivery for eventual Games in Rio de Janeiro, based in the pioneer model developed by Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Under legal aspects, the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) would be the entity responsible for planning and staging the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. According to the IOC, the existing legislation was sufficient to enable the organization of the Games and would be amended or modified to suit the Olympic Charter if needed. The Ministry of External Relations and the Ministry of Labor guaranteed the entry, exit and working arrangements for Games personnel. People in possession of a valid passport and an Olympic or Paralympic Identity and Accreditation Card, in lieu of a visa, will be able to enter the Brazilian territory.|$|E
