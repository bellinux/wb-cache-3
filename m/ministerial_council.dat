25|$|The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have powers {{similar to}} those devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy {{representing}} unionist and nationalist members of the Assembly. Arlene Foster (Democratic Unionist Party) and Martin McGuinness (Sinn Féin) were First Minister and deputy First Minister respectively until 2017. Devolution to Northern Ireland is contingent on participation by the Northern Ireland administration in the North-South <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Council,</b> where the Northern Ireland Executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the Government of Ireland. The British and Irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting Northern Ireland through the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which assumes {{the responsibilities of the}} Northern Ireland administration in the event of its non-operation.|$|E

25|$|Today, Irish and British {{citizens}} are accorded equivalent reciprocal rights and entitlements (with {{a small number}} of minor exceptions) and a Common Travel Area exists between Ireland, United Kingdom, and the Crown Dependencies. The British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference acts as an official forum for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on matters of mutual interest generally, and with respect to Northern Ireland in particular. Two other bodies, the British–Irish Council and the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly act as a forum for discussion between the executives and assemblies, respectively, of the region, including the devolved regions in the UK and the three Crown dependencies. Co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including the execution of common policies in certain areas, occurs through the North/South <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Council.</b> In 2014, the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny described {{the relationship between the two}} countries as being at 'an all time high'.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} dispute {{has yet to}} be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi. Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides, little progress was made under the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (1993–2003). His successor Mikheil Saakashvili (elected 2004) made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority. Having successfully {{put an end to the}} de facto independence of the southwestern province of Ajaria in May 2004, he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia. After the 2004 clashes, the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention. On 25 January 2005, President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe session in Strasbourg. Late in October, the US government and the OSCE expressed their support to the Georgian action plan presented by Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli at the OSCE Permanent Council at Vienna on 27 October 2005. On 6 December, the OSCE <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Council</b> in Ljubljana adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan which was subsequently rejected by the South Ossetian de facto authorities.|$|E
25|$|At {{midnight on}} 1 December 1999, direct London rule {{came to an}} end in Northern Ireland when power was {{formally}} devolved to the new Northern Ireland Assembly. On 2 December 1999, power was devolved to the North/South <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Council</b> and the British-Irish Council when commencement orders for the British-Irish Agreement came into effect. However, Article 4(2) of the British-Irish Agreement (the Agreement between the British and Irish governments for the implementation of the Belfast Agreement) required the two governments to notify each other in writing of the completion of the requirements for the entry into force of the Belfast Agreement. Entry into force was to be upon the receipt of the later of the two notifications. The British government agreed to participate in a televised ceremony at Iveagh House in Dublin, the Irish department of foreign affairs. Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, attended early on 2 December 1999. He exchanged notifications with David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister. Shortly after the ceremony, at 10.30 am, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern signed the declaration formally amending Articles 2 & 3 of the Irish Constitution. He then announced to the Dáil that the British-Irish Agreement had entered into force (including certain supplementary agreements concerning the Belfast Agreement).|$|E
