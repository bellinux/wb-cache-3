For n= 0, this model reproduces the known universal properties of the θ point describing the collapse of a polymer.

40|$|Abstract. We comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{article by}} Fujimoto (1997 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 30 3779) where the exact {{equilibrium}} crystal shape (ECS) {{in the critical}} Q-state Potts <b>model</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square lattice was calculated, and its equivalence with ECS in the Ising model was established. We confirm these results, giving their alternative derivation applying the transformation properties of the one-particle dispersion relation in the six-vertex model. It is shown, that this dispersion relation is identical with that in <b>the</b> Ising <b>model</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square lattice. In paper [1] Fujimoto determined the equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) in <b>the</b> Q-state Potts <b>model</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square lattice at the first order transition temperature. Fujimoto claimed [1, 2], that ECS is universal for a wide class of models, including the eightvertex model [2, 3], and <b>the</b> Ising <b>model</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square lattice [4]. The origin of this universality is still not well understood. The subject of the this comment is to show, that the one-particle spectrum in the six-vertex model (which {{is known to be}} equivalent to the critical Q-state Potts model), and in <b>the</b> Ising <b>model</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square lattice are also the same.
