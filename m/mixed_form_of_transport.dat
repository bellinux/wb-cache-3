40|$|This {{symposium}} presents {{research from}} different contexts {{to improve our}} collective understanding of a variety <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> service delivery, be they mixed contracting {{at the level of}} the market (which is more common in the U.

The articles included in this special symposium examine the factors that give rise to <b>mixed</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> service delivery (e. g., economic and fiscal stress, regulatory flexibility, geography, management) and how these factors impact their design and operation. Articles also explore the performance <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> service delivery relative to more conventional arrangements like contracted or direct service delivery. The articles contribute to a better theoretical and conceptual understanding <b>of</b> mixed/hybrid <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> services delivery...|$|R

50|$|Motorcycle taxis are a {{very common}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> {{unlicensed}} <b>transport</b> in Indonesia, where they are known as ojek.

Because of traffic, ojek are often the fastest <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport,</b> especially in Jakarta. Many people choose them over taxicabs, which are safer, but slower and more expensive.|$|R

The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to : (1) find out the forms ofcode-mixing, that are used by VISI FM 2 ̆ 7 s presenters. (2) find out the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> code- <b>mixing</b> that is dominantly used by VISI FM 2 ̆ 7 s presenter. This research applied descriptive quantitative method. The object of this study is presenter of VISI FM namely Deris and Lia. The tape recorder is used for collecting the data where the utterence of presenters were recorded while presenting that program. After collecting the data, the writer found that <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> code <b>mixing</b> occured in the presenters 2 ̆ 7 s utterances are code <b>mixing</b> in <b>forms</b> words, phrases, and sentences.

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> {{epilepsy}} - the {{coexistence of}} convulsive and non-convulsive epilepsy {{in the same}} animal - have hardly been described. <b>Mixed</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> epilepsy are refractory: {{they are the most}} difficult to treat. The possibility of the existence of audiogenic convulsive fits in WAG/Rij rats with absence epilepsy was studied in a large group of young and adult WAG/Rij. In 30 % of adult rats sound stimulation provoked an audiogenic fit of moderate intensity. The fit followed a two-wave pattern with a remarkable stable motionless interval between two excitation periods. Up to 20 % of young WAG/Rij rats were susceptible to audiogenic seizures with a longer latency, lower intensity, and with a simpler pattern than in adult rats. Since WAG/Rij rats demonstrate spontaneous spike-wave discharges characterising absence-epilepsy, the described subpopulation of rats seem to be a good subject to investigate characteristics and mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> epilepsy...|$|R

40|$|A {{temporal}} {{finite element}} method based on a <b>mixed</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the Hamiltonian weak principle is developed for dynamics and optimal control problems. The <b>mixed</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton's weak principle contains both displacements and momenta as primary variables that are expanded in terms of nodal values and simple polynomial shape functions. Unlike other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton's principle, however, time derivatives of the momenta and displacements do not appear therein; instead, only the virtual momenta and virtual displacements are differentiated with respect to time. Based on the duality that is observed to exist between the <b>mixed</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton's weak principle and variational principles governing classical optimal control problems, a temporal finite element formulation of the latter can be developed in a rather straightforward manner. Several well-known problems in dynamics and optimal control are illustrated. The example dynamics problem involves a time-marching problem. As optimal control examples, elementary trajectory optimization problems are treated...|$|R
