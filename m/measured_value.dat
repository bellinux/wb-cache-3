5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a <b>measured</b> <b>value</b> with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.

5|$|In 2015, {{the first}} {{ionization}} energy of lawrencium was measured, using the isotope 256Lr. The <b>measured</b> <b>value,</b> , agreed {{very well with}} the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4.963(15)eV, and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides. This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides, and supports the s2p configuration as the 7p1/2 electron {{is expected to be}} only weakly bound. This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements (and hence being the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium, instead of lanthanum and actinium), and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways. Given that the s2p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the IUPAC definition ("An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell"), unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and the group 3 elements, with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified. It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to curium, which has an 5f76d17s2 configuration, and show the expected 5f146d17s2 configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the <b>measured</b> <b>value</b> of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

However, measured levels differed considerably among measurement kits available in Japan until 2003.

25|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{dispersed}} phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The <b>measured</b> <b>value</b> of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid.

500|$|An age of no {{more than}} 750 years for the PSR B1937+21 was at odds with the {{observations}} of the region in other wavelengths. No optical supernova remnant, nor bright x-ray source, had been observed {{in the vicinity of the}} PSR B1937+21. If PSR B1937+21 was that young, it would not have had time to move far from the site at which it formed. As neutron stars are formed as the result of supernova explosions, evidence of the explosion should be nearby for a young pulsar. If it was that young, it would also be expected to still be hot, in which case the thermal radiation from PSR B1937+21 would be observable at x-ray wavelengths. Venkatraman Radhakrishnan and G. Srinivasan used the lack of observed supernova remnant to argue that PSR B1937+21 had not formed with such a fast period, but instead had been [...] "spun up" [...] by a companion star which essentially gave the pulsar its angular momentum, a mechanism now generally used to explain millisecond pulsars. They also made a theoretical estimate of the necessary spin down rate to be 1 seconds per second. Backer et al. revised their estimate of the upper limit of the spin down rate just a month after the initial discovery, to 1 seconds per second, but the currently <b>measured</b> <b>value</b> is more nearly in line with the theoretical estimate, at 1.05 seconds per second.

500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local {{gravitational}} acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the <b>measured</b> <b>value</b> was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E
