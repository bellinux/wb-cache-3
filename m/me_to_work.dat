500|$|Heynckes {{immediately}} requested signings in {{all three}} positions: defence, midfield and attack. Although the club scouted Hanuch (signed by Sporting) and Claudio Husaín for the midfield, the only players to join the team were Maniche and Marco Freitas (both on the club payroll and returning from one-year loans to Alverca). For attack Benfica considered Barcelona player Giovanni (who said, [...] "It would be an honour for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Heynckes") but ultimately signed Chano, a 34-year-old Spanish player from CD Tenerife.|$|E
500|$|All Pixar {{films to}} date have been computer-animated features, but WALL-E {{so far has been}} the only Pixar film to not be {{completely}} animated, as it featured a small amount of live-action footage. 1906, the live-action film by Brad Bird based on a screenplay and novel by James Dalessandro about the 1906 earthquake, was in development but has since been abandoned by Bird and Pixar. Bird has stated that he was [...] "interested in moving into the live-action realm with some projects" [...] while [...] "staying at Pixar [...] it's a very comfortable environment for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Furtado, in the studio, Timbaland {{had some}} beats that were [...] "already kind of halfway there; {{and then he}} had beats that he just had nucleuses of; and then other stuff we jammed together". While she was working with Timbaland and Danja in Miami, Pharrell Williams {{introduced}} Furtado to reggaeton, a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to [...] "No Hay Igual" [...] "nearly on the spot". In an interview with MTV News, Furtado joked: [...] "Supposedly it was Pharrell's idea for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Tim [...] Jimmy Iovine, the head of my record label , might beg to differ." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{said that}} he had a backache, besides blisters on his hands, and that wheeling a heavy barrow did not agree with him. He added, with an easy assurance that drew a frown to the contractor's face, [...] "It's a considerable come-down for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard at all, and I was told you were generally good to a distressed countryman.

500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the book}} Heroism and Gender in War Films (2014), the lyrics of [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "outline the perfect woman". The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what you give <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with", the performers then offer an extensive list of examples and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as it fast unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they would much rather remain single: [...] "the kind of girl who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to go find herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons. You’ve got other plans".|$|E

2500|$|On 8 September 2008, Zico {{revealed}} {{that he would be}} interested taking over the vacant managers position at Newcastle United following the resignation of Kevin Keegan.

2500|$|Thayer {{was largely}} {{surrounded}} by women, be they his family, housekeepers, models or students. Biographer Ross Anderson believed {{that in his}} mind [...] "feminine virtue and aesthetic grandeur were inextricably linked"; Thayer felt that the press and even other artists contributed to the degradation of women by emphasizing their sexuality, rather than exalting their moral attributes. When he began to add wings to his figures in the late 1880s, he was making more obvious the transcendent qualities {{he saw in the}} female subject: Doubtless my lifelong passion for birds has helped to incline <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> wings into my pictures; but primarily I have put on wings probably more to symbolize an exalted atmosphere (above the realm of genre painting) where one need not explain the action of the figures." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 1, 1889, Wright {{married his}} first wife, Catherine Lee [...] "Kitty" [...] Tobin (1871–1959). The two had met around {{a year earlier}} during {{activities}} at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: [...] "Mr. Sullivan, if you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?" [...] With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot {{at the corner of}} Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of Oak Park. The existing Gothic Revival house was given to his mother, while a compact Shingle style house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.|$|E
2500|$|After {{not being}} given a {{contract}} with the Queensland Bulls for the 2007–08 season, Nash decided to try to restart his career by moving to the West Indies. Speaking of his decision, he said [...] "I was obviously very disappointed to miss out on a contract, but I pretty much got told {{it would be hard for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> my way back in again and I felt I still have something to offer". In October 2007, Nash was named in the Jamaican squad. Nash played a key role in Jamaica winning the KFC Cup. In the final, he scored 117 as his team beat Trinidad and Tobago by nine wickets. Nash finished the season with 422 first-class runs at 46.88 to his name from the domestic competition and was third in the batting averages. There was surprise in some quarters when Nash was not selected for the Test series against Australia in 2008.|$|E
