Her tests following surgery showed no cancer, and six months later <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Lee</b> went to a breast imaging center for a follow-up visit. Dr. Harris reviewed old imaging studies in preparation for her meeting with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Lee.</b> She looked at the mammogram that had been interpreted as normal by another radiologist, 18 months before <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Lee</b> was diagnosed with breast cancer. After careful examination, Dr. Harris noted a small, ill-defined density in the left breast. It was in the location where the cancer was diagnosed on the subsequent mammogram and, in retrospect, it most likely represented the cancer in an earlier stage. In her own mind, Dr. Harris believed that many radiologists, possibly even she herself, would have interpreted the mammogram as normal.
