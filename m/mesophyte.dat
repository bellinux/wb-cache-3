5000|$|<b>Mesophytes</b> {{generally}} {{require a}} more or less continuous water supply. They usually have larger, thinner leaves compared to xerophytes, sometimes with a greater number of stomata on the undersides of leaves. Because of their lack of particular xeromorphic adaptations, when they are exposed to extreme conditions they lose water rapidly, and are not tolerant of drought. <b>Mesophytes</b> are very intermediate in water use and needs. These plants are found in average conditions of temperature and moisture and grow in soil that has no water logging.The roots of <b>mesophytes</b> are well developed, branched and provided with a root cap.The shoot system is well organised [...]The stem is generally aerial, branched, straight, thick and hard.

50|$|Adult argali eat 16 - 19 kg of food a day. The {{vegetation}} {{preferred by}} the species varies based on elevation and area. In higher elevations, they predominantly eat grasses, sedges, and forbs. At midelevation habitats, they more regularly feed on bushes and <b>mesophyte</b> grasses. In the lowest ranges and the spurs of deserts, grasses and sedges again predominate, but often of different species than the high-elevation ones. In north-central Kazakhstan, sprouts, leaves, flowers, and fruits are significant to the diet all year, whereas {{they appear to}} be a rare dietary supplement over the rest of the range. Water is needed by argali, which is rarely a problem for animals living at high elevation, where melting snow and small waterways are regularly encountered. In drier climes, argali may travel several kilometers in search of water. When available, argali readily consume saline soil.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mesophytes</b> are plants {{living in}} lands of {{temperate}} zone, which grow in well-watered soil. They can easily compensate the water lost by transpiration through absorbing {{water from the}} soil. To prevent excessive transpiration they have developed a waterproof external covering called cuticle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mesophytes</b> do {{not have}} any {{specific}} morphological adaptations. They usually have broad, flat and green leaves; an extensive fibrous root system to absorb water; and the ability to develop perennating organs such as corms, rhizomes and bulbs to store food and water for use during drought.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mesophytes</b> do {{not have}} any special {{internal}} structure. Epidermis is single layered usually with obvious stomata and large cortex. Opening or closing of stomata is related to water availability. In sufficient supply of water stomata remain open while in limited supply of water stomata are closed to prevent excessive transpiration leading to wilting.|$|R

50|$|Waterlogging {{refers to}} the {{saturation}} of soil with water. Soil may be regarded as waterlogged when it is nearly saturated with water {{much of the time}} such that its air phase is restricted and anaerobic conditions prevail. In extreme cases of prolonged waterlogging, anaerobiosis occurs, the roots of <b>mesophytes</b> suffer, and the subsurface reducing atmosphere leads to such processes as denitrification, methanogenesis, and the reduction of iron and manganese oxides.|$|R
50|$|For example, in {{hot weather}} they may {{overheat}} and suffer from temperature stress. They have no specific adaptations to overcome this, but, if there is enough water in the soil to allow this, they can increase their rate of transpiration by opening their stomata, thus meaning some heat is removed by the evaporating water. However these plants can only tolerate saturated soil for {{a certain amount of}} time without a warm temperature. In dry weather they may suffer from water stress (losing more water via transpiration than can be gained from the soil). Again they have no specific adaptations to overcome this, and can only respond by closing their stomata to prevent further transpiration. This does actually have some benefits as it reduces the surface area of the leaves exposed to the atmosphere, which reduces transpiration. Prolonged periods of dehydration, however, can lead to permanent wilting, cell plasmolysis, and subsequent death. Since <b>mesophytes</b> prefer moist, well drained soils, most crops are <b>mesophytes.</b> Some examples are: corn (maize), privet, lilac, goldenrod, clover, and oxeye daisy...|$|R

To better understand the drought-adaptive traits of three dominant species, Artemisia annua as contrastive species was selected from the loess hilly, which is a common annual or perennial <b>mesophyte</b> living in areas with adequate soil water content (Chen et al. 1993). According this research, it well elucidated that the primary principles of Artemisia species changed with the secondary succession on the Loess Plateau.|$|E

Cumulatively, these changes in local fuels diminish or extinguish fires {{in close proximity to}} individual trees or small clumps. The classical examples of this protective strategy are oak “domes” of Q. geminata that persist within frequently burned Southeastern pine-oak savannas (Figure 1; Guerin 1993), and the lake-margin Q. virginiana forests that intermix with frequently burned uplands (Cavender-Bares et al. 2004 [...]...|$|E

The water-recharging project neglects {{the fact that that}} it is flooding that controls the process of Populus euphratica colonizing on the bare surface, but focuses on groundwater influence on vegetation. The flooding control deviates inherent laws of riparian forests development, so the natural regeneration of riparian forests is checked. The response scope of riparian plants on groundwater uplift is extremely narrow, and most riparian communities have not been optimized. No seedlings of dominant species are found in flooding areas because their physio-ecological characteristics are ignored.

40|$|Diaspore {{characteristics}} of 22 families, including 102 genera and 150 species (55 represented by seeds and 95 by fruits) from the Gurbantunggut Desert were analyzed for diaspore biological characteristics (mass, shape, color, and appendage type). The diaspore mass and shape {{were significantly different}} in phylogeny group (APG) and dispersal syndromes; vegetative periods significantly affected diaspore mass, but not diaspore shape; and ecotypes did not significantly affect diaspore mass and shape, but xerophyte species had larger diaspore mass than <b>mesophyte</b> species. Unique stepwise ANOVA results showed that variance in diaspore mass and shape among these 150 species was largely dependent upon phylogeny and dispersal syndromes. Therefore, {{it was suggested that}} phylogeny may constrain diaspore mass, and as dispersal syndromes may be related to phylogeny, they also constrained diaspore mass and shape. Diaspores of 85 species (56. 67 %) had appendages, including 26 with wings/bracts, 18 with pappus/hair, 14 with hooks/spines, 10 with awns, and 17 with other types of appendages. Different traits (mass, shape, color, appendage, and dispersal syndromes) of diaspore decided plants forming different adapted strategies in the desert.

The Lateglacial and early Holocene periods are characterized by arid conditions with a stable landscape dominated by pinewoods and steppe until ca. 7780 cal yr BP, despite sedimentological evidence for large paleohydrological fluctuations in the paleolake. The most humid phase occurred between ca. 7780 and 5000 cal yr BP and was characterized by the maximum spread of <b>mesophytes</b> (e. g., Betula, Coorlus, Quercus faginea type), the expansion of a mixed Mediterranean oak woodland with evergreen Quercus as dominant forest communities and more frequent higher lake level periods.

Methods We analyzed the distribution of 24 permafrost wetland plant communities in the Da Hinggan Mountains using detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA). Species diversity, life forms and hydro- ecotypes of permafrost wetland plant communities were compared in three types of permafrost using multiple comparisons in ANOVA. Important findings The 24 permafrost wetland plant communities were classified into three groups according to three types of permafrost. From the predominantly continuous permafrost to the sparsely island permafrost to the predominantly continuous and island permafrost, shrub diversity decreased (p < 0. 05), herbaceous diversity increased(p < 0. 05), the percentage of <b>mesophytes</b> was 38. 5 %, 55. 9 % and 64. 4 %, respectively, the importance value decreased for helophytes (p < 0. 05) and increased for <b>mesophytes</b> and xerophiles (p < 0. 05), suggesting that the soil moisture tended to a moderate amount of moisture, and even drought.
