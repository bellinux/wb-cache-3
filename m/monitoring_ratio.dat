40|$|Objective: Several {{biomarkers}} {{may be used}} {{to detect}} harmful exposure and individual susceptibility to cancer. Monitoring of biomarkers related to exposure may {{have a significant effect on}} early detection of cell transformation, thereby aiding the primary prevention of various chronic and malignant diseases. Nurses who handle cytotoxic drugs are exposed to carcinogenic agents, which have the potential to interrupt the cell cycle and to induce chromosomal aberrations. The presence of high chromosomal aberrations indicates the need for intervention even when exposure to these carcinogens is low. Methods: Nationally representative samples of 552 nurses were investigated by a follow-up monitoring system. The measured biomarkers were clinical laboratory routine tests, completed with genotoxicological (chromosome aberrations [CAs] and sister chromatid exchanges [SCEs]) and immunotoxicological <b>monitoring</b> (<b>ratio</b> of lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphocyte activation markers) measured on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Results were compared to the data of 140 healthy, age-matched controls. Results: In nurses exposed to cytostatics, we observed a significantly increased frequency of CAs and SCEs compared with those in the controls. Cytostatic drug exposure also manifested itself in an increased frequency of helper T lymphocytes. Genotoxicological and immunotoxicological changes, as well as negative health effects (i. e., iron deficiency, anemia, and thyroid diseases), increased among cytostatic exposed subjects. Conclusions: These results raised concerns about the protection of nursing staff from chemical carcinogens in the working environment...|$|E

40|$|On-line Statistical Process Control (SPC) <b>monitoring</b> the <b>ratio</b> Z of two normal {{variables}} X and Y has surprisingly received {{too little}} {{attention in the}} quality control literature. Several potential applications dealing with <b>monitoring</b> the <b>ratio</b> Z {{can be found in}} the industrial sector, when quality control of products consisting of several raw materials calls for monitoring the stability of the proportions (ratios) of different components within a product. Tables about the sensitivity of these charts in the detection of one or more assignable causes are still not available. This paper investigates the statistical performance of Phase II Shewhart control charts <b>monitoring</b> the <b>ratio</b> of two normal variables in the case of individual observations. The obtained results show that the performance of the proposed charts is a function of the distribution parameters of the two normal variables. In particular, the Shewhart chart <b>monitoring</b> the <b>ratio</b> Z outperforms the (p= 2) multivariate  control chart when a process shift affects the in-control mean of X or, alternatively, of Y and the correlation among X and Y is high and when the in-control means of X and Y shift contemporarily to opposite directions. The sensitivity of the proposed chart to a shift of the in-control dispersion has been investigated, too. We also show that the standardization of the two variables before computing their ratio is not a good practice due to a significant loss in the chart’s statistical sensitivity. An illustrative example from the food industry is detailed to show the implementation of these control charts. Peer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|Cerebral cytoplasmatic redox {{state is}} a {{sensitive}} indicator of cerebral oxidative metabolism and is conventionally evaluated from the extracellular lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio [5 – 8]. During insufficient oxygen supply (e.g., arterial hypoxia, ischemia), the LP <b>ratio</b> <b>monitored</b> by intracerebral microdialysis increases instantaneously and if oxygenation is rapidly restored, it returns to a normal or near-normal level [9]. When cerebral oxidative metabolism is compromised by mitochondrial dysfunction, a lasting increase of the LP ratio is observed [8, 10, 11]. Although lactate and pyruvate are water-soluble, they rapidly equilibrate over cell membranes {{as well as the}} blood-brain barrier [12 – 14].

40|$|Since speed {{cameras were}} {{introduced}} in Queensland in May 1997 {{there has been a}} steady {{increase in the number of}} speed camera sites and the number of operational hours. However, infringements have not risen in line with this increase in speed enforcement. That is, over time there has been a gradual reduction in the number of speeding infringements issues as a proportion of the number of vehicles' speeds monitored by speed cameras. Superficially this data suggests that speed cameras are effective in reducing speeding. An alternative interpretation is that motorists are reducing their speed at known camera locations, thus avoiding detection, but still speeding at locations where they do not expect to encounter any speed enforcement. If the infringement to vehicles <b>monitored</b> <b>ratio</b> is a system wide indication of the number of motorists speeding, then a decline in this infringement ratio should be roughly parallelled by a corresponding reduction in speed related crashes. This paper will analyse infringement data, speed camera deployment data and speed related crash data in order to clarify the effects that speed cameras are having on speeding and crashes. In particular, the ratio of infringements to the number of hours of speed camera operation, speed related crashes and the surrogate measures of serious injury and fatality crashes will be investigated.
