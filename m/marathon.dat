5000|$|Dance <b>marathons</b> are {{events in}} which people dance or walk to music for an {{extended}} period of time. Dance <b>marathons,</b> endurance movement contests, and derbies can be traced back to London in 1364. They started as dance contests in the 1920s and developed into entertainment events during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Before the development of [...] "reality shows", dance <b>marathons</b> blurred the line between theatre and reality. Also known as endurance contests, dance <b>marathons</b> attracted people to compete as a way to achieve fame or win monetary prizes. The 1969 film They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, based on the 1935 novel of the same title written by Horace McCoy, a bouncer at several such <b>marathons,</b> popularized the idea and prompted students at Northwestern University, Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University, Ohio State University, the University of Florida, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to create charity dance <b>marathons.</b> <b>Marathons</b> could last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks.|$|R
50|$|Although {{many people}} {{supported}} <b>marathons</b> {{because they were}} sources of entertainment, there were outside groups that opposed the <b>marathons.</b> Some external groups did not like what the <b>marathons</b> were doing to participants.

Churches were unhappy with {{the way that the}} contestants danced with each other as it was not socially acceptable during the time period. Women's groups were upset because they thought it was unethical to charge spectators to watch dancers humiliate themselves.|$|R
