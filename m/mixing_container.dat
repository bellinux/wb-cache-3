5000|$|The Boston Shaker: A two-piece shaker {{consisting}} of a [...] metal bottom and traditionally a [...] glass or plastic mixing glass. The <b>mixing</b> <b>container</b> and bottom are inserted into each other for shaking or used separately for stirring or muddling. A separate strainer, such as a Hawthorne or Julep strainer, are required for this type shaker if crushed ice is used. Without such a strainer, some bartenders may instead strain by narrowly separating the two pieces after shaking and pouring the drink through the resulting gap. The market offers now [...] and [...] container versions too. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, versions of the Boston Shaker appeared with the metal bottom piece containing integral strainer mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{material}} may expand 4-5 times under a vacuum, the <b>mixing</b> <b>container</b> must {{be large enough}} to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill {{over the top of the}} container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The material container is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches 29 inches (at sea level) of mercury, {{the material}} will begin to rise (resembling foam). When the material falls, it will plateau and stop rising. The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to get {{accurate}} data on the effects of <b>mixing</b> <b>container</b> media components and to match these data against models for <b>mixing</b> <b>container</b> media. It was accepted that the mixing of two container media components was related linearly to the amounts of material mixed, for parameters such as degradability. For other parameters the extra material necessary to compensate for the effect of interstitial filling had to be taken into account. Four different two component mixes were measured for 36 different ratios in all. Moisture content, air content, shrinkage, density and EC and pH were measured for each mixture. A formula based on measured densities of the components and the mix was used to predict moisture/air content in the mixes. It is concluded that the formula and the underlying method underestimate the water content in relatively wet materials such as peat-coir products and overrate the moisture content for relatively dry materials such as peat and flax straw mixes. The increase in density of the mix may be calculated either by measuring the volume loss or the density increase of one or more test mixes, from modelling a simplified particle size distribution, or from an empirically calculated relationship with particle size distribution parameters...|$|E

40|$|Syntactic foam {{manufacturing}} method, ‘post-mold processing,’ {{based on}} the buoyancy of hollow microspheres was studied for potential building material applications. The post-mold processing involves mixing starch particles and ceramic hollow microspheres in water. It was found starch particles tend to adhere to hollow microspheres, forming agglomerations, during mixing. It was also found that “volume fraction of starch particles on a microsphere making a relative density of 1. 0 ” (VFSMRD) is an indicator for mixture volume transitions. Both the maximum total volume expansion of mixture and a transition in formation, after phase separation, of mixture volume in water referred to as “top phase” in a <b>mixing</b> <b>container</b> were taken place at a calculated VFSMRD.

A Simple Cubic cell model for the starch-microsphere inter-distance was adopted to quantitatively explain various effects on starch content in agglomeration such as hollow microsphere size, initial bulk volume of hollow microspheres (IBVMS), and water volume. Further, the following were found for manufactured syntactic foams: (a) volume fraction of starch in foam is of linear relation with starch content before mixing for a given experimental data range and (b) shrinkage is relatively high for small hollow microspheres with high starch content...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacturing}} process of brick and well rings {{were conducted by}} workers who must bend down, sit, and stand to do the job. This body positions occur repeatedly, so it can cause muscular and back bone injury. This monotonous and repetitive work, plus unergonomic working tools can cause Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) to workers, and will have impact to work productivity. Because of that, analysis was conducted to assess work risk relating to worker muscular disorder {{in the work place}} by using Quick Exposure Check (QEC) to every task elements, and working position that have potential to cause WMSDs. QEC assess damage to the back, shoulder, wrist, and neck.

To make coco- yoghurt, starter cultures must first be prepared.

The starters may now be stored at 5 ° C until use. Two textures of yoghurt may be made, a viscous one and a soft curd type. For the viscous, the milk base consists of 50 % coconut milk and 50 % NFDM; for the soft curd, the proportions are 44 % coconut milk to 56 % NFDM. The milk base is pasteurised at 85 ° C for 20 mins, cooled, and inoculated with 1. 5 % each of the previously prepared starter cultures. The mixture is poured into small yoghurt containers and then incubated at 42 ° C until the pH reaches 4. 5 - 4. 7. Coco-yoghurt can now be stored for 5 days at 5 ° C.

40|$|Methods for {{construction}} of geometrically complex, fully connected surface-immobilized microscopic networks of phospholipid bilayer vesicles (1 - 50 µm in diameter) interconnected by lipid nanotubes (100 - 300 nm in diameter), have been developed. The networks have controlled connectivity and are well-defined {{with regard to the}} container size, content, angle between nanotube extensions, and nanotube length. Within networks, the nanotubes spontaneously arrange themselves into three-way junctions with an angle of 120 ° between each nanotube, by minimizing the tube length. Using a combination of microelectrofusion, spontaneous nanotube pattern formation, and satellite-vesicle injection, complex networks of containers and nanotubes can be produced for a range of applications in, for example, nanofluidics and artificial cell design. In addition, this electrofusion method allows integration of biological cells into lipid nanotube-vesicle networks. A micropipette-assisted writing technique for formation of two-dimensional networks of phospholipid vesicles and nanotubes on functionalized and patterned substrates was also developed. The method allows for formation of networks with a large number of nodes and vertexes with well-defined geometry and surface adhesion, and represents a first step toward very large scale integration of nanotube-vesicle networks in, for example, nanofluidic applications. The networks are used in order to initiate chemical reactions involving few reactants inside the micrometer-scale biomimetic vesicles (10 - 12 to 10 - 15 L). The shape of these networks is under dynamic control, allowing for transfer and mixing of two or several reactants at will. Reactions could be followed for systems having as few as approximately 15 enzyme molecules confined to a reactor vesicle. Also, changes in the geometrical properties of a small-scale reaction container are found to alter the dynamics of a reaction-diffusion system with a diffusing catalyst (enzyme). A transition from a compact geometry (sphere) to a structured geometry (several spheres connected by nanoconduits) in nanotube-vesicle networks induces an ordinary enzyme-catalyzed reaction to display wave-like properties. The key to this behavior is the small diameter of the conduits placed between ideally <b>mixed</b> <b>containers</b> which act as diffusion-barriers of catalyst...|$|R

First, the chemistry has significant implications for managing the behavior of molten glass in any remelt application, from large-scale container manufacturing down to cottage-industry pressed glass.

Best Practice: More than 95 % of all manufactured glass is made from sodium oxide, calcium oxide, and silicon dioxide, commonly referred to as a soda-lime-silica composition.
