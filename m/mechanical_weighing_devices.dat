40|$|Purpose: The {{results of}} {{measurements}} shows that the chest size is not enough accurate to establish the body mass of living animals in all development stages, therefore additional measuring of the trunk length was used to increase reliability of the estimate. Design/methodology/approach: During the test 30 fattened animals were considered and were weighed by electronic <b>weighing</b> <b>device</b> EC 2000. The trunk length (d) and the chest size (o) were measured simultaneously. The body mass (T) was calculated according to the equation: T = o × d / 50. By the statistical package SPSS 12. 01. for Windows the basic statistics for the studied properties was calculated. By the t-test the calculated and the actually weighed body masses of animals were compared. Findings: On the young fattened cattle it was established that with 240 - 290 kg body mass, when the body form is most rectangular, the accuracy of calculation {{on the basis of}} measured body parts, is the greatest. The percentage difference between weighed and calculated body mass is only 0. 06 %, which is very accurate. Research limitations/implications: For wide applicability of measurement results on the living animals in all stages of growth it would be necessary in the equation for the calculation to include also the trunk size {{in the middle of the}} body and the size in the rear part. Practical implications: On small farms where the cost of purchase of the digital <b>weighing</b> <b>device</b> would be too great a burden, thus, measuring of the chest size at 3 cm behind the elbow joint, in the middle of the trunk (behind the last rib), and measuring of the size in the rear part of the body and the trunk length from the middle of the withers to the tail root are more appropriate. Originality/value: The animals which phenotypically feature cylindrical shape in the period of growth can be measured most simply in the front middle and rear part of the body and, then, their body mass can be determined very accurately on the basis of the data obtained...|$|R

In particular, it affects equilibrium paths in systems with variable length and instabilities, bifurcation and restabilization occurring in a structure penetrating in a movable constraint.
