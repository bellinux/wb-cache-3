25|$|The <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> {{method is}} a {{structural}} analysis method for statically indeterminate beams and frames developed by Hardy Cross. It {{was published in}} 1930 in an ASCE journal. The method only accounts for flexural effects and ignores axial and shear effects. From the 1930s until computers began to be widely used {{in the design and}} analysis of structures, the <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> method was the most widely practiced method.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> method, every {{joint of}} the {{structure}} to be analysed is fixed so as to develop the fixed-end moments. Then each fixed joint is sequentially released and the fixed-end moments (which {{by the time of}} release are not in equilibrium) are distributed to adjacent members until equilibrium is achieved. The <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> method in mathematical terms can be demonstrated as the process of solving a set of simultaneous equations by means of iteration.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of entire systems, this approach {{can be used in}} conjunction with statics, giving rise to the method of sections and method of joints for truss analysis, <b>moment</b> <b>distribution</b> method for small rigid frames, and portal frame and cantilever method for large rigid frames. Except for <b>moment</b> <b>distribution,</b> which came into use in the 1930s, these methods were developed in their current forms {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. They are still used for small structures and for preliminary design of large structures.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper [M. Cristelli, A. Zaccaria and L. Pietronero, Phys. Rev. E 85, 066108 (2012) ], Cristelli et al. {{analysed}} relation between skewness and kurtosis for complex dynamical systems and identified two power-law regimes of non-Gaussianity, {{one of which}} scales with an exponent of 2 {{and the other is}} with 4 / 3. Finally the authors concluded that the observed relation is a universal fact in complex dynamical systems. Here, we test the proposed universal relation between skewness and kurtosis with large number of synthetic data and show that in fact it is not universal and originates only due to the small number of data points in the data sets considered. The proposed relation is tested using two different non-Gaussian distributions, namely q-Gaussian and Levy distributions. We clearly show that this relation disappears for sufficiently large data sets provided that the second <b>moment</b> of the <b>distribution</b> is finite. We find that, contrary to the claims of Cristelli et al. regarding a power-law scaling regime, kurtosis saturates to a single value, which is of course different from the Gaussian case (K= 3), as the number of data is increased. On the other hand, if the second <b>moment</b> of the <b>distribution</b> is infinite, then the kurtosis seems to never converge to a single value. The converged kurtosis value for the finite second <b>moment</b> <b>distributions</b> and the number of data points needed to reach this value depend on the deviation of the original distribution from the Gaussian case. We also argue that the use of kurtosis to compare distributions to decide which one deviates from the Gaussian more can lead to incorrect results even for finite second <b>moment</b> <b>distributions</b> for small data sets, whereas it is totally misleading for infinite second <b>moment</b> <b>distributions</b> where the difference depends on N for all finite N.

40|$|The Magnéli phase Ti_ 4 O_ 7 is an {{important}} transition metal oxide {{with a wide range}} of applications because of its interplay between charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. At low temperatures, it has non-trivial magnetic states very close in energy, driven by electronic exchange and correlation interactions. We have examined three low-lying states, one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic, and calculated their energies as well as Ti spin <b>moment</b> <b>distributions</b> using highly accurate Quantum Monte Carlo methods. We compare our results to those obtained from density functional theory-based methods that include approximate corrections for exchange and correlation. Our results confirm the nature of the states and their ordering in energy, as compared with density-functional theory methods. However, the energy differences and spin distributions differ. A detailed analysis suggests that non-local exchange-correlation functionals, in addition to other approximations such as LDA+U to account for correlations, are needed to simultaneously obtain better estimates for spin <b>moments,</b> <b>distributions,</b> energy differences and energy gaps.

In this study, a four-axis robotic manipulator {{was employed to conduct}} a series of laterally-loaded pile tests in sand. Four model piles were installed into a sand bed and laterally loaded at different loading rates consecutively without stopping the centrifuge, which accordingly maximized consistency of the soil sample among the tests. Tests in both loose sand and dense sand were conducted. Detailed information of the test devices and procedures of soil sample preparation and load testing is described in this paper. The test results, including horizontal force-displacement curves, bending <b>moment</b> <b>distributions,</b> relationships between lateral resistance and loading rates, and p-y curves derived from the measured bending <b>moment</b> <b>distributions,</b> are presented. In addition, the effects of loading rate and ground surface are discussed based on the test results. It is found that, under the investigated conditions, loading rate has little effect on the horizontal resistance at specified displacements, but has significant effects on the bending moment and soil reaction distributions. The ground surface also has an effect on the behavior of the laterally-loaded piles. A simple modification method is used to consider the effect of ground surface con p-y curves at shallow depths...|$|R
