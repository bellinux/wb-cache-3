In the 19th century, the Bay of All Saints was also a popular whaling spot, as some species of whales used the bay as a <b>mating</b> <b>ground.</b> By that time, the province was also growing cotton, coffee, and tobacco with great success. Mandioc, rice, beans, and corn, saffron, oranges, mangoes, and other fruit were grown for local consumption. The arid interior was mostly used for cattle-farming, but this was ruined {{by a series of}} droughts caused in part by the custom of starting annual wildfires to improve the grass. Diamonds, gold, and amethysts were panned for in the rivers, while coal was mined on Itaparica. cacao was being farmed {{by the time of the}} First World War. As late as the mid-1950s, the Bahian economy could be considered a typical example of the primary-exporting model, which followed the subsistence production. For ten years, this dynamic was led by the cocoa crop, that used to be the state's main product and its most important source of income. With the acceleration of the industrialisation process in the 1970s, which started in the 1950s, the productive structure began to change. This process, which was not limited to the regional market, was inserted in the Brazilian industry matrix through the chemical (specially petrochemical) and metallurgical segment. Consequently, for the last twenty years, the dynamism of the Bahian economy has surpassed the national economy, yielding higher growth rates than those achieved by the national economy. The industrial sector is expected to continue to be the main contributor to this growth, particularly from 1999 on, when the investments that are being made now in the chemical, petrochemical and automotive segment, and in agroindustry and food production will be consolidated.|$|E
40|$|The {{movements}} and submergence behaviour of two male green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on their mating grounds at Ascension Island were investigated by satellite telemetry. During the mating season, males tended to conduct much shorter dives (typically < 15 min) than those recorded previously for females during the internesting period at this rookery.

40|$|Elasmobranch (shark, ray, and skate) populations {{around the}} world are in decline, and {{effective}} conservation measures are urgently needed. Marine Protected Areas (MPA) placed in locations important for key life-history stages may form part of an effective conservation strategy. In this context, we examined the seasonal abundance and population structure of the short-tailed stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) at an offshore MPA in northeastern New Zealand, and the reported use of this location as a <b>mating</b> <b>ground.</b> Diver surveys were conducted from 2004 to 2007 at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve (PKIMR).

These results suggest that the PKIMR acts as both a mating aggregation location and a nursery for this species.

The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals typically giving birth in the austral summer period after a gestation of c. 1 year. Reproductive periodicity in M. alfredi was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed by fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion.

40|$|International audienceAn {{abundant}} ichnological material {{composed of}} xiphosuran trackways and isolated traces {{was discovered in}} Upper Jurassic limestones from the Causses Basin (Causse Méjean, Lozère, France). The morphology of the imprints supports their identification as Kouphichnium isp. In contrast to the most frequent case, the trackways are composed of omnipresent pusher imprints sometime associated with leg traces, but with no telson mark. We argue that this pattern reflects actual surface traces rather than an incomplete set of undertracks. The size distribution of the sampled ichnites is broadly bimodal. This is best explained by sexual dimorphism, a phenomenon frequently observed in modern xiphosurans. Analysis of the trace fossils further suggests that several growth stages are recorded and that the horseshoe crabs were walking in a protected and flat environment like a lagoon. This area, certainly close to a <b>mating</b> <b>ground,</b> was occasionally affected by a continental influence. The biometric study of the tracks suggests a gigantic size for the trackmakers whose body may have reached 84 cm in length. This discovery complements the few reports on other gigantic horseshoe crabs in the Jurassic of Western Europe, thus casting doubt on the postulated increase in body size from the Palaeozoic to the Recent. Furthermore, a literature review shows {{that there are still}} major gaps in the record of limulid body-fossils and tracks. Thus, neither of these archives can be taken at face value for quantifying the body-size evolution of horseshoe crabs...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, much effort has been devoted towards {{evaluating}} and reducing bycatch in marine fisheries. There has been a particular focus on quantifying the risk to chondrichthyans, primarily because of their relatively high vulnerability to overfishing. A key part of risk assessment is evaluating the distributional overlap of the fish with the fisheries, where fish distribution is influenced by habitat use. I synthesised published observations of habitat use for different life history stages of chondrichthyans and hypothesised the associated catch composition in terms of fish sex, size, and maturity. I then searched for these catch compositions, and thereby locations, using New Zealand research vessel catch data. Results show that some life history stages and habitats for certain species can be identified, whereas others could not. Pupping ground criteria were met for Callorhynchus milii (ELE), Hydrolagus novaezealandiae (GSH), and Hydrolagus bemisi (GSP); nursery ground criteria were met for Callorhynchus milii (ELE), <b>mating</b> <b>ground</b> criteria were met for Callorhynchus milii (ELE), Hydrolagus novaezealandiae (GSH), Hydrolagus bemisi (GSP), and Harriotta raleighana (LCH); lek-like mating criteria were met for Hydrolagus novaezealandiae (GSH). For those life-history stage habitats not found, {{this may be because}} these are outside of the coverage of the data set (and likely also commercial fisheries), or because they do not actually exist for some chondrichthyans. On the basis of results, I propose to change the order of species in the New Zealand qualitative (Level 1) risk assessment, and rise the relative risk for Hydrolagus bemisi (GSP), given the species vulnerability of pupping grounds...|$|E
40|$|Skin biopsies of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) were sampled {{during the}} spring {{aggregation}} in Disko Bay, West Greenland, {{over a period of}} 13 years, and analyzed regarding gender and genetic diversity at the mitochondrial D-loop region and at 11 microsatellite loci. By identifying recaptures through matching sex, mitochondrial haplotype and microsatellite genotype, individual interannual revisits to the bay were confirmed. These were further utilized to provide a mark-recapture population size estimate that applies to the source of the local aggregation in Disko Bay, which yielded 1219 bowhead whales (SE= 278, 95 %CI: 673 - 1765) and a corresponding estimate of 1087 female bowhead whales (SE= 290, 95 %CI: 518 - 1656) for 2012. Given that each adult female bowhead whale in the stock(s) between eastern Canada and West Greenland visits the sampling area during the reproductive cycle, the latter estimate is assumingly valid for the adult female proportion of the bowhead whales in these waters. A skewed sex ratio in the Disko Bay aggregation was observed, where females constitute an estimated proportion of 79 % of the bowhead whales in the sampling area. As recent observations and early whaling records state that few calves are found in the area, Disko Bay is believed to serve as a feeding and <b>mating</b> <b>ground,</b> where adult females regain fat depots for their next calving period. The cyclicity in the female returns to the bay was thus assessed, which may arise from a multi-year migration pattern in relation to the female reproductive cycle. Although no conclusive results were obtained, a calving interval of four years would be most consistent with the data. Further, to test whether there was any substructuring of the stock in which different demes visit the bay in different years, the sampling years were analyzed with respect to both mitochondrial haplotypes and microsatellite genotypes. Global FST-value and an exact test of population differentiation were significant when based on the mitochondrial haplotypes across sampling years. When the microsatellites were investigated however, no global differentiation was detected. Slight differentiation was yet found among a few pairs of sampling years in both instances, although not coinciding among the markers. Hence, no obvious substructuring could be inferred from the data. The computer program STRUCTURE was additionally applied to the female bowhead whales sampled each year, finding that six clusters in the aggregation was the most likely number of clusters given the data. This was likely spurious and resulting from between-year recaptures, linked loci and close relatedness between the whales. In line with a star-shaped haplotype network and a sudden increase in the abundance in Disko Bay around the turn of this millennium, a population expansion was consequently implied. Although a recovery of the bowhead whale stocks after the extensive whaling during the 18 th and 19 th century is evident, close monitoring of the species is recommended in order to understand and manage it properly. This thesis is contributing to an extended dataset of bowhead whales in Disko Bay, of which most of its biology remains to be unveiled...|$|E
