5|$|More tornadic {{damage was}} {{reported}} in southern Durham and Killingworth, with some homes severely damaged, {{but there were some}} minor injuries, one young woman in Killingworth was injured by shards of glass from a breaking window. Some sources insist that the Wallingford tornado dissipated a few <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, and this was an entirely separate tornado, but without a modern damage survey it is impossible to tell. The parent storm finally moved out over the ocean around 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Ashford's {{importance}} as an agricultural and market town {{grew in the}} 13th century, and in 1243, King Henry III granted the town a charter to hold a market for livestock. The pottery industry expanded in the 13th and 14th centuries, with the main works based at what is now Potter's Corner, a few <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town centre. Later evidence from examining waste suggests that production was on a large scale. The Kent Archaeological society have discovered sandy ware at this location dating from around 1125 – 1250.|$|E

5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{convection}} {{associated with}} Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status. Early on October1, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal {{and there was}} little convection around {{the center of the}} system. With minimal shower and thunderstorm activity remaining around the center of Laura, the storm degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area on October1 while still producing tropical storm-force winds. The next day, the remnant system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and began to re-intensify as it rapidly tracked towards the north. Early on October3, the system slowed down as it turned towards the east and strengthened into a hurricane-force cyclone with winds of 75mph (120km/h). After accelerating towards the east, another large extratropical cyclone absorbed the remnants of Laura while located several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Isles on October4.|$|E
