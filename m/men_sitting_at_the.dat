5000|$|The book {{tells the}} story of a Sergipano (inhabitant of Sergipe), who arrives in Ilhéus in search of work. He suffers long hunger and is {{apprehensive}} of the city until encountering a good-hearted guard named Roberto in front of a big bakery, who gives him some bread. Later on the same day he encounters Roberto again, gets invited to a canteen to eat a feijoada and there meets several <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back. He is presented to one of them, nicknamed [...] "The '98", who in turn introduces the protagonist to a Colonel Misael, involved in recruiting men to work on the cocoa plantations. With the money that these two new friends give him, the young man manages to catch the train to Pirangi and, after a long journey and numerous events described in detail, he arrives at his destination. There, he embarks on the course of hard work and befriends the carpenter Colodino, as well as fellow workers João Grilo, Antonio Barriguinha and Honório, who are mostly Blacks or Mulattos.|$|E

5000|$|The {{village is}} located on Route 439 in the Iya Valley, a remote mountainous area. It {{formerly}} had about 300 inhabitants, but the decline in Japan's population has caused that to fall to 35 by January 2015 and 30 [...] Tsukimi Ayano, whose family left the area {{when she was a}} child, moved back to Nagoro in the early 2000s to look after her father, and made a scarecrow in his likeness that she placed in a field; she has since made more than 400 including replacements, and about 350 are in the village. Many are also likenesses of residents or former residents, while others are invented people. The village school, which closed in 2012, includes a large number; in one classroom, two children are self-portraits by the last two students to study there, who dressed them in their own clothes. Others include three <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of a telephone pole {{on the outskirts of the}} village, a man fishing in the river, a group in a bus shelter, and utility workers performing roadwork.

5000|$|The book {{tells about}} the highest stakes poker match of all time, {{over the course}} of a few years, between Andrew Beal and a group of {{professional}} poker players called [...] "The Corporation." [...] It begins as Ted Forrest, a professional poker player, is driving outside of Las Vegas when he calls the Bellagio poker room. The personnel in the poker room tell him the highest game is $10,000-$20,000 (which, at the time, was more than two times larger than any cash game ever played). He decides to go straight to the poker room, sit down with his last five hundred thousand dollars, and play against the other two <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table (Chip Reese and Andy Beal). Forrest had lost $400,000 without playing a single hand, and questions why he is there.The book then flashes back to February 2001, when Beal first visited the Bellagio poker room. He enjoys the atmosphere and the players, and meets many professional poker players, like Todd Brunson. He ends up winning over $100,000 and thinking it was luck, trains intensely to face the top players. Andy returns to Las Vegas, and wants to play heads-up with a professional for the highest stakes. Because they are in a casino, nothing can prevent other players from sitting down at the game, so the top professional poker players decide to pool their money with everybody who they thought would sit down at the game. Then Beal starts his match with Chip Reese.Beal and Reese play their match, and then Ted Forrest sits down. (Forrest was unreachable, so he was not originally part of the group.) Down to his last $100,000, Ted makes a stand and ends up winning $1.5 million. He is then asked to join the group, and for the rest of the book, nobody else sits down besides Beal and his selected opponent, who alternates throughout the story.|$|E
