The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

25|$|Not every {{conjecture}} ends {{up being}} proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (<b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can take Euclid's parallel postulate as either true or false).|$|E
25|$|If {{people ask}} {{in the name}} of {{religion}} we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham …etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

The third weakness was its gunsights, which were inaccurate: that's why we closed in as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could and fired point blank." ...|$|E

The only surprised party amongst the participants in the incursion seemed to be Lon Nol, who had been informed by neither Washington nor Saigon concerning the impending invasion of his country. He only discovered the fact after a telephone conversation {{with the head of the}} U.S. mission, who had found out about it himself from a radio broadcast.|$|E
500|$|After the {{original}} broadcast of [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two", NBC ran a commercial advertising [...] "April and Andy's wedding registry" [...] on the official Parks and Recreation website. At {{this point in the}} season, April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled. Shortly after the episode aired, HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy's wedding registry. However, after [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] aired, Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode, but ran with [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] due to an error by NBC employees: Schur said afterward, [...] "We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them, in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could." ...|$|E

500|$|Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: “This fellow Schulz is {{a monster}} {{in size and}} a perfect athlete. [...] He is both wonderfully agile and fast {{for a man of}} his size. [...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
500|$|Espenson {{said that}} this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they {{realized}} {{it was going to be}} airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to [...] "lean into" [...] this theme. Unusual for Once Upon a Time, the theme of this episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he is doing this, but really his actions are motivated by not believing that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and [...] "preserve as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could of the fairy tale side," [...] as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled knee-deep in water. Montgomery described his army as [...] "half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp". To make matters even worse, food and ammunition supplies were running out, and the British {{showed no sign of}} giving in despite the American bombardment. Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In {{the early days of the}} siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that [...] "a deserter [...] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can with shells." [...] Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga, the fort's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower.|$|E
