40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of this survey is to describe the current practice of thoracic anesthesia in the Middle Eastern (ME) region. Methods: A prospective online survey. An invitation to participate was e-mailed to {{all members of the}} ME thoracic-anaesthesia group. A total of 58 members participated in the survey from 19 institutions in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> <b>Questions</b> concerned ventilation strategies during one-lung ventilation (OLV), anesthesia regimen, mode of postoperative analgesia, use of lung isolation techniques, and use of i. v. fluids. Results: Volume-controlled ventilation was favored over pressure-controlled ventilation (62 % vs 38 % of respondents, P< 0. 05); 43 % report the routine use of positive end-expiratory pressure. One hundred percent of respondents report using double-lumen tube (DLT) as a first choice airway to establish OLV. Nearly a third of respondents, 31. 1 %, report never using bronchial blocker (BB) in their thoracic anesthesia practice. Failure to pass a DLT and difficult airway are the most commonly cited indications for BB use. Regarding postoperative analgesia, the majority 61. 8 % favor thoracic epidural analgesia over other techniques (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Our survey provides a contemporary snapshot of the ME thoracic anesthetic practice...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{generate}} a more holistic picture of the diffusion and assimilation of universal human rights norms in diverse cultural and political settings such as the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and North Africa (MENA). The overarching question to be investigated in this thesis is the relationship between the evolving international human rights regime and the emerging human rights normative and legal culture in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> This <b>question</b> will be investigated in detail with reference to regional human rights schemes such as the Arab Charter of Human Rights, as well as local human rights developments in three Middle Eastern states, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

40|$|This article interrogates {{the role}} of {{resource}} wealth in hindering democracy and democratization in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> It <b>questions</b> the familiar argument that oil wealth is a catalyst for democracy and development, and argues that {{in the context of}} the <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> oil wealth appears to hamper transition towards democratization. This is because oil revenues are used by the states to maintain the authoritarian monarchies through the allocation of large portions of state budget to defense expenditure and state security apparatuses that are ostensibly used to quell clamors for democratization and resist external pressures. The article also underlines the importance of hydrocarbon energy for the economies of Western superpowers and the way these powers cope with meeting their energy needs by all means possible. It is argued that Western countries face a moral predicament in meeting their strategic oil needs from a region seen as predominantly undemocratic and undemocratizing...|$|R

40|$|This article {{calls for}} closer {{attention}} to the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> in the wider debate on the purported rise of new modes of armed conflict {{following the end of}} the Cold War, particularly in relation to the notion of ‘regional conflict formations’ (RCFs). In so doing, it presents and analyses three main paradoxes. First, though the contemporary <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> had its own share of intrastate conflicts that generally grew into regional constellations, a look at the region's post-colonial history suggests that such trends are not as novel as has often been claimed. Second, the striking longevity of regionally entwined conflict in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> calls into <b>question</b> the common and generalizing argument that {{it was the end of}} the Cold War, together with the alleged disengagement of the superpowers, that constituted the radical shifts - including the rise of RCFs - that signalled the demise of old forms of politics and conflict involving weak states. Third, Middle Eastern states, mostly authoritarian in outlook, have over recent decades become stronger despite prevailing conditions of regionalized conflict; indeed, as tentatively suggested in this article, to some extent because of those factors...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{present the}} current {{situation}} of dental operating microscopy (DOM) training in the available Advance Specialty Education Programs in Endodontics in Arab Middle-Eastern countries.

40|$|The {{situation}} of Palestinian refugees {{is one of}} the most burning issues related to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Its solution is at the same time one of the key conditions for the settlement of this conflict, whose beginning may be traced back already in connection with the first alija - the first wave of Jewish immigration after the anti - Semitic pogroms in 1881. The importance of this problem is confirmed e. g. by the text of the Resolution 242 (S/RES/ 242) of 1967, which considers the upright solution for Palestinian refugees as one of the prerequisites for lasting peace in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> This <b>question</b> has been subject of many peace negotiations between the representatives of the concerned states lately, which only illustrates the high international topicality of the given problem. The aim of the dissertation is to define the term Palestinian refugee in the historic, political and legal context and in this connection to determine the position of Palestinian refugees in international law as an initial point, which is followed by the international law analysis of their right to return.

40|$|Software project {{development}} is increasingly becoming geographically distributed especially in today’s global business environment. In {{order to build}} quality software faster andat a lower cost, companies in industrialised countries are turning to globally distributed software development projects. Emerging countries such as India and Israel {{are known to have}} large pools of highly trained software engineers at relatively low cost. However, recent trends have shown that new locations are emerging as developmental sites. Examples of those locations in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> include Oman, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The main attraction of those countries is that they are close to the Arab market. However, distributed development also entails a number of risks and problems, for instance in terms of communication and knowledge transfer between sites, resulting in project failures. Being the project manager of a team that includes remote members has additional challenges compared to managing co-located team members. These projects face particular challenges that need careful managerial attention. This research aims to examine how globally distributed software development projects are managed in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> The main <b>question</b> to be answered was “How do companies in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> successfully manage and organise software development in a globally distributed environment?”. We outline the factors that were perceived as important by project managers. We also look at how culture affects the operation of virtual teams in a globally distributed software development environment in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> taking religion into consideration. To understand how these factors influence the success of globally distributed software development projects in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> we conducted a qualitative case study research involving three different companies operating in Dubai, Oman, Abu Dhabi, India and Pakistan. We used semi-structured interviews as the primary sources of information as these allow highly personalised data.

40|$|The 2001 United Nations World Conference against Racism (WCAR) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} United Nations events of the post-Cold War era. Major issues on the agenda included the <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> the <b>question</b> of reparations for the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, and the rights of indigenous peoples. Utilizing interviews with government and non-governmental actors as well as archival material, this dissertation examines Canada’s preparations for, and participation at, the WCAR as a case study to explore key theoretical debates about the Canadian foreign policy-making process. At the international level, Canada was an active participant during the multilateral negotiations in advance of the conference and at the conference itself. Drawing on the literature examining Canada as either a middle power, a satellite state or a principal power, this dissertation suggests that Canadian diplomacy did not fit easily into any one framework. On some occasions, Canada embraced middle power diplomacy; on other occasions, it embraced the positions advanced by the United States and other Western countries. At the domestic level, Canada established a consultation process involving many Canadian stakeholders intended to help shape the government’s position on key issues. Drawing on the literature examining the Canadian state as either pluralist, Marxian or statist, this dissertation suggests that the Canadian state wielded considerable autonomy from domestic actors and generally sought to define and advance its own interest, as expected by the statist view...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{conflict}} between the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and the Western world after the Danish newspapers’ cartoon publications of the prophet Muhammed in October 2005. The conflict resulted in massive reactions in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and the Danish-Swedish dairy company Arla Foods, was boycotted during six months in 2006. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe how the biggest Swedish daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter and three Saudiarabic newspapers Al-Hayat, Al-Watan and Shark Al-Awsat described "the Other" during the crisis in the year of 2006. Another aim is to describe how Arla Foods managed the consumer boycott. The ideas about "the Other" that were expressed in the media are seen as a discourse with the aim of maintaining and/or creating a "Us and Them viewpoint". Earlier theoretical studies are being presented, not at least Foucault, Schutz and Baumans and Mays contribution to the "Us and Them viewpoint" and their sociological approach. The main questions in the paper are; what ideas were expressed in the Saudiarabic newspapers against the Western world and the other way around; what ideas were expressed in the Swedish newspaper against the <b>Middle</b> <b>East?</b> The third <b>question</b> is; how Arla Foods handled the reactions in Saudi arabia due to the cartoon publications and how the company management reacted in order to reduce the damage of the consumer boycott ? The result of this study shows that an "Us-and Them viewpoint" exists in both the Saudiarabic and Swedish newspapers. Three themes can be outlined. First of all, the Swedish focus on freedom of speech and its lack of understanding on why the cartoons caused such massive reactions in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> Second, the massive criticism against the Western world for publishing the "islamphobic" cartoons and causing all the hatred. Third, the ideas of more calm and ressentment between the people, respecting Islam as a religion and freedom of speech at the same time. Arla Foods reacted to the crisis by applying risk management and also by dissociating itself from the publications by an information campaign that was published in 25 different Arabic newspapers. Finally, the company made a reset of the communication stra   strategy adopting a more global mindset although being a Scandinavian company. ...|$|R

40|$|Background : Non-medical {{anabolic}} steroid (AS) use in non-professional athletes is an increasingly recognized {{public health problem}} in Europe and the United States but poorly studied in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> Research <b>question</b> : The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the prevalence and determinants of {{anabolic steroid}} use amongst adult fitness centre attendees in the Greater Beirut area, Lebanon. Type of study : A cross-sectional study design was adopted. Methods :Subjects: The targeted population included all gym attendees in Greater Beirut aged 18 or above. Professional or career athletes competing in organized sports were excluded. Questionnaire: A questionnaire was used to survey participants on demographic information, history of anabolic steroid usage and possible determinants of use. Sampling: A list of 53 fitness centres in the Greater Beirut area was identified. Thirty-three gyms agreed to permit access to their centres. Trained research assistants distributed the questionnaire to all gym attendees on arrival, during equally selected day and evening intervals. A total of 523 gym attendees completed the survey. Results : The prevalence of any history of anabolic steroid use was 10. 7 %. The majority of users (78. 2 %) were aware of the adverse health effects. The main reason for usage reported was body image enhancement (82. 0 %). Demographic factors associated with anabolic steroid use were: male gender, separated/divorced status and full-time employment. Conclusion : Non-medical anabolic steroid use is a public health concern in Lebanon that should be addressed by monitoring AS use in health clubs and with educational programs aimed at high-risk groups, health practitioners and health clubs that not only focus on risk awareness but also on media literacy and body image attitudes.
