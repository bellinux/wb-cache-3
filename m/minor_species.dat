Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the podzol region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a <b>minor</b> <b>species</b> (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce makes good growth on well-drained lacustrine soils in Alberta Mixedwoods (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|E

500|$|Because all {{amino acids}} contain amine and {{carboxylic}} acid functional groups, they share amphiprotic properties. [...] Below pH 2.2, the predominant form {{will have a}} neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge −1). [...] But at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge. [...] This molecular state {{is known as a}} zwitterion, from the German Zwitter meaning hermaphrodite or hybrid. [...] The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the left) is a very <b>minor</b> <b>species</b> in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 107).

40|$|Bonvital is a {{preparation}} of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium authorised for use in piglets and pigs for fattening, in sows and in chickens for fattening. The applicant is seeking the further authorisation of Bonvital for use in {{chickens reared for laying}} and <b>minor</b> avian <b>species.</b> The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. The safety of Bonvital in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, safety for this animal category can be presumed. As the same dose is proposed for <b>minor</b> avian <b>species,</b> this conclusion can be extrapolated to <b>minor</b> avian <b>species</b> to point of lay. The strain is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. Bonvital is not irritant to skin and eyes. In the absence of data, it should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of Bonvital under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. The efficacy in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg complete feedingstuffs) in chickens reared for laying, the conclusion on the major species can be extended to this category.

The applicant seeks the re-evaluation of the product and the extension of its use to pigs for fattening, minor poultry and porcine species. Tolerance trials in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs showed that the animals tolerated well 100 -fold the recommended dose. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is safe for these target species. The conclusions reached on those species can be extrapolated to <b>minor</b> poultry <b>species</b> and to <b>minor</b> porcine <b>species</b> for fattening. In the absence of adequate studies, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of Endofeed® DC for the consumer. No specific studies were provided regarding the safety for the user. Therefore, Endofeed® DC {{should be considered a}} potential skin and eye irritant, and a potential skin and respiratory sensitiser. The results obtained in efficacy studies performed in chickens for fattening, laying hens and pigs for fattening showed that the additive has the potential to improve the performance of the animals. The nominal dose at which the potential of the enzyme preparation is demonstrated is the recommended dose. The conclusions on the efficacy on the major poultry species and on pigs for fattening can be extrapolated to <b>minor</b> poultry <b>species</b> and <b>minor</b> porcine <b>species</b> for fattening, respectively...|$|R
