5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} cats {{are seen as}} yōkai in Japanese mythology is {{attributed}} {{to many of the}} characteristics that they possess: for example, the way the irises of their eyes change shape depending on the time of day, the way their fur seems to cause sparks due to static electricity when they are petted (especially in winter), the way they sometimes lick blood, the way they can walk without <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> their wild nature that remains despite the gentleness they can show at times, the way they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), the sharpness of their claws and teeth, their nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.|$|E
25|$|When {{playing the}} bodhrán as an accompaniment to Irish music, {{different}} beats may be used. For example, reels have a 4/4 time. The bodhrán player must stick to this rhythm but {{is free to}} improvise within the structure: most simply, s/he may enunciate the first beat of four, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> like ONE two three four ONE two three four; but s/he can syncopate, put in double pulses, according to the rhythmic characteristics of the tunes being played. This {{is the difference between}} sensitive and insensitive playing, a matter of much concern to other traditional musicians. Because the bodhrán typically plays 16th notes (Kerry style), a great deal of variety can be introduced by these syncopations and the use of rests. Combined with manual pitch changes and naturally occurring tonal variations in an animal skin drumhead, the bodhrán can almost sound as melodically expressive as other non-percussive instruments.|$|E

25|$|The White Lady, without <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> {{advances}} {{along the}} terrace. Raymonda follows {{her in a}} state of unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin's feature The Circus, {{released}} in 1928, {{was his last}} film before the motion picture industry embraced sound recording and brought the silent movie era to a close. As his own producer and distributor (part owner of United Artists), Chaplin could still conceive City Lights as a silent film. Technically the film was a crossover, as its soundtrack had synchronized music, sound effects, and some unintelligible sounds that copied speech pattern films. The dialogue was presented on intertitles. Chaplin was first contacted by inventor Eugene Augustin Lauste in 1918 about <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> film, but he never ended up meeting with Lauste. Chaplin was dismissive about [...] "talkies" [...] and told a reporter that he would [...] "give the talkies three years, that's all." [...] He was also concerned about how to adjust the Little Tramp to sound films.|$|E

500|$|The {{objective}} of the British August offensive was to seize Chunuk Bair, a high point in the Sari Bair mountain range. The New Zealand and Australian Division would provide the attacking force. The initial attack was to clear the Turks from the foothills; this task {{was given to the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, reinforced by the Maori Pioneer Battalion. The regiment, together with the Otago Mounted Rifles, was to clear Chailak Dere valley, then advance to Aghyl Dere in the north. They also had to capture Taylor's Hollow and Walden's Point, then turn east to capture Beauchop Hill. To reduce noise and maintain stealth, they were ordered to use only their bayonets. At 20:00 on 5 August, the 296 men of the regiment moved forward to No.2 Post in preparation for the attack, which was due to start at 21:00 the next night. Their assault started on time, with the 1st and 10th Squadrons forward, followed by the 8th Squadron and Machine-Gun Section in reserve. The leading men met and killed four Turks in an observation post. Then with still around [...] to go, a destroyer's searchlight beam lit up the advancing men, and a Turkish machine-gun opened fire on them. The 10th Squadron charged straight into the Turkish trench, while the 1st Squadron managed to manoeuvre around and attack the machine-gun from the rear. They achieved this without firing a shot or <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> and then advanced towards their last objective, Beauchop Hill. The hill was also captured, and the survivors started to dig in. Although it had taken all its objectives, the regiment had around forty per cent casualties, including the commanding officer, who was wounded, and the second in command, Major Overton, who had been killed. While digging in they were able to observe the rest of the battle, which {{did not seem to be}} going well. By the next day, 7 August, Turkish reinforcements were arriving at Chunuk Bair and the attack had failed. Since the start of the battle they had lost twenty-four men dead and sixty men wounded. Now commanded by Major Hutton, from the 10th Squadron, the regiment remained on Bauchop Hill in defence until 15 August, when they moved back to the entrance of Aghyl Dere, then later moved forward [...] and occupied an old Turkish trench.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} sign languages, JSL (usually called simply 手話 shuwa, [...] "hand talk") {{consists}} of words, or signs, and the grammar {{with which they}} are put together. JSL signs may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or any other part of a sentence, including suffixes indicating tense, negation, and grammatical particles. Signs consist not just of a manual gesture, but also [...] (pronouncing a standard Japanese word with or without <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound).</b> The same sign may assume one of two different but semantically related meanings, as for example in [...] "home" [...] and [...] "house", according to its mouthing.

2500|$|Metal Gear Solid 2 {{carries the}} {{subtitle}} of [...] "Tactical Espionage Action", {{and most of}} the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the enemies. Most fundamental are the wider range of skills offered to the player. The first-person aiming mode allows players to target specific points in the game, greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted by a flying piece of fruit or hit in weak spots. Players can walk slowly, allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> or hang off walkways to slip past below guards' feet. The corner-press move from Metal Gear Solid, which allowed players a sneak peek around the next bend is expanded to allow players to fire from cover. Other abilities included leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers, and sneaking up behind enemies to hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition. Players are able to shoot out the enemy's radio so they are unable to communicate with others on their team. [...] The environment also has a greater impact on the stealth gameplay, taking into account factors such as weather, smell, atmosphere and temperature.|$|E
2500|$|In AD 132, Zhang Heng of China's Han dynasty {{invented the}} first {{seismoscope}} (by the definition above), which was called Houfeng Didong Yi (translated as, [...] "instrument {{for measuring the}} seasonal winds and {{the movements of the}} Earth"). The description we have, from the History of the Later Han Dynasty, says that it was a large bronze vessel, about 2 meters in diameter; at eight points around the top were dragon's heads holding bronze balls. [...] When there was an earthquake, one of the mouths would open and drop its ball into a bronze toad at the base, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> and supposedly showing the direction of the earthquake. On at least one occasion, probably at the time of a large earthquake in Gansu in AD 143, the seismoscope indicated an earthquake even though one was not felt. The available text says that inside the vessel was a central column that could move along eight tracks; this is thought to refer to a pendulum, though it is not known exactly how this was linked to a mechanism that would open only one dragon's mouth. The first ever earthquake recorded by this seismoscope was supposedly somewhere in the east. Days later, a rider from the east reported this earthquake.|$|E
