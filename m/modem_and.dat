5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC instruction set, and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a wireless <b>modem,</b> <b>and</b> other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices. They are also used for netbooks, in cars, wearable devices and other devices.|$|E
25|$|A {{radioteletype}} station {{consists of}} three distinct parts: the Teletype or teleprinter, the <b>modem</b> <b>and</b> the radio.|$|E
25|$|Today, both {{functions}} can {{be performed}} with modern computers equipped with digital signal processors or sound cards. The sound card performs {{the functions of the}} <b>modem</b> <b>and</b> the CPU performs the processing of the digital bits. This approach is very common in amateur radio, using specialized computer programs like fldigi, MMTTY or MixW.|$|E

25|$|The keyboard, Famicom <b>Modem,</b> <b>and</b> Famicom Disk System {{would later}} be {{released}} as add-on peripherals, all utilizing the Famicom expansion port. Other peripheral devices connecting via the expansion port would include the Famicom Light Gun, Family Trainer, and various specialized controllers. Many such devices would be produced for the console, though many of them, including the Famicom 3D System and Famicom Disk System, were never released outside Japan.|$|E
25|$|Prestel was a British information-retrieval {{system based}} on {{teletext}} protocols. However, it was essentially a different system, using a <b>modem</b> <b>and</b> the phone system to transmit and receive the data, comparable to systems such as France's Minitel. The modem was asymmetric, with data sent at 75-bit/s, and received at 1200-bit/s. This two-way nature allowed pages to be served on request, {{in contrast to the}} TV-based systems' sequential rolling method. It also meant that a limited number of extra services were available such as booking event or train tickets and a limited amount of online banking.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} AirPort Base Station (known as Graphite, model M5757, {{part number}} M7601LL/B) features a dial-up <b>modem</b> <b>and</b> an Ethernet port. It employs a Lucent WaveLAN Silver PC Card as the Radio, and uses an embedded AMD Elan processor. It was released July 21, 1999. The Graphite AirPort Base Station is functionally {{identical to the}} Lucent RG-1000 wireless base station and can run the same firmware. Due to the original firmware-locked limitations of the Silver card, the unit can only accept 40-bit WEP encryption. Later aftermarket tweaks can enable 128-bit WEP on the Silver card. Aftermarket Linux firmware has been developed for these units to extend their useful service life.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{complaint}} {{was that it}} lacked the functions of a mobile PDA, although there are now several PIM options created by the community. Also, for Internet access away from Wi-Fi hotspots, the Nokia 770 relies upon a Bluetooth 1.2 phone acting as a <b>modem,</b> <b>and</b> not all bluetooth phones will work with the tablet. Additionally some complained that the device used Reduced-Size MMC (RS-MMC or Micro-MMC) cards that were originally difficult to find. However, the format has since been used in other products and has become widely available. The device originally could only use cards up to 1GB, but 2GB cards are supported with {{the current version of}} the operating system.|$|E
25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the Picture Processing Unit). To keep costs down, suggestions of including a keyboard, <b>modem,</b> <b>and</b> floppy disk drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin expansion port connection {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a <b>modem</b> <b>and</b> included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 {{changed its name to}} America Online, and continued to operate its AOL service for the IBM PC compatible and Apple Macintosh. Q-Link was {{a modified version of the}} PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to the polls, the UMP lost ground, but it {{maintained}} a workable majority. The Socialists unexpectedly gained seats. Their plea to voters {{to prevent an}} overwhelming UMP dominance of the legislature appears to have paid off, providing the Socialists {{with a measure of}} redemption from the election loss. UDF splinter groups, François Bayrou's <b>MoDem</b> <b>and</b> the New Centre, contested their first elections. MoDem won 4 seats (including Mayotte regionalist Abdoulatifou Aly), while the New Centre was able to form a parliamentary group, with 22 seats. It {{remains to be seen whether}} Bayrou's party, which polled the third highest vote (7.61% in round one), will develop into a major political force. Their result is an improvement on the UDF's result of 4.9% in 2002. The National Front (FN) polled its lowest vote since its splash onto the political scene in 1986. The FN lost more than 60% of its support base since 2002. Support for the Communist Party also declined, and they saw a loss of several seats, whilst several other left-wing parties won nine new seats. The Greens gained one new seat, despite a fall in their vote. One of the most stunning results was the surprise defeat of UMP party leader Alain Juppé by the Socialist Party candidate Michèle Delaunay. Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was defeated as well losing to Socialist Party candidate Jean-Patrick Gille. The far right did not win any seats.|$|E
500|$|A patch was {{released}} that fixed bugs and added support for Serial Cable, <b>Modem,</b> <b>and</b> IPX/SPX network gaming (with {{up to four}} players) in the Windows version, and a difficulty setting. In multiplayer, each player has a colour, which patients will wear to distinguish from those of other players. [...] "Litter Bombs" [...] are featured, allowing players to spread litter around other players' hospitals, while staff members can be persuaded to work for other players, and there are [...] "Mini Missions", with instructions for players to perform. Players are also able to chat with each other during a game.|$|E
500|$|Sega Meganet, {{also known}} as the Net Work System, was an online service for the Mega Drive in Japan. [...] Utilizing dial-up Internet access, Meganet was Sega's first online {{multiplayer}} gaming service, and functioned on a pay to play basis. [...] The system functioned {{through the use of a}} peripheral called the Mega <b>Modem</b> <b>and</b> offered several unique titles that could be downloaded, and a few could be played competitively with friends. In addition, it shared technology and equipment with more serious services such as the Mega Anser, used for banking purposes. [...] Though the system was announced for North America under the rebranded name [...] "Tele-Genesis", it was never released for that region.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Kheradpir formed small {{teams that}} were each {{responsible}} for {{coming up with}} and developing new products. Kheradpir implemented a 30-day prototype cycle to rapidly test and modify new technologies in development. His team of approximately 10,000 staff often worked late hours, but positions at Verizon were in high demand, because of the department's rapid pace. According to InfoWorld, he led technology development for strategic initiatives such as FiOS(fiber to the home), process and systems transformation, and many new customer-facing products." [...] In 2003 his team created iobi, which manages address books, caller ID and other features across devices over the internet. The Verizon One, a combination phone, router, <b>modem</b> <b>and</b> smart portable device, was developed from his department the following year. His division also reengineered many of Verizon's core network systems, including call center, website, automated customer service systems, and integrated formerly separate systems from predecessor companies GTE, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX.|$|E
500|$|Sega Meganet, {{also known}} as the Net Work System, was an online service for the Mega Drive in Japan and later Brazil.

[...] Though the system was announced for North America under the rebranded name [...] "Tele-Genesis", it was never released for that region. [...] Ultimately, the Meganet service would be short-lived, lasting approximately a year before it was discontinued, but would serve as a precursor to the Sega Channel and XBAND services, as well as a predecessor to online gaming services for video game consoles. Retrospective feedback praises the attempt by Sega to introduce online gaming, but criticizes the service for its logistical issues and lack of titles.|$|E

2500|$|CP/M {{software}} {{often came}} with installers that adapted it {{to a wide}} variety of computers. Most forms of copy protection were ineffective on the operating system, and the source code for BASIC programs was easily accessible.
