40|$|Pavement {{management}} systems (PMS) have historically relied on distress (e. g., cracking, and rutting) and roughness (e. g., International Roughness Index or IRI) as key pavement performance indicators in the decisions-making process. Both are important indicators that merit emphasis within the PMS process, {{but they are}} not the only ones. Structural adequacy, for example, is another important pavement performance indicator that is critical to making rational pavement rehabilitation decisions. And indeed, more and more highway agencies in the USA are incorporating deflection testing as part of their routine PMS activities. Deflection testing for the structural evaluation of pavements has been around for decades. Falling Weight Deflectometers (FWDs) represent the state-of-the-practice in pavement deflection testing; however, FWD testing is a stop-and-go operation that requires lane closures (hence can cause traffic disruptions and create a safety hazard) and that has limited production rates. To overcome these shortcomings, a number of organizations have developed <b>moving</b> <b>pavement</b> deflection testing devices. Recognizing the potential benefits of these devices, the Federal Highway Administration commissioned Fugro Consultants, Inc., to undertake a study to determine whether the curren...|$|E
40|$|Pavement {{structural}} adequacy {{is considered}} {{an important aspect of}} the pavement management activities and can be incorporated by using surface pavement deflections. Continuous deflection technology, which has been around for several years, can potentially supplant single point deflection measurements provided by the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD). Previous studies have evaluated the traffic speed deflection devices (TSDD) accuracy and precision by comparing their results with FWD measurements. Although appropriate correlations and indices to compensate for the differences in load have been made, a direct comparison under the same loading conditions has not been reported in the literature. ^ The goal of this thesis is to establish a reliable measure of the structural condition of bound pavement layers above the unbound base layer as it deteriorates over time under traffic and environmental loading, based on <b>moving</b> <b>pavement</b> deflection technology, measured at traffic speeds (30 â€“ 60 mph). Two devices, the Greenwood TSD and ARA RWD, were found to be potentially viable devices (Flintsch, 2014). Based on this findings, a work plan was developed and implemented to evaluate whether the two devices met a minimum set of specifications related to the structural evaluation of pavements at the network level, including accuracy and precision of deflection measurements, monitoring applied load, operating speed, and distance between deflection measurements. The modern versions of the TSDDs that are used in this study include the Greenwood Traffic Speed Deflectometer (TSD) and the Applied Research Associates, Inc. Rolling Wheel Deflectometer (RWD). ...|$|E

30|$|As far as {{pavement}} {{response is}} concerned, some pioneers have dedicated their research {{to the subject}} of effects of <b>moving</b> loads on <b>pavement</b> structure. To perform the dynamic analysis of pavement structures, one of the indispensable considerations is the dynamic traffic loading, which is the excitation source of pavement structures. Since pavement loads are caused by vehicle vibration, it is necessary to include the vehicle in the investigations of pavement loads. Employing MIT heavy truck simulation program Hedric and his associates, Abbo and Markow [9, 10, 11], examined the influence of joint spacing, step faulting, vehicle suspension characteristics, and vehicle velocity on pavement damage as defined by fatigue cracking in concrete slab. The response of pavement under their consideration is achieved using PMARP, a static finite element program for pavement analysis developed by the Purdue. The conclusions obtain provide a valuable approximation of pavement response.While PMARP is a static finite element program, the properties of inertia and damping of the pavement structure were not included in consideration.|$|R

From their first film, the unfinished Traveling Boy (1950), to Powers of Ten (re-released in 1977), to their last film in 1982, their cinematic work was an outlet for ideas, a vehicle for experimentation and education. The couple often produced short films in order to document their interests, such as collecting toys and cultural artifacts on their travels. The films also record the process of hanging their exhibits or producing classic furniture designs. Some of their other films cover more intellectual topics. For example, one film covers the purposely mundane topic of filming soap suds <b>moving</b> over the <b>pavement</b> of a parking lot. Powers of Ten (narrated by physicist Philip Morrison), gives a dramatic demonstration of orders of magnitude by visually zooming away from the earth {{to the edge of}} the universe, and then microscopically zooming into the nucleus of a carbon atom.|$|R

ABSTRACT: A Hill road is one which passes through a terrain with a cross slope of twenty five percent or more. A hilly or Mountainous area {{is characterized by a}} highly broken relief with widely differing elevations, steep slopes, deep gorges and a great number of water courses. Owing to complex topography, the route has to be ineffectively increased. Flexible pavements are especially affected by moving vehicles, as a result of <b>moving</b> vehicles the <b>pavement</b> starts deteriorate. The existing road has been badly damaged due to heavy intensity of rain and by the due course of time. The main objectives of this project involve widening of the existing road up to the desirable limit and to renovate the pavement where the roads have been heavily damaged. The results indicate that the Benkelman beam method was used for the calculation of the deflection behavior against dynamic vehicle loading for flexible pavements...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityExisting asphalt mixture design {{approaches}} are mainly empirical based "trial-and-error" methods. Based purely on volumetrics, such design methods have little {{consideration of the}} mechanical performance of the mixtures. With the trend of <b>moving</b> the <b>pavement</b> research into more mechanistic based methods and targeting the ultimate goal to good field performance, {{it is necessary to}} develop a sophisticated mix design and characterization methodology which can help the designer understand the expected engineering performance of the mix at the early stages, at the same time, to have a more efficient tool to evaluate the quality of the mixtures. This research develops a comprehensive aggregate gradation and asphalt mixture design method that estimates the mechanical properties of the mix at early stage. In this method, strong correlations between aggregate properties, volumetrics, and mechanical properties are identified, making the VMA (Voids in Mineral Aggregate) an excellent media to link the properties of aggregates and asphalt binder to their engineering performance. The concept of the design procedure, especially the aggregate gradation design procedure, is largely based on an analysis of aggregate packing and interlocking. As a fast and convenient design method that emphasizes more on the mechanical performance of the mix, the new design method can be used to evaluate the quality of an existing gradation and mix design, and adjust the gradation of a new mix to satisfy both volumetrics and mechanical properties. In addition, the characteristics of asphalt mixture are studied using micromechanical based discrete element method (DEM) and macromechanical modeling. In DEM simulation, an image based ball clumping technique is used for simulating the angularity properties of aggregate particles. The DEM model is established and calibrated to describe the viscoelastic (dynamic modulus and phase angle) and viscoelastic plastic (strength) properties of asphalt mixtures with or without damage involved. As for macromechanical modeling, a constitutive model for characterizing the permanent deformation of asphalt mixture is explored by taking consideration of the directional distribution of aggregates (anisotropy), and the damage induced by plasticity.

[...] "When I was teaching at Cooper Union in the first year or two of the '50s, someone told me how I could get on to the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike. I took three students and drove from somewhere in the Meadows to New Brunswick. It was a dark night and there were no lights or shoulder markers, lines, railings or anything at all except the dark <b>pavement</b> <b>moving</b> through the landscape of the flats, rimmed by hills in the distance, but punctuated by stacks, towers, fumes and colored lights. This drive was a revealing experience. The road and much of the landscape was artificial, and yet it couldn't be called a work of art. On the other hand, it did something for me that art had never done. At first I didn't know what it was, but its effect was to liberate me from many of the views I had had about art. It seemed that there had been a reality there which had not had any expression in art." ...|$|R
40|$|A non-contact, {{non-destructive}} {{method is}} described {{that allows the}} user to measure pavement texture and loaded and unloaded profiles from a moving vehicle. ^ The device uses laser distance measuring gages. The gages are arranged such that their readings can be interpreted to give the loaded and unloaded pavement profiles and a measure of its texture. Four gages are mounted on a rigid beam that, in turn, is mounted {{on the side of}} a load vehicle. The gages read the distance to the pavement. Three of the gages are located outside the range of influence of the load wheel, and hence the pavement below these gages is undeflected. One of the gages is adjacent to the load wheel to measure the induced deflection. An algorithm is presented that relates all measurements to a common datum. ^ The three gages yield readings that are interpreted to give the profile (do the surveying). The gages make so many readings and so quickly, that the standard deviation of the readings, taken over a short time period, gives a measure of the texture. ^ A prototype device was constructed and tested. The results were: (1) Pavement profiles were calculated using the new system. These compare favorably, though not completely, with the transit surveys. (2) Standard deviations were recorded. These readings were taken over concrete, asphalt and porous friction surface pavements. Differences were noted between the textures of concrete (smooth) and asphalt (rough) pavements. No correlation between this measure and standard measures was made. (3) The deflections caused by prototype loads were measured and recorded. This was done from the load vehicle, while the vehicle was <b>moving</b> across a <b>pavement</b> at the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The scheme for obtaining the resulting deflections is descibed in detail. An algorithm for accomodating the misalignment of the laser gages on the rigid beam is also presented. ^ Suggestions are offered for improving the system. ...|$|R
