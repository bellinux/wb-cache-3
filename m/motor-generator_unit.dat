50|$|The {{regulations}} for the 2014 season limit the maximum {{fuel mass flow}} to the engine to 100 kg/h, which reduces the maximum power output from the current 550 kW to about 450 kW. The rules also double the power limit of the electric motor to 120 kW for both acceleration and energy recovery, and increase {{the maximum amount of}} energy the KERS is allowed to use to 4 MJ per lap, with charging limited to 2 MJ per lap. An additional electric <b>motor-generator</b> <b>unit</b> may be connected to the turbocharger.|$|E
5000|$|With {{regards to}} battery management, [...] "power ramping down" [...] was {{introduced}} whereby cars that exceeded their maximum power usage during the main race {{are required to}} linearly ramp down to [...] within five seconds on track, and the car's rain light must switch on to warn other drivers. After the car crosses the line to mark the entry to pit lane, the driver must engage <b>motor-generator</b> <b>unit</b> power to continue racing or return to the pit lane if this proves unsuccessful. The change was introduced to aid spectators in when the rule on energy usage has been transgressed without relying on a steward's decision.|$|E
50|$|General Motors mild hybrids {{including}} the Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) and numerous cars and SUVs {{equipped with the}} BAS Hybrid system, often use a 36- to 48-volt system to supply the power needed for the startup motor, {{as well as a}} source of power to compensate for the increasing number of electronic accessories on modern vehicles. GM's Belt alternator starter (BAS) mild hybrid system uses a belt drive to start the internal combustion engine (ICE) through its <b>motor-generator</b> <b>unit</b> (MGU), then once started the engine drives the 14.5 kW motor-generator to charge the batteries. The BAS hybrid system also utilizes regenerative braking to replenish the system's 36 V battery and can provide moderate levels of power assist. According to the EPA, a 2009 Saturn Vue Greenline equipped with the BAS Hybrid system delivers a 27% improvement in combined fuel economy over the non-hybrid version (FWD 4cyl).|$|E
40|$|Microgrids {{integrating}} distributed <b>motor-generator</b> <b>units</b> {{are commonplace}} in locomotive and industrial applications. The behavior {{of these systems}} is dependent upon various designoperating parameters. However there is a distinct relation between power quality and power flow within these units. This paper presents an analysis of power quality measurements, depicting this interdependence. Respective results can be taken under consideration during power flow programming, enabling enhanced system operation. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
50|$|From the 2014 season, Formula 1 racing {{cars will}} have what are {{described}} as 2 <b>motor-generator</b> <b>units</b> (MGU), single units which can act as either a generator or a motor. This makes the cars more fuel-efficient by harvesting energy from the turbocharger and under braking. They {{can be used to}} provide an additional 160 BHP to the wheels to aid acceleration and overtaking, or can be used to spin the turbo to increase boost pressure faster, thereby reducing turbo lag.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} dynamic {{models for}} the two-mode FWD EVT, develops a control system based on those models {{that is capable of}} meeting driver torque demands and performing synchronous mode shifts between different EVT modes while also accommodating preferred engine operating points. The two-input two-output transmission controller proposed herein incorporates motor-generator dynamics, is based on a general state-space integral control structure, and has feedback gains determined using linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimization. Dynamic modeling of the vehicle is categorized as dynamic modeling of the mechanical and electrical subsystems where the mechanical subsystem consists of the planetary gear sets, the transmission and the engine whereas the electrical subsystem consists of the <b>motor-generator</b> <b>units</b> and the battery pack. A discussion of load torque is also considered as part of the mechanical subsystem. With the help of these derived dynamic models, a distinction is made between dynamic output torque and steady-state output torque. The overall control system consisting of multiple subsystems such as the human driver, power management unit (PMU), friction brakes, combustion engine, transmission control <b>unit</b> (TCU) and <b>motor-generator</b> <b>units</b> is designed. The logic for synchronous mode shifts between different EVT modes is also detailed as part of the control system design. Finally, the thesis presents results for responses in individual operating modes, EVT mode shifting and a full UDDS drive cycle simulation.
