25|$|Cisco Systems {{was founded}} in December 1984 by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, two Stanford University {{computer}} scientists, who pioneered {{the concept of a}} local area network (LAN) being used to connect geographically disparate computers over a <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> system. By the time the company went public in 1990, when it was listed on the NASDAQ, Cisco had a market capitalization of $224 million. Cisco was the most valuable company in the world by 2000, with a more than $500 billion market capitalization.|$|E
50|$|Also the Motorola Vanguard 6560 <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> used a 50 MHz 68EC060 processor.|$|E
50|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Bosack and ex-wife Sandy Lerner involves {{the legitimacy of}} the claim that the couple invented the <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> and started Cisco in their living room, using their own credit cards for financing. Many feel that this claim omits many people who helped develop the <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router,</b> a device which was critical to the early Internet, as well as a battle with Stanford that almost killed Cisco at its conception over charges that Bosack and Lerner used technology that belonged to Stanford when starting their business.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>routers</b> were {{independently}} {{created by}} staff researchers at MIT and Stanford in 1981; the Stanford router {{was done by}} William Yeager, and the MIT one by Noel Chiappa; both were also based on PDP-11s. Virtually all networking now uses TCP/IP, but <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>routers</b> are still manufactured. They were important {{in the early stages}} of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern Internet routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than routers processing AppleTalk, DECnet, IP and Xerox protocols.|$|R
50|$|The network number allows {{to address}} (and {{communicate}} with) the IPX nodes {{which do not}} belong to the same network or cabling system. The cabling system is a network in which a data link layer protocol can be used for communication. To allow communication between different networks, they must be connected with IPX routers. A set of interconnected networks is called an internetwork. Any Novell Netware server may serve as an IPX router. Novell also supplied stand-alone <b>routers.</b> <b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>routers</b> of other vendors often support IPX routing. Using different frame formats in one cabling system is possible, but it works similarly as if separate cabling systems were used (i.e. different network numbers must be used for different frame formats even in the same cabling system and a router must be to allow communication between nodes using different frame formats in the same cabling system).|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the BLOOM II {{improved}} on {{the previous}} ASIC design by reducing its power consumption and die size, while maintaining 2 Gbit/s technology. It powered Brocadeâ€™s second generation director, the SilkWorm 24000. Still a 128 port design, {{it was the first}} one which could operate as a single 128-port switch (a single domain). The new director also used approximately two thirds less power than its predecessor. Brocade introduced also its first <b>multiprotocol</b> Fibre Channel <b>router,</b> the SilkWorm 7420. Brocade also acquired Rhapsody Networks (a SAN virtualization startup company). This was also the time frame in which Brocade first entered into the embedded switch market, delivering multiple switches physically integrated into other vendors' hardware, such as storage controllers and blade server chassis.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> - The {{computer}} running RRAS can route IP, IPX, and AppleTalk simultaneously. All routable protocols are configured {{from the}} same administrative utility. RRAS included two unicast routing protocols, Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) as well as IGMP routing and forwarding features for IP multicasting.|$|E
5000|$|Bridging {{solutions}} for Token Ring and Ethernet networks included the AT&T StarWAN 10:4 Bridge, the IBM 9208 LAN Bridge and the Microcom LAN Bridge. Alternative connection solutions incorporated a router {{that could be}} configured to dynamically filter traffic, protocols and interfaces, such as the IBM 2210-24M <b>Multiprotocol</b> <b>Router</b> which contained both Ethernet and Token Ring interfaces.|$|E
50|$|XKL, LLC, {{was founded}} in 1991 and {{develops}} optical transport technologies. Originally based in Redmond, Washington its headquarters are now located in Kirkland, Washington. XKL is led by Cisco Systems co-founder Len Bosack who also {{used to work for}} DEC and Bell Labs. Under Bosack, Cisco commercialized local area network (LAN) technology to connect geographically to computers over a <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> system.|$|E
40|$|This RFC {{specifies}} an IAB standards track {{protocol for}} the Internet community, and requests discussion {{and suggestions for}} improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol Standards " for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This document specifies the encapsulation of IP and other network layer protocols over X. 25 networks, in accordance and alignment with ISO/IEC and CCITT standards. It is a replacement for RFC 877, "A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams Over Public Data Networks " [1]. It was written to correct several ambiguities in the Internet Standard for IP/X. 25 (RFC 877), to align it with ISO/IEC standards that have been written following RFC 877, to allow interoperable <b>multiprotocol</b> operation between <b>routers</b> and bridges over X. 25, and to add some additional remarks based upon practical experience with the specification over the 8 years since that RFC. The substantive change to the IP encapsulation {{is an increase in}} the allowed IP datagram Maximum Transmission Unit from 576 to 1600, to reflect existing practice. This document also specifies the Internet encapsulation for protocols, including IP, on the packet mode of the ISDN. It applies to the use of Internet protocols on the ISDN in the circuit mode only when the circuit is established as an end-to-end X. 25 connection...|$|R
50|$|He {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for pioneering the widespread commercialization of local area network (LAN) technology to connect geographically disparate computers over a <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> system, which was unheard of technology at the time. In 1990, Cisco's management fired his wife Sandy Lerner, and Bosack resigned. Bosack is currently the CEO of XKL LLC, a privately funded engineering company which explores and develops optical networks for data communications.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{techniques for}} sharing the processing load among multiple processing units within systems {{that act as}} nodes in a data communications network. Load-sharing techniques have been explored {{in the field of}} computer science for many years and their benefits are well known, including better utilization of processing capacity and enhanced system fault tolerance. We discuss deploying such methods in the specifics of the networking environment. We concentrate particularly on the data plane, or the data packet-processing tasks. After reviewing the main results in the fields of load sharing and multiprocessor networking systems architectures, we conduct a preparatory optimization study of a router system to gain better understanding of the optimization issues in a particular multiprocessor system. The main contribution of this thesis, the adaptive load-sharing method, is presented next. We first formulate the optimization problem of mapping packets to processors. The goal is to minimize the likelihood of flow reordering, while respecting certain system constraints, such as the acceptable probability of a packet loss. As we show that the task is an NP-complete problem, we propose a heuristic method that uses an adaptive hash-based mapping to assign packets to processors. We demonstrate its advantages and prove that the method adaptation policy possesses the key minimal disruption property with respect to the mapping. In other words, the adaptation results in a minimum number of flows being moved among processing units. Further on, the method is validated in an extensive set of simulations designed to imitate the networking environment. Finally, two sample applications, an architecture of a <b>multiprotocol</b> <b>router</b> and an implementation of a server load balancer on a network processor demonstrate the applicability of the method...|$|E
