5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke can be regarded in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E

In order {{to look for a}} pairing, a man <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through an initiation ritual in which he endures several penalties and difficulties, to demonstrate the fundamental abilities for the subsistence and consumes a hallucinogen (Virola sp.).|$|E
25|$|Welden didn't {{return to}} campus. Her roommate thought she <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{to the library}} to study for exams, but the next morning, Welden still hadn't returned. Once the college administrators were notified, they {{immediately}} started {{a search of the}} campus itself. The Bennington County State's Attorney was notified, and the county sheriff was brought in to help with the search. Over the next couple of days, her visit to the Long Trail was discovered when one of the hikers she had approached identified her from the photo in the Bennington Banner newspaper, where he worked.|$|E

25|$|Matilda was {{supported}} by her uncle King David of Scotland, {{and he did not}} accept Stephen's succession peacefully. Thus Eustace was placed in the front line of a new war, and when David invaded northern England Eustace's castle of Alnwick was among those captured by David in the first two months of the year (though it was returned in March). Stephen relieved Eustace of control of Bamburgh Castle when he returned from his punitive invasion of Lothian early in 1138. It has been claimed that Eustace <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> over to David's side by the end of 1137, when David invaded northern England. There is no proof however that Eustace had switched allegiance at this point.|$|E
25|$|Cedd is not {{mentioned}} as Chad's companion {{in this stage}} of his education. Probably Cedd was considerably older than Chad, and was ordained priest some years earlier: certainly he was already a priest by 653, when {{he was sent to}} work among the Middle Angles. Chad's companion was Egbert, who was of {{about the same age as}} himself. The two travelled in Ireland for further study. Bede tells us that Egbert himself was of the Anglian nobility, although the monks sent to Ireland were of all classes. Bede places Egbert, and therefore Chad, among an influx of English scholars who arrived in Ireland while Finan and Colmán were bishops at Lindisfarne. This means that Egbert and Chad <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Ireland later than the death of Aidan, in 651.|$|E
25|$|Leslie was {{a younger}} son, {{probably}} the third son, of Sir Andrew Leslie of Leslie Castle sixth in line from Bartholomew, {{founder of the}} name Leslie in Aberdeenshire, by his wife Mary Abernethy, daughter and coheiress of Sir Alexander Abernethy. Along with his elder brother Norman, he obtained safe conduct through England {{on his way to}} Prussia to participate in a crusade against the pagans of that region. He had returned by 1356. He is then said to have gone to France, to aid the French in their wars with the English. He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> there more than once, for he was present at the Battle of Pontvallain in 1370, where he proved instrumental in the English defeat, and was rewarded by King Charles with a yearly pension of two hundred gold francs.|$|E

25|$|At 1:40pm on 15 November 1940 {{the sirens}} were sounded in Margate {{to alert the}} town of an air-raid. The lifeboat-men of Lord Southborough were mustered and were in the Margate {{boathouse}}. From the boathouse the men watched as the Royal Naval Tug HMS Guardsman exploded after she hit a mine off North Foreland headland. The lifeboat was immediately launched {{to go to the}} aid of the tug. By the time the lifeboat arrived at the scene, the tug had sunk, but the Lord Southborough was able to save the lives of seven of the crew of ten who they found hanging on to pieces of the wreckage that were still afloat. The lifeboat reported that {{there was no sign of}} the other two crewmen and it was assumed that they <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> down with the tug.|$|E
500|$|Only a few {{deaths from}} the fire are officially recorded, and deaths are {{traditionally}} {{believed to have been}} few.

They found that, while the White Sea assemblage had the most species, there was no significant difference in disparity between the three groups, and concluded that before the beginning of the Avalon timespan these organisms <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through their own evolutionary [...] "explosion", which may have been similar to the famous Cambrian explosion [...]|$|E

500|$|Siward was at Wearmouth in {{the summer}} of 1070, with Edgar and Mærle-Sveinn, while William marched to the River Tyne with his marauding army. Although William burnt down the church of Jarrow, he left Edgar's party undisturbed. Siward <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Scotland in this year, for the Historia Regum reports that in 1071 Morcar (previously earl of Northumbria) and Hereward went by ship to the Isle of Ely, and that [...] "Æthelwine, bishop of Durham, and Siward, nicknamed Barn, sailing back from Scotland" [...] arrived there too. This is also related by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which {{confirms}} that:Bishop Æthelwine and Siweard Bearn came to Ely and many hundred men with them". It was at Ely that Siward and all the other notables, save Hereward, were captured by King William.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World {{synopsis}} states, [...] "State Senator Jack Dare, one of {{the reform}} members of the legislature, starts to the state capitol to attend an important session of that body. That he took the midnight train from his home city is clearly proven, for his aged mother was a passenger on it, and besides the conductor and porter are certain that he retired for the night. In the morning, however, his berth is empty, although some of his garments are found there. The case puzzles the railroad officials and the police, and Violet Gray is {{given a chance to}} distinguish herself. She learns from the conductor and porter, who had happened to spend the night awake at opposite ends of the car, that the senator did not go by them. Consequently this leaves only the window as his means of egress, and she knows that he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> that way. Violet discovers that Dare is a hearty supporter of a bill that a powerful lobby is trying to defeat. The fight is so close that his is the deciding vote. Dare cannot be bribed, so his opponents spirited him away in a novel fashion. But the girl finds where he is hidden and brings him back, although he is much injured. He reaches his seat in time to cast the needed vote, and to astound and defeat the lobby." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} a place called Beharee Ghat on the western bank of the Son River and disembarked at about 4:00pm. Their path was then blocked by a large stream that could only be crossed using boats. The party took three hours to cross the stream and head inland. After the expedition had marched , Dunbar halted them [...] from Arrah for one hour to see if his supplies would catch up to him. When the supplies did not arrive, he ordered the expedition to press on, despite warnings from his subordinate officers of the danger of hungry, tired men marching through unfamiliar territory at night. Up to this point in the expedition, Dunbar had sent skirmishers as scouts ahead of his main body of troops; he now decided not to do so and the men advanced in a single body. As the party neared Arrah, they spotted men on horseback, whom they took to be vedettes (mounted sentries), that rode away as they approached. When the expedition was about [...] from Arrah, its route passed through a thick grove of mango trees. As the expedition was almost through the grove, they were fired on from three sides by a force they estimated as 2,000 to 3,000 in number. Heavy casualties were suffered during the initial ambush, including Dunbar (who was killed instantly), and the force broke up in confusion. The besieged party in Arrah heard the sound of gunfire, growing louder as the expedition approached them, then becoming more distant as the expedition retreated, and they immediately inferred that something <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> wrong. A wounded member of the Bengal Military Police Battalion who was part of Dunbar's force was able to avoid the mutinying sepoys surrounding Boyle's building. Pulled up into the building with a rope, he told its occupants about the ambush.|$|E

50|$|It {{is known}} that the Ancient Hawaiians ventured from the main islands as far as Mokumanamana (Necker), but they might <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> further to French Frigate Shoals. However, they <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>gone</b> by the 18th century, when Europeans {{discovered}} the islands, because the islands were deserted upon discovery. Many agricultural terraces have been found on Nihoa, proving that Hawaiians lived there long-term, but Mokumanamana, much barer of vegetation, was probably not able to support many people for long. It is thought that the early Hawaiians only came to Mokumanamana for religious purposes.|$|R
2500|$|There remains {{uncertainty}} {{as to the}} two sides' {{capability to}} have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: [...] "You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks.

However he stated on the record that [...] "there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic." [...] At no time had the Dáil or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.|$|E
2500|$|On the Sunday Samuel Wilberforce, now the Bishop of Oxford, {{used his}} sermon at St. Mary's Church on [...] "the wrong {{way of doing}} science" [...] to deliver a {{stinging}} attack obviously aimed at Chambers.

Chambers denounced this {{as an attempt to}} stifle progressive opinion, but others thought he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> home [...] "with the feeling of a martyr".

[...] Would it be possible to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up to that moment, would the beam splitter let it pass through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? Or, would it behave as though the second beam-splitter had always been there? Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave.
