40|$|Research on optimal {{bundling}} {{strategy has}} primarily {{dealt with the}} case of a monopolist and suggests that <b>mixed</b> <b>bundling</b> be adopted, as it allows for price discrimination. The overwhelming majority of consumer products, however, operate in a competitive arena, so that an adequate description of the bundling phenomenon needs to take account of alternative competitive product offerings. A few researchers have examined the duopolistic case—two suppliers each offering a bundle composed of two complementary products. However, the collective results do not paint a consistent picture. For example, Economides (1993. <b>Mixed</b> <b>bundling</b> in duopoly.

40|$|While {{there can}} be {{significant}} benefits for consumers who take broadband bundles, the complexity of communication offers and bundles has made {{it increasingly difficult to}} understand and compare service prices and characteristics. Bundling can provide both benefits and drawbacks to broadband customers. In general, bundled services are less expensive when purchased together and consumer surplus from one good in the bundle can help “subsidise” another less-valued element. Bundling also allows the integration of products in a way that benefits consumers. In other cases bundles can lead to situations where customers are worse off. Consumers may be required to purchase a bundle which contains one product they value and others they do not. Bundling also raises some significant concerns regarding transparency and consumer “lock in”. Bundles may make it difficult or impossible for subscribers to switch providers of certain bundled services and not others.

Abstract — The carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) bundle {{is a potential}} candidate for deep nanometer interconnect applications due to its superior conductivity and current carrying capabilities. A CNT bundle is generally a mixture of single-wall and multi-wall CNTs {{and has not been}} fully explored in previous studies. This letter introduces a diameter-dependant model to analyze the conductance of both single-wall and multi-wall CNTs. Using this model, the conductance performance of the <b>mixed</b> CNT <b>bundles</b> is analyzed and the estimation is consistent with the corresponding experimental result. This study also demonstrates that the <b>mixed</b> CNT <b>bundles</b> can provide 2 - 5 times conductance improvement over copper by selecting the suitable parameters such as bundle width, tube density and metallic tube ratio.

In the present work, a modified beam model is developed to investigate the effect of carbon nanotubes on the buckling of microtubule bundles in living cell. A realistic interaction model is employed using recent experimental data on the carbon nanotube-stabilized microtubules. Small scale and surface effects are taken into account applying the nonlocal strain gradient theory and surface elasticity theory. Pasternak model is used to describe the normal and shearing effects of enclosing filament matrix on the buckling behavior of the system. An exact solution is obtained for the buckling growth rates of the <b>mixed</b> <b>bundle</b> in viscoelastic surrounding cytoplasm. The present results are compared with those reported in the open literature for single microtubules and an excellent agreement is found. Finally, the effects of different parameters such as the size, chirality, position and surface energy of carbon nanotubes on the buckling growth rates of microtubule bundles are studied. It is found that the buckling growth rate may increase or decrease by adding carbon nanotubes, depending on the diameter and chirality of carbon nanotubes.
