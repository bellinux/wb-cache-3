25|$|Corbett {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} in March 1982 in Hastings, East Sussex. He was 57 years old. He is buried in the churchyard at Penhurst, East Sussex. The headstone inscription, chosen by his wife Maureen, reads 'The earth can have but earth which is his due: <b>My</b> <b>spirit</b> is thine, the better part of me', from Sonnet 74. Maureen was buried {{alongside}} him in 1999. Corbett is commemorated in the name of the Corbett Theatre at the East 15 Acting School at Loughton, which was founded by Margaret Bury and Jean Newlove, two members of Theatre Workshop, where he worked.|$|E
25|$|The Biblioteca Central (Central Library) {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} prism in {{the center}} of the campus. It was built by Gustavo Saavedra, Juan Martínez and Juan O'Gorman. O’Gorman was in charge of decorating the four sides with multicolored mosaics of stone pieces brought from all parts of Mexico. The murals relate to the history of Mexico. The north side reflects the pre-Hispanic period; the south reflects the colonial period and the east is from the modern period. The west side is meant to represent Mexico today with the coat of arms of the university in the center with José Vasconcelos’ motto of “Por mi raza hablará mi espíritu” (For my race, speaks <b>my</b> <b>spirit.).</b> These mosaics are the largest of their type in the world.|$|E
500|$|... (And <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> rejoices in God my Saviour) is an aria, as {{an image}} of {{personal}} celebration, sung by soprano II, accompanied by the strings. The major-mode and motifs of joy in the instruments illustrate the exultation. [...] (And exults) begins with a broken upward triad followed by a rest, suggesting a minuet. [...] (<b>my</b> <b>spirit)</b> is a sequence of 16th notes, two for every syllable. Longer melismas illustrate [...] (salvation).|$|E

500|$|The first aria {{is set for}} tenor with a virtuoso flute, [...] "" [...] (Where, in {{this valley}} of suffering). It {{contrasts}} again the anxious question [...] "" [...] (Where ... is the refuge of <b>my</b> <b>spirit?)</b> and the trusting [...] "" [...] (However, to Jesus' fatherly hands I will turn in my weakness), The anxious question returns in the da capo form.|$|E
500|$|The second vocal {{movement}} {{is a similar}} combination of ideas, now mostly from the New Testament. It quotes twice what Jesus said on the cross according to the Gospel of Luke. The first quotation (3a), [...] "" [...] (Into Your hands I commit <b>my</b> <b>spirit),</b> with an added explanation [...] "" [...] (You have redeemed me, Lord, faithful God), from Psalm 31, is rendered as an alto aria.|$|E
500|$|Upon Mendelssohn's death Lind wrote, [...] " [...] {{the only}} person who brought {{fulfilment}} to <b>my</b> <b>spirit,</b> and almost as soon as I found him I lost him again". In 1849 she established the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation, which makes an award to a British resident young composer every two years in Mendelssohn's memory. The first winner of the scholarship was Arthur Sullivan, then aged 14, in 1856. In 1869 Lind erected a plaque in Mendelssohn's memory at his birthplace in Hamburg.|$|E

500|$|Starved {{generated}} controversy {{even before}} its premiere. A number of {{specialists in the}} treatment of eating disorders expressed concern that the program would either make light of or glamorize eating disorders. Others, however, felt that Starved might focus attention on eating disorders as a serious medical condition. The National Eating Disorders Association called for a boycott of the show and claimed that Diageo (makers of Tanqueray) and Nautilus agreed to pull their advertising. Schaeffer responded to the controversy, saying [...] "there is some difficult stuff to watch. But I know <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> and intention are good." ...|$|E
500|$|Contemporary critics {{often found}} the work scandalous {{due to its}} sexual themes. A few years earlier Fuseli had fallen for a woman named Anna Landholdt in Zürich, while {{travelling}} from Rome to London. Landholdt was the niece of his friend, the Swiss physiognomist Johann Kaspar Lavater. Fuseli wrote of his fantasies to Lavater in 1779; [...] "Last night I had her in bed with me—tossed my bedclothes hugger-mugger—wound my hot and tight-clasped hands about her—fused her body and soul together with my own—poured into her <b>my</b> <b>spirit,</b> breath and strength. Anyone who touches her now commits adultery and incest! She is mine, and I am hers. And have her I will.…" ...|$|E
500|$|A violoncello piccolo {{complements}} the soprano in a recitative, which {{begins as a}} secco recitative, [...] "" [...] (How dear are the gifts of the holy meal), and leads to the fourth stanza of the chorale, [...] "" [...] (Ah, how <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> hungers), sung in a moderately adorned version of the tune. Bach uses recitative to introduce the chorale by evoking the [...] "gift of communion", while the chorale stanza expresses the longing for this gift, mentioning thirst and hunger. The melody sounds sometimes like a new melody, expressing that a personal longing. The violoncello piccolo in continuous motion [...] "envelops the soprano's voice in a quasi womb-like blanketing of divine reassurance",as Mincham phrases it.|$|E

500|$|The {{last of the}} [...] "Lucy poems" [...] to be composed, [...] "I {{travelled}} among unknown men", was {{the only}} one not included in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads. Although Wordsworth claimed that the poem was composed while he was still in Germany, it was in fact written during April 1801. Evidence for this later date comes from a letter Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson referring to [...] "I travelled" [...] as a newly created poem. In 1802, he instructed his printer to place [...] "I travelled" [...] immediately after [...] "A slumber did <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> seal" [...] in Lyrical Ballads, but the poem was omitted. It was later published in Poems, in Two Volumes in 1807.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marked the}} final regular {{performances}} of actors David Costabile and Jeremiah Bitsui as Gale and Victor. Gilligan considered changing the episode based on audience {{responses to the}} third-season finale, [...] "Full Measure", on whether Gale would be killed or not, but ultimately decided against it. During a twist scene in [...] "Box Cutter", Gus slices his loyal henchman Victor's throat with a utility knife right before Walt and Jesse's eyes. Esposito said {{he was concerned about}} filming the scene [...] "without really hurting <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> and my soul", and he concentrated so hard that he remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to others on set. The scene was so bloody it made Cranston's daughter faint during a screening.|$|E
500|$|The soprano and alto {{enter in}} unison [...] (My soul doth magnify [...] ). The vocal motif of [...] leaps up a major sixth and rises even higher. It is {{repeated}} {{several times in}} different combinations of voices, always in homophony. The second verse, [...] (And <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> hath rejoiced), is sung first by soprano and alto in third parallels. The men repeat it similarly and continuo [...] (in God), [...] accented by the characteristic figure of a lower mordent, which is repeated throughout the whole work, often when God is mentioned. The conclusion of the idea, [...] (in God my saviour), is expressed by a descending line, alternating the rhythm, one measure in 3/4, one 6/8, and alternating the women's voices in sequences. A short recapitulation of [...] {{marks the end of}} the second verse.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{consist of}} [...] "Strange fits of passion have I known", [...] "She dwelt among the untrodden ways", [...] "I {{travelled}} among unknown men", [...] "Three years she grew in sun and shower", and [...] "A slumber did <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> seal". Although they {{are presented as}} a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive {{of them as a}} group, nor did he seek to publish the poems in sequence. He described the works as [...] "experimental" [...] in the prefaces to both the 1798 and 1800 editions of Lyrical Ballads, and revised the poems significantly—shifting their thematic emphasis—between 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group; anthologies since have generally presented them as a series.|$|E
500|$|Written in spare language, [...] "A slumber did <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> seal" [...] {{consists}} of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl who [...] "seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation {{from the fact that}} she is now beyond life's trials, and [...] "at last...in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures". The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
6000|$|... "How should I know?" [...] she retorted, carelessly. [...] "Didn't {{you tell}} me to rally <b>my</b> <b>spirits?</b> Will you ring the bell, or must I?" ...|$|R

500|$|Giancarlo Esposito {{said that}} when he first read the script for [...] "Box Cutter", he was so shocked that he had to put it down and walk away from it. Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed, without really hurting <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip, which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E
500|$|In July 1651, the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{was visited}} by three Rhode Islanders {{who had become}} Baptists: [...] John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall. [...] Massachusetts reacted harshly against the visit, imprisoning the three men, while Cotton preached [...] "against the heinousness" [...] of the Anabaptist {{opinions}} of these men. [...] The three men were given exorbitant fines, despite public opinion against punishment. [...] Friends paid the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but Holmes refused to allow anyone to pay his fine. [...] As a result, he was publicly whipped in such a cruel manner that he could only sleep on his elbows and knees for weeks afterwards. [...] News of the persecutions reached England and met with a negative reaction. [...] Sir Richard Saltonstall, a friend of Cotton's from Lincolnshire, wrote to Cotton and Wilson in 1652 rebuking them for the practices of the colony. [...] He wrote, [...] "It doth not a little grieve <b>my</b> <b>spirit</b> to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecutions in New-England as that you fyne, whip and imprison men for their consciences." [...] He continued, [...] "these rigid wayes have layed you very lowe {{in the hearts of}} the saynts." [...] Roger Williams also wrote a treatise on these persecutions which was published after Cotton's death.|$|E
500|$|In the New Testament, the messianic {{expectations}} {{found in}} early Judaism were fulfilled {{on the day}} of Pentecost as recorded in Acts. The Christian community was gathered together in Jerusalem when a sound from heaven like rushing wind was heard and tongues like tongues of flame rested on everyone. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, miraculously praising God in foreign languages. A crowd gathered and was addressed by the Apostle Peter who stated that the occurrence was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2, [...] "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out <b>my</b> <b>Spirit</b> on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy". He then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus’ ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God. In response, the crowd asked Peter what they should do. He responded that they should repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Peter finished his speech stating that the promise [...] "is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself".|$|E
