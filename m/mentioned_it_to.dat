5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
25|$|Australia resumed at 119/1. With the Ashes {{series on}} the line and 42 degree heat, Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden {{improved}} on their overnight scores, but fell short of centuries, scoring 75 and 92 respectively after lunch. Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey both recorded centuries, with Clarke's being his second in as many Tests. Hussey got out rather cheaply, being caught behind by Geraint Jones. Adam Gilchrist made a quickfire 50 off only 40 balls. After that, he hit 3 sixes and a four from one Monty Panesar over, with the over ultimately costing 24 runs. Subsequent overs cost 10 and 18, with Gilchrist recording the second-fastest century in Test Cricket behind Viv Richards (the mark is the fastest in Ashes history, however), in just 57 balls. In an interview after the day's play, Gilchrist explained that he was unaware of how close he was to the record until after he had scored his century until Ian Healy <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him during that interview, but was not disappointed to be behind a player {{regarded as one of the}} most damaging hitters to play the game. Soon after, Ponting declared the innings and sent England in to bat. Brett Lee took Andrew Strauss' wicket with an inswinging ball, which Strauss left and it thundered into the pads and was given out, this left England at 0 for 1. By stumps, the score had progressed to 19/1.|$|E

500|$|At the 2015 New York Comic Con, Muto {{revealed}} that the miniseries originated with ideas that were initially developed during the show's second season. He remarked, [...] "There was this idea from season two about Marceline and ... how she got her powers to begin with. We kind of rolled with that and expanded that into eight episodes." [...] Olson was not aware that the producers and writers were working on a Marceline-centric miniseries until the series' head writer, Kent Osborne, casually <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her in a conversation; when she learned of this, she reportedly cried {{because she was so}} excited. Due to the Marceline-centric nature of the miniseries, a new opening was created that features Olson singing the theme song over a bass guitar. This intro was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and was animated by Masaaki Yuasa's company Science SARU.|$|E

Gillard linked the speech to {{the context of the}} then ongoing Alan Jones [...] "died of shame" [...] controversy. [...] was widely reported around the world. In Laos soon after for an Asian-European leaders conference, Gillard described comments by François Hollande and Helle Thorning-Schmidt: [...] "The president of France congratulated me on the speech, as did the Prime Minister of Denmark, and some other leaders, just casually as I've moved around, have also <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me."

500|$|Considering {{the idea}} of the fission bomb {{theoretically}} settled—at least until more experimental data was available—the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the [...] "super", now usually referred to as a [...] "hydrogen bomb", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium. Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one. The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs. Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might [...] "ignite" [...] the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei. Bethe calculated that it could not happen, and a report co-authored by Teller showed that [...] "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started." [...] In Serber's account, Oppenheimer <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Arthur Compton, who [...] "didn't have enough sense to shut up about it. It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" [...] and was [...] "never laid to rest".|$|E

500|$|The Nevermind {{album cover}} shows a naked baby boy, alone {{underwater}} with a US dollar bill on a fishhook {{just out of}} his reach. According to Cobain, he conceived of the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Geffen's art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Furthermore, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use. Instead, Fisher sent a photographer, Kirk Weddle, to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on {{the image of a}} four-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son of Weddle's friend. However, there was some concern because Elden's [...] penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they were afraid that it would offend people, but relented when Cobain {{made it clear that the}} only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis that would say, [...] "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile." ...|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true." ...|$|E

Thor had a range of , and therefore did not have the range to reach the Soviet Union and China from the United States. Britain, Germany, Turkey, the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan were considered as possible sites for them. Gordon Gray, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a Ministry of Supply official in January 1956, and unofficial, low-level approaches began in March 1956. The United States Secretary of the Air Force, Donald A. Quarles, officially raised the matter with the Minister of Defence, Sir Walter Monckton, and his Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Frederick Brundrett, in meetings at the Palace of Westminster on 16 and 17 July 1956. Quarles proposed sites in England for the missiles, and suggested that live firings be conducted from Scotland. Monckton noted that this option had already been rejected for Blue Streak, in favour of test firings at the Woomera Test Range. Monckton and Brundrett considered whether Thor or Jupiter would have the range for British purposes. The Americans could not supply nuclear weapons under the McMahon Act. The missiles could be fitted with British warheads, but these would be heavier, reducing the range to [...] Brundrett considered such a missile [...] "useless". The Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir William Dickson, queried whether Blue Streak was redundant if the Americans supplied Thor. Like many senior RAF officers and their USAF, he was also concerned about the fate of the manned bomber if the government embraced missile technology.|$|E

2500|$|Cocks' {{work has}} been anthologized and {{discussed}} in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, but sometimes with skepticism. In particular, Julian Rice writing in the opening chapter of his book Kubrick's Hope believes Cocks' views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained [...] "critical leaps" [...] of faith. Rice holds that {{what went on in}} Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust), but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one single obsession. Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for The Shining, commented on Cocks' observations and holds that preoccupation with the Jewish Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 August, Straffen {{was again}} at the cinema when he met 9-year-old Cicely Batstone. He first took Cicely to a {{different}} cinema to see another film {{and then went on}} the bus to a meadow known as [...] "Tumps" [...] on the outskirts of Bath. There he strangled her to death. The circumstances of the murder left many witnesses who had seen Straffen with the girl. The bus conductor recognised Straffen as a former workmate, a courting couple in the meadow had seen Straffen very closely, and a policeman's wife had also seen the two together. She <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her husband; when the alarm was raised the next morning, she guided police to where she had seen the two, and the body of Cicely Batstone was discovered.

2500|$|According to Thai history, Taksin {{defeated}} a [...] "sizable" [...] Burmese {{force at}} Ayutthaya garrison in November 1767. The Burmese chronicles do not report this although they usually report any battle of significance {{even if they}} tend to downplay those with an unfavorable outcome. For example, the Burmese chronicles mention the 1774 Lan Na rebellion despite the outcome. If the battle truly was in Ayutthaya and in November, the chronicles should have <b>mentioned</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> be sure, the lack of corroborating Burmese sources {{does not mean the}} battle did not take place. After all, the Burmese chronicles do not mention the looting of Ayutthaya either. Still, other contemporary events indicate that storming a fortified garrison was no easy task. The Chinese army could not take the Burmese garrison at Kengtung in 1765–1766. The Burmese themselves spent 14 months outside Ayutthaya. Taksin could not take Phitsanulok in May 1768.|$|E

When her oldest daughter was enthusiastic about the show, Collins decided to accept the offer from the studio. D'Agosta called her a [...] "notorious actress", but said that at the time they saw approaches {{from a wide range of}} actors and actresses who wanted to appear on the series. Pevney said [...] "Joan Collins was very good in it. She enjoyed working on the show and Bill and Leonard were both very good to her... Using her was a good choice." [...] Collins would later recall that Keeler was a Nazi sympathiser, a view which has been supported by other biographies of the actress.

[...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material.

Lloyd George [...] "read [...] all night", and <b>mentioned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Churchill, who wrote in 1928 that it held [...] "a permanent place in war literature", and described it as [...] "one of those cries of pain wrung from the fighting troops ... like the poems of Siegfried Sassoon [...] should be read in each generation, so {{that men and women}} may rest under no illusions about what war means". H. A. L. Fisher called it [...] "a masterpiece", whilst Montgomery thought it [...] "the best story of front line war"; from a purely literary perspective, it received a very positive review from Arnold Bennett. Other reviews described it as [...] "the best book published about life in the trenches" [...] (New Statesman) and [...] "one of the most interesting and moving English war books" [...] (Athenæum). However, it was not a commercial success. The war was not the most popular of themes among the reading public in 1919, and the book saw only limited sales; it was not reissued for another five years, with a second edition appearing in January 1924. Assisted by Herbert's growing popularity as a writer, it gained in popularity during the war novel boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s – five editions between 1928 and 1936 – but never reached the fame that many of its supporters feel it deserved.
