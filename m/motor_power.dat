5|$|Since {{his early}} youth {{he was very}} {{enthusiastic}} about flying and volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich on 10 December 1935. There he participated {{in a number of}} exercises and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) of the Reserves on 1 December 1936. In his civilian life, Brändle attained a pilot license and worked as a flight instructor. As an instructor, he trained roughly 150 students and logged more than 6,000 starts and 8,000 flight hours before he became a military aviator. In addition to his passion for <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> flight, he also was a glider pilot.|$|E

At around 11:35 her sails were being raised while the engine was still in use, and the ship was sailing towards the south-west at around 3 knots. At around 11:40, the ship's engine failed.|$|E
25|$|In Italy {{the driving}} licence is a {{governmental}} right given {{to those who}} request a licence {{for any of the}} categories they desire. It is required for every type of motorized vehicle. The minimum age to obtain a driving licence is: 16 years for a motorcycle 125cc with a limit of <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> of 11kW and for a quadricycle motor (cars with a weight of 400kg (550kg if it's for freight transport)and a <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> not exceeding 15kW), 18 years for a car or a motorcycle without a limit for the engine cylinder capacity and a limit of <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> of 35kW, and 21 years for mini-buses, three-wheeler without a limit of <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> and cargo vehicles, and 24 years for motorcycles without limits of <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> and for buses.|$|E

Gladiators were imported into England by the <b>Motor</b> <b>Power</b> Company, which was co-owned by S. F. Edge and Harvey du Cros founder of Dunlop. Financed by Harvey du Cros Herbert Austin built Clement-Gladiator cars at Longbridge from early 1906, selling them as Austin cars.|$|E
25|$|A mercury {{arc valve}} {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current. Rectifiers of this type were used in electric <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> supplies for industry, in electric railways, streetcars, and diesel-electric locomotives. They also found use in static inverter stations and as rectifiers for high-voltage direct current power transmission. Mercury arc rectifiers were invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902.|$|E
25|$|Some {{experiments}} have used {{an electric motor}} to drive the shaft to which the pedals are attached, while others have used averages {{of a number of}} actual cyclists. It is not clear how the steady power delivered by a motor compares with the cyclic power provided by pedals. Rohloff argues that the constant <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> should match the peak pedal power rather than the average (which is half the peak).|$|E

25|$|The diesel {{version of}} the TRAXX {{platform}} was introduced with the 2E {{version of the}} TRAXX platform. In the diesel version, the fuel tank occupies the same space as the transformer in the electric versions, centrally and below the main frame members. Installed <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> is 2.2MW. The diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives share the same driver cabin and control desk, body, bogies, and drive system. The maximum tractive effort is slight reduced by 30kN to 270kN due to the lower power of the diesel engine.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{promising}} approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency. It {{has been shown that}} totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.|$|E
25|$|The FCV concept {{also uses}} {{portions}} of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive technology including the electric <b>motor,</b> <b>power</b> control unit {{and other parts}} and components from its hybrid vehicles to improve reliability and minimize cost. The hybrid technology {{is also used to}} work together with the fuel cell. At low speeds such as city driving, the FCV runs just like any all-electric car by using the energy stored in its battery, which is charged through regenerative braking. At higher speeds, the hydrogen fuel cell alone powers the electric motor. When more power is needed, for example during sudden acceleration, the battery supports the fuel cell system as both work together to provide propulsion.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of trucks}} was {{constrained}} {{by the lack of}} fuel and high costs of synthetic gasoline on the German side, and the losses of equipment in 1941–1942 on the Soviet side. The Soviets managed their losses with the formation of 76 horse transport battalions of 500 horses each, and employed reindeer in the Arctic and camels in the South. But overcoming shortage of horses themselves was insurmountable: a work horse matures in three to four years; farm stocks were already depleted of horses as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage of horses since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly. Germany of the 1920s managed to restore their population of horses, but then it declined again as farm horses were replaced by <b>motor</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{boat was}} built in 1920 in Kiel, Germany at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} as Mary. Because of the terms imposed {{in the wake of}} the Armistice, Germany was required to hand over all new ships built as large steam or motor vessels, and Mary was one of a group of forty sailing ships completed at Kiel intended to operate primarily under sail, with auxiliary <b>motor</b> <b>power.</b> The boat was completed as a two-masted schooner and was just under [...] long, with a nominal displacement of [...] (gross).|$|E
2500|$|Despite appearances, these {{machines}} were not simply Selectric typewriters with an RS-232 connector added. [...] As with other electric typewriters and electric adding machines of the era, Selectrics are electromechanical, not electronic, devices: The only electrical components are the power cord, power switch, and electric motor. The electric motor runs continuously. [...] The keys are not electrical pushbuttons {{such as those}} found on a computer keyboard. Pressing a key does not produce an electrical signal as output, but rather engages a series of clutches which couple the <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> to the mechanism to turn and tilt the element. A Selectric would work equally well if hand-cranked (or foot-powered, like treadle powered sewing machines) at sufficient speed.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain <b>motor</b> <b>power,</b> but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, {{the locomotive}} will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as [...] "transition," [...] a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with federal law, all power-assisted bicycles, regardless of province, must 1) have {{a maximum of}} three wheels; 2) have steering handlebars and pedals; 3) use an electric motor of 500W output or less for propulsion; 4) must not be capable of speeds faster than [...] on level ground using <b>motor</b> <b>power</b> alone; and 5) bear a permanently affixed label by the manufacturer stating in both official languages that the vehicle conforms to the federal definition of a power-assisted bicycle. Power-assisted bicycles are required to use electric motors only, {{and may not be}} operated on certain provincial controlled-access highways or where prohibited by municipal law. Age restrictions vary from province to province, but all require an approved helmet. Some versions (e.g., if capable of operating without pedaling) of e-bikes require a drivers license in some provinces and have age restrictions. Vehicle licenses and liability insurance are not required. E-bikes are required to follow the same traffic regulations as regular bicycles.|$|E

New P85Ds have an optional [...] "Ludicrous Mode" [...] hardware package available with the 90kWh battery upgrade (thus becoming a P90D) that improves the [...] acceleration to [...] and 1.1g. Tesla initially reported the total output in the P85D as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at [...] but later reported it as [...] because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time. As of March 2017, the P100D variant holds the record for the fastest acceleration of any production vehicle with a NHRA rolling start to 60mph in Motor Trend tests with 2.28 seconds (0 to 100km/h in 2.36 seconds) in ludicrous mode, although other independent tests have placed it behind the Porsche 918 Spyder. Due to overheating issues, Tesla limits the amount of times that a driver is able to use ludicrous mode within a certain amount of time, as driving the car in that mode may shorten the battery's lifespan and can cause damage to the car.|$|E
