40|$|Abstract — P 2 P is {{a trendy}} {{technology}} used for file sharing. File replication and Consistency maintenance are {{the methods used}} in P 2 P for elevated system performance. File replication methods indicate replica nodes without thinking about consistency maintenance which may lead to high overhead for redundant file replications and consistency maintenance. Consistency <b>maintenance</b> methods update <b>files</b> without considering file replication dynamism which may not give the accuracy of replica consistency. Hence {{there is a need}} to think about consistency <b>maintenance</b> while <b>file</b> replication to achieve high performance and high availability. When data files are replicated at many nodes, consistency must be maintained among the nodes. In this paper we point out different replication strategies that are applied P 2 P systems, followed by consistency maintenance techniques intended for high performance and high availability of data. Finally we explore a combined method of file replication and consistency maintenance...|$|R
50|$|In the <b>maintenance</b> of <b>file</b> systems, {{defragmentation}} is {{a process}} that reduces the amount of fragmentation. It does this by physically organizing the contents of the mass storage device used to store files into the smallest number of contiguous regions (fragments). It also attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction to impede the return of fragmentation. Some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together, as they are often accessed in sequence.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} lecture, {{we looked at}} the cache-oblivious model, in which the machine has two levels of memory, one much larger and slower than the other, but where the memory system is {{controlled}} automatically, so that our algorithm doesn’t see the size of the blocks or the cache. We also looked at cache-oblivious B-trees. In this lecture, we look inside a black box from the last lecture: ordered <b>file</b> <b>maintenance.</b> We then examine ordered queries in lists, a topic related to ordered <b>file</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Finally, we learn how to implement cache-oblivious priority queues. 2 Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> The problem is posed as follows: maintain N elements in an array of size O(N) in a specified order, with at most O(1) gaps between two consecutive elements, subject to inserting and deleting in a specified place in the order. We show how to implement updates by moving a portion of the array of size O(lg 2 N), amortized. Since gaps are bounded, scanning k consecutive elements takes O(1 + k B) memory transfers, even cache-obliviously; inserting and deleting take O (lg 2 N B). Th...|$|R

50|$|Most {{operating}} systems support {{the concept of}} record locking, which means that individual records within any given file may be locked, thereby {{increasing the number of}} concurrent update processes. Database <b>maintenance</b> uses <b>file</b> locking, whereby it can serialize access to the entire physical file underlying a database. Although this does prevent any other process from accessing the file, it can be more efficient than individually locking a large number of regions in the file by removing the overhead of acquiring and releasing each lock.|$|R

The model demonstrates that the two prices exert negative effects on renewal and patenting, respectively (i. e. adverse own price effects). The model also offers a discriminating testable hypothesis, predicted on the cross-price effects, to identify complementarity or substitutability across sequential innovations. Our regression results show that the probability of patent renewal and maintenance fees are correlated negatively and that the patent propensity and application fees are correlated negatively. We also demonstrate that higher application fees are associated with lower probability of patent renewal, which corroborates the case of complementarity in sequential innovations.

50|$|Just as {{the records}} of the {{organization}} {{come in a variety of}} formats, the storage of records can vary throughout the organization. <b>File</b> <b>maintenance</b> may be carried out by the owner, designee, a records repository, or clerk. Records may be managed in a centralized location, such as a records center or repository, or the control of records may be decentralized across various departments and locations within the entity. Records may be formally and discretely identified by coding and housed in folders specifically designed for optimum protection and storage capacity, or they may be casually identified and filed with no apparent indexing. Organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed. The inefficiency of <b>filing</b> <b>maintenance</b> and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records.|$|R

40|$|Last lecture we {{discussed}} the cache-oblivious model for algorithm and data structure design, and surveyed current results within this model. During this survey, we developed {{the idea of a}} cacheoblivious dynamic B-tree. In order to construct this data structure, we utilized a black box component data structure that could maintain an array of N elements in order in O(N) space and achieve insert/delete operations in O(lg 2 N) (O (lg 2 N B) memory transfers in the cache-oblivious model). This problem is called Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> in the literature, and is the topic {{of the first half of}} this lecture. In the second half of this lecture, we complete our survey of cache-oblivious algorithms by investigating cache-oblivious priority queues. 2 Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> [1] [2] Formally the Ordered <b>File</b> <b>Maintenance</b> problem is to maintain an array of N elements in O(N) space by having only O(1) size empty array-slot “gaps ” between elements. This leads to scanning any k items in O(⌈k/B⌉) memory transfers and performing updates (insert/delete) in lg 2 N B memory transfers by rearranging only O(lg 2 N) amortized consecutive elements. Because both scanning and updates involve only consecutive elements, and therefore the 1 B factor in the number of memory transfers is obvious, we will continue in our investigation considering only the traditional data structure without any caching. The rough idea of the OFM data structure is as follows: on any update of an element e, choose progressively larger intervals of the array that contains e until the element density of the interval is “within threshold”, then evenly redistribute all elements in the interval. We choose intervals from our array using a symbolic complete binary search tree. We divide our array into segments of Θ(lg N) elements each, and use these as the leaves of our symbolic BST. When an update occurs, we walk up our tree until the segment of the array covered by the current subtree is within our density threshold. We define our desity threshold on a node at depth d in a tree of height h as follows: density ≥ 1 2 density ≤...|$|R
