25|$|Newtown was {{originally}} a relatively prosperous suburb, {{the legacy of}} which is the numerous lavish Victorian mansions still standing in the area. However, many parts of Newtown had gradually become a working-class enclave, and for much of the 20th century, Newtown was a low-income blue-collar suburb, often denigrated as a slum. In the post-war period, the low rents and house prices attracted newly arrived European migrants, and Newtown's population changed radically, becoming home to a sizeable <b>migrant</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

Accordingly this paper seeks to ascertain whether self-determination may operate to protect permanent refugee and forced <b>migrant</b> <b>communities.</b> Self-determination is a human right that has attracted considerable controversy. However, its universal applicability and the strength of the right make it an attractive means of limiting the power of a State in respect of refugee and forced <b>migrant</b> <b>communities.</b> Drawing from historical analogy this article concludes that in limited circumstances self-determination may be available for permanent refugee or forced <b>migrant</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R
