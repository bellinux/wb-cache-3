40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} new chelating material from <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose.</b> The first part treats the chemical modification of non-mercerized cellulose (cell 1) and <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose</b> (cell 2) with succinic anhydride. Mass percent gains (mpg) and degree of succinylation (DS) of cell 3 (from cell 1) and cell 4 (from cell 2) were calculated. Cell 4 in relation to cell 3 exhibited an increase in mpg and in the concentration of carboxylic functions of 68. 9 % and 2. 8 mmol/g, respectively. Cells 5 and 6 were obtained by treatment of cells 3 and 4 with bicarbonate solution to release the carboxylate functions and characterized by FTIR. The second part compares the adsorption capacity of cells 5 and 6 for Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, and Pb 2 + ions in an aqueous single metal solution. Adsorption isotherms were developed using Langmuir model. Cell 6 in relation to cell 5 exhibited an increase in Qmax for Cu 2 + (30. 4 mg/g), Cd 2 + (86. 0 mg/g) and Pb 2 + (205. 9 mg/g) ...|$|E
30|$|Alkaline {{treatment}} of cellulose, called mercerization, {{is one of}} the well-known treatments that induce the conversion of cellulose I. In the mercerization process, alkaline solution penetrates between cellulose chains to form a complex of cellulose, alkaline ions and water molecules. After washing with water, alkaline ions are washed away, yielding a cellulose hydrate called Na-cellulose IV. On drying, Na-cellulose IV is converted to the final structure of mercerization, cellulose II [6, 7]. Several studies on the hydrolysis efficiency of <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose</b> have been reported [8 – 10]. We have recently reported that <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose,</b> especially Na-cellulose IV, exhibits much higher degradability than cellulose I [11, 12]. Alkaline treatment, as a useful pre{{treatment of}} lignocellulosic biomass to remove hemicellulose and lignin, has also been studied. Although the concentration of alkaline solution used in these pretreatments is generally too low to induce mercerization, we nonetheless applied the same treatment, but with concentrated alkaline solution that could induce mercerization of cellulose to lignocellulosic biomass, bagasse, as cellulose samples [12]. The results of the study suggested that the alkaline treatment could lead to mercerization of cellulose in bagasse {{at the same time as}} the removal of hemicellulose and lignin, which indicates a significant improvement in enzymatic degradability.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we study {{the effect of}} the nixtamalization time on the structural, {{morphological}} and thermal properties of the corn pericarp. We also studied the semi-quantitative changes in the chemical composition of the pericarp by x-ray diffraction. By correlating the results obtained by x-ray diffraction and photoacustics we propose that nixtamalization {{can be viewed as a}} series of physicochemical phenomena that involve hemicellulos dissolution, swelling, alkaline cellulose formation and phase transition between native and <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose.</b> We found consistent values for some physical properties of the raw pericarp...|$|E
30|$|Cellulose {{isolated}} from wood is more susceptible than cotton cellulose to homogeneous hydrolysis in phosphoric acid. The influence of carboxyl group introduction at the C 6 {{position on the}} hydrolysis rate of cellulose in 82.5 % phosphoric acid was studied {{as a model of}} the oxidation of cellulose during pulping. The rate constant of hydrolysis for dissolving pulp was larger than that of cotton cellulose at temperatures of 25 °– 35 °C. <b>Mercerized</b> cotton <b>cellulose</b> was partially oxidized regioselectively at the C 6 position by a free radical system using 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine 1 -oxyl (TEMPO). The oxidized cellulose was obtained at a range of 1.7 – 12.7 mEq carboxyl content per 100 g of cellulose. The hydrolysis rate of the oxidized cellulose samples accelerated with increasing carboxyl content in the samples.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} posed {{in the title}} has been addressed by studying the swelling of celluloses at 20 C by twenty protic solvents, including water; linear- and branched-chain aliphatic alcohols; unsaturated aliphatic alcohols, and alkoxyalcohols. The biopolymers investigated included microcrystalline cellulose, MC, native and never-dried <b>mercerized</b> cotton <b>cellulose,</b> cotton and M-cotton, and native and never-dried <b>mercerized</b> eucalyptus <b>cellulose,</b> eucalyptus and M-eucalyptus, respectively. In most cases, better correlations with the physico-chemical properties of the solvents were obtained when the swelling was expressed as number of moles of solvent/anhydroglucose unit, nSw, rather than as % increase in sample weight. The descriptors employed in these correlations included, where available, Hildebrand`s solubility parameters, Gutmann`s acceptor and donor numbers, solvent molar volume, V(S), as well as solvatochromic parameters. The latter, employed {{for the first time}} for correlating the swelling of biopolymers, included empirical solvent polarity, E(T) (30), solvent ""acidity"", alpha(S), ""basicity"", beta(S), and dipolarity/polarizability, pi(S) *, respectively. Small regression coefficients and large sums of the squares of the residues were obtained when values of nSw were correlated with two solvent parameters. Much better correlations were obtained with three solvent parameters. The most statistically significant descriptor in the correlation equation depends on the cellulose, being pi(S) * for MC, cotton, and eucalyptus, and V(S) for M-cotton and M-eucalyptus. The best correlations were obtained with the same set of four parameters for all celluloses, namely, solvent pKa (or alpha(S)) beta(S), pi(S) *, and V(S), respectively. These results indicate that the supra-molecular structure of the biopolymer, in particular the average sizes of crystallites and micro-pores, and the presence of its chains in parallel (cellulose I) or anti-parallel (cellulose II) arrangements control its swelling. At least for the present biopolymer/solvent systems, use of solvatochromic parameters is a superior alternative to Hildebrand`s solubility parameters and/or Gutmann`s acceptor and donor numbers. The relevance of these results to the accessibility of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, hence to its reactivity, is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Reactions of fibrous {{cellulose}} are always {{more or less}} influenced by the fiber structure of the material. Native, <b>mercerized</b> or regenerated <b>celluloses</b> will all be different in this respect, partly because of their distinctive lattice structures, but mostly because of their unequal accessibilities. Reactions such as acetylation or etherification have {{to be carried out}} with activated cellulose, made more accessible by preswelling.

40|$|This study {{described}} the anaerobic {{degradation of the}} azo dye Remazol Golden Yellow RNL (RGY-RNL) using cellulose-immobilized riboflavin (MC 3) as the redox mediator. This new solid support containing immobilized riboflavin was synthesized from succinylated <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose,</b> and was characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, and solid-state 13 C NMR. MC 3 was resistant to pH 2 – 9, and anaerobic degradation of RGY-RNL using MC 3 {{in the presence of}} anaerobic sludge yielded a zero order degradation rate constant (k 0,obs) equal to 0. 189 mg/L h, which was 56 % better than experiments carried out without a redox mediator. Color removal efficiency after 48 h of degradation averaged 89. 4 % in experiments with MC 3 and 72 % without the addition of a redox mediator. These results showed that MC 3 can be used to immobilize redox mediators, allowing reduction of wastewater treatment cost...|$|E
40|$|Cationization of {{different}} cellulosic materials was successfully accomplished using an efficient solvent-minimizing spray-technique. The obtained materials were studied and evaluated {{in regard to}} reaction efficiency and regioselectivity using 1 D and H- 1 -C- 13 correlated 2 D NMR experiments. The high consistencies and temperatures applied using the spray-technique resulted in reagent effective etherifications and shorter reaction times. The NMR spectra indicated that the spray-technique favors substitutions at position O- 6, showing a regioselectivity of O- 6 > O- 2 > O- 3 for softwood kraft pulp (SKP) and cotton linters. However, cationization of <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose</b> and dissolving pulp, using the spray-technique, demonstrated more efficient reactions compared to SKP and cotton, and a regioselectivity of O- 6 a parts per thousand yen O- 2 > O- 3. Nanocrystalline cellulose showed the lowest reactivity and a regioselectivity of O- 6 a parts per thousand O- 3. In this work we provide information on structure-property relationships and characterization methods for modified polysaccharides, together with a solvent system that is well known industrially and in line with sustainability aspects...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Succinylated <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose</b> (cell 1) {{was used}} to {{synthesize}} an anion exchange resin. Cell 1, containing carboxylic acid groups was reacted with triethylenetetramine to introduce amine functionality to this material to obtain cell 2. Cell 2 was reacted with methyl-iodide to quaternize the amine groups from this material to obtain cell 3. Cells 2 and 3 were characterized by mass percent gain, degree of amination and quaternization, FTIR and CHN. Cells 2 and 3 showed degrees of amination and quaternization of 2. 8 and 0. 9 mmol/g and nitrogen content of 6. 07 % and 2. 13 %, respectively. Cell 3 was used for Cr (VI) adsorption studies. Adsorption equilibrium time and optimum pH for Cr (VI) adsorption {{were found to be}} 300 min and 3. 1, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm {{was used to}} model adsorption equilibrium data. The adsorption capacity of cell 3 was found to be 0. 829 mmol/g. Kinetic studies showed that the rate of adsorption of Cr (VI) on cell 3 obeyed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model...|$|E
40|$|We report here on {{some aspects}} of the {{acetylation}} in LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide, DMAc, of untreated and <b>mercerized</b> sisal <b>cellulose,</b> hereafter designated as sisal and M-sisal, respectively. Fiber mercerization by NaOH solution has resulted in the following changes: 29. 9 % decrease in the index of crystallinity; 16. 2 % decrease in the degree of polymerization and 9. 3 % increase in &# 945;-cellulose content. A light scattering study of solutions of sisal, M-sisal, microcrystalline and cotton celluloses in LiCl/DMAc has shown that they are present as aggregates, with (an apparent) average aggregation numbers of 5. 2, 3. 2, 9. 8, and 35. 3, respectively. The presence of these aggregates affects the accessibility of cellulose during its functionalization. A study of the evolution of the degree of substitution, DS, of cellulose acetate as a function of reaction time showed an increase up to 5 h, followed by a decrease at 7 h. Possible reasons for this decrease are discussed. As expected, M-sisal gave a higher DS that its untreated counterpart...|$|R
40|$|The {{digestion}} kinetics of {{a variety}} of pure celluloses were examined by using an in vitro assay employing mixed ruminal microflora and a modified detergent extraction procedure to recover residual cellulose. Digestion of all of the celluloses was described by a discontinuous first-order rate equation to yield digestion rate constants and discrete lag times. These kinetic parameters were compared with the relative crystallinity indices and estimated accessible surface areas of the celluloses. For type I celluloses having similar crystallinities and simple nonaggregating particle morphologies, the fermentation rate constants displayed a strong positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 978) with gross specific surface area; lag time exhibited a weaker, negative correlation (r 2 = 0. 930) with gross specific surface area. Crystallinity was shown to have a relatively minor effect on the digestion rate and lag time. Swelling of microcrystalline cellulose with 72 to 77 % phosphoric acid yielded substrates which were fermented slightly more rapidly than the original material. However, treatment with higher concentrations of phosphoric acid resulted in a more slowly fermented substrate, despite a decrease in crystallinity and an increase in pore volume. This reduced fermentation rate was apparently due to the partial conversion of the cellulose from the type I to the type II allomorph, since <b>mercerized</b> (type II) <b>cellulose</b> was also fermented more slowly, and only after a much longer lag period. The results are consistent with earlier evidence for the cell-associated nature of cellulolytic enzymes of ruminal bacteria and suggest that ruminal microflora do not rapidly adapt to utilization of celluloses with altered unit cell structures...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} work, chemically modified cellulose (EMC) and sugarcane bagasse (EMMB) were prepared from <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose</b> (MC) and twice-mercerized sugarcane bagasse (MMB) using ethylenediaminetetraacetic dianhydride (EDTAD) as modifying agent. In this work we {{described in detail}} the modification of these materials in function of reaction time and EDTAD amount in the reaction media. The resistance of ester bond at pH 1, 2, 11, and 12 was also evaluated by FTIR. The results were used to model the hydrolysis process and a kinetic model was proposed. The modified materials (EMMB and EMC) were used to adsorb Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions from aqueous single solutions. The adsorption isotherms were developed at two pH values. These materials showed maximum adsorption capacities for Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions ranging from 15. 6 to 54. 1 mg/g and 13. 5 to 42. 6 mg/g, respectively.

The first part involved the mercerization treatment of cellulose and sugarcane bagasse with NaOH 5 mol/L. Non- and <b>mercerized</b> <b>cellulose</b> and sugarcane bagasse were then reacted with ethylenediaminetetraacetic dianhydride (EDTAD) in order to prepare different chelating materials. These materials were characterized by mass percent gain, X-ray diffraction, FTIR, and elemental analysis. The second part consisted of evaluating the adsorption capacity of these modified materials for Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, and Pb 2 + ions from aqueous single metal solutions, whose concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. These materials showed maximum adsorption capacities for Cu 2 +, Cd 2 +, and Pb 2 + ions ranging from 38. 8 to 92. 6 mg/g, 87. 7 to 149. 0 mg/g, and 192. 0 to 333. 0 mg/g, respectively.

Acetatos de celulose com graus de substituição, GS, variando entre 0, 6 e 1, 9, foram preparados previamente a partir de celulose de linter mercerizado, em meio homogêneo, usando N,N-dimetilacetamida/cloreto de lítio como sistema de solvente. A influência de diferentes graus de substituição nas propriedades dos acetatos de celulose foi investigada usando a análise termogravimétrica (TGA). Métodos quantitativos foram aplicados nas curvas termogravimétricas obtidas a fim de determinar a energia de ativação aparente (Ea) relacionado à decomposição térmica de celulose não-tratada e mercerizada e acetatos de celulose. Valores de Ea foram calculados usando o método de Broido e considerando condições dinâmicas. Valores de Ea de 158 e 187 kJ mol- 1 foram obtidos para a celulose não-tratada e mercerizada, respectivamente. Em trabalho anterior verificou-se que o C 6 OH é o sítio mais reativo na acetilação, provavelmente devido ao impedimento estérico de C 2 e C 3. O C 6 OH participa da primeira etapa de decomposição da celulose, levando à formação de levoglucosana e, quando se tem a substituição para C 6 OCOCH 3, o resultado indica que o mecanismo de decomposição térmica muda para um com Ea menor.
