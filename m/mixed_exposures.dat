40|$|Workers are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} a wide variety of chemical substances, biological agents, physical agents, and other stressors encountered both in and out of the workplace. Each stressor has the potential to cause a physiological effect, whether it is a prescribed pharmaceutical, consumed food, cleaning product, automotive exhaust emission, solvent, ultraviolet radiation, noise, whole-body vibration, or social or psychological stress. <b>Mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> may produce acute or chronic effects or a combination of acute and chronic effects, with or without latency. Other exposures in combination with certain stressors may produce increased or unexpected deleterious health effects, or they may combine or interact in the environment to create a new exposure risk. Exposures to mixed stressors can produce health consequences that are additive, synergistic, antagonistic, or can potentiate the response expected from individual component exposures. This is the complex problem that faces environmental scientists and public health officials in setting and carrying out public health policy for the general environment, consumer product and food and drug safety, and the protection of workers. Because the issue of <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> affects all of these areas, it was selected as one of the priority areas of the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to leverage collaborative research efforts for better understanding the complex interactions of <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> research agenda includes the elements generally found in public health responses: surveillance, evaluation and research, and controls and interventions. Health surveillance is needed to identify mixtures with adverse health effects that cannot be explained by the toxicity of the individual components in a mixed exposure. Exposure surveillance is needed to identify workers exposed to mixtures with observed potential effects. To create manageable priorities for research and worksite interventions, systems are needed for ranking <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> on the basis of knowledge about health effects and the degree to which exposure is likely to occur. In addition, the research agenda describes a variety of evaluation tools that can be used to assess the risk of exposure to various mixtures. Additional research is needed to develop better tools for toxicity analysis, exposure-response modeling, and physiologically based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PB/PK and PB/PD) modeling. An approach based on observed health effects and observed exposures is needed to control exposures to mixtures and to assure that protective technologies are not compromised by multiple simultaneous exposures. For example, when the service life of respirator cartridges is reduced by the presence of an interfering agent, it should be determined whether that agent is toxic. Finally, the research agenda identifies intervention opportunities and information dissemination needs to assure that the outcomes of the developed research can be applied to preventing harmful effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures.</b> Because resources are limited, the <b>Mixed</b> <b>Exposures</b> Team identified several research needs as top priorities, including: 1. Develop and implement new surveillance methods to identify the number of workers exposed to these mixtures, the range of exposure concentrations, and health effects associated with the <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures.</b> 2. Develop research strategies that promote collaboration between occupational health professionals and workers in ranking and characterizing <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> within specific occupations and industries. Such assessment will also facilitate dissemination of research findings. 3. Conduct research to better understand the toxicology (biological mechanisms) of <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures.</b> 4. Develop methods to understand and integrate experimental data from the molecular level to the whole organism. For example, researchers should develop the ability to use data from proteomics and genomics studies and extrapolate these to whole body systems. 5. Develop methods that can be used to measure and predict deviations from additivity. 6. Develop and validate mechanism-based exposure-response models. 7. Develop the concept of the virtual human by means of PB/PK simulation. 8. Develop default parameters for mechanistically based risk estimation and extrapolation models. 9. Develop biosensors or measurement technologies (such as micro-arrays with advanced signal processing) that indicate whole mixture toxicity. 10. Identify, validate, and characterize the health outcome for biomarkers of exposure and response for workers exposed to mixtures. 11. Determine the effects of mixtures on engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE); evaluating each mixture's potential to adversely affect the protection provided by the controls. Through these research advances, policymakers and regulators may be better able to assess the true risk involved in most occupational and environmental exposures that include multiple stressors and mixed-chemical exposures.

RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic studies in humans support animal data demonstrating that exposures to endocrine-disrupting compounds have pronounced effects on pubertal timing and that the timing of endocrine-disrupting compound exposure and the specific agent causes different outcomes. Recent studies confirm subtle effects of lead, dioxins, and phytoestrogens on delaying onset of puberty and demonstrate an association of phthalates and polychlorinated biphenyls with earlier breast development and menarche, respectively.

40|$|The {{effect of}} mixed mutagen {{exposures}} on the rate {{and type of}} induced mutants was studied in the L 5178 Y/TK+/- [...] > TK-/- mouse lymphoma cell mutagenicity assay. In this assay, exposure to ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) results in more mutants that form large colonies than small colonies. Exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) results in more mutants that form small colonies than large colonies. Other reports in the literature suggest that large colony TK-/- mutants appear to result from small-scale, perhaps single-gene mutations, and that small-colony TK-/- mutants appear {{to be associated with}} chromosomal mutations. Treating cells for 4 h with simple, 2 -component mixtures containing 6. 45 [mu]g/ml MMS and either 261, 392, 560 or 712 [mu]g/ml EMS resulted in synergism of mutants at each mixture level. The frequencies of total mutants were synergized 12, 20, 35 and 72 %, respectively, in <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> with graded doses of EMS, above the sums of the mixture components.

The frequencies of small colony mutants in <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> were increased 31, 54, 73 and 123 %, respectively, while the frequencies of large colony mutants were increased - 7, - 6, 11 and 39 %. Statistical analyses provide strong evidence of synergism (within the limits of the assay) for total and small-colony mutants at all doses of EMS tested, and for large-colony mutants above 400 [mu]g/ml EMS.

40|$|In two {{experiments}} {{an imprinting}} procedure {{was used to}} familiarize chicks with two stimuli, A and B, that subsequently served as the discriminanda in a simultaneous discrimination. On {{the first day of}} each experiment, subjects either received presentations of A and B that were intermixed within a session (<b>mixed</b> <b>exposure)</b> or presentations of A in one session and of B in another (separate exposure). For half of the subjects in each of the exposure conditions, A and B differed in both colour and form; for the remainder A and B differed in form alone. On {{the second day of the}} experiments, the chicks were placed into a cool test apparatus and given training in which approaching A was rewarded by the delivery of a stream of warm air, but approaching B was not. Acquisition of this discrimination was more rapid when A and B differed in two respects than when they differed in form alone. When A and B differed in both colour and form, the heat-reinforced discrimination was acquired more rapidly after separate <b>exposure</b> than after <b>mixed</b> exposure; but when A and B differed in form alone, discrimination learning was more rapid following <b>mixed</b> <b>exposure</b> than separate exposure.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) can cause DNA adducts and initiate carcinogenesis. <b>Mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> to coal dust (CD) and PAHs are common in occupational settings. In the CD and PAH-exposed lung, CD increases apoptosis and causes alveolar type II (AT-II) cell hyperplasia but reduces CYP 1 A 1 induction. Inflammation, but not apoptosis, appears etiologically associated with reduced CYP 1 A 1 induction in this mixed exposure model. Many AT-II cells in the CD-exposed lungs have no detectable CYP 1 A 1 induction after PAH exposure. Although AT-II cells are a small subfraction of lung cells, they {{are believed to be}} a potential progenitor cell for some lung cancers. Because CYP 1 A 1 is induced via ligand-mediated nuclear translocation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), we investigated the effect of CD on PAH-induced nuclear translocation of AhR in AT-II cells isolated from in vivo -exposed rats. Rats received CD or vehicle (saline) by intratracheal (IT) instillation. Three days before sacrifice, half of the rats in each group started daily intraperitoneal injections of the PAH, β-naphthoflavone (BNF). Results Fourteen days after IT CD exposure and 1 day after the last intraperitoneal BNF injection, AhR immunofluorescence indicated that proportional AhR nuclear expression and the percentage of cells with nuclear AhR were significantly increased in rats receiving IT saline and BNF injections compared to vehicle controls. However, in CD-exposed rats, BNF did not significantly alter the nuclear localization or cytosolic expression of AhR compared to rats receiving CD and oil. Conclusion Our findings suggest that during particle and PAH <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures,</b> CD alters the BNF-induced nuclear translocation of AhR in AT-II cells. This provides an explanation for the modification of CYP 1 A 1 induction in these cells. Thus, this study suggests that mechanisms for reduced PAH-induced CYP 1 A 1 activity in the CD exposed lung include not only the effects of inflammation on the lung as a whole, but also reduced PAH-associated nuclear translocation of AhR in an expanded population of AT-II cells. </p...|$|E

40|$|A cancer {{epidemiologist}} {{recently said}} that "adduct measurement {{has so far}} been of little use to epidemiological research. " This remark gives us a starting point for the discussion of the purposes of measuring macromolecule adducts that originate from electrophilic compounds or metabolites in humans and animals. Historically, methods for adduct monitoring were developed as a means of determining target doses that, combined with measurements of genotoxic potencies, could be used for risk assessment. With mass spectrometric methods, adducts can be quantified at levels that are thousands of times lower than those in which the cancer incidence associated with this exposure is detectable in disease-epidemiological studies. Furthermore, mass spectrometric techniques permit identification of the chemical structure of the adduct, particularly in the case of hemoglobin adducts. Adduct measurement therefore constitutes not only a means of risk estimation but it may be used as a complement of disease epidemiology in situations in which, for statistical reasons, the risk is too low to be detectable [...] which does not signify that the risk is acceptably low. It also gives a possibility of identification of the dangerous components in <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> and of the relevant reactive intermediates in cases of complex metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Recent {{animal studies}} have {{demonstrated}} three separate and distinct mechanisms by which low toxicity dusts can cause important chronic pulmonary effects; through overloading of clearance mechanisms, through increased toxicity associated with ultrafine particle size or by increasing the toxicity of known carcinogens in <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures.</b> The problem to be addressed is how the pathogenicity to man of various airborne dusts should be evaluated, when epidemiological evidence is often insufficient, and the reliability of extrapolation of quantitative risks from animals to man is not established. In this paper we examine the feasibility of evaluating the likely human risks of low toxicity dusts by: (1) semi-quantitative comparisons of the ability of various dusts, in animal studies, to cause overload of clearance and resulting inflammation and fibrosis; (2) postulating that these relativities apply quantitatively to human risks; and (3) estimating approximate human risks by comparisons with reference dusts for which adequate animal and human data are available. Such a decision-making framework appears feasible, provided: (1) comparable and quantitative methods are used consistently in animal studies for the measurement of impairment of clearance leading to overload and resulting inflammation and fibrosis; (2) the quantitative relationship...|$|E

METHODS: A group of 1003 workers exposed to methylparathion or ethylparathion (alkyl phosphates), propoxur (carbamate), or cyfluthrin (pyrethroid) was investigated. After exposure to methylparathion or ethylparathion the methylparathion or ethylparathion and methylparaoxon or ethylparaoxon concentrations in plasma, the p-nitrophenol concentration in urine, and the activities of cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase were measured.

Before analysis, the acidified urine samples were spiked with $-(p-fluorine) -phenylmercapturic acid as internal standard.

Evidence for {{carcinogenicity}} {{to humans}} (inadequate) ln one study, the mortality of 161 men exposed to ethylene dibromide in two factories since the mid- 1920 s and 1942, respectively, was investigated. By 1 January 1976, 36 workers had died, seven ofthem from cancer (5. 8 expected) I. ln another study, the mortality of 25 10 male workers employed at a chemical plant was investigated. Ethylene dibromide {{was one of}} several chemicals used and was apparently a minor component of the <b>mixed</b> <b>exposure.</b> No statistically significant excess of cancer at any site was found 2. An excess of Iymphoma was detected in a mortality study of grain workers in the USA who may have had exposure to ethylene dibromide, among other compounds 3. B. Evidence for carcinogenicity to animais (suffcíent) Ethylene dibromide has been tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration and by inhalation in mice and rats and by skin application in mice. Following its oral administration, it produced squamous-cell carcinomas of the forestomach in animaIs of each species, an increased incidence of alveolar j bronchiolar lung tumours in mice of each sex, liver carcinomas in female rats, haemangiosarcomas in male rats and oesophagea...|$|R
40|$|Harmful algal blooms (HABs) {{and marine}} {{pathogens}} – like Vibrio spp. – are increasingly common due to climate change. These stressors affect the growth, viability {{and development of}} bivalve larvae. Little is known, however, {{about the potential for}} interactions between these two concurrent stressors. While some <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> have been performed with adult bivalves, no such work has been done with larvae which are generally more sensitive. This study examines whether dinoflagellates and bacteria may interactively affect the viability and immunological resilience of blue mussel Mytilus edulis larvae. Embryos were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (100, 500, 2500 & 12, 500 cells ml − 1) of a dinoflagellate (Alexandrium minutum, Alexandrium ostenfeldii, Karenia mikimotoi, Protoceratium reticulatum, Prorocentrum cordatum, P. lima or P. micans), a known pathogen (Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius -like isolate or Vibrio splendidus; 10 5 CFU ml − 1), or both. After five days of exposure, significant (p P. cordatum) and V. splendidus. Yet, despite the individual effect of each stressor, no significant interactions were found between the pathogens and harmful algae. The larval viability and the phenoloxidase innate immune system responded independently to each stressor. This independence may be related to a differential timing of the effects of HABs and pathogens...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{provided an}} overview of National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) and the progress made in the first year. The NORA Liaison Committee has worked with NIOSH to begin the transformation from a concept to a reality. Altogether, 20 NORA teams have been established including NIOSH staff and partners from academia, labor, industry, professional organizations, and other Government agencies. Increases in investment in NORA research areas has been observed. Twenty one research priorities were identified, including allergic and irritant dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fertility and pregnancy abnormalities, hearing loss, infectious diseases, low back disorders, musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremities, traumatic injuries, emerging technologies, indoor environment, <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures,</b> organization of work, special populations at risk, cancer research methods, control technology and personal protective equipment, exposure assessment methods, health services research, intervention effectiveness research, risk assessment methods, social and economic consequences of workplace illness and injury, and surveillance research methods. The success of NORA can be measured by NIOSH's research investment, other Federal agencies investments, funding of grant applications in NORA priority areas, research literature and prevention and intervention activities arising out of NORA. In this one year NORA has been recognized {{as a model for}} public/private partnerships. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Cover title. Also available via the World Wide Web from...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper reviews {{our current}} {{knowledge}} of the mechanisms underlying the induction of bystander effects by low dose, low-LET ionizing radiation and discusses how they {{may be related to}} observed adaptive responses or other protective effects of low dose exposures. Bystander effects appear {{to be the result of}} a generalized stress response in tissues or cells. The signals may be produced by all exposed cells, but the response appears to require a quorum in order to be expressed. The major response involving low LET radiation exposure discussed in the existing literature is a death response. This has many characteristics of apoptosis but is p 53 independent. While a death response might appear to be adverse, the position is argued in this paper that it is in fact protective and removes damaged cells from the population. Since many cell populations carry damaged cells without being exposed to radiation, so called “background damage”, it is possible that low doses exposures cause removal of cells damaged by agents other than the test dose of radiation. This mechanism would lead to the production of “U-shaped ” dose response curves. In this scenario, the level of “adaptive ” or beneficial response will be related to the background damage carried by the cell population. This model may be important when attempting to predict the consequences of <b>mixed</b> <b>exposures</b> involving radiation and other environmental stressors...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{certify that}} all {{research}} involving human subjects was done under full compliance with all government {{policies and the}} Helsinki Declaration. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has recently reclassified diesel engine exhaust (DEE) as a Group 1 carcinogen. Micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB), and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are associated with cancer risk. However, the impact of DEE exposure on MN frequency has not been thoroughly elucidated due to <b>mixed</b> <b>exposure</b> {{and its impact on}} NPB and NBUD frequencies has never been explored in humans. We recruited 117 diesel engine testing workers with exclusive exposure to DEE and 112 non-DEE-exposed workers, and then we measured urinary levels of 4 mono-hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as MN, NPB, and NBUD frequencies in PBLs using cytokinesis-block MN assay. The DEE-exposed workers exhibited significantly higher MN, NPB, and NBUD frequencies than the non-DEE-exposed workers (P< 0. 05). Among all study subjects, increasing levels of all 4 urinary OH-PAHs, on both quartile and continuous scales, were associated with increased MN, NPB, and NBUD frequencies (all P< 0. 05).
