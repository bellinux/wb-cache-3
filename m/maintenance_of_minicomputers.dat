40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that library automation {{is most likely}} to be economically justifiable through (a) the sharing of computer resources among a number of libraries, by networking or other cooperative arrangements, or (b) the use <b>of</b> <b>minicomputers</b> within the complete control of a single library. Cooperation in data processing was the subject of the clinic of 1973. It is fitting, therefore, that the other approach, the use <b>of</b> <b>minicomputers,</b> should have been the theme of the 1974 clinic, the proceedings of which appear in this volume. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

5000|$|The {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>minicomputer</b> is vague {{with the}} consequence {{that there are}} a number of candidates for the first minicomputer. [...] An early and highly successful minicomputer was Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) 12-bit PDP-8, which was built using discrete transistors and cost from US$16,000 upwards when launched in 1964. Later versions of the PDP-8 took advantage of small-scale integrated circuits. The important precursors of the PDP-8 include the PDP-5, LINC, the TX-0, the TX-2, and the PDP-1. DEC gave rise to a number <b>of</b> <b>minicomputer</b> companies along Massachusetts Route 128, including Data General, Wang Laboratories, Apollo Computer, and Prime Computer.|$|R
50|$|Systems Engineering Laboratories (also called SEL) was a {{manufacturer}} <b>of</b> <b>minicomputers</b> in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It {{was one of}} the first 32-bit realtime computer system manufacturers. Realtime computers are used for process control and monitoring.|$|R

Hardware and archi- tectural features are covered in the paper by Divilbiss. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
