She cut her hair, prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers, speaking passionately after a <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> 29 March. On 4 April she signed a declaratory document marking her access to the local uprising forces. Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
50|$|In many countries, the bishop's {{power to}} permit priests to {{celebrate}} {{two or three}} <b>Masses</b> <b>on</b> one day is widely used, and {{it is common for}} priests assigned to parish ministry to celebrate at least two <b>Masses</b> <b>on</b> any given Sunday, and two <b>Masses</b> <b>on</b> several other days of the week. Permission for four <b>Masses</b> <b>on</b> one day has been obtained in order to cope with large numbers of Catholics either in mission lands or where the ranks of priests are diminishing. This sometimes also happens in the case of historic churches which are unusually small compared to their number of parishioners, but which have not been replaced due to their historic character.|$|R

5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} envoi, {{not wishing to}} test the Académie's {{tolerance}} too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work {{in the form of}} a secular <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> a text by Horace. This work, entitled Carmen Saeculare, was intended as a song to Apollo and Diana. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to Carmen Saeculare, he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of Ulysses and Circe. After Don Procopio, Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem Vasco da Gama. This replaced Carmen Saeculare as his second envoi, and was well received by the Académie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.|$|E

5|$|For several months, Bachelot and {{his fellow}} missionaries lived in three small rented structures, saying their first <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> the island in a grass hut. They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased, where the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace was {{dedicated}} in 1843. After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the Hawaiian language. During their mission's first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted. They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution. The priests' vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.|$|E
5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial <b>Mass</b> <b>on</b> 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{attacked}} {{once again}} down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) {{leading the way}} with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig.

They were driven back {{in the face of}} heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity to move forward. On Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.|$|E

5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper Batzen by 50% to adjust its face value to its intrinsic value to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. Not many people could thus {{take advantage of this}} exchange offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese Batzen were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable. Insider deals of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population. The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by Hans Emmenegger from Schüpfheim and Christian Schybi from Escholzmatt, sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to even hear them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (Landsgemeinde) {{of the population of the}} valley at Heiligkreuz, in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the freedom of assembly. The assembly, which took place after the <b>mass</b> <b>on</b> February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.|$|E

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of Alcell (R) lignin in iso-propanol/formic acid mixtures (1 : 1 mass ratio) was explored in a batch set-up using Ru/C as the catalyst (673 K, 4 h, 28 % <b>mass</b> lignin intake <b>on</b> solvent). Lignin oils were obtained in good yields (71 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input) and shown {{to consist of}} a mixture of mainly aromatics (10. 5 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input), alkylphenolics (6 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input), catechols (8. 7 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input), guaiacols (1. 3 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input), and alkanes (5. 2 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input), the remainder being soluble higher molecular weight compounds (GCxGC-FID and GPC). The results for the catalytic experiments using formic acid were {{compared with those of}} a non-catalysed experiment and a catalytic hydrotreatment with molecular hydrogen and Ru/C {{in the absence of a}} solvent. Distinct differences in product yields and compositions were observed, and highest lignin oil yields were obtained by catalytic solvolysis (71 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input) versus 18 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input for noncatalytic solvolysis and 63 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input for catalytic hydrotreatment. The effect of reaction time on oil yields and product composition was established and a reaction network involving depolymerisation, and hydro(-deoxy) genation pathways is proposed to explain the product yields and composition. Besides iso-isopropanol, the use of ethanol and methanol in combination with formic acid was also explored for catalytic solvolysis. Best results were obtained in methanol (4 h, 673 K) leading to a lignin oil (68 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input) containing 11 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input of alkylphenolics and 19 % <b>mass</b> yields <b>on</b> lignin input of aromatics.
