40|$|Background and Purpose: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an {{inherited}} disorder of the {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. This disorder results in recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Aspergillus species are the most common fungal infections in these patients. Case Report: Herein, we present a case of fungal infection in a girl with CGD. We confirmed aspergillosis through the positive microscopic and <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examinations,</b> as well as radiology results. Invasive aspergillosis in this patient with pneumonia, lung abscess, and osteomyelitis of the ribs was not initially treated with amphotericin B (Am B) and recombinant interferon-gamma. Conclusion: Among infectious diseases, fungal infections, in particular aspergillosis, remain a serious problem in CGD patients.

40|$|Background: Gallbladder {{stones are}} {{the main reason for}} {{numerous}} gallbladder removal procedures. In many cases it is impossible to discover gallbladder carcinoma during the preoperative workup. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening is usually the result of gallstones but may harbour carcinoma as well. The objective of our study was to estimate the accuracy of the intraoperative <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> for determination of a pathological process of the gallbladder. Methods: We retrospectively examined 25 cases of the gallbladder carcinoma found in 4288 patients who underwent cholecystectomy in the period from 1993 to 2004.  In each of those cases we determined whether a suspicion for carcinoma has been reported based on <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination.</b> Results: According to <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the gallbladder surgeon did not report any suspicion for the carcinoma in 52 % of the cases. Conclusions: Due to high inaccuracy of preoperative and intraoperative macroscopical assessment, pathological examination of the resected gallbladder is the only accurate method for the diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma, as well as for staging and establishing the indication for extended surgical procedure. </p...|$|E

40|$|Allopurinol {{were given}} to {{counteract}} gastric damage caused by stress in rats. In the study 64 male Sprague dawley rats were used. They were divided into 8 groups, and protective agents were applied at different doses for 8 weeks. Then, performing cold-restraint stress stomach tissues were taken out and investigated macroscopically to determine mucosal damage. Lipid peroxidation levels in the stomach specimens were determined by identifying Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels by the thiobarbituric acid method. These agents have shown protective effects against cold-restraint stress. Evaluating <b>macroscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> of stomach specimens and considering MDA levels determined this. The results obtained from the Vit-E (10 mg/kg/day), Allopurinol and Selenium groups {{were found to be}} statistically significant when compared to the control group (p< 0. 05).
