500|$|He was billeted with Alexander, who {{was working}} in Hut 8, the {{counterpart}} to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma. Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time. By October 1941, he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman. At this time, Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma, and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed. This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8, which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy. Together, Welchman, Milner-Barry, Turing and Alexander bypassed {{the chain of command}} and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, outlining their difficulties. It fell to Milner-Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person, on 21 October 1941. The next day, Churchill responded, [...] "Action this day: <b>Make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." [...] Within a month their needs were being met.|$|E

During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, Winston Churchill {{reportedly}} remarked to Denniston: [...] "I {{told you to}} leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally." [...] Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was [...] "Action this day <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> all they want on extreme priority and report {{to me that this}} has been done." ...|$|E

Lloyd has maintained links with the club after his playing career ended, and in May 2009 he voiced his wishes {{to become involved in}} the club {{from the point of view}} of investment. He stated to the Accrington Observer that [...] "I love football and always have. I was talking to Eric Whalley about it the other day and he said he wanted to sell and I wish I could afford to buy the club off him. I can’t do that but I would like some involvement and perhaps raise the profile of Accrington Stanley.

2500|$|On 21 November 2006, {{the region}} of the Komi Republic in Russia filed a lawsuit against t.A.T.u. over the album and song [...] "Lyudi Invalidy" [...] (translates to {{disabled}} people). Leonid Vakuev, a human rights representative for the Komi Republic, interpreted the song as being directed towards disabled people and cited words written in the booklet for the album, which said: [...] " [...] do not {{know what it means to}} be a human being. They are fakes inside the human form. They do not live, but— function". Katina said, [...] "Of course, we meant moral invalids, people who do not have [...] soul and human feelings." [...] When asked if they had anything against disabled people, she stated that she finds it offensive to refer to people by that term, and added, [...] "We take pictures together and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> priority seats [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|As a result, colleges use wait lists {{as a hedge}} to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> enough {{students}} in the fall. Some schools [...] "under-invite" [...] applicants in the regular admissions season to appear highly selective and then about-face and accept them from their wait lists later. One report is that Vanderbilt gets a tenth of their first-year class from the wait list. But it varies from college to college and from year to year. For example, in 2010 Stanford and Yale wait-listed 1,000 students while Duke wait-listed 3,000 students. Overall, one survey suggested that 30% of wait-listed students are eventually accepted, {{but this is an}} average figure for all wait-listed students, and the percentage is dramatically lower at elite or prestigious schools. There is a report suggesting that in recent years, the lists are more fluid than in previous years, in the sense that there is more wait list activity—which have become more of a safety net for colleges rather than students. Estimates vary about how many college applicants find themselves on a wait list; one report was that 10% of applicants were wait-listed.|$|E

2500|$|In Nintendo's year-end {{report for}} its 2016 fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017), the company {{stated that they}} had sold 2.74 million Switch units worldwide. Distribution of {{shipments}} included 1.2 million units in North and South America, 600,000 in Japan, and 940,000 in all other regions including Europe and Australia. To meet unexpected demand during March, Nintendo used air freight to ship Switch units, approximately costing an additional $45 per console, rather than the less-costly overseas shipment. Retailer GameStop reported that initial sales of the Switch were [...] "phenomenal" [...] and on track to surpass the Wii U based on their historical sales data, with merchandising director Eric Bright saying the Switch has had [...] "one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we've {{seen in a long}} time". Due to the strong sales, Nintendo has expanded its production capacity for the Switch, with anticipation of selling at least 10 million Switch consoles during the 2017 fiscal year. Kimishima stated that having a Switch user base of 10 million [...] "will give publishers and the rest of our business partners a sense that the future of Nintendo Switch is more promising" [...] and spur further games development for the platform. Kimishima said that a key goal in their production ramp up will be to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> enough Switch inventory near the end of 2017 for holiday sales, as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday-season period, while balancing the near-term high demand. According to Kimishima, Nintendo now believes that if they can realize 10 million in Switch sales in 2017, they expect that the Switch will have lifetime sales that are comparable to the Wii, which had sold over 100 million units in its lifetime.|$|E

On October 24, 1935, they tracked down Schultz and his associates Otto Berman, Abe Landau, and Lulu Rosenkrantz and shot them at the Palace Chop House in Newark, New Jersey.

Members of the SS were cautioned to carefully interview prospective marriage partners to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no family history of hereditary disease or insanity, but to do this carefully so as not to hurt the feelings of the prospective fiancee and, if it became necessary to reject her for eugenic reasons, to do it tactfully and not cause her any offense.|$|R
