40|$|We {{consider}} a simple network {{consisting of a}} source, a half-duplex DF relay with a buffer, and a destination. We assume that the direct source-destination link is not available and all links undergo fading. We propose two new buffer-aided relaying schemes. In the first scheme, neither the source nor the relay have CSIT, and consequently, both nodes are forced to transmit with fixed rates. In contrast, in the second scheme, the source does not have CSIT and transmits with fixed rate but the relay has CSIT and adapts its transmission rate accordingly. In the absence of delay constraints, for both fixed rate and <b>mixed</b> rate <b>transmission,</b> we derive the throughput-optimal buffer-aided relaying protocols which select either the source or the relay for transmission based on the instantaneous SNRs of the source-relay and the relay-destination links. In addition, for the delay constrained case, we develop buffer-aided relaying protocols that achieve a predefined average delay. Compared to conventional relaying protocols, which select the transmitting node according to a predefined schedule independent of the link instantaneous SNRs, the proposed buffer-aided protocols with adaptive link selection achieve large performance gains. In particular, for fixed rate transmission, we show that the proposed protocol achieves a diversity gain of two as long as an average delay of more than three time slots can be afforded. Furthermore, for <b>mixed</b> rate <b>transmission</b> with an average delay of $E{T}$ time slots, a multiplexing gain of $r= 1 - 1 /(2 E{T}) $ is achieved. Hence, for <b>mixed</b> rate <b>transmission,</b> for sufficiently large average delays, buffer-aided half-duplex relaying with and without adaptive link selection does not suffer from a multiplexing gain loss compared to full-duplex relaying.

40|$|International audienceAt first sight, {{aiming for}} energy {{efficiency}} appears to penalize electricity carriers. A {{close look at}} electrical energy flow, from primary to final energy, reveals abysmally low efficiency, resulting from the generation <b>mix,</b> <b>transmission</b> and distribution losses, and obsolete equipment. As a consequence, the share of primary electricity has to be reduced {{in order to achieve}} low carbon society scenarios in line with energy saving policies. Since it relies on a partial description of the electrical workflow, this viewpoint reveals certain weaknesses that need to be qualified with a long‐term planning assessment. We propose circumventing this drawback using a thermodynamic analysis based on the Gibbs free energy of the electromagnetic field. In particular, the so‐called Maxwell‐Faraday law of induction is the local result of an optimal path towards reversibility of the entire power system, described as a monotherm engine. This approach supports a multi‐scale analysis that naturally addresses those levels that involve huge losses, namely the functional materials, conversion devices and transmission network. As a result, the role played by magnetic energy is clarified: although it is required locally for conversion purposes, magnetic energy's overall value governs the transmission of electrical power through the grid. In addition to indicating kinetic reserve, an evaluation of the power system's reliability should include an assessment of magnetic energy from the very first moment of fluctuation (typically a few ms) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The conjectured {{transmission}} price response model {{presented in the}} first of this two paper series considers the expectations of oligopolistic generators regarding how demands for transmission services affect the prices of those services. Here, the model is applied to northwest Europe, simulating a <b>mixed</b> <b>transmission</b> pricing system including export fees, a path-based auction system for between-country interfaces, and implicit congestion-based pricing of internal country constraints. The pathbased system does not give credit for counterflows when calculating export capability. The application shows that this no-netting policy can exacerbate the economic inefficiencies caused by oligopolistic pricing by generators. The application also illustrates the effects of different generator conjectures regarding rival supply responses and {{transmission price}}s. If generators anticipate that their increased demand for transmission services will increase transmission prices, then competitive intensity diminishes and energy prices rise. In the example here, the effect of this anticipation is to double the price increase that results from oligopolistic (Cournot) competition among generators...|$|E

The source nodes in the network are modeled using a marked Poisson process. We consider the case in which only a single randomly located relay is added to one source in the network and study the outage probability gains obtained. Then, using a simple model, we study the case in which all sources can potentially use their nearest neighbor from the set of inactive nodes as relays, leading to a <b>mixed</b> <b>transmission</b> scheme in which some users employ decode-and-forward and others employ direct transmission. The optimal relay activation probability for the second case is found, observing that in the small outage probability regime it exhibits a binary behavior, being zero or one. Comparing both scenarios we conclude that activating more relays rapidly reduces the gains observed when only one source can use a relay. We derive closed-form approximations to the upper bounds on the error probability, averaging over all node positions and fading gains realizations, to support our claims...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the energy balanced data collection problem in WSNs, aiming {{to balance the}} energy consumption among all the sensor nodes in the data propagation process. Energy balanced data collection can potentially save energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime, and hence it has many practical implications for WSN design and deployment. The traditional hop-by-hop transmission model allows a sensor node to propagate its packets in a hop-by-hop manner towards the sink, resulting in poor energy balance for the entire network. To address the problem, we apply a slice based energy model, and divide the energy balanced data collection problem into inter- and intra-slice energy balance problems. We then propose a novel Inter-slice <b>Mixed</b> <b>Transmission</b> strategy and an Intra-slice Forwarding technique to address each of the problems. Finally, we design an Energy-balanced Transmission Protocol (ETP) to combine both techniques to achieve total energy balance in data collection.
