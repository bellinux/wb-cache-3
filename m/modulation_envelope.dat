50|$|Alternatively {{a series}} {{regulator}} can be inserted between the DC supply and the anode. The DC supply provides twice the normal voltage the anode sees. The regulator can allow none {{or all of}} the voltage to pass, or any intermediate value. The audio input operates the regulator {{in such a way as}} to produce the instantaneous anode voltage needed to reproduce the <b>modulation</b> <b>envelope.</b> An advantage of the series regulator is that it can set the anode voltage to any desired value. Thus the power output of the transmitter can be easily adjusted, allowing the use of Dynamic Carrier Control. The use of PDM switching regulators makes this system very efficient, whereas the original analog regulators were very inefficient and also non linear. Series PDM modulators are used in solid state transmitters also, but the circuits are somewhat more complex, using push pull or bridge circuits for the RF section.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{neural network}} (DNN) based {{acoustic}} modelling has been suc-cessfully {{used for a}} variety of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, thanks to its ability to learn higher-level information using multiple hidden layers. This paper investigates the recently pro-posed exemplar-based speech enhancement technique using coupled dictionaries as a pre-processing stage for DNN-based systems. In this setting, the noisy speech is decomposed as a weighted sum of atoms in an input dictionary containing exemplars sampled from a domain of choice, and the resulting weights are applied to a cou-pled output dictionary containing exemplars sampled in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain to directly obtain the speech and noise estimates for speech enhancement. In this work, settings using input dictionary of exemplars sampled from the STFT, Mel-integrated magnitude STFT and <b>modulation</b> <b>envelope</b> spectra are evaluated. Experiments performed on the AURORA- 4 database re-vealed that these pre-processing stages can improve the performance of the DNN-HMM-based ASR systems with both clean and multi-condition training.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of signal shapes, the above described simulated signals include various interfering factors that may impact the calculation of global phase shifts, including, as documented in Literature ([21], 33 – 34), unevenness in background intensity and <b>modulation</b> <b>envelopes</b> (α ≠ constant, b ≠ constant), low carrier frequency, signal noises, non-periodic apodization, and etc. For a linear carrier interferogram, if the signal is non-periodic, the sideband of the carrier frequency signal will be broader; if the carrier frequency is not high enough, then it will spectrally aliased with the baseband signal. In practice, however, most interference signals are usually not single frequency. The location of apodization is not readily selected for reasons such as background and modulation unevenness.|$|R
40|$|Narrowband speech can be {{separated}} into fast temporal cues [temporal fine structure (TFS) ], and slow amplitude <b>modulations</b> (<b>envelope).</b> Speech processed to contain only TFS leads to envelope recovery through cochlear filtering, {{which has been}} suggested to account for TFS-speech intelligibility for normal-hearing listeners. Hearing-impaired listeners have deficits with TFS-speech identification, but the contribution of recovered-envelope cues to these deficits is unknown. This was assessed for hearing-impaired listeners by measuring identification of disyllables processed to contain TFS or recovered-envelope cues. Hearing-impaired listeners performed worse than normal-hearing listeners, but TFS-speech intelligibility was accounted for by recovered-envelope cues for both groups.

40|$|In exemplar-based speech {{enhancement}} systems, lower dimen-sional features are preferred over the full-scale DFT features for their reduced computational complexity {{and the ability}} to better gener-alize for the unseen cases. But in order to obtain the Wiener-like filter for noisy DFT enhancement, the speech and noise estimates obtained in the feature space need to be mapped to the DFT space, which yield a low-rank approximation of the estimates resulting in a sub-optimal filter. This paper proposes a novel method using cou-pled dictionaries where the exemplars for the required feature space and the DFT space are jointly extracted and the estimates are di-rectly obtained in the DFT space following the decomposition in the chosen feature space. Simulation experiments revealed that the pro-posed approach, where the activations of exemplars calculated using the Mel resolution are directly used to obtain the Wiener filter in the DFT space, results in improved signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) when compared to the system without coupled dictionaries. To fur-ther motivate the use of coupled dictionaries, the paper also investi-gates the use of <b>modulation</b> <b>envelope</b> features for the exemplar-based {{speech enhancement}}.

40|$|We propose an {{auditory}} scene analyzer for double vowel segregation. Our {{technique is}} based on a two-dimensional representation of the signal that generates a cochleotoptic/AMtopic map, which is used to mimic the periodicity analysis performed in the principal monaural pathway at the brain-stem level. In our scheme, the incoming signal is first processed by a cochlear filter bank and the AM <b>modulation</b> <b>envelopes</b> are extracted for the outputs of the bank. The FFT of the output of each channel is then computed. The two-dimensional representation we obtain this way is then applied to a network of bio-inspired neurons. We use three versions of the network: relaxation oscillator, chaotic, and integrate-and-fire networks. The biological neural map acts as a coherence detector, i. e., regions with different oscillation phases are formed based on the onset times of events belonging to different sources.
