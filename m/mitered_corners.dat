50|$|Instead of bedrooms, {{there are}} two rooftop {{sleeping}} baskets. The baskets were redwood four post canopies with beams at <b>mitered</b> <b>corners,</b> protected from the rain by canvas sides.|$|E
50|$|Rollformed screen doors have <b>mitered</b> <b>corners</b> {{into which}} a steel or {{aluminum}} alloy corner is forced using a friction fit. If a steel corner is used, the rollformed sections are often pierced or staked into the corners, to help secure the corners together. If aluminum alloy corners are used, the corner relies on its friction fit alone {{to hold the}} door frame together.|$|E
50|$|The {{straight}} skeleton {{can also}} be used to construct an offset curve of a polygon, with <b>mitered</b> <b>corners,</b> analogously to the construction of an offset curve with rounded corners formed from the medial axis. Tomoeda and Sugihara apply this idea in the design of signage, visible from wide angles, with an illusory appearance of depth. Similarly, Asente and Carr use straight skeletons to design color gradients that match letter outlines or other shapes.|$|E
2500|$|My {{first piece}} of four-way Bargello was started {{approximately}} ten years ago [...] I placed a mirror on a Bargello design {{in a way that}} showed me how it would look if I <b>mitered</b> [...] a <b>corner.</b> This intrigued me so much, I graphed a design starting in the center and <b>mitering</b> all four <b>corners.</b>|$|R
50|$|The compact {{horizontal}} plan {{reflects a}} standard Usonian scheme. Three bedrooms and one bathroom are arranged on a linear axis like cabins of an ocean liner. With its prominent living room defined by six glass doors, <b>mitered</b> glass <b>corners</b> and cathedral ceiling, the home seems larger than its 1500 sq ft.|$|R
40|$|The {{bending moment}} {{capacity}} was studied under the diagonal tensile and compression loadings of <b>miter</b> <b>corner</b> joints with dovetail fitting in frames made with {{medium density fiberboard}} (MDF). The influence {{of the type of}} adhesive in the joints with dovetail fitting on bending moment capacity under diagonal tensile and compression loading were considered, and the joints without adhesive were compared. A total of 80 each <b>miter</b> frame <b>corner</b> joint specimens with dovetail fitting were made. Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), polyurethane (PU), and cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesives were used, and 20 specimens were prepared without adhesive (WA) with dovetail fitting. MDF was used as a frame material, as in normal practice. The specimens were subjected to diagonal tensile and compression loadings in accordance with ASTM-D 143 - 94. The data were analyzed statistically. The highest bending moment capacity under diagonal tensile loading (46. 09 Nm) was obtained in the specimens bonded with CA adhesive and the highest bending moment capacity under diagonal compression loading (72. 04 Nm) was obtained in the specimens glued with PVAc adhesive. Other than this, since there is no difference between these and the unbonded joints, the PU adhesive was not effective in increasing the bending moment capacity under diagonal tensile loading, and the PU and CA adhesives were not effective in increasing the bending moment capacity under diagonal compression loadings...|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} laid out on a 4 ft by 4 ft grid. The house is {{dominated}} by a low, nearly flat roof that flares dramatically over the living room, where three sides of the room are floor-to-ceiling glass. The windows have <b>mitered</b> <b>corners,</b> eliminating a support and giving {{the impression that the}} glass itself incorporates a right-angle bend. A small triangular bay projects from the glass wall as a piano niche, a common Wright element. Exterior wall materials are primarily locally quarried ashlar sandstone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{common storage}} box for tools, instruments, glassware, artworks, etc. is a sturdy box {{made to be}} longer-lasting and better-finished than a {{shipping}} box or crate. For instance, a box might be a rigid paperboard box instead of a corrugated box. Or {{it could be a}} wooden box with a sanded surface and <b>mitered</b> <b>corners</b> instead of a crude crate construction. A storage box {{may or may not have}} dunnage or cushions that protect the contents if the box is upended or shaken, and usually does not have hinges, latches or locks, but simply a cover. Boxwood gets its name from its superior properties for manufacturing this type of box, although those properties are equally useful when making a decorative box.|$|E

40|$|Mr. and Mrs. Carl Lindeken live 10. 5 miles {{northeast}} of Chadron, Nebraska, in a home with a big picture window over the kitchen sink, a window that faces the Sheridan Gates, a formation which is in Sheridan County across the Dawes County line. Outside the window is a small platform on which Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebes have nested for many years. The first year the Lindekens were aware of Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebes was in 1958 when a pair nested in the garage, a building which {{is attached to the}} house. The birds were 2 ̆ 2 messy 2 ̆ 2 but they were allowed to remain through the summer. Before the next year Mr. Lindeken built a small platform at the angle where the garage and house meet. It is about 10 inches below a sort of overhang of the roof and is screwed to the north and east sidewalls. It is well protected. The platform itself is made of a 3 -ply board about 7. 5 x 7. 5 inches with the outer <b>corner</b> <b>mitered.</b> The board is edged with a molding making a border which helps hold the nest together...|$|R
50|$|Platform {{construction}} {{is based on}} box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods. While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, {{different parts of the}} construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction. First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets. Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two mitered vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached {{to the bottom of the}} feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way <b>mitered</b> <b>corners.</b> Unlike European-derived styles, table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the mitered joints, especially the 3-way mitered joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{characteristics}} of a novel miniaturized optical delay line, which delays light in a meandering photonic crystal waveguide, and describe the design steps. We show how lattice parameters and refractive index difference of the pho-tonic crystal affect the bandgap width and suggest a criterion to select these parameters. Next, we focus on the parallel waveguide channels in photonic crystal, and analyze the impact of the channel length and the interchannel spacing on crosstalk. We suggest a method for <b>mitering</b> the sharp <b>corners</b> in meandering lines which reduces the undesired reflections by 8 dB. Considering all these guidelines, we examine the propagation of light in the proposed delay line through calculating time-delay and insertion loss. To achieve longer delays in a small device area, we concentrate on coupled cavities in photonic crystals and propose an approximate method for calculating the group velocity of light in the coupled defects. We show how by replacing waveguide channels of a mean-dering delay line with coupled defects we achieve time-delays more than 9 ps within a device size around 27 m, which corresponds to a miniaturization factor of 100. Index Terms—Coupled cavities, crosstalk, finite difference time domain (FDTD), group velocity, optical delay line, photonic crystal. I...|$|R
