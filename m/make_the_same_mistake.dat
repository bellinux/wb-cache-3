5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{written in the}} New York Daily News on March 24, 2008, Alex Rodriguez said how he regretted signing with the Texas Rangers (the team the Yankees {{acquired}} him from) {{in the first place}} and wished he had signed with the Mets rather than Texas. Rodriguez grew up a Met fan and of former Met first baseman turned announcer Keith Hernandez. Rodriguez stated how he listened to his agent Scott Boras about taking more money instead and did not want to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> of not being on a team he liked playing for by leaving the Yankees.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1891 Schiller had {{independently}} reached a doctrine {{very similar to}} William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation is to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.|$|E
500|$|Peter Sagan's {{victory in}} the race was his first since winning the rainbow jersey {{at the world championships}} road race the {{previous}} year. It was the end of what Cycling Weekly called a [...] "frustrating run" [...] that had included second place at E3 Harelbeke two days previously. He said that he was very happy to have won in the rainbow jersey, especially as Gent–Wevelgem was an important race to him. He said that he was determined not to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> as he had in previous races by working hard in the final part of the race; Kuznetsov's early sprint then set him up for his own sprint.|$|E
500|$|On 3 January, Western journalists {{toured the}} deserted Ap Bac hamlet with American advisors. When {{reporter}} Neil Sheehan asked Brig. Gen. Robert York what had happened, the general replied: [...] "What the hell's {{it look like}} happened, boy? They got away, that's what happened"! Shortly afterwards, more than 18 hours too late, the South Vietnamese hit Ap Bac with an artillery barrage. The artillery rounds killed another five South Vietnamese soldiers and wounded 14 others. Vann, who had made key decisions in the early phases of the battle, blamed the South Vietnamese for the debacle. [...] "It was a miserable damn performance, just like it always is. These people won't listen. They <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> {{over and over again}} in the same way". According to Moyar (2008), in blaming the South Vietnamese, Vann wanted to conceal the Americans' flawed intelligence and poor leadership. He hoped to pressure the South Vietnamese to accept future changes he favored.|$|E

500|$|A year later, Smith {{suffers a}} fatal heart attack. Blair, {{encouraged}} {{by his wife}} Cherie (Elizabeth Berrington), decides {{to stand in the}} leadership contest. He later meets with Mandelson to tell him that he has received support from key Labour frontbenchers. Previously a supporter of Brown, Mandelson switches his allegiance to Blair. Brown is furious that Blair has gone back on what he perceives as having been an unwritten understanding between the two that Brown was the most likely candidate for the leadership, but Blair is incredulous - believing that the circumstances have changed enormously in the intervening years. Smith's funeral passes, and Blair's camp is sure that Brown will run. Charlie Whelan (Dexter Fletcher) and Ed Balls (Matt Blair) advise Brown that he will receive support from significant trade unions. Blair decides to arrange a meeting with Brown. At Granita, Blair tells Brown that he will run for the leadership, and in return offers Brown unprecedented power as his Chancellor, should they win the next election, also offering Brown sweeping control of social policy. Brown asks what Blair's plan is should Labour win a second term in office, and Blair responds that he would not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> as Margaret Thatcher and [...] "go on too long," [...] agreeing to offer his support to Brown as his successor. Brown agrees and Mandelson prepares a statement from him, but discards Brown's alterations. The leadership contest is won by Blair.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, a {{pregnancy}} was {{written into the}} character’s narrative. Natalie was shown to be distressed {{by the prospect of}} being a mother and planned to have an abortion.

Her family background is so awful she doesn't want to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake</b> her mother made, but feels the odds are stacked against her and Barry." [...] Viewers saw a “devastated Barry” react badly to the news in a special extended four-hander episode (written by Christopher Reason and directed by Clive Arnold) – the episode had a maternal theme with the action flitting between Barry and Natalie’s saga and scenes between Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and his dying mother, which included revelations of child abuse and incest. An EastEnders spokesman said: [...] "We are very proud of the programme. The storylines involving Steve and his mother and Barry and Natalie are the stuff of intense drama.

2500|$|In Oz, [...] "some time ago," [...] Ruby and Mulan {{encounter}} Dorothy's dog Toto in {{the woods}} while searching for Ruby's pack. Dorothy believes the growling Toto has identified Ruby as a witch, but Ruby explains her wolf heritage. Toto runs off, and Red insists on helping Dorothy track the dog, after Dorothy initially goes the wrong way. The three come upon Zelena, who demands the silver slippers from Dorothy as ransom for Toto, whom she has found. That night, Mulan, Ruby, and Dorothy brew a potion to use against Zelena. Ruby and Dorothy go to collect the last ingredient, a poppy. Dorothy explains that Toto was a final gift from her beloved Auntie Em, who died shortly after interceding to prevent Dorothy's family from having her committed due to her stories of Oz. Ruby reveals that she was expelled by her village after accidentally killing her boyfriend, Peter. She also shares that she still feels she is searching for something, but she no longer knows what. They collect the poppy but then are attacked by winged monkeys. Dorothy confirms that she trusts Ruby, so Ruby takes on her wolf form and carries Dorothy to safety. After they return to Mulan, a seemingly disconcerted Dorothy goes off alone. Ruby tells Mulan that she thinks Dorothy is what she has been looking for, but she is afraid Dorothy is disgusted by her wolf identity; Mulan reveals that she regrets not having told someone how she felt, and urges Ruby not to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>mistake,</b> as Dorothy might return her feelings. But Ruby discovers Dorothy has fled. At the Emerald Palace, Dorothy confronts Zelena, who pricks her with a sleeping curse.|$|E
