50|$|Specific {{changes in}} lung volumes also occur during pregnancy. Functional {{residual}} capacity drops 18-20%, typically falling from 1.7 to 1.35 litres, {{due to the}} compression of the diaphragm by the uterus. The compression also causes a decreased total lung capacity (TLC) by 5% and decreased expiratory reserve volume by 20%. Tidal volume increases by 30-40%, from 0.5 to 0.7 litres, and minute ventilation by 30-40% giving an increase in pulmonary ventilation. This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50 mL/min, 20 mL of which goes to reproductive tissues.

50|$|Cooper himself defines aerobic {{exercise}} {{as the ability}} to utilise the maximum amount of oxygen during exhaustive work. Cooper describes some of the major health benefits of {{aerobic exercise}}, such as gaining more efficient lungs by maximising <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity,</b> thereby increasing ability to ventilate more air in a shorter period of time. As <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> increases, one is able to extract oxygen more quickly into the blood stream, increasing elimination of carbon dioxide. With aerobic exercise the heart becomes more efficient at functioning, and blood volume, hemoglobin and red blood cells increase, enhancing the ability of the body to transport oxygen from the lungs into the blood and muscles. Metabolism will change and enable consumption of more calories without putting on weight. Aerobic exercise can delay osteoporosis as there is an increase in muscle mass, a loss of fat and an increase in bone density. With these variables increasing, there is a decrease in likelihood of diabetes as muscles use sugars better than fat. One of the major benefits of aerobic exercise is that body weight may decrease slowly; it will only decrease at a rapid pace if there is a calorie restriction, therefore reducing obesity rates.|$|R

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] this preliminary study 20 patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) walked on the treadmill until symptoms limited further exercise.

In 4 patients the exercise tidal volume exceeded the resting inspiratory capacity, indicating a decline in functional residual capacity and increased work of breathing.

There are few measurements of total mechanical work and efficiency of the respiratory muscles in the literature (1). A simple method for the determination of the oxygen consumption and efficiency of the respiratory muscles, as well as an indirect measurement of the total mechanical work, has recently been described (2).

Pulmonary complications have ranked first among postoperative disturbances and as a cause of mortality. Preoperative respiratory function and changes of acid-base balance and serum electrolytes during postoperative course were evaluated in elderly patients over 65 years of age in order to assure a smooth and uncomplicated surgical procedure. Poor pulmonary function as following pattern has been observed in the aged. Inspiratory and expiratory reserve volume, vital capacity, <b>maximum</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> and one second forced expiratory volume decreased with advancing age, while residual volume/total lung capacity ratio increased. Breathing reserve ratio slightly decreased. In mechanics of breathing considerable difference between static and dynamic compliance was noted. In exercise tolerance test increasing ratio of pulse and pressure, oximeter rate, and exercise index were elevated with decreasing tendency of oxygen removal ratio and ventilation index. These changes associated with aging appear to be due to diminished cardiopulmonary reserve. In changes of arterial blood determination pre- and postoperatively, predominant decrease of pH and the most elevated carbon dioxide tension immediately after operation were confirmed. Oxygen tension was reduced to postoperative 24 hours and followed general trend of delay in recovery. There was a negative level in base excess preoperatively in 38 per cent of patients, a marked metabolic acidosis was observed immediately following operation and evidence of metabolic acidosis still one week after surgery. Among changes of serum electrolytes, Na, K and Cl did not show significance with the analysis we used. Correlation studies illustrate some of the dysfunction with increasing age preoperatively, tendency of delay in recovery from operative procedure and serious potentialities of postoperative morbity and mortality. Preoperatively, elderly patients whose laboratory findings suggest a pulmonary abnormality must have their condition fully evaluated and treated before undergoing an operation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Changes in {{ventilatory}} capacity {{during the}} work shift were studied in workers exposed to tea dust in two tea-packing plants, wood dust in two furniture factories, and virtually no dust in an inoperational power station. The FEV, and FVC in workers exposed to dust {{were found to}} decline during the work shift by a small but significant volume. The MMFR, Vmax 50 % and Vmax 75 % were too variable to display any trend. No dose-response relationship could be discerned between the fall in workers ' ventilatory capacity and the concentration of airborne dust or microbes {{to which they were}} exposed. Bronchodilators could reverse the fall in FEV 1. Many non-allergenic dusts of vegetable or animal origin have been shown to affect acutely the ventila-tory capacity of exposed workers. McKerrow et alt found that dust in cotton mills suppressed the "indirect <b>maximum</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> " (IMBC) and increased airway resistance during the working day. These findings were later confirmed 2 3 and others observed that the FEVo. 75, FEV 1, or forced vital capacity (FVC) were similarly affected in workers exposed to flax dusts, 45 cotton dust, 6 7 hemp dust, 8 9 and jute dust. 10 11 These changes were at one time considered to be byssinotic symptoms even though they occurred also in non-byssinotic subjects. In the past decade, however, workers' FEV 1 and FVC in particular were found to decline on exposure to dusts in industries where byssinosis does not occur, such as in coal-mines, 12 and in wool 13 and tobacco processing factories. 14 Similar changes tended to occur in other, occasionally more sensitive {{but at the same time}} less reproducible, indices of ventilatory function, such as the maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MMFR), peak-flow (PF), and flow volume curves (Vmax 25 %, Vmax 500 %, and Vmax 75 %).

(3) The itsms of the breathing function test were VC, %VC, FVC, FVC 1. 0, FEV 1. 0, FEV 1. 0 %, Index, V 75 /HT, V 50 /HT, V 25 /HT, V 10 /HT, V 50 /V 25, &V 25 /V 10, and they are not significantly for the two areas in both sexes, but except V 75 /HT in female was higher in the study area than in the control areas. (4) The correlation coefficient between the total mean values of average hearing loss in both ears and all the mean values of their lung capacity was r=- 0. 145 in male, and r= 0. 397 in female...|$|R
50|$|Maria Anna {{was highly}} {{intelligent}} but physically disabled. She suffered from bad health, worsened by the drafty and cold {{rooms of the}} Hofburg Palace. In 1757 she contracted pneumonia and almost died, the last rites being called for her. Although she survived, her <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> was permanently damaged, and she also developed a fusion of her spine which caused her to have a lump on her back. After that time, she began to have {{a close relationship with}} her father, and reportedly became Francis I's favourite child. She shared his interest in science and conducted experiments in chemistry and physics. Despite being disabled, Maria Anna often played important roles in major events of state, including acting as sponsor at Marie Antoinette's christening.|$|R
40|$|A 53 -year-old female patient noticed {{weakness}} and wasting of limb muscles at age 30 years. Over the following years, the sternocleidomastoid muscles became atrophic and wasted, with frontal baldness. At age 43, her eyesight began to fail because of bilateral cataracts. She had expe-rienced increasing sleepiness since adolescence. She {{was always very}} apt to drop off to sleep and always had diffi-culty in {{getting up in the}} morning. Examination at age 45 years revealed a hatchet face with frontal baldness, bilat-eral ptosis, grasp and percussion myotonia, and muscular atrophy of the four limbs, greater distally, and at the ster-nocleidomastoid. Pulmonary function tests revealed venti-latory insufficiency of a restrictive type with reduction of vital capacity (1800 mL, 55 % of predicted), total lung capacity (2500 mL) and <b>maximum</b> <b>breathing</b> capacit...|$|R
