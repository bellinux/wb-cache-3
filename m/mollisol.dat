5000|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that are}} taken into account to decide what type of farming should take place on a certain area of land including, topography, altitude, exposure, and rainfall. Soil plays a large role in {{determining}} how land will be used. <b>Mollisol</b> lands are typically described as semi-arid to semi- humid areas that are grassy. This is where most intensive cattle operations occur which produce beef and dairy. Although a majority of pastoral farming is conducted in <b>Mollisol</b> lands, pastoral farming can also be found in areas with soil made up of Entisol, Aridisol or Alfisol. Aside from soil order, pastoral farming {{is more likely to be}} found than arable farming in areas with steep slopes, cold strong winds and a wet climate. [...] All of these conditions are more advantageous to raising live stock than crops. Raising of sheep is often found in cooler regions with steep hills and above average rain fall. The wetness of the area and incline would make it unsuitable to grow crops. A similar conclusion is drawn by looking at dairy farms which are often found in warm wet climates.|$|E
50|$|Caliche (ka-lee'-chee, or {{sometimes}} klee'-chee) is a sedimentary rock, a hardened natural cement of calcium carbonate that binds other materials—such as gravel, sand, clay, and silt.

5000|$|<b>Mollisols</b> {{occur in}} savannahs and {{mountain}} valleys (such as Central Asia, or the North American Great Plains). These environments {{have historically been}} strongly influenced by fire and abundant pedoturbation from organisms such as ants and earth worms. It was estimated that in 2003, only 14 to 26 percent of grassland ecosystems still remained in a relatively natural state (that is, they were not used for agriculture due to the fertility of the A horizon). Globally, they represent ~7% of ice-free land area. As the world's most agriculturally productive soil order, the <b>Mollisols</b> represent {{one of the more}} economically important soil orders. [...] Though most of the other soil orders known today existed {{by the time of the}} Carboniferous Ice Age 280 million years ago, <b>Mollisols</b> are not known from the paleopedological record any earlier than the Eocene.

50|$|Switchgrass {{is useful}} for soil {{conservation}} and amendment, particularly in the United States and Canada, where switchgrass is endemic. Switchgrass has a deep fibrous root system - nearly as deep as the plant is tall. Since it, along with other native grasses and forbs, once covered the plains of the United States that are now the Corn Belt, {{the effects of the}} past switchgrass habitat have been beneficial, lending to the fertile farmland that exists today. The deep fibrous root systems of switchgrass left a deep rich layer of organic matter in the soils of the Midwest, making those <b>mollisol</b> soils some of the most productive in the world. By returning switchgrass and other perennial prairie grasses as an agricultural crop, many marginal soils may benefit from increased levels of organic material, permeability, and fertility, due to the grass's deep root system.|$|E
50|$|Metrosideros polymorpha {{may occur}} as a tall tree or a {{prostrate}} shrub, and everything in between. Preferred soils are acidic to neutral (pH 3.6-7.4) and either a Histosol, <b>Mollisol,</b> Podsol, Oxisol, Ultisol, or Alfisol. Rainfall of 1000 - 3000 mm per year is favored, but ōhia can grow in dry forests that receive as little as 400 mm or bogs that get more than 10000 mm of rain. On moist, deep soils, ōhia grows to 20 - 25 m high. Specimens reaching 30 m high are on record. The trunk varies in form. In some trees, it is straight and smooth; in others, it is twisted and prominently fluted. Trees growing in forests often have stilt roots, having germinated on logs or the stems of fallen hāpuu (Cibotium tree ferns), which have long decayed away when the tree has reached maturity. Some trees have fibrous aerial roots to gather moisture. At high elevations, and in areas with poor soils or little rainfall, shrub forms are the norm. Flowers are usually bright to medium red but orange-red, salmon, pink, yellow, or orange forms are also found. The flowers appear in clusters on the terminal ends of the branches. Masses of stamens extend from the flower and give the blossoms their characteristic pom-pom shape.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mollisols</b> a. k. a., Black Soils or Prairie Soils make {{up about}} 916 million ha, which is 7 % of the world’s {{ice-free}} land surface. Their distribution strongly correlates with native prairie ecosystems, but {{is not limited to}} them. They are most prevalent in the mid-latitudes of North America, Eurasia, and South America. In North America, they cover 200 million ha of the United States, more than 40 million ha of Canada and 50 million ha of Mexico. Across Eurasia they cover around 450 million ha, extending from the western 148 million ha in southern Russia and 34 million ha in Ukraine to the eastern 35 million ha in northeast China. They are common to South America’s Argentina and Uruguay, covering about 89 million and 13 million ha, respectively. <b>Mollisols</b> are often recognized as inherently productive and fertile soils. They are extensively and intensively farmed, and increasingly dedicated to cereals production, which needs significant inputs of fertilizers and tillage. <b>Mollisols</b> are also important soils in pasture, range and forage systems. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} these soils are prone to soil erosion, dehumification (loss of stable aggregates and organic matter) and are suffering from anthropogenic soil acidity. Therefore, soil scientists from all of the world’s <b>Mollisols</b> regions are concerned about the sustainability of some of current trends in land use and agricultural practices. These same scientists recommend increasing the acreage under minimum or restricted tillage, returning plant residues and adding organic amendments such as animal manure to maintain or increase soil organic matter content, and more systematic use of chemical amendments such as agricultural limestone to replenish soil calcium reserves...|$|R
5000|$|Sequim {{lies within}} the rain {{shadow of the}} Olympic Mountains and {{receives}} on average less than 16 in of rain per year—about the same as Los Angeles, California—and has given itself the nickname of Sunny Sequim. Yet the city is fairly close {{to some of the}} wettest temperate rainforests of the contiguous United States. This climate anomaly is sometimes called the blue hole of Sequim. Fogs and cool breezes from the Juan de Fuca Strait make Sequim's environment more humid than would be expected from the low average annual precipitation. Some places have surprisingly luxuriant forests dominated by Douglas-fir and western red cedar. Black cottonwood, red alder, bigleaf maple, Pacific madrone, lodgepole pine, and Garry oak can also be large. Historically, much of the area was an open oak-studded prairie supported by somewhat excessively drained gravelly sandy loam soil, though agriculture and development of the Dungeness valley have changed this ecosystem. Most soils under Sequim have been placed in a series that is named after the city. This [...] "Sequim series" [...] {{is one of the few}} Mollisols in western Washington and its high base saturation, a characteristic of the <b>Mollisol</b> order, is attributed to the minimal leaching of bases caused by low annual rainfall.|$|E
40|$|Strength regain in {{aggregate}} beds {{as a consequence}} of wetting and drying cycles was studied in two Andisols and one <b>Mollisol</b> from Chile, collected at two depths (0 - 10 and 40 - 60 cm). In the <b>Mollisol,</b> wetting and drying cycles promoted an increase of mechanical parameters (cohesion and precompression stress value), associated with increase of bulk density. The Andisols showed the same tendency, but in some coarse aggregate beds the measured values decreased or remained constant. After six cycles of wetting and drying, the restructuring of the aggregate beds from the <b>Mollisol</b> resembled more the measured properties of non-disturbed samples than the identically prepared samples from the Andisols. The change of pore water pressure during mechanical tests depends on the soil development: the <b>Mollisol</b> is sensitive to external load, during compression and shear tests the pore water pressure changed intensely, while in the younger Andisol, irrespective of the stress applied, the pore water pressure did not change significantly.

40|$|The genesis and {{characteristics}} of the Timpanogos, Hillfield, and Sterling soils and an unnamed <b>Mollisol</b> (soil formed on north- slope) on the east part of Cache Valley were studied {{in order to determine}} (1) why the soil morphology is not chronologically related to the geomorphic surface and (2 } why different soils have developed on these surfaces, even though the soil forming factors appear similar. The particle size distribution of the upper horizons of the Timpanogos, Hillfield, and unnamed <b>Mollisol</b> pedons are relatively similar. These soils developed from stratified deposits with granulimetric composition in which 75 to 90 percent of the grains are less than 100 micrometers in diameter, characteristic of wind-blown material. Development of an incipient argillic horizon in Timpanogos pedon indicates this soil did not develop under the moist conditions of the Pleistocene and the geomorphic surface was not stable after deposition. The material was reworked by the wind. The Sterling soil formed on an alluvial fan which was deposited during Holocene time and its development is chronologically related to geomorphic surface. The development of an incipient argillic horizon in the Timpanogos soil and a weak cambic horizon in the Hillfield soil and the unnamed <b>Mollisol</b> is due to topographic condition of the landscapes. The thick and dark mollie epipedon in the unnamed <b>Mollisol</b> (north-slope) compared to the Hillfield soil (south- s lope) which has an epipedon with color light to be mollie and a less thick A horizon is related to effect of microclimate...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyGanga M. HettiarachchiSoil carbon (C) {{sequestration}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the most effective potential mitigation options for climate change. Underlying mechanisms of soil C sequestration/preservation is poorly understood, even after decades of soil C research. The main research objectives of this dissertation were three-fold: (1) enhancing our understanding in mineralogical and physicochemical mechanisms of soil C sequestration in microaggregates, (2) understanding the chemistry of organic C sequestered in soil aggregates, and (3) to determine the resilience of C to different temperature-moisture regimes and physical disturbance in a six-month incubation. An integrated approach was used in obtaining a better picture on mechanisms of C preservation. Two long-term agroecosystems located at the North Agronomy Farm, Manhattan, KS (<b>Mollisols)</b> and the Center of Experimentation and Research Fundacep in Cruz Alta-RS, Brazil (Oxisols) were used. Main plots of both systems were till and no-till. <b>Mollisols</b> consisted of three fertilizer treatments; control, manure/compost and urea. Oxisols had three different crop rotations; simple, intermediate, and complex. Submicron level information gathered by spectromicroscopy approaches, identified the direct preservation of OC structures with the original morphology; suggesting that the preservation of OC is a primary mechanism of C sequestration in these soils. Physical protection and organo-mineral associations seemed to also be involved in OC preservation. Manure/compost addition and no-till favored labile C preservation in aggregates of <b>Mollisols.</b> Significant associations observed between reactive minerals and C pools in <b>Mollisols</b> indicated the significance of organo-mineral associations in OC preservation. Large microaggregates exerted strong C preservation through physical protection and organo-mineral associations. Unlike in <b>Mollisols,</b> Oxisols showed a poor correlation between reactive mineral fraction and organic C which indicated the significance of physical protection over organo-mineral associations. Resilience of sequestred C was significantly affected by temperature across both temperate and tropical soil ecosystems, directly and indirectly. High temperature influenced soil acidity and reactive minerals, ultimately affecting organo-mineral associations. Macromolecular propeties of humic acid fraction showed changes after six months. Overall, direct and indirect evidence from this study suggested that the preservation of SOC is an ecosystem property supporting the newly proposed theories in soil C dynamics...|$|R

The occurrence of Ultisols alongside acidic Alfisols and <b>Mollisols</b> in both zeolitic and non-zeolitic parent materials in humid tropical (HT) climatic environments, {{indicates that the}} soil diversity in India is large. These soils are not confined to a single production system and generally maintain a positive organic carbon (OC) balance without adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This review presents a synthesis of literature on the recent developments on the pedology of RF soils, including their physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical and micro-morphological properties, and their degradation status. It also addresses the changes in soil properties in semi-arid tropical (SAT) areas, created by climate shift during the Holocene. This knowledge contributed to our understanding {{as to how the}} parent material composition influences the formation of Alfisols, <b>Mollisols</b> and Ultisols in weathering environments of HT climate; and also as to how the relict Alfisols of SAT areas are polygenetic. The state-of-the-art information developed through the extensive work on such soils has helped establish an organic link between pedogenetic processes and bulk soil properties, and has provided an insight of many pedological and edaphological issues related to Alfisols, <b>Mollisols</b> and Ultisols mainly of HT climate. The synthesis has helped us to understand as to why the formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway in tropical environment of India and elsewhere in the world.

40|$|Background: Physico-chemical {{sorption}} onto soil minerals {{is one of}} {{the major}} processes of dissolved organic carbon (OC) stabilization in deeper soils. The interaction of DOC on soil solids is related to the reactivity of soil minerals, the chemistry of sorbate functional groups, and the stability of sorbate to microbial degradation. This study was conducted to examine the sorption of diverse OC compounds (D-glucose, L-alanine, oxalic acid, salicylic acid, and sinapyl alcohol) on temperate climate soil orders (<b>Mollisols,</b> Ultisols and Alfisols). Methodology: Equilibrium batch experiments were conducted using 0 – 100 mg C L 21 at a solid-solution ratio of 1 : 60 for 48 hrs on natural soils and on soils sterilized by c-irradiation.
