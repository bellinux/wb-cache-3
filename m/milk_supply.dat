25|$|Breast {{augmentation}} surgery generally {{does not}} interfere with future ability to breastfeed. Breast reduction surgery more frequently leads to decreased sensation in the nipple-areola complex, and to low <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> in women who choose to breastfeed. Implants can interfere with mammography (breast x-rays images).|$|E
25|$|Re-lactation is {{most easily}} {{accomplished}} with a newborn {{or with a}} baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she {{is more likely to}} be able to re-establish her <b>milk</b> <b>supply,</b> and more likely to have an adequate supply. Although some women successfully re-lactate after months-long interruptions, success is higher for shorter interruptions.|$|E

25|$|Heavy use of {{cigarettes}} {{by the mother}} (more than 20 per day) {{has been shown to}} reduce the mother's <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> and cause vomiting, diarrhoea, rapid heart rate, and restlessness in breastfed infants. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is more common in babies exposed to a smoky environment. Breastfeeding mothers who smoke are counseled not to do so during or immediately before feeding their child, and are encouraged to seek advice to help them reduce their nicotine intake or quit.|$|E
25|$|The human {{mammary gland}} is {{composed}} of several cell types, including adipose (fat cells), muscle, ductal epithelium, and mammary epithelium (referred to sometimes as lactocytes). The mammary epithelium is the site for excretion of raw materials into the <b>milk</b> <b>supply,</b> including choline. This occurs, for the fat portion of the milk, by apocrine secretion, where vacuoles containing materials bud off the cell into the lumen (storage) of the alveolus (milk secretion gland). From here the milk will be released upon stimulation with oxytocin via suckling.|$|E

40|$|Fresh milk is the raw {{material}} in milk processing industries. In fact, the amount of fresh milk tend to decrease every year. PT Frisian Flag Indonesia (FFI) is one of Milk Processing Industries in Indonesia. FFI has 18 fresh milk suppliers which locate in DKI Jakarta, West Java, Central Java and East Java. This scarcity of fresh milk will affect the continuity of production in FFI. The high demands of sweetened condensed milk (SCM) and ready to drink (RTD) products constrain FFI to be selective in choosing suppliers. Due to limited amount of fresh <b>milk</b> <b>supplies,</b> optimization of fresh <b>milk</b> <b>supplies</b> needs {{to be carried out}} {{in order to maintain the}} business. It was expected that linear programming model could provide an overview of fresh milk allocation from each supplier, therefore the amount of supplier could be maintained. The results showed that FFI required only 14 out of 18 existing suppliers for producing SCM and RTD. FFI needed 30. 6 billion rupiah of 31 billion rupiah for allocating fresh <b>milk</b> <b>supplies</b> budget. Post optimal analysis using the sensitivity analysis, we can see the changes in the amount of <b>supply</b> cost, fresh <b>milk</b> <b>supplies,</b> demand level and budget cost to get know about the permitted changes but did not affect the optimal value obtained...|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} century or so larger farms specialising in dairy alone have emerged. Large scale dairy farming is only viable where either {{a large amount of}} milk is {{required}} for production of more durable dairy products such as cheese, butter, etc. or there is a substantial market of people with cash to buy milk, but no cows of their own. In the 1800's von Thünen argued that there was about a 100 mile radius surrounding a city where such fresh <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> was economically viable.|$|E
25|$|Mothers express {{milk for}} {{multiple}} reasons. Expressing breast milk can maintain a mother's <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> {{when she and}} her child are apart. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Some babies are unable or unwilling to nurse. Expressed milk is the feeding method of choice for premature babies. Viral disease transmission can be prevented by expressing breast milk and subjecting it to Holder pasteurisation. Some women donate expressed breast milk (EBM) to others, either directly or through a milk bank. This allows mothers who cannot breastfeed to give their baby the benefits of breast milk.|$|E
25|$|Choline can {{be found}} in milk as free choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine, and choline levels within breast milk are {{correlated}} with choline levels in maternal blood. Choline consumed via breast milk has been shown to impact blood levels of choline in breast-fed infants – indicating that choline consumed in breast milk is entering the neonatal system. Choline may enter the <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> either directly from the maternal blood supply, or choline-containing nutrients may be produced within the mammary epithelium. Choline reaches the milk through a transporter specific for choline from the maternal blood supply (against a concentration gradient) into the mammary epithelial cells. At high concentrations (greater than that typically seen in humans), choline can diffuse across the cell membrane into the mammary epithelium cell. At more normal concentrations, it passes via what is believed to be a calcium/sodium-dependent, phosphorylation-related, active transporter into the cell.|$|E

25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human <b>milk</b> <b>supply,</b> thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
2500|$|Electric breastpumps {{can also}} be rented. [...] Rental pumps are many times {{recommended}} for mothers or babies with medical problems such as a premature infant or mother on medication that contraindicates breastfeeding. Rental pumps will generally sustain a mothers <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> better than personal use pumps. Lactation consultants may assist in selection and training in use.|$|E
2500|$|... "Exclusively expressing", [...] "{{exclusively}} pumping", and [...] "EPing" [...] are {{terms for}} a mother who exclusively feeds her baby expressed milk. With good pumping habits, particularly in the first 12 weeks while establishing the <b>milk</b> <b>supply,</b> {{it is possible to}} express enough milk to feed the baby indefinitely. With the improvements in breast pumps, many women exclusively feed expressed milk, expressing milk at work. Women can leave their infants in the care of others while traveling, while maintaining a supply of breast milk.|$|E

2500|$|Women use breast pumps {{for many}} reasons. Many women use breast pumps to {{continue}} breastfeeding after {{they return to}} work. They use the pump to express breast milk, which is later bottle fed to their child by a caregiver. A breast pump may {{also be used to}} stimulate lactation for women with a low <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> or those who have not just given birth. However, {{it is important to note}} that the amount of milk a woman is able to pump should not be compared to how much milk a baby can get; efficiency greatly varies. A breast pump may be used to relieve engorgement, a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull, possibly preventing a proper latch by the infant. A mother may also choose to pump exclusively if her baby does not latch properly, is hospitalized after birth, or cannot nurse for physical reasons (such as cleft palate). If the mother needs to take medication that affects the breast milk and may be harmful to the infant, which is a very rare instance, the mother may [...] "pump and dump" [...] the breast milk to keep up her <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> during the time period that she is on the medication and may resume nursing after the course of medication is completed. Pumping may be desirable to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not used.|$|E
2500|$|According to La Leche League International, [...] "Experienced {{breastfeeding}} mothers {{learn that}} the sucking patterns and needs of babies vary. While some infants' sucking needs are met primarily during feedings, other babies may need additional sucking at the breast soon after a feeding {{even though they are}} not really hungry. Babies may also nurse when they are lonely, frightened or in pain....Comforting and meeting sucking needs at the breast is nature's original design. Pacifiers (dummies, soothers) are a substitute for the mother when she cannot be available. Other reasons to pacify a baby primarily at the breast include superior oral-facial development, prolonged lactational amenorrhea, avoidance of nipple confusion, and stimulation of an adequate <b>milk</b> <b>supply</b> to ensure higher rates of breastfeeding success." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elsewhere, {{animals have}} widely {{been used as}} [...] "milk siblings" [...] for infants to toughen the nipples and {{maintain}} the mother's <b>milk</b> <b>supply.</b> In Persia and Turkey puppies were used for this purpose. The same method was practiced in the United States in the early 19th century; William Potts Dewees recommended in 1825 that from the eighth month of pregnancy, expectant mothers should regularly use a puppy to harden the nipples, improve breast secretion and prevent inflammation of the breasts. The practice seems to have fallen out of favour by 1847, as Dewees suggested using a nurse or some other skilled person {{to carry out this}} task rather than an animal. Tribal peoples around the world have used many types of animals for the same purpose. Travelers in Guyana observed native women breastfeeding a variety of animals, including monkeys, opossums, pacas, agoutis, peccaries and deer. Native Canadians and Americans often breastfed young dogs; an observer commented that the Pima people of Arizona [...] "withdrew their breasts sooner from their own infants than from young dogs." ...|$|E

60|$|There is, perhaps, {{this much}} truth in that, {{that most people}} do need a certain {{stimulus}} to exertion and a certain standard of achievement to do their best, but {{to say that this is}} provided by private ownership and can only be provided by private ownership is an altogether different thing.
