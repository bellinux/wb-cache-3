Outgoing Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie also offered congratulations, pledging 'not be a back seat driver' and was 'confident that she is more than equal to taking on Alex Salmond'. Murdo Fraser conceded defeat, saying he was 'disappointed that I {{was not able to}} persuade <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> members that my vision for the future is the correct one', but pledged to support Davidson as leader.|$|E
25|$|The global {{chemicals}} {{industry was}} in a distinct recession, and the company faced difficult times. The company employed 23,000 and had £2 billion in annual revenue, with 30% from the United States, 40% from Europe and 15% from Asia-Pacific. CEO Sipko Huismans had focused the company on rationalisation and cost cutting: We have to cut costs. We can't count on sales growth to pay us more or {{to allow us to}} buy <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> favorite things. In 1991, the company closed its viscose plant in Calais, France, allowing its other plants to boost output to 93% capacity, compared with an industry average of 75%. This enabled the share price to double in the first three years following the demerger.|$|E

It was {{replaced}} with a scene where Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack or not. In it, Truman asserts that dropping the bomb will shorten the war, and a [...] "year less of war will mean life for... from 300,000 to half a million of America's finest youth".|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him {{sitting up in bed}} holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E

LucasArts revealed no additional details at the time beyond a projected release {{in the first quarter}} of 2004. The game was officially announced for Windows at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention on May 12, 2003, where the full title Sam & Max: Freelance Police was revealed. LucasArts reaffirmed the projected early 2004 release date at the convention. The game's trailer was also presented at E3, reintroducing the characters and confirming that the original voice actors for Sam and Max, Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson respectively, were set to reprise their roles. Over the following months, several minor media releases were made, revealing new information regarding the game's developmental direction and graphical style. The game's release was highly anticipated by journalists in the video game industry, who published various previews and interviews with the development team, particularly with lead designer Michael Stemmle, one of the original designers of Sam & Max Hit the Road.|$|E

2500|$|Though Ronald and Nancy Reagan {{were both}} former actors {{and he had}} served as {{president}} of the Screen Actor's Guild, his administration had a curiously mixed record on support for the arts. Via a 1982 Executive Order, President Reagan established the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. In each year of his presidency (except for the fiscal years of 1982 and 1986), Congress staved off the Administration's efforts to cut federal expenditures for arts programs such as the National Endowment for the Arts. In a 1983 speech he declared, [...] "We support the National Endowment for the Arts to stimulate excellence and make art more available to <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> people," [...] yet throughout his administration, beginning with an early threat to cut the Carter-era arts budget in half, Reagan's economic and social agendas put him at odds, often contentiously, with artists and arts communities nationwide.|$|E

[...] According to Dennis Dewsnap's memoir, What's Sex Got To Do With It (The Syden Press, 2004), Orton and Halliwell had their ashes mixed and were buried together. Dewsnap writes about Orton's agent Peggy Ramsay: [...] "...At the scattering of Joe's and Kenneth's ashes, his sister took a handful from both urns and said, 'A little bit of Joe, {{and a little bit}} of Kenneth.

The intention was originally to sink her on Saturday 20 October 2007 – two days before its 36th commissioning anniversary. After some delays, on 3 November 2007 at 14:30 hrs she was eventually sunk by imported plastic explosives placed at 12 locations around the hull (totalling only [...] in weight). The sinking was prepared by Norman Greenall, once Chief Petty Officer (shipwright) on Canterbury, who has undertaken the scuttling of other New Zealand Navy ships (like [...] ). Greenall has a somewhat colourful reputation in the navy as the person who has [...] "sunk <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> navy ships than the enemy did in the whole of the Second World War" [...] – however, the actual sinking of Canterbury was performed by UK company Cadre One.

The lawsuit by their {{families}} claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album Stained Class contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words [...] "Do it" [...] in the song [...] "Better By You, Better Than Me" [...] (a cover version of a Spooky Tooth song), and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record, and the judge's ruling stated that [...] "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain {{the conduct of the}} deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli."
