But to get complete results in tints merely, requires both long time and consummate skill; and you will find that a few well-put pen lines, with a tint dashed over or under them, get <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> facts than you could reach in any other way, by the same expenditure of time. The use of the Liber Studiorum print to you is chiefly {{as an example of the}} simplest shorthand of this kind, a shorthand which is yet capable of dealing with the most subtle natural effects; for the firm etching gets at the expression of complicated details, as leaves, masonry, textures of ground, &c., while the overlaid tint enables you to express the most tender distances of sky, and forms of playing light, mist or cloud. Most of the best drawings by the old masters are executed on this principle, the touches of the pen being useful also to give a look of transparency to shadows, which could not otherwise be attained but by great finish of tinting; and if you have access to any ordinarily good public gallery, or can make friends of any print-sellers who have folios of old drawings, or facsimiles of them, you will not be at a loss to find some example of this unity of pen with tinting. Multitudes of photographs also are now taken from the best drawings by the old masters, and I hope that our Mechanics' Institutes, and other societies organized with a view to public instruction, will not fail to possess themselves of examples of these, and to make them accessible to students of drawing in the vicinity; a single print from Turner's Liber, to show the unison of tint with pen etching, and the [...] "St. Catherine," [...] lately photographed by Thurston Thompson, from Raphael's drawing in the Louvre, to show the unity of the soft tinting of the stump with chalk, would be all that is necessary, and would, I believe, be in many cases more serviceable than a larger collection, and certainly than a whole gallery of second-rate prints. Two such examples are peculiarly desirable, because all other modes of drawing, with pen separately, or chalk separately, or colour separately, may be seen by the poorest student in any cheap illustrated book, or in shop windows. But this unity of tinting with line he cannot generally see but by some especial enquiry, and in some out of the way places he could not find a single example of it. Supposing that this should be so in your own case, and that you cannot meet with any example of this kind, try to make the matter out alone, thus: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the thermal stress effect on brain, pancreas and ileum in normal and alloxan-diabetic mice by studying the structural changes at both light and electron microscopical levels and by studying the molecular changes expressed through the examination of protein banding pattern in the electrophorograms of the different groups. The animals were divided into four main groups; control mice, alloxan diabetic mice, heat-stressed nondiabetic mice and heat-stressed diabetic mice. No remarkable changes could be detected in nonstressed diabetic animals except the ultrastructural changes noticed in B cells of islets of Langerhans in pancreas. The heat-stressed nondiabetic animals displayed various cellular and subcellular changes in the organs of study, which were focal in most of the cases. Signs of restitution were also noted in the three selected organs in this group. On the other hand, heat stress was so much destructive in diabetic mice and that was so clear specially in pancreas. The difference in degree of cellular injury between diabetics and nondiabetics is correlated with data of protein studies which demonstrated <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> heat stress proteins (HSPs) in nondiabetics and attenuation of this expression in diabetics. These stress proteins are suggested {{to play an important role}} in protection against thermal stress injury. Consistent with this, the brain which showed <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> HSPs was the least affected of the three organs. Moreover, the attenuated expression of these HSPs in diabetics highlights the suggestion that diabetes deranged the stress response and delayed the expression of the protective HSPs. In conclusion further studies are needed to characterize the molecular structure of the HSPs and the genes responsible for the expression of these proteins in these tissues and the other body tissues...|$|E

40|$|UNLABELLED: In {{atherosclerotic}} plaques, {{the risk}} of rupture is increased at sites of macrophage accumulation. Activated macrophages express folate receptor-β (FR-β), which can be targeted by folate coupled to radioactive ligands to visualize vulnerability. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the presence of activated macrophages in human atherosclerotic plaques by (99 m) Tc-folate imaging and to evaluate whether this technique can discriminate between an M 1 -like and M 2 -like macrophage phenotype. METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy specimens of 20 patients were incubated with (99 m) Tc-folate, imaged using micro-SPECT, and divided into 3 -mm slices. The mean accumulation was calculated per slice, and the distribution of M 1 -like and M 2 -like macrophages per slice was quantified by immunohistochemical staining for CD 86 as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) for M 1 and CD 163 and FR-β for M 2 macrophages. Monocytes from healthy donors were differentiated toward M 1 -like or M 2 -like phenotype by in vitro culturing. Messenger RNA levels of specific M 1 and M 2 markers were measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and expression of FR-β, CD 86, and CD 163 by flow cytometry. RESULTS: There was a heterogeneous accumulation of (99 m) Tc-folate in plaques (median, 2. 45 [0. 77 - 6. 40] MBq/g). Slices with the highest (99 m) Tc-folate accumulation of each plaque showed significantly <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> FR-β and CD 163, compared with slices with the lowest (99 m) Tc-folate accumulation, which showed significantly <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> iNOS. In in vitro polarized macrophages, messenger RNA expression of FR-β, mannose receptor, IL- 10, and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 was significantly increased in M 2 -like macrophages, compared with M 1 -like macrophages. On a receptor level, CD 86 was shown to be overexpressed on M 1 -like macrophages whereas FR-β and CD 163 were overexpressed on M 2 -like macrophages measured by flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: Higher numbers of M 2 -like macrophages were present in areas of high (99 m) Tc-folate accumulation than areas with low accumulation. It is anticipated that (99 m) Tc-folate imaging using SPECT as a marker for M 2 -like macrophages in atherosclerosis might be a good indicator for plaque vulnerability...|$|E

40|$|Because lymphoid {{progenitors}} {{can give}} rise to natural killer (NK) cells, NK ontogeny has been considered to be exclusively lymphoid. Here, we show that rare human CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitors develop into NK cells in vitro {{in the presence of}} cytokines (interleukin- 7, interleukin- 15, stem cell factor, and fms-like tyrosine kinase- 3 ligand). Adding hydrocortisone and stromal cells greatly increases the frequency of progenitor cells that {{give rise to}} NK cells through the recruitment of myeloid precursors, including common myeloid progenitors and granulocytic-monocytic precursors to the NK-cell lineage. WNT signaling was involved in this effect. Cells at more advanced stages of myeloid differentiation (with increasing expression of CD 13 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor [M-CSFR]) could also differentiate into NK cells in the presence of cytokines, stroma, and hydrocortisone.

The innate {{immune system}} is implicated in the etiology of human chronic rhinosinusitis. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysfunction in innate immunity could be implicated in the pathogenesis of SNA and LPR. Expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1 to 10 and NOD-like receptors (NODs) 1 and 2 in nasal mucosal biopsies from SNA or LPR dogs was compared with mucosa from healthy controls. Gene expression was quantified using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction normalized against multiple housekeeper genes.

40|$|Expression of {{increased}} levels of matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) has been implicated in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Much of {{our knowledge of the}} controls of MMP- 9 levels has focused on transcription. Here we show that MMP- 9 levels are also controlled by translational efficiency in murine prostate carcinoma cells. The murine prostate carcinoma cells 148 - 1,LMD and 148 - 1,PA were derived from a single mouse that had been implanted with urogenital sinus transformed by ras and myc. 148 - 1,PA secretes little MMP- 9 yet has equivalent amounts of MMP- 9 mRNA as the cell line 148 - 1,LMD that secretes substantially more.

Human MMP- 9 is equally expressed in both cells after infection with a vector for human MMP- 9 indicating that the effect is species-specific.
