25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated <b>man.</b> <b>Here,</b> this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E
500|$|By dawn, {{the winds}} and swells had subsided, but the delay {{caused by the}} bad weather had slowed the two boats, and they now had to travel across the Mindanao Sea in daylight. Cagayan was sighted shortly after 06:30 on 13 March. Although PT-34 had led {{all the way from}} Tagauayan, Kelly now let Bulkeley take the lead, as he had the channel charts. PT-41 {{therefore}} pulled up at the wharf first, with MacArthur on the bow. They were met by Colonel William Morse, an officer {{on the staff of the}} Brigadier General William F. Sharp, the commander of U.S. forces on Mindanao. MacArthur told Bulkeley [...] "I'm giving every officer and <b>man</b> <b>here</b> the Silver Star for gallantry. You've taken me out of the jaws of death, and I won't forget it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gerry {{served in}} the Second Continental Congress from February 1776 to 1780, when matters of the ongoing war {{occupied}} the body's attention. [...] He was influential in convincing a number of delegates to support passage of the United States Declaration of Independence in the debates held {{during the summer of}} 1776; John Adams wrote of him, [...] "If every <b>Man</b> <b>here</b> was a Gerry, the Liberties of America would be safe against the Gates of Earth and Hell." [...] He was implicated {{as a member of the}} so-called [...] "Conway Cabal", a group of Congressmen and military officers who were dissatisfied with the performance of General George Washington during the 1777 military campaign. [...] However, Gerry took Pennsylvania leader Thomas Mifflin, one of Washington's critics, to task early in the episode, and specifically denied knowledge of any sort of conspiracy against Washington in February 1778.|$|E

500|$|In January 1854, Douglas {{introduced}} the Kansas–Nebraska Act {{to organize the}} Nebraska Territory. Southerners had thwarted his previous attempts to organize the territory because Nebraska lay north of parallel 36°30' north, the line separating slave and free territory under the Missouri Compromise. They feared that the territory would be organized into new free states that would vote against the South on slavery issues. The Kansas–Nebraska Act allowed the territory's settlers {{to decide whether or}} not to permit slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Kentucky Senator Archibald Dixon's amendment to make the repeal explicit angered northern Democrats, but Breckinridge believed it would move the slavery issue from national to local politics, and he urged Pierce to support it. Breckinridge wrote to his uncle Robert that he [...] "had more to do than any <b>man</b> <b>here,</b> in putting [...] in its present shape", but Heck notes that few extant records support this claim. The repeal amendment made the act more palatable to the South; only 9 of 58 Southern congressmen voted against it. No Northern Whigs voted for the measure, but 44 of 86 Northern Democrats voted in the affirmative, enough to pass it. The Senate quickly concurred, and Pierce signed the act into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a <b>man</b> <b>here</b> who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} defend ourselves against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{statements}} by James {{in which he}} repudiated the most militant point of view endeared him to concerned whites, including President Johnson, who invited him to a White House reception. Immediately after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and as riots erupted in several areas across the country, James addressed a gathering of Air Force Association officers at which he declared {{that in spite of}} events and the resistance to progress, [...] "I'm not disgusted-I'm a citizen of the United States of America and I'm no second-class citizen either and no <b>man</b> <b>here</b> is, unless he thinks like one and reasons like one and performs like one. This is my country and I believe in her, and I will serve her, and I'll contribute to her welfare whenever and however I can. If she has any ills, I'll stand by her until in God's given time, through her wisdom and her consideration for the welfare of the entire nation, she will put them right." ...|$|E
