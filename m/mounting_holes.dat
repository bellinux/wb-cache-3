25|$|HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) {{expansion}} boardsTogether {{with the}} ModelB+, {{inspired by the}} Arduino shield boards, the interface for HAT boards was devised by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Each HAT board carries a small EEPROM (typically a CAT24C32WI-GT3) containing the relevant details of the board, so that the Raspberry Pi's OS is informed of the HAT, and the technical details of it, relevant to the OS using the HAT. Mechanical details of a HAT board, that use the four <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> in their rectangular formation, are available online.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Take conical {{cylinder}} spherical swashplate type {{axial piston}} pump as research object, the calculation method limitation of slipper shoe <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> which located in mounting plate is analyzed. First of all,the motion characteristics and the trace of slipper shoe is derived, then,based on above results, the sipper shoe <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> size current calculation methods in engineering and it’s limitations is analyzed,the conclusion is that: current design methods is parameter averaging method and {{also is an}} approximate method, in theory is not accurate and in engineering is unreasonable. In order to deign the slipper shoe <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> accurately, this paper recommends the most reasonable method is using slipper movement envelope to determine its shape and size...|$|R
2500|$|When the {{development}} for the Telefunken main frame [...] began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team {{came up with the}} idea of [...] "reversing" [...] the existing [...] into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> for the earlier trackball device. Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968. Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the [...] in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum. Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.|$|E
50|$|The {{dimensions}} and <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> must suit {{the equipment that}} uses the fan. Square-framed fans are usually used, but round frames are also used, often so that a larger fan than the <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> would otherwise allow can be used (e.g., a 120 mm fan with holes for the corners of a 90 mm square fan). The width of square fans and the diameter of round ones are usually stated in millimeters. The dimension given is the outside width of the fan, not the distance between <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> Common sizes include 40 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm, 92 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm, although8 mm, 17 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 38 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, 70 mm, 250 mm and 360 mm sizes are also available. Heights are typically 10 mm, 25 mm or 38 mm, but this is usually not an important dimension as it does not affect <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> or apertures in the case.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 610 socket {{was provided}} with two <b>mounting</b> <b>holes,</b> one behind the receptacle for the plug spigot, and both for countersunk screws. This arrangement allowed the socket to be secured using two screws, with no plug inserted, or alternatively with the plug inserted, {{using the same}} two <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> but {{with one of the}} screws passing through the spigot to secure the plug as well.|$|E

SSI CEB motherboards have the same IO connector area and many of the same motherboard <b>mounting</b> <b>holes</b> as ATX motherboards, although SSI CEB motherboards are larger in size than ATX motherboards and have different processor <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> The rear panel aperture is identical to the EEB and ATX specification and expansion cards mounted on an SSI CEB motherboard appear much the same as they would on an ATX motherboard.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, the Canadian {{provinces and}} U.S. states {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, Automobile Manufacturers Association, and National Safety Council that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles, except those for motorcycles, at 15cm in height X 30cm in width (6 inches X 12 inches in the U.S.), with standardized <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> The 1955 (dated 1956) issue was the Northwest Territories' first licence plate that complied with these standards.

50|$|In 1956, the U.S. {{states and}} Canadian provinces {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the Automobile Manufacturers Association and the National Safety Council that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for motorcycles) at 6 in in height by 12 in in width, with standardized <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b> The 1956 (dated 1957) issue was the first Illinois license plate that fully complied with these standards: the 1955 (dated 1956) issue was 6 inches in height by 12 inches in width, but had non-standard <b>mounting</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since the <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> {{arrangement}} is vertically symmetric, {{it is possible}} to mount rack-mountable equipment upside-down. However, not all equipment is suitable for this type of mounting. For instance, most optical disc players will not work upside-down because the driving motor mechanism does not grip the disc.|$|R

50|$|An MPP is {{normally}} 0.5 - 2 mm thick.

They are usually made using the microperforation process.|$|R
50|$|Bash valves {{have also}} been used for the ad hoc {{conversion}} of commonplace petrol small engines, such as lawnmowers, into hobbyist steam engines. The original petrol engine sparkplug <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> is used as the location for a new piston-actuated bash valve, together with the original exhaust valve. Performance and efficiency are not a need of such projects.|$|R
50|$|Subframes {{are prone}} to misalignment, which can cause {{vibration}} and alignment issues in the suspension and steering components.

50|$|All of the July 1961 through August 1964 221-260-289 engines used a five-bolt bell housing, {{with all}} 221s and 260s being of this configuration, but the 289 changed to the six-bolt {{arrangement}} {{at this time}} - the change was made due to transmission utilization issues i.e. the need for larger-diameter clutches, for example. The block mount pads and the cylinder wall contour of the 221 and 260 engines changed in January-February 1963 {{with the introduction of}} the 289 variant - all 221 and 260 engine blocks up to this time featured 'corrugated wall' construction with two freeze plugs on the side of each bank and engine <b>mount</b> <b>hole</b> pitch distances of 6 inch. All three block variants from this point on featured the straight wall method of construction, three freeze plugs and an engine <b>mount</b> <b>hole</b> pitch distance of seven inches. The corrugated wall method of block construction had caused cleaning difficulties in the foundry from day one and a change was phased in.|$|R
25|$|Size of {{individual}} drivers. For cone drivers, the quoted size is generally the outside {{diameter of the}} basket. However, it may less commonly also be {{the diameter of the}} cone surround, measured apex to apex, or the distance from the center of one <b>mounting</b> <b>hole</b> to its opposite. Voice-coil diameter may also be specified. If the loudspeaker has a compression horn driver, the diameter of the horn throat may be given.|$|R
