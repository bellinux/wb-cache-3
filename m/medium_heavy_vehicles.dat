40|$|Internoise 2014, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIE, 16 -/ 11 / 2014 - 19 / 11 / 2014 Transportation {{in urban}} areas is often synonymous of traffic congestion. In the last decade, this {{situation}} led users to give up passenger cars and incited them to adopt powered two-wheelers (PTW), better adapted to the traffic hazards. However, {{the question of the}} noise emitted by PTW remains a concern for the population. In France, these vehicles are quoted in second position in the opinion surveys relative to the transportation noise. The main objective of the French research project Ascoot (Acoustique des scooters et des motocycles) is to propose solutions aiming to reduce the noise emitted by the most represented PTW in the current traffic. This paper summarizes the results obtained on the acoustical investigation of a panel of ten PTW (including an electric powered scooter). Global and third-octave noise analysis has been performed, relying on the classical Controlled Pass-by procedure, and on a determination of the directivity characteristics. Pass-bys at constant speed, with acceleration and deceleration have been considered, and the influence of mechanical parameters, as the engine capacity, is also analyzed. The noise emission of PTW has been finally compared with those of other means of transportation usually met in urban zones (light vehicles, <b>medium</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles,</b> buses, trams) ...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{traffic flow}} as a steady noise source is common {{practice}} when studying traffic alternatives {{and its impact}} on the sound environment. However, vehicle dynamics have a strong influence on both transport behaviour and noise emission. One of the most relevant elements of traffic design is the intersection, where replacement of crossing intersections with roundabouts is common. In order to understand the features of these two traffic configurations, microscopic approaches are needed, making it possible to study time-pattern fluctuations relevant for the urban sound environment perception. A model based on individual-vehicle characteristics as function of time is developed and implemented in a real case study at a development stage. The model incorporates state-of-art microscopic traffic simulation software combined with the recent noise emission model, CNOSSOS-EU, applied through an in-house developed dynamic traffic noise tool, including both internal combustion engine and all-electric vehicles at different traffic flows. The tool is described in general terms incorporating the randomisation of source power. The propagation considers a flat-city configuration up to 100 m range. The tool enables study of different statistical indicators, including descriptors of probability density functions, calm periods through the novel indicator Centre of Mass Time (CMT) and noise events. The outcomes are presented through graphs and maps explaining traffic disruptions, acceleration effects, vehicle configurations and flows, source strengths, contribution and difference maps. Among the results, it is shown that, for the signalised crossing, the acceleration of the simulated traffic has a large effect on the source strength. It is however also shown that, for an unbalanced roundabout intersection leading to congestions, it can become noisier than the signalised crossing. It is furthermore shown that, when reducing the traffic flow, the two intersection types behave more similarly; however the roundabout having the best performance for the majority of the studied analysis. Further results are shown, e. g. for removing heavy vehicles, removing also <b>medium</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> and assuming only all-electric light vehicles, including analysis from using various indicators. A discussion about the presented tool, the current results and ideas for future work concludes the paper. The present paper goes along a series of studies with the overall intention to provide a more solid basis for justifying decisions in traffic planning regarding the outdoor sound environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{trend in}} technological advances {{has led to}} the implementation of complex systems in order to meet demands for improved services and products. Such implementation attempts to perform on-going activities in an effective and efficient manner. The size and complexity of these complex systems can be witnessed by the transportation systems, the highway systems, and the <b>medium</b> and <b>heavy</b> duty <b>vehicles</b> systems (engine, transmission, and brakes) which rely on electronic controls and require a combination of hardware (off-board diagnostic tools), software, and even peopleware. In this thesis work, an investigation is made to study the impact of implementing electronic controls to <b>medium</b> and <b>heavy</b> duty <b>vehicles</b> systems on the shop floor procedure when maintenance is performed. The impact reflects a significant change in the diagnostic procedures. Several manufacturers, such as Cummins, Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, and Rockwell, design their systems with different electronic control units. Once these different systems are assembled together as a single entity in a vehicle, different formats and procedures must be followed when performing diagnostic procedures. Because of the change of procedures, traditional offboard diagnostic tools have to be replaced by new tools to ensure quality diagnostic repairs, thus introducing the cost consideration to system analysis. The main contribution of this thesis is to present a Systems Engineering Approach to integrate <b>Medium</b> and <b>Heavy</b> Duty <b>Vehicles</b> Electronic Controls (so the same off-board diagnostic tool can be used on all manufactured vehicles) and Shop Floor Procedures (human factors and quality control in maintenance). An intelligent off-board diagnostic tool will be designed and act as an expert system to aid the service technician(s) in performing diagnostic procedures. Consequently, a significant reduction of work time for repairing can be achieved for productivity improvement, and the retraining of the service technician(s) can also be realized. The results from this thesis work can effectively assist the top managers, service managers, and mechanics in performing diagnostic repairs, and can provide a mean for effective communications between the manufacturers, the repair facilities, and the customers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> can {{considerably}} affect {{traffic flow}} particularly during heavy traffic conditions. Large numbers of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane changing manoeuvres {{can contribute to}} increase the number of traffic accidents and hence to reduce the freeway safety. The increase in the number of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> on freeways has been the motivation to establish strategies to reduce the interaction between <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> and passenger cars. Previous studies have examined different lane restriction strategies for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> using microscopic traffic simulation packages. Those packages mostly use a general lane changing model to estimate the lane changing behavior of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> and passenger car drivers. The general lane changing models ignore the fundamental differences in the lane changing behavior of passenger cars and <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, an exclusive lane changing model for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> can increase the accuracy of simulation models. The application of such a model can result in more reliable evaluation of lane restriction strategies. In this paper, different lane restriction strategies are defined for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For each strategy, the macroscopic and microscopic traffic measurements of the two freeway sections in California are analyzed, using the VISSIM default lane changing model and an exclusive <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane changing model.
