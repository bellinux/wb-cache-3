5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} in the parking lot, where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to show <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
25|$|Hunt's {{most famous}} {{service in the}} war was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. His new commander, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, had {{considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> Hunt than Hooker did and not only gave him great latitude in directing the artillery, but also used him on occasion as his personal representative. For example, on July 2, Meade sent Hunt to visit III Corps commander Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles {{in an attempt to}} get his defensive lines to conform to orders. (Sickles' insubordinate movement from Cemetery Ridge, where he had been ordered to defend, to the Peach Orchard caused considerable difficulty for the entire Union defense.) Hunt was unable to influence the irascible political general, but his masterful analysis of terrain and placement of batteries on the ridge were important factors in the Union's eventual success on the second day.|$|E

25|$|Poland {{would be}} briefly resurrected—if {{in a smaller}} frame—in 1807, when Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw. After his defeat and the {{implementation}} of the Congress of Vienna treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated Congress Kingdom of Poland was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with Warsaw) and, after crushing an insurrection in 1831, the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the uprising of 1863, Russification of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the literacy rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian portion, Poles fared better, and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Kraków and Lemberg (Lwów/Lviv) became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia Germanized the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a client state of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary was proposed and accepted by the Central Powers of World War I: the Regency Kingdom of Poland. After the end of World War I, the Central Powers' surrender to the Western Allies, the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the Treaty of Versailles finally allowed and helped the restoration of Poland's full independence after 123 years.|$|E

500|$|Hamza was {{captured}} in the battle {{as well as his}} staff. Francesco Sansovino, in Historia universale dell'origine et imperio de'Turchi, states that Hamza, [...] fearing punitive measures, begged for mercy, arguing that he had only fought against Skanderbeg since he had been ordered to. According to Demetrio Franco, one of Skanderbeg's earliest biographers, Skanderbeg responded {{in such a way that}} the Ottoman officers began to cry and he offered to have dinner with them. After this, he ordered for his prisoners to be put under guard and to be treated properly. The men were freed in the end, but Hamza and his staff were ransomed for 13,000 ducats. Franco reports that Skanderbeg's magnanimity became known throughout Albania and the Ottoman Empire to the point where many of his men gained much <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> him as a warrior. Skanderbeg's intention in doing so was to show that he would not take advantage of the unfortunate and that he had enough confidence in his ability to let his enemies fight him again another day.|$|E

500|$|Black {{intensely}} {{believed in}} judicial restraint and reserved {{the power of}} making laws to the legislatures, often scolding his more liberal colleagues for {{what he saw as}} judicially created legislation. Conservative justice John M. Harlan II would say of Black: [...] "No Justice has worn his judicial robes with a keener sense of the limitations that go with them." [...] Conservative Judge Robert Bork wrote, [...] "Justice Black came to have significantly <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> the limits of the Constitution than Justice Douglas and the other leading members of the Warren majorities ever showed." [...] One scholar wrote, [...] "No Justice of the Court conscientiously and persistently endeavored, as much as Justice Black did, to establish consistent standards of objectivity for adjudicating constitutional questions." [...] Black advocated a narrow role of interpretation for justices, opposing a view of justices as social engineers or rewriters of the Constitution. Black opposed enlarging constitutional liberties beyond their literal or historic [...] "plain" [...] meaning, as he saw his more liberal colleagues do. However, he also condemned the actions of those to his right, such as the conservative Four Horsemen of the 1920s and 1930s, who struck down much of the New Deal's legislation.|$|E
500|$|The German High Command had <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> Patton {{than for}} any other Allied {{commander}} and considered him central to any plan to invade Europe from the United Kingdom. Because of this, Patton was made a prominent figure in the deception operation, Fortitude, in early 1944. Through the British network of double-agents, the Allies fed German intelligence {{a steady stream of}} false reports about troops sightings and that Patton had been named commander of the First United States Army Group (FUSAG), all designed to convince the Germans that Patton was preparing this massive command for an invasion at Pas de Calais. FUSAG was in reality an intricately constructed [...] "phantom" [...] army of decoys, props, and fake signals traffic based around Dover to mislead German aircraft and to make Axis leaders believe a large force was massing there so as to mask the real location of the invasion in Normandy. Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking he was in Dover throughout early 1944, when he was actually training the Third Army. As a result of Operation Fortitude, the German 15th Army remained at Pas de Calais to defend against Patton's supposed attack. This formation held its position even after the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Patton flew into France a month later and returned to combat duty.|$|E
500|$|Exploiting Patton's situation, Eisenhower {{sent him}} on several {{high-profile}} trips throughout the Mediterranean in late 1943. He traveled to Algiers, Tunis, Corsica, Cairo, Jerusalem, and Malta {{in an effort}} to confuse German commanders as to where the Allied forces might next attack. By the next year, the German High Command still had <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> Patton than for any other Allied commander and considered him central to any plan to invade Europe from the north. Because of this, Patton was made a central figure in Operation Fortitude in early 1944. The Allies fed the German intelligence organizations, through double agents, a steady stream of false intelligence that Patton had been named commander of the First United States Army Group (FUSAG) and was preparing for an invasion of Pas de Calais.

Adolf Hitler reportedly called him [...] "that crazy cowboy general". Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war, {{and many of its}} highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited Patton with executing [...] "the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare". Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, {{chief of staff of the}} German Army, stated that Patton [...] "was the American Guderian. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes." [...] Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring noted that [...] "Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare." [...] Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein, Fritz Bayerlein opined that [...] "I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily." [...] In an interview conducted for Stars and Stripes just after his capture, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt stated simply of Patton, [...] "He is your best." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Spark the Fire" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Pharrell Williams; Williams serves as the track's sole producer. The song is a dance-pop and hip hop track, with {{inclusions}} of funk music and heavy percussion. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the song as [...] "full of vintage Pharrell moves: pep-band drum lines, percussive blips {{and a lot of}} open space for Stefani's gum-smacking shouts". Lyrically, the song discusses several different themes; Feminism and [...] "girl power" [...] is made clear in the lyric [...] "It is time for the girl species to grow / I am a Libra / Let's balance the scales", while partying and clubbing is made clear in the lyric [...] "Who got the lighter? / Let's spark the fire". In a 2014 interview with Scott T. Sterling, Williams stated that the [...] "coolest part" [...] of the song was [...] "the sound and direction", particularly the song's lyrics dicscussing [...] "feminism and women standing up for themselves, and standing together". He described the song as inspired by his feeling that [...] "the female species has been suppressed long enough", calling the lyric [...] "Enough's enough. Who's got the lighter? / Let's spark the fire" [...] Stefani's way of demanding <b>more</b> <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> women. In an interview with PopSugar's Lindsay Miller, Stefani identified the song as being [...] "a very personal song" [...] and [...] "my journey" [...] instead of a feminist anthem, but supported Williams' interpretation, saying [...] "I love when people discover their own opinions about a song". Miller described Stefani's hesitation with the word feminism as [...] "com more from a place of humility than an attempt to avoid controversy".|$|E
