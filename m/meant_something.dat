5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> to someone.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
25|$|It {{is listed}} {{on both the}} 4th/5th century Notitia Dignitatum and the 7th century Ravenna Cosmography. The name Concangis is Celtic rather than Roman and {{is thought to have}} <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> like 'the horse people', perhaps due to a nearby tribe.|$|E

25|$|By early 1992, {{the search}} was on for a good byte stream {{encoding}} of multi-byte character sets. The draft ISO 10646 standard contained a non-required annex called UTF-1 that provided a byte stream encoding of its 32-bit code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably {{that it did not}} have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or extended ASCII), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21–0x7E that <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the Unix path directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a textual description in the annex.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{ends with}} Munch {{revealing}} to Thormann that he lights the candle each night [...] "for all {{the ones who}} have been killed," [...] while Thormann admits that he re-lit it in Munch's absence because he knew it <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> to him.|$|E
500|$|According {{to gender}} stereotypes, {{women were not}} meant to be soldiers; only men were {{supposed}} to engage in fighting and conflict. There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men.|$|E
6000|$|The colours {{faded from}} his {{brilliant}} proposal. [...] "Oh, I only <b>meant</b> till <b>something</b> was settled--determined--concluded; till this terrible suspense was over." [...] He added hopelessly, [...] "But {{nothing can be}} done!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{want to ask}} the {{secretary}} to take the chair for a few minutes," [...] he said, {{and there was something}} in his voice that <b>meant</b> business. <b>Something</b> ominous.

500|$|Burt Reynolds {{was chosen}} for [...] "Improbable" [...] after he {{expressed}} his desire to appear in an episode of The X-Files to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and told Patrick that he would [...] "write something good". He later noted that [...] "as a young man, [...] <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> to me" [...] and that {{the opportunity to work}} with him was [...] "surreal". After Carter had written the script, he presented it to Reynolds for his approval; Reynolds approved of the script and agreed to be in the episode. Robert Patrick later noted that Reynolds [...] "had a great time, and he loved working with everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|The Roman satirist Juvenal {{wrote in}} AD 82 of rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno ("a rare {{bird in the}} lands, and very like a black swan"). He <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> whose rarity would {{compare with that of}} a black swan, or in other words, as a black swan did not exist, neither did the {{supposed}} characteristics of the [...] "rare bird" [...] with which it was being compared. The phrase passed into several European languages as a popular proverb, including English, in which the first four words ("a rare bird in the land") are often used ironically. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination as a metaphor for that which could not exist.|$|E
500|$|In Moonwalk (1988), Jackson {{said his}} {{relationship}} with Shields was [...] "romantically serious for a while." [...] Shields said that while never formally proposing, he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together. The suggestions were met with disapproval from Shields, who felt {{such a move would}} have [...] "divided [...] life too much". She recalled: [...] "There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, 'You have {{me for the rest of}} your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on...have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me.' I think it made him relax. He didn’t want to lose things that <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> to him." ...|$|E

500|$|Mega Man 6 is {{occasionally}} seen as [...] "redundant" [...] to the series. GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled Mega Man 6 the [...] "cheesiest" [...] {{among the}} NES titles: [...] "If you're looking for mega-laughs, {{you might want}} to try this one out." [...] 1UP.com contributors likewise found that the game's [...] "inane" [...] storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game's good soundtrack and interesting power-ups. The four members of the Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, [...] "OK, Mega Man was fun and original {{back in the days when}} the letters 'N E S' <b>meant</b> <b>something.</b> Now the game is just getting redundant. Oh sure, Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E

40|$|The pluralistic {{dimension}} of contemporary societies, {{even for the}} massive migration to European countries of populations with their own beliefs and religions <b>meant</b> as <b>something</b> different from the western values and costumes, needs tools for managing the problems related to the potential contrast between reasons that an individual can ground on legal order and different ones that he can find in cultural order...|$|R
5000|$|Garakupi is a Bengali word {{adopted from}} old man many years ago. Garakupi had its earlier name [...] "Garapota" [...] {{but it is}} no more today. But {{something}} can be understood by this word pota is <b>meant</b> that <b>something</b> digging into soil and kupi has the same meaning to pota. So Gara may be a thing and it is dug into soil.|$|R
500|$|Spivey {{returned}} to the EBL in 1963 to join the Scranton Miners, for whom he played five seasons. His highest scoring average for the Miners came in the 1964–65 season, when he had 27.0points per game. In 1967–68, his final professional season, Spivey {{went back to the}} Barons. Playing for about $200 in salary per contest, he had 10.4points per game. On February 11, 1968, Spivey participated in his final professional game. Taking advantage of a loophole in the NBA's rules, he took part in an all-star game in Baltimore featuring former Baltimore Bullets players before a Bullets – San Diego Rockets game. Spivey led both teams by scoring 12points, but his team lost by onepoint. One day later he retired, saying [...] "It really <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> for me to finish off my career with a game like that." [...] By the end of his career, Spivey's physical condition had declined; Lou Tsioropoulos, who had played with him at Kentucky, said, [...] "He was just completely disabled. He could barely walk." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{compilation}} of Orbison's most successful songs updated and re-recorded {{was released in}} 1987 under the title In Dreams: The Greatest Hits. It coincided {{with the release of}} the dark and surreal mystery thriller Blue Velvet, [...] directed by David Lynch. Orbison was astonished at the way Lynch used [...] "In Dreams". In the film, a murderous and morally bankrupt psychopath named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper) is obsessed with the song and demands it be played over and over, calling it [...] "Candy Colored Clown". In one scene it is lip-synced by a flamboyantly effeminate character played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth becomes enraged and beats the protagonist. Lynch later stated, [...] "it is a beautiful song and it was written by Roy... Those lyrics, that feel <b>meant</b> <b>something</b> to him. And it just so happened that a song in a certain situation could mean something else. And the way that Frank Booth used that song in two different places, it is just kind of unbelievable. But I can see why Roy was upset because for him it meant a third thing." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} vocals for Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid project Sun City in August 1985, Bono made {{an additional}} {{contribution to the}} album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition" [...] and {{felt as if they}} [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to Sun City. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they felt a sense of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock's roots and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained, [...] "I used to think that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt {{the time had come to}} write words that <b>meant</b> <b>something,</b> out of my experience." [...] Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track [...] "In a Lifetime".|$|E

60|$|One evening, when I was fishing at the inlet, {{the racket}} was {{different}} from any I had heard before. There would be an interval of perfect silence, broken suddenly by wild yelling; then the ordinary loon talk for a few minutes, and another silence, broken by a shriller outcry. That <b>meant</b> that <b>something</b> unusual was going on, so I left the trout, {{to find out about}} it.|$|R
