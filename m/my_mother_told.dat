Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>told</b> me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E

Perhaps it was <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>mother</b> who <b>told</b> me. It will be a merry journey--we can see the bodies of those who died in the battle as we go.
