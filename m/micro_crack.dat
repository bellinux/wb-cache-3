25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe authors {{propose a}} new model on {{cleavage}} fracture toughness of steels. Fracture toughness of steels {{is controlled by the}} weakest link mechanism, so it has intrinsic scatter. Beremin proposed Weibull stress through probabilistic fracture initiation model based on the weakest link theory, and it has been widely used for describing fracture toughness scatter. In his model, only propagation of <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> is considered. However, <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation should also be incorporated in order to estimate fracture toughness distribution more accurately. Bordet introduced <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> initiation to the Beremin model, in which probability of <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation is assumed proportional to plastic strain. Some previous studies have shown, however, that <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation probability increases non-linearly with plastic strain. Then, we developed a new probabilistic model by introducing <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> nucleation probability as a non-linear function of plastic strain. Furthermore, the authors developed a new method for obtaining Weibull parameters, in which not only distribution of fracture toughness values but also location of fracture initiation sites are considered through a newly developed likelihood function. We conducted fracture toughness tests with different specimen configurations and carried out convergence calculation for determining Weibull parameters by applying the likelihood function mentioned above. As a result of the calculation, the authors confirmed that the present model can obtain the Weibull parameters less sensitive to the specimen configurations and simulate distribution of fracture toughness more accurately than the previous models...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> {{initiation}} and propagation {{tests of}} a TiAl alloy with 8 % Nb content {{were carried out}} by using scanning electron microscopy in situ technology at room temperature and at 750 &# 176;C. These {{results indicated that the}} fatigue <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> initiation was mainly caused by the stress concentration at room temperature, but at an elevated temperature (750 &# 176;C) the multi-cracks were caused by the coupled factors of both lamellar microstructure and stress concentration. Therefore, fatigue <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> initiation behavior is much more dependent on the lamellar structure at an elevated temperature. One of the reasons is that the elevated temperature degrades the interface strength between the lamellar of the TiAl alloy with 8 % Nb content. Therefore, the small fatigue crack propagation behavior of the alloy exhibited a mixture damage model of interlamellar and translamellar at a micro scale. The crack growth path and fracture characteristics provided a proof of crack deflection, branching and/or bridging induced either by interlamellar or by translamellar failure mode...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Characteristics of {{fracture}} toughness of polycrystalline ceramics are investigated by numerical simulations and indentation fracture test for polycrystalline alumina ceramics. Generally ceramics fracture from a defect. A crack propagates from the defect stably under monotone increasing load before catastrophic fracture. This stable crack propagation determines {{the characteristics of}} {{fracture toughness}} of ceramics. In this study we perform crack propagation simulations by using boundary element method. The relationship between the <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> extension resistance and the macro fracture toughness in polycrystalline ceramics is investigated. According to the results, the crack extension area is wide and the standard deviation of the macro fracture toughness is large, so that the standard deviation of the <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> extension resistance is large. It is worth noticing that the aforementioned results obtained in the present paper might be useful also when stable crack propagation due to fatigue loading is investigated...|$|E

The animation uses experimental results of high-cycle fatigue of material.

By applying the force, the pressure cumulates between two convex surfaces. This phenomenon results in material damage under of curved surfaces in contact. Moreover, further damage has been registered on the surface. This is due to exceeding the elastic-plastic state limit and development of „tabs“.

40|$|Due to the {{influence}} of stress, tension, impact and cyclic load in the process of manufacturing and processing, the metal structure are inevitably to generate fatigue crack or other tiny damages in the component. If without timely detection, these tiny defects will expand, merge and form the macroscopic crack, eventually inducing failure of the component. The detection of micro-crack in the metal components is a very important section. Traditional ultrasonic testing achieved detection based on the linear feature of the defect, such as reflection, scattering and signals in the process of ultrasonic propagation. When the crack width is less than a half of the ultrasonic wavelength, the reflection will be very weak and it is invalid for the traditional ultrasonic technique. Nonlinear ultrasonic nondestructive testing is based on the nonlinear character which is generated by the interaction between the crack and ultrasonic wave. However as a new nondestructive testing technology, the application of nonlinear ultrasound in the detection of micro defects also has some limits like the complex loading equipment. In order to acquire the effective detection of micro cracks, a composite detection method is proposed. By using the continuous sinusoidal pulse current as excitation and loading the bias magnetic field and high frequency eddy current at the <b>micro</b> <b>crack,</b> the Lorenz force will make the crack in a state of fluctuation which will impact the propagation process of the ultrasonic. In this paper, by simulating the nonlinear response process, the modulation effect of the ultrasonic wave because of the fluctuation of the <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> can be realized and the <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> will be detected. The signals will be analyzed in time and frequency domain and the components of ultrasonic modulation will be extracted to identify the closed crack effectively...|$|E

As per the Indian standard a beam shall {{be considered as}} deep beam when the ratio of effective span to overall depth is less than 2 for simply supported & 2. 5 for continuous beam.

Shear strength of concrete beam is a complex phenomenon {{so that it is}} not well defined. Therefore to improve shear strength & deformation of cement matrix mixed (Crimped steel- Polypropylene) fibers are used. The main reason of adding a steel fiber is to improve the energy absorption capacity, apparent ductility, crack resistance & crack control.

40|$|Critical strain is a {{material}} constant and a critical parameter for many applications. It is not depending on temperature if no phase transition is involved.

Observation of crack patterns helped the understanding of change in the air permeability coefficients. Several small cracks along rebar were observed after tensile loading, and most cracks along rebar were not found after water recuring. On the other hand, the crack pattern did not change after air recuring.

40|$|When {{considering}} a composite strip or plate under certain thermal and environmental conditions and loadings, {{there is a}} minimum strain threshold for {{the appearance of the}} first <b>micro</b> <b>crack.</b> The associated strain level is defined here as “critical strain”. There are various active displacement methods to measure this strain level (by tension and bending). The registration of the first <b>micro</b> <b>crack</b> is however challenging. Therefore, some alternative methods have been developed like the Bergen ellipse [1]. With this method, a relatively thin strip is forced by clamping to “follow” the elliptical contour of the jig. The strip undergoes various strain levels from 0 % to 2 % or 3 %. However, the strain distribution {{as a function of the}} strip length is far from linear. This causes inaccurate readings and high error sensitivity for certain areas on the ellipse. To overcome this problem, a novel jig design is introduced here; this design is based on a perfectly linear strain distribution along the strip’s length. The resulting curve is a classical one known as the Euler-Fresnel curve [2]. The linearity and the constant, low sensitivity to measurement errors guarantees high accuracy. Only at the beginning and the end of the strip, the measured strain might deviate from the real one, especially when the thickness of the strip is moderately less (Dh > 0. 1 [mm]) than the height of the slot, Figure 9. The jig is a low cost device that can easily be placed in climate cabinets for e. g. cryo-cycling. In this paper we focus on the mathematical derivation of the jig, compare it to the Bergen ellipse, and provide the full consideration of the associated primary and secondary forces and moments.
