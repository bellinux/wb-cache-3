"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|I was hit [...] by flak as I {{was pulling}} out of a dive-strafing pass on an {{airfield}} called Tarnewitz, up on the Baltic. Five P-51s made a pass on the airdrome that April day. I {{was the only one}} to return home...When I tested the stall characteristics of my wounded bird over our home airfield, I found it quit flying at a little over [...] indicated and rolled violently into the dead wing (note: the right flap had been blown away and two large holes knocked in the same wing). What to do? Bailout seemed the logical response, but here's where sentiment {{got in the way of}} reason. That airplane (note: [...] "Scat VI") had taken <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> lot and I was damned if I was going to give up on her...why the bird and I survived the careening, bouncing and juttering ride down the length of the field, I guess I'll never know.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2006, Robert Novak {{posted a}} column titled [...] "My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story": [...] "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has {{informed}} my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his {{investigation of the}} CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, I said what I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me {{in the middle of a}} long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.) Harlow is the person whom Novak refers to as his [...] "CIA source" [...] for his column [...] "Mission to Niger".|$|E

6000|$|CHARTERIS. No, thank you. Miss Craven {{has just}} been taking <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> old song; and I've had enough of it. (He takes the song off the piano desk and lays it aside; then closes the lid over the keyboard.) ...|$|R
60|$|This was Kenge and Carboy's. The young gentleman showed <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> {{outer office}} into Mr. Kenge's room--there {{was no one}} in it--and politely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my {{attention}} to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail {{on one side of the}} chimney-piece.|$|R

50|$|After {{trying for}} two and a half years to get this goal it was given to <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> unfortunate injury to Mattie Stewart. I was not at my best but it was great that Scotland didn’t turn their back on me and I was very {{determined}} to prove I should be there.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the empty}} {{blackness}} {{closed in on}} me again, and I lay still, wondering whether I were dead and buried, and if so, why the pricking between shoulder and breast should continue so pitilessly; until that ceased in turn, and I had a hazy idea that someone was carrying <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> interminable cavern; after which there succeeded complete oblivion.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is with me}} always," [...] I answered, [...] "in my thoughts." [...] She {{looked at}} me with her clear grey eyes. I found myself blinking. Something seemed to be {{slipping}} from me, something I did not want to lose. I remember a similar sensation once at the moment of waking from a strange, delicious dream to find the sunlight pouring in upon <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> open window.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} him along the tortuous {{path to the}} shore, {{and on the way}} he questioned me about my acquirements, putting <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> sort of vivâ-voce examination, the result of which appeared to satisfy him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sound was}} repeated. Without knowing what I did, I turned. I heard {{what sounded like}} words; I saw in the fog the stern of a vessel, with a man above it, {{shouting}} to <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> speaking-trumpet.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was better}} not," [...] she assented. [...] "Even {{after you left}} I {{had a great deal}} of trouble. That odious man, Major Thomson, put <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> regular {{cross-examination}} again, and I had to tell him at last--" ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{a disciple}} I must confess I was {{particularly}} ill {{acquainted with the}} works of the master.

6000|$|... "Come hither!" [...] she said, drawing <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{door into}} a small, square, empty room that jutted out above the moat.

60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} night; the full moon was just rising over the wooded hills, and her light fell through the poplars into the garden before <b>me.</b> <b>Through</b> <b>an</b> open corner {{on the western side}} I saw the sky all silvery blue in the afterlight. The garden was very beautiful just then, for it was the time of the roses, and ours were all out--so many of them--great pink, and red, and white, and yellow roses.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would depend}} on what they didn't like him for," [...] said Maggie, laughing. [...] "He might be very disagreeable. He might look at <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> eye-glass stuck in his eye, making a hideous face, as young Torry does. I should think other women are not fond of that; but I never felt any pity for young Torry. I've never any pity for {{conceited}} people, because I think they carry their comfort about with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 34: I learnt {{the whole}} of it by heart, and could then say it without a break. I have always loved it, and in return it has helped <b>me</b> <b>through</b> many <b>a</b> long and sleepless night.--S. B.] ...|$|R

60|$|I had {{to knock}} twice before a servant-maid {{opened the door}} and showed <b>me</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> dingy hall into a small room, where sat an elderly, careworn lady, who {{introduced}} herself as Mrs. Heatherstone.

5000|$|The list {{of artists}} who studied under Porter is a long one. It {{includes}} Tritoba Hayes Benjamin, David C. Driskell, Sylvia Snowden, Mildred Thompson (1936-2003) and many others. Mildred Thompson wrote of Porter that he [...] "...was a kind and gentle teacher. His method was personal and individual.

6000|$|John took me {{round to}} see his mother, [...] his mother, [...] his mother! [...] And when he'd {{introduced}} us to each other, [...] She sized up everything that I had on.

60|$|A {{second and}} third door receded before me and slipped to one side as the first, before I reached a large inner chamber where I found food and drink set out upon a great stone table.
