5|$|Due to {{his absence}} from Constantinople {{at the time}} of Phocas's takeover, and because he {{retained}} a large <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> within the soldiery, Priscus {{was the only one of}} Maurice's senior generals who was retained by the new regime, whereas Comentiolus and Peter were executed and Philippicus was banished to a monastery. A possible explanation for this comes from the later historian Paul the Deacon, who records, possibly based on early 7th-century sources, that Phocas had once served as an equerry under Priscus. At any rate, Priscus was soon counted among the main supporters of the new regime. In the winter of 602/603, he was made comes excubitorum, commander of the imperial bodyguard. In 606 or 607, he also married Phocas's daughter, Domentzia, becoming the effective heir-apparent to the sonless ruler. In the games celebrated at the Hippodrome to honor the event, however, Phocas reacted violently when he saw portraits of Priscus and Domentzia carried alongside his by the citizens. From this moment on, the chroniclers report, Priscus turned against Phocas.|$|E
5|$|The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in Lithuania.|$|E

This interpretation is not necessary to methods such as jackknifing or bootstrapping, which are better interpreted as <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the current dataset. Grant and Kluge only accepted the absolute Bremer value as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> group <b>support,</b> and considered resampling methods as irrelevant to phylogenetic inference.

Grant and Kluge associated the resampling methods (and the use <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> group <b>support</b> in general) with what they call a ‘‘verificationist agenda’’, where strongly supported groups are first detected, and then protected against additional testing.

Financial pressures were enormous and continuous. In June Mackworth was nominated by the Commons as one of the commissioners to raise the vast and strangely precise sum of £5531 19s. 9¾d. monthly from Shropshire to finance Fairfax's army and military operations in Ireland.

25|$|Mihail Sadoveanu {{withdrew from}} {{politics}} in the late 1930s and early 1940s, as Romania came to be led by successive right-wing dictatorships, he offered a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> to King Carol II and his National Renaissance Front, which attempted to block the more radically fascist Iron Guard from power. He was personally appointed {{a member of the}} reduced corporatist Senate by Carol. In 1940, the official establishment Editura Fundațiilor Regale published the first volume of his Opere ("Works"). Sadoveanu kept a low profile under the Iron Guard's Nazi-allied National Legionary regime. After Conducător Ion Antonescu overthrew the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion and established his own fascist regime, the still-apolitical Sadoveanu was more present in public life, and lectured on cultural subjects for the Romanian Radio. After publishing the final section of his Frații Jderi in 1942, Sadoveanu again retreated to the countryside, in his beloved Arieș area, where he had built himself a chalet and a church; this seclusion produced his Povestirile de la Bradu-Strâmb ("Bradu-Strâmb Stories"). During those years, the sixty-year-old writer met Valeria Mitru, a much younger feminist journalist, whom he married after a brief courtship.|$|E
40|$|Association rule mining {{is one of}} {{the useful}} {{techniques}} in data mining and knowledge discovery that extracts interesting relationships between items in datasets. Generally, the number of association rules in a particular dataset mainly depends on the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and confidence To choose the number of useful rules, normally, the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and confidence need to be tried many times. In some cases, the <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and confidence are chosen by experience. Thus, it is a time consuming to find the optimal <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> supportand confidence for the process of association rule mining in large datasets. This paper proposes a regression based approach to improve the association rule mining process through predicting the number of rules on datasets. The approach includes a regression model in a generic level for general domains and an instantiation scheme to create concrete models in particular domains for predicting the potential number of association rules on a dataset before mining. The proposed approach can be used in broad domains with different types of datasets to improve the association rule mining process. A case study to build a concrete regression model based on a real dataset is demostrated and the result shows the good performance of the proposed approach...|$|R

As Sturdza came to lead the cabinet, both he and Brote retracted their previous statements, but again provoked the National Party by alleging that its leaders were the actual radicals. In harsh terms, Caragiale exposed the understanding Sturdza had with Brote. Soon after, he authored a short story about a con artist who traveled to the imagined Transylvanian town of Opidul-nou, posing as the nationalist Romanian writer Alexandru Vlahuţă {{as a means to}} live off the local intelligentsia. In October 1897, he was outraged by news that Sturdza had given in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and that he had expelled Transylvanian nationalists from Romania: Caragiale held a speech in which he argued that Romanians living abroad were [...] "indispensable" [...] to the Romanian state.|$|E

The only Administration which could compare in the importance and the volume of its legislation with the present Government is Mr. Gladstone's great Government of 1868. That was a Government of measures and of men; but no measure of that Government could equal in importance the Old-Age Pensions Act which we have placed on the Statute-book. The settlement of the Irish Church question by Disestablishment was not a more baffling and intricate business, than the settlement of the Irish University question which Mr. Birrell has achieved. The labour legislation of the Government of 1868, although very important, shows nothing which equals in importance the Trades Disputes Act, which we have carried through, and Mr. Cardwell's reforms in army organisation were not more successful, and were certainly much less generally accepted, than those which have been effected by Mr. Haldane. In the fourth year of its administration the Government of 1868 was genuinely unpopular. It had quarrelled with the Nonconformists without gaining the support of the Church; it had offended the liquor interest without satisfying the Temperance forces in the country; it had disturbed and offended many vested interests without arousing popular enthusiasm.|$|E

However, {{the way in which}} social support is provided has changed greatly with the expanding role of social networking sites (e. g., Facebook). While there are numerous anecdotal accounts of the benefits <b>of</b> Facebook-based social <b>support,</b> little empirical evidence exists to support these assertions, and there are no empirically validated measures designed to assess social support provided via this unique social networking medium. This study sought to develop an empirically sound <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> Facebook-based social <b>support</b> (Facebook <b>Measure</b> <b>of</b> Social <b>Support</b> [FMSS]) and to assess how this new measure relates to previously established <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> and two outcome variables: depression and QOL. Following exploratory factor analysis, the FMSS was determined to assess four factors <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> on Facebook (Perceived, Emotional, Negative, Received/Instrumental). The Negative Support factor on the FMSS was most strongly related to both depression and QOL with magnitudes (and direction of relationships) comparable to a traditional <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> perceived social <b>support.</b> However, two FMSS factors (Received/Instrumental and Perceived) were unrelated to both mental health outcomes. Contrary to expectations, elevations in one FMSS factor (Emotional) was associated with worse symptoms of depression and poorer psychological QOL.

Consequently, those hoping to use Facebook as a medium for reducing depression or improving QOL are unlikely to realize significant therapeutic benefits...|$|R

60|$|It {{has been}} said that the Countess, when she sent her {{daughter}} down to Yoxham, laid her plans with the conviction that the associations to which the girl would be subjected among the Lovels would fill her heart and mind with a new-born craving for the kind of life which she would find in the rector's family;--and she had been right. Daniel Thwaite also had known that it would be so. He had been quite alive {{to the fact that he}} and his conversation would be abased, and that his power, both of pleasing and of governing, would be lessened, by this new contact. But, had he been able to hinder her going, he would not have done so. None of those who were now interested in his conduct knew aught of the character of this man. Sir William Patterson had given him credit for some honesty, but even he had not perceived,--had had no opportunity of perceiving,--the staunch uprightness which was as it were a backbone to the man in all his doings. He was ambitious, discontented, sullen, and tyrannical. He hated the domination of others, but was prone to domineer himself. He suspected evil of all above him in rank, and the millennium to which he looked forward was to be produced by the gradual extirpation of all social distinctions. Gentlemen, so called, were to him as savages, which had to be cleared away in order that that perfection might come at last which the course of nature was to produce in obedience to the ordinances of the Creator. But he was a man who reverenced all laws,--and a law, if recognised as a law, was a law to him whether enforced by a penalty, or simply exigent of obedience from his conscience. This girl had been thrown in his way, and he had first pitied and then loved her from his childhood. She had been injured by the fiendish malice of her own father,--and that father had been an Earl. He had been strong in fighting for the rights of the mother,--not because it had been the mother's right to be a Countess,--but in opposition to the Earl. At first,--indeed throughout all these years of conflict, except the last year,--there had been a question, not of money, but of right. The wife was entitled to due support,--to what <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> Daniel had never known or inquired; but the daughter had been entitled to nothing. The Earl, had he made his will before he was mad,--or, more probably, had he not destroyed, when mad, the will which he had before made,--might and would have left the girl without a shilling. In those days, when Daniel's love was slowly growing, when he wandered about with the child among the rocks, when the growing girl had first learned to swear to him that he should always be her friend of friends, when the love of the boy had first become the passion of the man, there had been no thought of money in it. Money! Had he not been well aware from his earliest understanding of the need of money for all noble purposes, that the earnings of his father, which should have made the world to him a world of promise, were being lavished in the service of these forlorn women? He had never complained. They were welcome to it all. That young girl was all the world to him; and it was right that all should be spent; as though she had been a sister, as though she had already been his wife. There had been no plot then by which he was to become rich on the Earl's wealth. Then had come the will, and the young Earl's claims, and the general belief of men in all quarters that the young Earl was to win everything. What was left of the tailor's savings was still being spent on behalf of the Countess. The first fee that ever found its way into the pocket of Serjeant Bluestone had come from the diminished hoard of old Thomas Thwaite. Then the will had been set aside; and gradually the cause of the Countess had grown to be in the ascendant. Was he to drop his love, to confess himself unworthy, and to slink away out of her sight, because the girl would become an heiress? Was he even to conceive so badly of her as to think that she would drop her love because she was an heiress? There was no such humility about him,--nor such absence of self-esteem. But, as regarded her, he told himself at once that she should have the chance of being base and noble,--all base, and all noble as far as title and social standing could make her so,--if such were her desire. He had come to her and offered her her freedom;--had done so, indeed, with such hot language of indignant protest against the gilded gingerbread of her interested suitor, as would have frightened her from the acceptance of his offer had she been minded to accept it;--but his words had been hot, not from a premeditated purpose to thwart his own seeming liberality, but because his nature was hot and his temper imperious. This lordling was ready to wed his bride,--the girl he had known and succoured throughout their joint lives,--simply because she was rich and the lordling was a pauper. From the bottom of his heart he despised the lordling. He had said to himself a score of times that he could be well content to see the lord take the money, waste it among thieves and prostitutes, and again become a pauper, while he had the girl to sit with him at his board, and share with him the earnings of his honest labour. Of course he had spoken out. But the girl should be at liberty to do as she pleased.|$|E
