It is historically the oldest and simplest detector, and it achieves good performance when the SNR is strong enough. Unfortunately, since it is based on an estimation of the in-band noise power spectral density (PSD), it is affected by the noise level uncertainty (due to measurement errors or a changing environment), especially at low SNR [5], where it reaches an absolute performance limit called the SNR wall.

The absence of other magnetospheric signals implies that the growth rate of the triggered wave is enhanced over background noise. It is shown that, for at least low amplitude triggering waves, the phase bunching of untrapped electrons can account for the observed enhanced growth. The phase bunching is initially produced by perturbations in the electron trajectories due to their interactions with the front of the wave. Due to the inhomogeneity of the geomagnetic field, the phase-bunched electrons are able to gyroresonantly interact with a later portion of the triggering wave. Because the electrons are phase bunched, the electrons can lose energy to the wave faster than phase-random electrons and are thereby able to produce enhanced growth. Plasma conditions for which this phase bunching is effective in producing enhanced growth are derived...|$|R

They detected the emission of non-thermal radiation that they were searching for, but were surprised that it contained spectral peaks suggesting modulation at various frequencies and their harmonics. Ruf et al. hypothesized that the emission of non-thermal radiation was caused by electric discharges in a deep convective dust storm, modulated by Schumann resonances (SRs). Anderson et al. used the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) to search for similar emissions. They stated that they found only radio frequency interference (RFI) during their search for non-thermal emission by martian dust storms and implicitly suggested that the signal detected by Ruf et al. was also RFI. However, their search was not conducted during the dust storm season when deep convective storms are most likely to occur. Here, we show that the ubiquitous dust devils and small-scale dust storms that were instead likely present during their observations are too shallow to excite SRs and produce the signals detected by Ruf et al. We also show that the spectral and temporal behavior of the signals detected by Anderson et al. corroborates the idea that they originated from <b>man-made</b> pulse-modulated telecommunication <b>signals</b> rather than martian electric discharges.

We discuss two methods for isolation and then subtraction of this interference, by an adaptive filtering technique and with least squares matrix analysis. Methods for estimating the time-varying frequency are also discussed. A few variants of these techniques are applied both to simulated data and then to real data.

The {{idea behind}} this {{theory is that}} <b>man-made</b> <b>signals</b> possess hidden periodicities such as the carrier frequency, the symbol rate or the chip rate, that can be {{regenerated}} by a sine-wave extraction operation which produces features at frequencies that depend on these hidden periodicities (hence called cyclic features and cycle frequencies resp.).

The result is called the spectral correlation density (SCD), and can be represented in a bifrequency plane. The SCD {{can be seen as}} a generalization of the PSD, as it is equal to the PSD when the cycle frequency is equal to zero. Therefore, the SOCS cyclic feature detectors act like energy detectors, but at cycle frequencies different from zero. The advantage of these detectors comes from the absence of features (at least asymptotically) when the input signal is stationary (such as white noise), since no hidden frequencies are present, or when the input signal exhibits cyclostationarity at cycle frequencies different than the one of interest. The HOCS cyclic-feature detectors are based on the same principles, but the equivalent of the SCD is a [...]...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{spectrum}} sensing algorithms {{have been proposed}} in the literature [2 – 4]. Broadly speaking, they {{can be divided into}} three major types, namely, energy detection, stochastic feature detection, and matched filter detection, where different types require different amounts of prior knowledge about the PU signal. While matched filter ([5], Ch. 4.3) detectors require the knowledge of the exact waveform of at least a part of the PU signal, energy detection [6] does not require any prior knowledge. Feature detectors are an in-between as they only make assumptions about structural or statistical properties of the signal. One of the stochastic features which lets an SU receiver discriminate between pure stationary noise (H_ 0) and a communication signal contaminated with noise (H_ 1) is cyclostationarity. In contrast to pure stationary noise, most <b>man-made</b> <b>signals</b> vary periodically with time [7] and can thus be characterized as cyclostationary.

Thus, the decreased sampling rates of CS ADCs accommodate the otherwise limiting quantizer of conventional ADCs. In this thesis, we consider a different approach to CS ADC by shifting towards lower quantizer bit-depths rather than lower sampling rates. We explore the extreme case where each measurement is quantized to just one bit, representing its sign. We develop a new theoretical framework to analyze this extreme case and develop new algorithms for signal reconstruction from such coarsely quantized measurements. The 1 -bit CS framework leads us to scenarios where it may be more appropriate to reduce bit-depth instead of sampling rate.
