As a first contact between films and their prospective audiences, titles induce a certain vision of a movie and its author. Woody Allen, a most demanding director concerning the translation of his films for export, proves especially punctilious on the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles.</b> His success relies much more on foreign markets than on the domestic circuit and French-speaking audiences are {{more often than not}} the key to his box office performance. His American and French titles are compared here, as well as the linguistic and iconographic changes operated on his films' posters, to illustrate the way chosen to export the director's persona as an original brand in the French-speaking area. His distributors play on the image built by Allen over the years, for he is seen as a true auteur in France. As a result, his French titles are kept the closest possible to the American ones, and his presence, whether as an actor or a director, is always reminded on the promotional material. These strategies have helped install each of his movies as part of a whole series, so that Allen's work has almost become a genre by itself...|$|R

Various chroniclers of arms were named for Spain, Castile, León, Frechas, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Granada (created in 1496 to honor the reunification of Spain), Estella, Viana, Navarre, Catalonia, Sicily, Aragon, Naples, Toledo, Valencia and Majorca.

However, as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law, <b>Title</b> 10 <b>of</b> the United States Code makes a distinction between general officers and flag officers. Non-naval officers usually fly their flags from their headquarters, vessels, or vehicles, typically only for the most senior officer present. In the United States all flag and general officers must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate; each subsequent promotion requires renomination and re-approval.

Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action. One of the most enduring solutions to this problem was proposed by Savigny (1779-1861). He argued that it was always necessary for the court to find the [...] "natural seat" [...] or [...] "centre of gravity" [...] for the case by identifying the largest cluster of [...] "connecting factors" [...] to a particular legal system. If all courts adopted such an international outlook, he reasoned, this would eliminate forum shopping by producing the same choice <b>of</b> law no <b>matter</b> where the case was begun. Unfortunately, the theory has not delivered the desired results. Forum shopping remains a problem, and neither legislators nor judges have been able to agree on characterisation issues, producing classifications that extend rather than reduce international divergences. In an attempt to avoid obviously unjust results in particular cases, some judges therefore created a number of public policy exceptions to justify decisions [...] "on the merits". Ernest G Lorenzen commented that this strategy was a warning that there must be serious problems with the rules if policy exceptions were the solution.|$|R

50|$|In {{international}} relations, MoUs {{fall under}} the broad category of treaties and should be registered in the United Nations treaty collection.

As a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> law, the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> MoU does not necessarily mean the document is binding or not binding under international law. To determine whether a particular MoU is meant to be a legally binding document (i.e., a treaty), one needs to examine the parties’ intent as well as the signatories' position (e.g., Minister of Foreign Affairs vs. Minister of Environment). A careful analysis of the wording will also clarify the exact nature of the document. The International Court of Justice has provided some insight into the determination of the legal status of a document in the landmark case of Qatar v. Bahrain, 1 July 1994.|$|R

Adams' efforts were met with widespread derision and perplexion; Thomas Jefferson called them [...] "the most superlatively ridiculous thing I ever heard of", while Benjamin Franklin considered it [...] "absolutely mad".

The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the article {{seems to be a}} paraphrase of a well-known paper by WEDEPOHL (1971), “Kupferschiefer as a prototype of syngenetic sedimentary ore deposits”. It is intended, however, more as a paradigm for the genesis of the hydrogen-sulphide geochemical barrier, an important ore formation episode prior to heavy metal accumulation, which shows the utility of RENFRO’s (1974) epigenetic model. Barite mineralization in Lokve is a stratabound ore deposit conformably situated at the Permian-Triassic boundary. It bears only two ore minerals, barite and pyrite exclusively, separated into two distinct, juxtaposed horizons stretching for tens of kilometers. The discovery of cryptalgal fabrics and other conspicious sedimentary features in underlying siliciclastics with massive pyrite and surmounting barite-bearing dolomites supports their affiliation to a tidal flat facies and sabkha environment. Barite and pyrite accumulation were formed by an early diagenetic, bacteriogenic sulphate reduction in a peritidal muddy environment, concommitant to a widespread process of evaporative dolomitization. The early diagenetic model is supported by an analysis of the sedimentary facies, trace element geochemistry and sulfur isotope distribution along two vertical profiles across the stratabound barite and pyrite mineralization...|$|R

Finally, the Article argues that neither the fact of litigation by disciplined students nor the examples of their occasional success undermines Title IX and its application to sexual assault. Such litigation is not evidence of a problem with Title IX or a reason to withdraw universities’ responsibility to engage a prompt and equitable response to sexual assault...|$|R
