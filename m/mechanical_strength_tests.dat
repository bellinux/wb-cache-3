50|$|Manufacturing {{standards}} for pipes commonly require {{a test of}} chemical composition {{and a series of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> for each heat of pipe. A heat of pipe is all forged from the same cast ingot, and therefore had the same chemical composition. Mechanical tests may be associated to a lot of pipe, which would be all from the same heat and have been through the same heat treatment processes. The manufacturer performs these tests and reports the composition in a mill traceability report and the mechanical tests in a material test report, both of which are referred to by the acronym MTR. Material with these associated test reports is called traceable. For critical applications, third party verification of these tests may be required; in this case an independent lab will produce a certified material test report(CMTR), and the material will be called certified.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} materials, {{traceability}} {{refers to the}} capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment, or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material. Destructive tests typically include chemical composition and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> A heat number is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from, and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment (i.e., {{were in the same}} oven at the same time). Material traceability is important to the aerospace, nuclear, and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions. In these industries, a part made of the wrong material is called [...] "counterfeit," [...] even if the substitution was accidental.|$|E

One of the promising methods used for bioethanol purification is pervaporation membrane. This research is aimed to prepare and characterize zeolite membranes for pervaporation membrane. The membrane preparation consisted of two stages, namely support preparation and zeolite deposition on the support. In support preparation, α- alumina and kaolin with specific composition (50 : 30; 40 : 40; 50 : 30) was mixed with additives and water. After pugging and aging process, the mixture became paste and extruded into tubular shape. The tube was then calcined at temperature of 1250 °C for 3 hours. After that, zeolite 4 A was deposited on the tubes using clear solution made of 10 %wt zeolite and 90 %wt water and heated at temperature of 80 °C for 3 hours. Furthermore, the resulting zeolite membranes was washed with deionized water for 5 minutes and dried in oven at temperature of 100 °C for 24 hours.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to clarify the effects of the shape of the {{zirconium}} framework of implant-supported, all-ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs) on the fracture strength and fracture mode. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study consisted of <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> and 3 D finite element analysis (FEA). The three framework shapes used in this study were: (1) conventional shape (control); (2) convex shape: 1. 0 -mm curve in the direction of the occlusal surface; and (3) concave shape: 1. 0 -mm curve in the direction of the gingival surface. Five frameworks were made for each condition (total: 15). A load (N) was applied until the FPD fractured. For FEA, a 3 D model consisting of cortical bone, cancellous bone, implant bodies, and superstructure was constructed. RESULTS: The results of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> showed that fracture load was 916. 0 +/- 150. 1 N for the conventional shape, 1690. 5 +/- 205. 3 N for the convex shape, and 1515. 5 +/- 137. 0 N for the concave shape. The mean final fracture load for the FPDs with frameworks was the highest for the convex shape; however, a critical crack in the veneer porcelain (736. 5 +/- 145. 2 N) was confirmed during loading for the convex shape. Stress distribution maps for all conditions showed that tensile stress was generated at the veneer porcelain on the gingival side of the mesial and distal connectors of the pontic; however, there were differences in the maximum value and stress distribution within the framework. CONCLUSION: The shape of the framework, particularly the shape of the pontic-connector interface, affects the stress distribution, fracture strength, and fracture mode of all-ceramic FPDs, and stress concentration inside a framework may induce cracking of layering porcelain...|$|R

Diametral compression and flexure tests were employed to evaluate the strength of commercial samples from five manufacturers of chewable vitamin C tablets. Weibull analysis was used to assess the brittleness of these tablets. The tablets had a lower tensile strength value when determined by the diametral compression test compared to the flexure test ratio which ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 4. The value for the Weibull modulus ranged from 5 to 16, indicating an appreciable degree of brittleness of the samples. Relating the values for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> to suggested practical values for the prevention of damage to the teeth or the mandibular joints indicated that most tablets exceeded these values.
