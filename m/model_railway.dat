5|$|The {{production}} work was exhaustive, involving {{the filming of}} numerous churches in Norfolk, both ancient and more modern. Many of the clergymen featured in the programme were discovered by accident or by word-of-mouth. For example, the production researcher managed to find, on request, a vicar who had an extensive <b>model</b> <b>railway</b> in his rectory, another whose ministry was based on water (the Chaplain of the Broads) and a vicar whose congregation at the time numbered zero.|$|E

Located {{on the banks of}} the Wollundry lagoon and officially opened in 1927, the Victory Memorial Gardens were established amidst some controversy as a tribute to those who fought and died in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} used for {{occasional}} excursions by railway enthusiasts {{for a short period}} after official closure, using the electric locomotive and a brake van borrowed from British Railways. The exact date of the last run is not recorded; the last recorded use of the line was an excursion organised by the Norbury Transport and <b>Model</b> <b>Railway</b> Club on 4April 1959, but it is known that later excursions ran. In the early 1960s a railway society in Yorkshire proposed to buy the track as a preserved railway. However, as the psychiatric hospital was still open the request was not considered practical, and the track was lifted in the early 1960s. The fittings and locomotive were disposed of by H.Ripley and Sons of Hailsham.|$|E

25|$|Eventually the {{unofficial}} or manufacturer specific scale standards became more established and were adopted by various <b>model</b> <b>railway</b> standardization bodies such as NMRA and MOROP. However, despite of existing scale and gauge standards {{they were very}} often poorly implemented in design and manufacturing processes with commercial manufacturers before the World War II. The conformity to scale standards grew strongly in the 1950s and 1960s when many new <b>model</b> <b>railway</b> accessories manufacturers were born and to whom the standard conformity was vital.|$|E

Some of the ex-Lima models appear in the main Hornby products list. This range is known as Hornby International. This acquisition also included the Rivarossi line of HO-scale products, also originally from Italy, and the Arnold brand of N-scale products. They also took over the Spanish <b>model</b> <b>railway</b> company Electrotren. Electrotren had been the Spanish importer for Scalextric, sold in Spain as Superslot. The takeover was {{at the request of}} the Spanish company and was not due to obvious financial problems. They have remained independent outside of the Hornby International umbrella.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{transport}} modelling uses {{a variety}} of scales (ratio between {{the real world and}} the model) to ensure scale models look correct when placed next to each other. <b>Model</b> <b>railway</b> scales are standardized worldwide by many organizations and hobbyist groups. Some of the scales are recognized globally, while others are less widespread and, in many cases, virtually unknown outside their circle of origin. Scales may be expressed as a numeric ratio (e.g. 1/87 or 1:87) or as a letter defined in rail transport modelling standards (e.g. HO, OO, N, O, G, TT and Z.) The majority of commercial <b>model</b> <b>railway</b> equipment manufacturers base their offerings on Normen Europ√§ischer Modellbahnen (NEM) or National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) standards in most popular scales.|$|E
