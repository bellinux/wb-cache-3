On his return to what became known as East Pakistan, he {{enrolled}} in the University of Dhaka to study law and founded the East Pakistan Muslim Students' League. He {{became one of the most}} prominent student political leaders in the province. During these years, Mujib developed an affinity for socialism as the solution to <b>mass</b> <b>poverty,</b> unemployment, and poor living conditions. On 26 January 1949 the government announced that Urdu would be the only official state language of Pakistan, although Bengali was the majority language in East Pakistan. Though still in jail, Mujib encouraged fellow activist groups to launch strikes and protests; he undertook a hunger strike for 13 days.|$|E
2500|$|Even though ISI is a {{development}} theory, its political implementation and theoretical rationale {{are rooted in}} trade theory: {{it has been argued}} that all or virtually all nations that have industrialized have followed ISI. Import substitution was heavily practiced during the mid-20th century as a form of developmental theory that advocated increased productivity and economic gains within a country. This was an inward-looking economic theory practiced by developing nations after WW2. Many economists at the time considered the ISI approach as a remedy to mass poverty: bringing a third-world country to first-world status through national industrialization. <b>Mass</b> <b>poverty</b> is defined thusly: [...] "the dominance of agricultural and mineral activities – in the low-income countries, and in their inability, because of their structure, to profit from international trade," [...] (Bruton 905).|$|E
2500|$|The {{realistic}} {{presentation of}} the disparity {{between the rich and}} the poor of a society, and realistic depictions of poverty are fundamental to the McOndo literature that shows how the introduction of high technology gadgets and contemporary public infrastructure to the poor societies of Latin America result in a greater contrast between First-world wealth and Third-world poverty. Paz-Soldán explained that [...] "In Bolivia there exist small islands of modernity in the middle of a great pre-modern ocean. The collision between tradition and modernity interests me." [...] These traits of contemporary Latin American life are directly related to the globalization caused, in great part, by economic, political, and social influence of the U.S. In every way, this emphasis on the separation of wealth [...] is perhaps one of the most important characteristics of life in contemporary Latin America." [...] Hence, <b>mass</b> <b>poverty,</b> which is a fundamental political matter in every country of the Third World, is a common theme in the McOndo literature that shows Latin American cities as decrepit, and composed of cramped barrios of houses, huts, and shacks.|$|E

2500|$|The ANC {{had risen}} to power on the {{strength}} of a socialist agenda embodied in a Freedom Charter, which was intended to form the basis of ANC social, economic and political policies. The Charter decreed that [...] "the national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall be restored to the people; the mineral wealth beneath the soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of the people". ANC icon Nelson Mandela, asserted in a statement released on 25 January 1990: [...] "The nationalisation of the mines, banks and monopoly industries is the policy of the ANC, and a change or modification of our views in this regard is inconceivable." [...] But, after the ANC's electoral victory in 1994, the eradication of <b>mass</b> <b>poverty</b> through nationalisation was never implemented. The ANC-led government, in a historic reversal of policy, adopted neoliberalism instead. A wealth tax on the super-rich to fund developmental projects was set aside, while domestic and international corporations, enriched by apartheid, were excused from any financial reparations. Large corporations were allowed to shift their main listings abroad. According to a leading South African economics expert, the government's concessions to big business represented [...] "treacherous decisions that [...] haunt South Africa for generations to come".|$|E

50|$|Clann {{was formed}} {{at a time}} {{during a period of}} turmoil in Irish politics. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the two major {{political}} parties, were weak. Fine Gael were in disarray because of their rival's seemingly hegemonic dominance and because of a perceived failure to be able to offer anything to disillusioned FF supporters. FF were visibly losing support because of the failure of the party's programme to end <b>mass</b> unemployment, <b>poverty</b> and emigration. The Labour Party had bitterly split in 1944 over personal differences between William X.

5000|$|The Nature of <b>Mass</b> <b>Poverty</b> [...] is an {{economics}} book by John Kenneth Galbraith published in 1979, in which Galbraith draws on his experiences as ambassador to India {{to explain the}} causes for and solutions to poverty.

5000|$|A dystopia is {{a society}} {{characterized}} by a focus on that which {{is contrary to the}} author's ethos, such as <b>mass</b> <b>poverty,</b> public mistrust and suspicion, a police state or oppression.

2500|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, poverty {{had been}} mostly {{accepted}} as inevitable as economies produced little, making wealth scarce.

[...] The initial industrial revolution led to high economic growth and eliminated <b>mass</b> absolute <b>poverty</b> in what is now considered the developed world.

The dependent economy, neglect of indigenous resources and the production of essential commodities being in the hands of few persons, are the main causes for poverty, unemployment, backwardness and other social inequalities and economic disparities.Therefore, Makkal Manadu Katchi states that unless the economy is self-reliant, use indigenous resources, and production of the essential commodities are with the <b>masses,</b> the <b>poverty,</b> unemployment, backwardness and other social inequalities and economic disadvantages cannot be eradicated.

50|$|Galbraith then {{lays out}} two {{arguments}} {{with regards to}} <b>mass</b> <b>poverty.</b> First, he contends {{that many of the}} causes attributed to the conditions of the rural poor (governmental corruption, lack of education) are in fact both a cause and effect of poverty. The poor being perfectly adapted to their labour-intensive work, an accommodation to poverty makes this culturally ingrained and the poor and their offspring tend to stay in that vicious circle. Galbraith points out that most solutions to poverty from the West (capital investment, improved organization and technology, increased agricultural production) are those the developed nations can provide—but often fail to consider local accommodation to poverty (compare Axelle Kabou).|$|E
5000|$|It {{may appear}} the upliftment of Other Backward Classes {{is part of}} the larger {{national}} problem of the removal of <b>mass</b> <b>poverty.</b> This is only partially correct. The deprivation of OBCs is a very special case of the larger national issue: here the basic question is that of social and educational backwardness and poverty is only a direct consequence of these two crippling caste-based handicaps. As these handicaps are embedded in our social structure, their removal will require far - reaching structural changes. No less important will be changes in the perception of the problems of OBCs by the ruling classes of the country.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the other}} end of the spectrum, the 15 percent of {{humankind}} in the developed countries have 80 percent of global income. Pogge argues that shifting 1 or 2 percent of the wealthy states' share toward poverty eradication is morally compelling. Yet most of the affluent believe that they have no such responsibility and Thomas Pogge's book seeks to explain how this belief is sustained. He analyses how our [...] "moral and economic theorizing and our global economic order" [...] have adapted to make us appear disconnected from <b>mass</b> <b>poverty</b> abroad. Dispelling the illusion, he also offers a normative standard of global economic justice and makes detailed, realistic proposals toward fulfilling it.|$|E
