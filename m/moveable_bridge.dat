25|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Chicago River was {{constructed}} over the North Branch near the present day Kinzie Street in 1832. A second bridge, over the South Branch near Randolph Street, was added in 1833. The first <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed across the main stem at Dearborn Street in 1834. Today, the Chicago River has 38 movable bridges spanning it, down {{from a peak of}} 52 bridges. These bridges are of several different types, including trunnion bascule, Scherzer rolling lift, swing bridges, and vertical lift bridges.|$|E
500|$|The Blossomland Bridge {{over the}} St. Joseph River is {{eligible}} {{to be listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places. The span is a Scherzer rolling-lift bascule, a type of <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge.</b> The bridge was built {{as part of a}} 1940s plan to relocate US31 through St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. Those plans were delayed by World War II. The bridge was completed in late 1948 using the rare design prepared by a firm from Chicago that specialized in bascule bridges. The state paid a total of $1.3million for what was called [...] "the largest bridge ever built {{under the auspices of the}} State Highway Department".|$|E
500|$|The second {{bridge is}} the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge in Cheboygan. This bascule bridge {{was built in}} 1940 over the Cheboygan River {{as the last of}} its kind before World War II. It was built as a [...] "two-leaf bridge in a place where a {{single-leaf}} bridge probably would have sufficed." [...] The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940. [...] It was the second <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge</b> on the site, replacing an iron swing bridge built in 1877. The structure is [...] long, composed of two [...] spans {{on either side of the}} central [...] span; the roadway is [...] wide with four lanes for vehicle traffic. There are also pedestrian sidewalks on either side of the roadway. When the bridge is opened to allow river traffic to pass, boats have a [...] channel for navigation. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 1, 2000, and reconstructed in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|The hurdy-gurdy, or vielle-à-roue, is {{essentially}} a mechanical violin, with keys or buttons instead of a finger board. [...] It {{is made up of}} a curved, oval body, a set of keys and a curved handle, which is turned and connected to a wheel which bows the strings that are stopped by the keys. [...] There is a <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge,</b> a variable number of drones and hidden sympathetic strings, all of which can also affect the sound. [...] Simpler forms of the hurdy-gurdy are also found in Spain, Hungary and Russia.|$|E

50|$|A <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge,</b> or {{movable bridge}} (common {{alternative}} spelling in American English), is a bridge that moves to allow passage (usually) for boats or barges. In American English, <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge</b> and drawbridge are synonymous, {{and the latter}} is the common term, but drawbridge can {{be limited to the}} narrower, historical definition used in some other forms of English, in which drawbridge refers only to a specific type of <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Chicago River {{separates}} the downtown from the North and West sides. Heavy river traffic required <b>moveable</b> <b>bridges,</b> and long delays. Cable {{cannot be used}} on <b>moveable</b> <b>bridges,</b> and the delays would have stopped the whole system, so the NCCR leased and refurbished the city’s LaSalle St. tunnel under the river, the WCCR would use the similar Washington St. tunnel for its first two lines. For the WCCR’s two Southwest lines the company dug a tunnel next to Van Buren St. at their own expense.|$|R

5000|$|A {{bascule bridge}} (sometimes {{referred}} to as a drawbridge) is a <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge</b> with a counterweight that continuously balances a span, or [...] "leaf", throughout its upward swing to provide clearance for boat traffic. It may be single or double leafed.|$|E
50|$|The S&BR {{line was}} to leave the Slamannan main line at Causewayend, and cross the Union Canal by a <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge,</b> turning north and passing under the E&GR main line near Myrehead Farm, {{with one or more}} {{branches}} to the E&GR line near there.|$|E
50|$|The Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge, {{also known}} as Saugatuck River Bridge, is a {{railroad}} bridge carrying trackage of Metro-North railroad's New Haven Line over the Saugatuck River in Westport, Connecticut.

50|$|In the United States, {{regulations}} {{governing the}} operation of <b>moveable</b> <b>bridges</b> (referred to as drawbridges) - for example, hours of operation and how much advance notice must be given by water traffic - are listed in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations; temporary deviations are published in the Coast Guard's Local Notice to Mariners.|$|R
50|$|Locks on {{commercial}} canals are usually power operated. The lock keeper, {{who no longer}} lives on site, controls the whole process from a control room overlooking the lock. In the modern age the control of traffic and locks on canals is being centralised. A single control centre can remotely operate several locks and <b>moveable</b> <b>bridges</b> in a wide area, overseeing the process using CCTV. For example, the Tilburg control centre in the Netherlands will remotely control 18 locks and 28 <b>moveable</b> <b>bridges</b> from 2015 on.This allows for a reduction in manpower while still providing round-the-clock service to water traffic. As the controller now has overview over the traffic moving through one lock after another, he can anticipate the arrival of boats by turning the lock in advance, having boats wait for another coming from behind to handle them simultaneously, or decide whether to turn a lock empty for a boat going in one direction or to wait for one going in the other direction.|$|R
50|$|The first bridge {{built by}} the BAGSR over the Riachuelo lasted 44 years, so in 1909 it was {{replaced}} by a <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge</b> that operated until 1982, when the line was electrified and a new bridge (built in concrete) replaced the old iron structure.|$|E
5000|$|A bridge tender's {{house is}} a {{structure}} near or upon a <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge</b> from which a bridge tender may operate the bridge and monitor river traffic, and in which, he may reside. [...] It may contain the controls and the mechanicals to operate the bridge.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{project was}} {{introduced}} in 1844, and it was built during 1845, to be finally opened in 1847. Once finished, it became the third bridge that crossed the river and also became the main connection between Bilbao and the elizate of Abando. It had an iron structure (it was the first known Spanish bridge made by casting) {{and it was a}} <b>moveable</b> <b>bridge.</b> The bridge was named Isabella II. The Queen Isabella II herself wanted to see the bridge during her visit to the city in 1865, in which the Prince of Asturias (which later would become the King Alfonso XII) joined her. In 1866 the internal structure of the bridge, which allowed it to open and close (<b>moveable</b> <b>bridge)</b> stopped working. Until 1870, a toll had to be paid in order to cross the bridge.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally gaps may {{be present}} in the {{overhead}} lines, when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at <b>moveable</b> <b>bridges,</b> as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails. Electric trains have to coast through. To prevent arcing, power must be switched off before reaching the gap. Usually the pantograph must be lowered too, but this is not always the case.|$|R
