50|$|The {{administration}} of cantonments {{and management of}} the military lands inside and outside the cantonments is centrally controlled and supervised by the Military Lands and Cantonments Department, which is an attached department of the Ministry of Defense headed by a Director General. The Director General is assisted by an Additional Director and a Deputy Director at the headquarters. In addition, five Regional Deputy Directors based at Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi and Quetta supervise the respective cantonment boards in their jurisdiction. The Cantonment Executive Officer is the principal executive at the local level. The Board normally decides and lays down policies, while the executive officer executes these policies. He is the chief exponent of the Board’s policies. He acts as an adviser and is a permanent officer specially trained in local administration. He is empowered to carry out the policies and decisions and ensure adherence to the various laws and bylaws. The presence of elected members in the board has a salutary effect, and is most beneficial for the civilian residents because the elected members are the medium to convey their views. The elected members {{play an important role in}} the development of public services in their respective areas. Development works are usually carried out in consultation with the respective elected members. <b>Major</b> <b>development</b> <b>schemes</b> are finalized in the budget meeting held before the beginning of the fiscal year, with the consent of all the members.|$|E

50|$|Approval {{was given}} in 1999 for plans {{initiated}} by Inverclyde Council, Caledonian MacBrayne and Railtrack, which involved shortening the railway tracks and constructing a new station adjacent to Caledonian MacBrayne's headquarters. This formed part of a <b>major</b> <b>development</b> <b>scheme,</b> with the space formerly occupied by the station together with the grassed area which had been {{the site of the}} Bay Hotel providing space for two major supermarkets and housing. Alexander George was appointed preferred developer, but Network Rail was slow to come to an agreement on relocating the station. The work involved in shortening the tracks would have involved considerable expense and meant closing the station for 18 months. The delay left the station looking rather neglected. Then, near the end of September 2006, new plans were announced following intervention by the transport minister Tavish Scott. A considerable saving is to be made by not moving the station so far, so that the work involved is reduced and it will only have to be closed for four or five weeks. Only one supermarket is now proposed, with 580 houses being constructed in blocks facing out onto the Clyde.|$|R

40|$|The {{current rate}} of global {{biodiversity}} loss led many governments to sign the international agreement ‘Halting Biodiversity Loss by 2010 and beyond’ in 2001. The UK government {{was one of these}} and has a number of methods to tackle this, such as: commissioning specific technical guidance and supporting the UK Biodiversity Acton Plan (BAP) targets. However, by far the most effective influence the government has upon current biodiversity levels is through the town planning system. This is due to the control it has over all phases of a new <b>development</b> <b>scheme’s</b> lifecycle. There is an increasing myriad of regulations, policies and legislation, which deal with biodiversity protection and enhancement across the hierarchical spectrum: from the global and European level, down to regional and local levels. With these drivers in place, coupled with the promotion of benefits and incentives, increasing biodiversity value ought to be an achievable goal on most, if not all development sites. However, in the professional world, {{this is not the case}} due to a number of obstructions. Many of these tend to be ‘process’ barriers, which are particularly prevalent with ‘urban’ and ‘major’ <b>development</b> <b>schemes,</b> and is where the focus of this research paper lies. The paper summarises and discusses the results of a questionnaire survey, regarding obstacles to maximising biodiversity enhancements on <b>major</b> urban <b>development</b> <b>schemes.</b> The questionnaire was completed by Local Government Ecologists in England. The paper additionally refers to insights from previous action research, specialist interviews, and case studies, to reveal the key process obstacles. Solutions to these obstacles are then alluded to and recommendations are made within the discussion...|$|R
40|$|Second of {{two short}} papers for general readers and {{regional}} researchers {{provided to the}} Society of Malawi who provided assistance before and during field work {{in the country in}} 2008. The Shire Valley Project in Nyasaland/Malawi emerged in the 1940 s as a <b>major</b> integrated <b>development</b> <b>scheme</b> of the colonial government of Nyasaland. It sought to combine the twin objectives of regulating the level of Lake Nyasa with the control of waters flowing through the Shire Valley for use as a source of hydro-electricity and waters for irrigation. With the establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953 the scheme became embroiled in on-going power politics between the Federal government, the Nyasaland territorial government and the Nyasaland African Congress. The unruly behaviour of the lake and the weight attached by all actors to this project as a basis for the economic development of Nyasaland led to the Nkula Falls HEP element of the SVP becoming a key geopolitical pivot point {{in the history of the}} country, one upon which President Banda and the MCP were able to lever Nyasaland out of the Federation. authorsversionauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years ago}} the Seychelles Polytechnic {{initiated}} a joint teacher-training scheme with Sussex University and in five years trained 100 new Seychellois teachers for the secondary school system. This scheme a numerical balance in favour of Seychellois teachers for the first time. The influx of Seychellois teachers produced a number of immediate advantages: there was a saving in the salary budget, the new teachers were able to supplement their lessons conducted in English with explanations in Kreol, and they also used {{a wider variety of}} teaching methods. They were more committed to teaching and were much preferred by the secondary school students. This paper presents findings from evaluations of the scheme. It describes the situation produced by the returnees, and follows this up with an analysis of the <b>major</b> <b>developments</b> since the <b>scheme</b> came to an end and since the four-year government bonding period of teachers ended. The final section of the paper discusses in more general terms the sustainability of education development projects and the implications for the progressive improvement of schemes...|$|R

40|$|Schistosomiasis is {{a disease}} of great medical and {{veterinary}} importance in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma (subclass Digenea). Following <b>major</b> water <b>development</b> <b>schemes</b> in the 1980 s, schistosomiasis has become an important parasitic disease of children living in the Senegal River Basin (SRB). During molecular parasitological surveys, nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed unexpected natural interactions between a bovine and human Schistosoma species: S. bovis and S. haematobium, respectively. Hybrid schistosomes recovered from the urine and faeces of children and the intermediate snail hosts of both parental species, Bulinus truncatus and B. globosus, presented a nuclear ITS rRNA sequence identical to S. haematobium, while the partial mitochondrial cox 1 sequence was identified as S. bovis. Molecular {{data suggest that the}} hybrids are not 1 st generation and are a result of parental and/or hybrid backcrosses, indicating a stable hybrid zone. Larval stages with the reverse genetic profile were also found and are suggested to be F 1 progeny. The data provide indisputable evidence for the occurrence of bidirectional introgressive hybridization between a bovine and a human Schistosoma species. Hybrid species have been found infecting B. truncatus, a snail species that is now very abundant throughout the SRB. The recent increase in urinary schistosomiasis in the villages along the SRB could therefore be a direct effect of the increased transmission through B. truncatus. Hybridization between schistosomes under laboratory conditions has been shown to result in heterosis (higher fecundity, faster maturation time, wider intermediate host spectrum), having important implications on disease prevalence, pathology and treatment. If this new hybrid exhibits the same hybrid vigour, it could develop into an emerging pathogen, necessitating further control strategies in zones where both parental species overlap. status: publishe...|$|R
