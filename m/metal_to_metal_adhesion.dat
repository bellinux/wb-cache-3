40|$|Inorganic ceramic {{adhesives}} (geopolymers) {{based on}} aluminosilicate matrix are versatile candidates for bonding <b>metals</b> <b>to</b> <b>metals</b> or <b>metals</b> <b>to</b> ceramics. On curing, they {{result in an}} amorphous, crosslinked, impervious, acid resistant 3 D-structures. Alkali activated aluminosilicate based ceramic adhesive was developed for bonding <b>metals</b> <b>to</b> ceramics and <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal,</b> for high temperature applications. The bonding is achieved at 175 °C for 3 hrs, by solid state reaction of alkaline solution of allkalisilicate precursor with the refractory filler, contributing to the bulk aluminosilicate matrix. Lap shear strength of 2 - 4 MPa was obtained for bonding stainless steel. The XRD patterns show the amorphous nature of the aluminosilicate matrix, with mullite formation at higher temperatures. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the weight loss is only due to the removal {{of water from the}} system by means of evaporation and polycondensation of Si-OH groups and Al-OH groups. This is followed by structural reorganisation in which aluminium ions are incorporated into the silicate chains forming the Si-O-Al network resulting in the bonding with the metallic surface.

40|$|Abstract. Journal {{bearings}} {{are widely}} applied in different rotating machineries. These bearings allow for transmission of large loads at mean speed of rotation. These bearings {{are susceptible to}} large amplitude lateral vibration due to self exited instability which is known as oil whirl or synchronous whirl. This oil whirl depends on many parameters such as oil film thickness, viscosity of lubricant, load on bearing, inertia of fluid etc. out of which oil film thickness {{plays an important role}} in operation of Journal bearings. As oil film thickness decreases <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> contact occurs this further can damage the journal bearing. So during the operation minimum oil film thickness should be maintained which can avoid the <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> contact and further increases the life of bearing. This paper presents a theoretical calculation of oil film thickness and experimental verification of same on journal bearing test rig. Different journal speeds and loads are considered for the analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{relation}} of surface roughness of bearing surfaces to allowable fiim thickness is studied quantitatively with a simple Michell pad apparatus.

There was little difference in the frictional behaviour {{of any of the}} lubricants, except that the aqueous lubricants would not run with very finely finished steel surfaces. The onset of <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> contact was detected by an increase in the frictional drag, and also by the change in electrical conductivity between the pad and collar-an extremely sensitive method. The paper shows that there is, at any rate for this system, a quantitative relation between the total surface roughness of the rubbing surfaces and the calculated oil film thickness both at the initial <b>metal</b> <b>to</b> <b>metal</b> contact and seizure.
