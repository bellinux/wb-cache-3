5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer {{wrote a letter to the}} king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E
25|$|As the {{daughter}} of Augustus, mother (now legally the sister) of two of his heirs, Lucius and Gaius, and wife of another, Tiberius, Julia's future seemed assured to all. Yet in 2 BC she was arrested for adultery and treason; Augustus sent her a letter in Tiberius' name declaring the <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> (Tiberius was at this time {{on the island of}} Rhodes and unable to respond quickly). He also asserted in public that she had been plotting against his own life. Though at the time Augustus had been passing legislation to promote family values, he likely knew of her intrigues with other men but hesitated for some time to accuse her. Several of Julia's supposed lovers were exiled, most notably Sempronius Gracchus, while Iullus Antonius (son of Mark Antony and Fulvia) was forced to commit suicide. Others have suggested that Julia's alleged paramours were members of her city clique, who wished to remove Tiberius from favour and replace him with Antonius. This would explain the letter, written by Gracchus, asking Augustus to allow Julia to divorce Tiberius.|$|E

It cannot be otherwise after all he has gone through; but so that I have him again it is enough for me, no matter how great the change that may {{have taken place in}} him. But who are these men?"

6000|$|Jean Kennedy knew, {{though the}} girl did not, what these words conveyed. If Bothwell no longer lived, {{there would be}} no need to declare the <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void,</b> and thus {{sacrifice}} his daughter's position; but supposing him to be in existence, Mary had already shown herself resolved to cancel the very irregular bonds which had united them,--a most easy matter for a member of her Church, since they had been married by a Reformed minister, and Bothwell had a living wife at the time. Of all this Cicely was absolutely ignorant, and was soon eagerly listening as the Queen spoke of her hopes of speedy deliverance. [...] "My son, my Jamie, is working for me!" [...] she said.

50|$|In 2002 {{transgender}} man Michael Kantaras made {{national news}} {{when he won}} primary custody of his children upon divorce; however, that case was reversed on appeal in 2004 by the Florida Supreme Court, upholding {{the claim that the}} <b>marriage</b> was <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> because Michael Kantaras was still a woman and same-sex marriages were illegal in Florida.

50|$|Clement IV died in 1268, and Andrés Albalat, {{bishop of}} Valencia, {{declared}} the <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Clement IV's successor, Pope Gregory X, allowed {{the case to}} be treated in Rome and confirmed his predecessor's decision. James attempted procuring an annulment again in 1275, this time claiming {{that he had had}} sexual relations with Teresa Gil's cousin before their marriage (which would have rendered the marriage invalid), but the argument was no more successful than the previous one.|$|E
50|$|Divorce (or the {{dissolution}} of marriage) in South African law refers to the termination of a marital union, the canceling of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage and the dissolving of the bonds of matrimony between a married couple. Divorce is unlike annulment, which declares the <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Divorce requires the sanction of a court in a legal process. The legal process of divorce may also involve issues of alimony (spousal support), child custody, child support, distribution of property and division of debt.|$|E
50|$|Annulment {{is a legal}} {{procedure}} for declaring a <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> Unlike divorce, it is usually retroactive, meaning that an annulled marriage {{is considered to be}} invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place (though some jurisdictions provide that the marriage is only void from the date of the annulment; for example, this is the case in section 12 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in England and Wales).In legal terminology, an annulment makes a void marriage or a voidable marriage null.|$|E

50|$|The custody case of Michael Kantaras made {{national}} news. Kantaras met {{another woman}} and {{filed for divorce}} in 1998, requesting primary custody of the children.

50|$|Divorce {{is not a}} {{possibility}} for the devotees of certain religious organizations. The Catholic Church, for example, does not permit its adherents to remarry after a divorce unless the marriage has been annulled. They also strongly discourage any legal divorce. Marriage annulments, however, are the current option for the followers of Catholicism to dissolve the official ties to their former significant other. The annulment, which renders a <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void,</b> can be sought on the bases of “adultery, pressure to marry, failure to consummate a marriage through vaginal intercourse, or a refusal to have children,” among other reasons. The Catholic Church considers couples that are divorced but have not been granted an annulment to still have a sacred bond of marriage even if legally divorced.|$|E
50|$|On Philip the Tall's {{death on}} 3 January 1322, Blanche's husband {{inherited}} the crowns. Blanche thus became queen of France and Navarre, {{but her husband}} still refused to release her. Both of her children died in infancy, Philip before 24 March 1322 and Joan on 17 May 1321. Charles requested annulment of their marriage, to which Blanche reluctantly agreed. The annulment was justified by the claim that Blanche's mother was Charles's godmother, although probably the real reason was Blanche's pregnancy during her imprisonment. Pope John XXII declared their <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> on 19 May 1322, and gave both Charles and Blanche permission to remarry. The Countess of Artois requested, among other things, the return of her daughter's enormous dowry.|$|E
50|$|French Minister of Justice Dominique Perben had {{stated that}} such unions would be legally void, {{and called for}} {{judicial}} intervention to halt the ceremony. On 27 July 2004, the Bordeaux Court of General Jurisdiction declared the <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> One legal argument defended by the public prosecutor, which, representing the National Government, opposed the marriage, was that the French Civil Code speaks several times of a husband and a wife, which implies different genders. On 19 April 2005, the Appeals Court of Bordeaux upheld the ruling. On 14 March 2007, the Court of Cassation turned down Charpentier and Chapin's appeal. On 9 June 2016, the European Court of Human Rights ruled {{that the decision to}} invalidate Charpentier and Chapin's marriage did not constitute an infringement of the European Convention on Human Rights.|$|E

In December 2012, the couple announced that Stone was pregnant with their first child and on 6 May 2013, Stone gave birth to their son, Alfred. It was reported on 4 March 2015 that, following five years of marriage, the pair had decided to try a trial separation after [...] "drifting apart". On 9 September 2015, Walliams filed for divorce from Stone, citing [...] "unreasonable behaviour".

50|$|In {{the last}} season, Hyde returns from Las Vegas after his {{confrontation}} with Jackie and Kelso. While {{he is in}} Vegas, he gets drunk and marries a stripper named Samantha. Although Jackie claims nothing happened between herself and Kelso in Chicago, Hyde chooses {{to stay in the}} marriage instead of annulling it, ending his and Jackie's relationship. The marriage is bitter, as they are often seen screaming at each other, but it is hinted that they have an excellent sex life and all the yelling was just a factor of it. In the middle of Season 8, Samantha's real husband showed up unexpectedly and decided to take Samantha with him back to Vegas. Donna points out that since Samantha is already married when she marries Hyde, Hyde and Samantha were never legally married, making their <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> In the midst of the confusion, the two decided that it would be best for them to part ways, and Sam went back to Vegas.

50|$|Upon the {{ascension}} of Queen Mary, Parr {{was arrested}} and was committed to the Tower after his traitorous complicity with John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland's failed plot against Mary to place Lady Jane Grey upon the throne. After Parr {{was sentenced to death}} on 18 August 1553, Anne went to court and intervened on Parr's behalf with Queen Mary I in hopes that they {{she would be able to}} keep their estates. Parr was released. The bill which had declared their <b>marriage</b> <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void</b> was reversed on 24 March 1554. That December, Anne used the reversal to her advantage and was granted an annuity of £100. Again in December 1556, Anne was granted another annuity of £450. She remained at the royal court until the ascension of Elizabeth I. Queen Elizabeth held Parr in high favour and Anne most likely knew that her adulterous history would not endear her to the queen. Parr was restored to blood and was re-created Marquess of Northampton, re-elected to the Order of the Garter, and was made a privy councillor among other things.|$|E
5000|$|The Church {{holds the}} {{exchange}} of consent between the spouses to be the indispensable element that [...] "makes the marriage".

In 1879, his second wife, also complaining of adultery and cruelty, petitioned the English courts for a declaration that their <b>marriage</b> was <b>null</b> <b>and</b> <b>void.</b> The case made legal history: Harvey's argument was that since the first marriage was solemnised in England, the courts in Scotland {{did not have the}} power to end that marriage by divorce, and therefore, Farnie had not been free to marry Harvey.
