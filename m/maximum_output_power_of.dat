50|$|Creating {{circuits}} {{with the}} inverted behaviour to the amplifier {{is one way}} to implement this concept. These circuits counteract the non-linearities of the amplifier and minimize the distiortion of the signal. This increases linear operating range up to the saturation (<b>maximum</b> <b>output</b> <b>power)</b> <b>of</b> the amplifier. Linearized amplifiers have a significantly higher efficiency with improved signal quality. There are different concepts to linearize an amplifier, including pre- and post-distortion and feedback linearization. Most commonly used is pre-distortion linearization.|$|E

50|$|Peukert's law {{brings a}} certain degree of fire-safety to many battery designs.

This danger is easily controlled by limiting the available charge voltage, and ensuring ventilation is present during charging to vent any excess hydrogen gas.|$|E
