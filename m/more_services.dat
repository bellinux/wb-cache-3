The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow <b>more</b> <b>services</b> to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|OsloS is {{the central}} hub of the {{commuter}} rail. Located in the central business district of Oslo, all lines either terminate at, or run through the station. From OsloS, there are four main corridors. All trains running through the West Corridor continue along either the North, South or East Corridor. Because there are <b>more</b> <b>services</b> in the latter three, some of these terminate at OsloS.|$|E
5|$|In February 1981, {{the long-standing}} {{operator}} Orpington & District collapsed due to financial difficulties, so Tillingbourne decided {{to launch a}} test operation of three former O services. These proved successful, so <b>more</b> <b>services</b> were added and two new AEC Reliance coaches purchased for the operation. In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, {{it became clear that}} the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop the business in a different way from that of the main company. On 24 September 1983, the Orpington operation's directors, Gary Wood and Peter Larking, bought out the subsidiary to form Metrobus Limited.|$|E

5|$|Network Rail, in its July 2011 London & South East route {{utilisation}} strategy, {{recommended that}} all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate {{in the bay}} platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018 and the diverted Thameslink trains return there. Passengers from Herne Hill would then have had to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail made this recommendation because <b>more</b> <b>services</b> will be using the route between St Pancras and London Bridge from 2018; sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms {{on the western side}} of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on {{the eastern side of the}} station) would have removed the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from Denmark Hill and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.|$|E

25|$|When the clicks-and-bricks {{euphoria}} hit in {{the late}} 1990s, many banks began to view web-based banking as a strategic imperative. The attraction of banks to online banking are fairly obvious: diminished transaction costs, easier integration of services, interactive marketing capabilities, and other benefits that boost customer lists and profit margins. Additionally, online banking services allow institutions to bundle <b>more</b> <b>services</b> into single packages, thereby luring customers and minimizing overhead.|$|E

25|$|Before the new {{timetable}} {{could be}} introduced, stopping patterns and running times were scrutinised to maximise the utilisation of locomotives and rolling stock. The {{majority of the}} country timetable had not been revised since the steam era of the 1950s, with excessive turn around times at termini and excessive numbers of stops at little-used stations.

25|$|During the consultation, 9 of the 12 {{responses}} from broadcasters were {{in favour of}} removing the restriction. These included the BBC. The BBC agreed that the digital television market had changed substantially since 2002, and that Top Up TV probably couldn't afford the current cost of DTT slots anyway. The BBC suggested that the deregulation should be conditional {{on a number of}} further changes to regulation. These included that Ofcom changes the transmission mode of broadcast on all multiplexes from 16QAM to 64QAM so <b>more</b> <b>services</b> could be squeezed onto the digital terrestrial platform. However, Ofcom rejected these suggestions, saying they were outside the scope of the consultation.|$|E

In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools lost their accreditation. This added momentum to proposals for government reform. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending, and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government.|$|E
