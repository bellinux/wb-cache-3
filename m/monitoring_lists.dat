Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on Hawai'i Island was surveyed for alien plant, feral pig (Sus scrofa), and cattle (Bos taurus) distribution and abundance in April and June of 1987. Fourteen transects were established from high to low elevations (1, 200 to 2, 200 m or 3, 900 to 7, 200 ft), and 2, 293, 5 x 20 -m plots (transect intervals) were sampled. Six permanent 20 x 20 m vegetation plots were established, three in heavily grazed areas and three in less intensely grazed areas. Results were primarily analyzed according to six major vegetative types, which represented 30 detailed vegetation types. Ungulate and cattle sign were significantly related to vegetation types. Six of 68 alien plants encountered on transects were similarly analyzed and found to be associated with certain communities more than others. Alien plant species considered special threats included sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), meadow ricegrass (Microlaena stipoides), kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum), blackberry (Rubus penetrans), banana poka (Passiflora mollissima), and gorse (Ulex europaeus). Some rare plants were also encountered in the survey, and readily recognized large game birds and raptors were also tabulated. Management recommendations are provided, together with protocols for future <b>monitoring,</b> <b>lists</b> of plants encountered (rare or previously reported), and data from the six permanent plots established for long-term monitoring.

30|$|EDA {{is based}} on {{selected}} toxicological endpoints and combines biotesting with fractionation to sequentially reduce complexity down to those compounds (or compound groups) causing observable effects. Finally, {{the components of the}} toxic fractions are analytically identified, quantified and confirmed as the cause of the effect. MODELKEY developed an extensive integrated toolbox for EDA including tools for exhaustive and bioaccessibility-directed extraction (Schwab and Brack 2007), clean-up and fractionation tools (Lübcke-von Varel et al. 2008; Meinert et al. 2010), biotests and bioavailability-directed dosing techniques (Bandow et al. 2009), and analytical and computer tools for structure elucidation (Schymanski et al. 2008). We applied this toolbox to sediments and waters at several sites in the three river basins mentioned above. The identified fractions and compounds bore little correspondence to what had been expected and to what are included in priority pollutant and river basin specific <b>monitoring</b> <b>lists.</b> This is illustrated using sediments as an example. Current assessment of sediment contaminants has a clear focus on nonpolar and highly hydrophobic compounds like for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and chlorinated pesticides such as DDT, HCH, HCB, aldrin and dieldrin. EDA focusing on algal growth inhibition, mutagenicity, tumour promotion and endocrine disruption (estrogenic, androgenic, arylhydrocarbon-receptor mediated, thyroid hormone disturbing) as endpoints suggested a clear dominance of polar fractions causing these effects. These are thus likely relevant for different BQEs but possibly also for human health. This tendency towards attributing impacts to more polar compounds was further enhanced if bioavailability was considered in the EDA studies. Typical compounds identified as major toxicants in sediments were polar PAH-derivatives including nitro and keto-PAHs and PAH-quinones, the biocide triclosan used in personal care products, musk compounds such as galaxolide and tonalide or the flame retardant tri(2 -chloroisopropyl)phosphate. None of these compounds is a priority pollutant or regularly monitored.|$|E
40|$|Chest pain in {{patients}} presenting {{to the emergency}} department (ED) has a plethora of etiologies and electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations. Admission to the hospital from the ED with chest pain will likely place the patient on a telemetry monitored unit for continued cardiac monitoring, specifically monitoring the ST-segment that can detect ischemia. The current guideline for in-hospital cardiac <b>monitoring</b> <b>lists</b> a few exclusions to ST-segment ischemia monitoring such as bundle-branch blocks, ventricular rhythms, and coarse atrial fibrillation or flutter (Drew et al., 2004). These conditions alter the ST-segment for reasons unrelated to acute myocardial ischemia, triggering ST-segment monitor alarms {{that can lead to}} alarm fatigue, misdiagnosis, or inappropriate treatment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of these non-ischemic ECG abnormalities that alter the ST-segment and affect the healthcare professionals’ accurate assessment of myocardial ischemia {{in patients}} that present to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain. This study includes a secondary analysis of the ongoing Electrocardiographic Methods for Prompt Identification of Coronary Events (EMPIRE) study data set, which aims to quantify ischemia-induced repolarization dispersion for early non-ST elevation myocardial infarction detection. The parent study has created a database of patients who arrive via ambulance to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain (Al-Zaiti, Martin-Gill, Sejdic, Alrawashdeh, & Callaway, 2015). In this secondary analysis, the demographic, clinical, and ECG data from 750 consecutively enrolled patients were assessed for acute coronary syndrome risk factors and ECG abnormalities, including secondary repolarization changes that interfere with ST-segment monitoring. 75 % of patients were admitted and 16 % of patients overall had confounders for ST-segment monitoring. Significant relationships between ST-segment monitoring confounders and important clinical variables such as age, coronary artery disease risk factors, and length of stay were found. Determination of the prevalence of ECG abnormalities that affect the ST-segment would provide valuable information on the clinical utility of ST-segment monitoring in chest-pain populations...|$|E
