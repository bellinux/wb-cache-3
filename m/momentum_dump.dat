40|$|The paper {{describes}} the commissioning and in-orbit performance {{results of the}} attitude and orbit determination and control system to support the multi-spectral earth observation imager payload of the SumbandilaSAT microsatellite. The satellite has been designed as a single string mission with little redundancy due to mass and volume restrictions and early in the mission the Z-axis reaction wheel was permanently lost due to a power switch failure. The paper will demonstrate how full 3 -axis stability is achieved without the use this wheel. The pushbroom imager is still able to scan target areas accurately using a forward motion compensation method (FMC 4), simultaneously doing a roll offset manoeuvre for cross track scanning. Target tracking by pointing the high data rate S-band antenna is also successfully demonstrated, while allowing the satellite to freely rotate around the antenna boresight during these periods. The satellite has a Y-body mounted main solar panel and the attitude control system must ensure a sufficient level of solar energy collected during the sunlit part of each orbit. The control actuators employed are 3 -axis magnetic torquer rods and X/Y reaction wheels. During initial detumbling and safe mode operations, a magnetic control law is used to bring the satellite to a sun pointed Y-Thompson spinning attitude for maximum power collection. From this sun-pointed, spinning attitude an intermediate control mode is entered where the Y-reaction wheel is utilised as a momentum wheel, to absorb the body spin rate and to inertially stabilise the momentum vector initially towards the sun direction and finally aligned with the orbit normal. During this mode the magnetic rods are used to maintain the momentum vector in size and steer the pressesion direction while doing nutation damping. The pitch angle is controlled using the Y-wheel, to keep the main imager payload {{as close as possible}} to an earth pointed attitude and thermally stabilise the telescope. Finally, the nominal attitude control mode is enabled when a low Y-momentum biased X/Y reaction wheel and magnetic controller is enabled, to: 1) ensure a nominal nadir pointing attitude to collect a sufficient level of solar energy, 2) do target tracking during view finder use or during imaging download communication with ground stations and 3) implement pushbroom imager FMC 4 scanning. During the nominal mode magnetic rods are used to maintain the Y-wheel angular <b>momentum,</b> <b>dump</b> the X-wheel momentum and zero any yaw angle offsets. The in-orbit performance will be presented of newly developed 2 -axis sun and earth sensors, an autonomous star tracker and SGPS receiver.

40|$|Magnetic {{torquing}} of spacecraft {{has been}} an important mechanism for attitude control since the earliest satellites were launched. Typically a magnetic control system has been used for precession/nutation damping for gravity-gradient stabilized satellites, <b>momentum</b> <b>dumping</b> for systems equipped with reaction wheels, or momentum-axis pointing for spinning and momentum-biased spacecraft. Although within the small satellite community there has always been interest in expensive, light-weight, and low-power attitude control systems, completely magnetic control systems have not been used for autonomous three-axis stabilized spacecraft due to the large computational requirements involved. As increasingly more powerful microprocessors have become available, this has become less of an impediment. These facts have motivated consideration of the all-magnetic attitude control system presented here. The problem of controlling spacecraft attitude using only magnetic torquing is cast into the form of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), resulting in a linear feedback control law. Since the geomagnetic field along a satellite trajectory is not constant, the system equations are time varying. As a result, the optimal feedback gains are time-varying. Orbit geometry is exploited to treat feedback gains as a function of position rather than time, making feasible the onboard solution of the optimal control problem. In simulations performed to date, the control laws have shown themselves to be fairly robust and a good candidate for an onboard attitude control system...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- New {{advanced}} control {{techniques for}} the attitude determination {{and control of}} the SUNSAT microsatellite are presented. The attitude sensors and actuators on a small satellite are limited in accuracy and performance due to physical limitations, e. g. volume, mass and power. To enhance the application of sophisticated payloads such as a high resolution imager within these confinements, a multi-mode control approach is proposed, whereby various optimized controller functions are utilized during the orbital life of the satellite. To keep the satellite's imager and antennas earth pointing with the minimum amount of control effort, a passive gravity gradient boom, active magnetic torquers and a magnetometer are used. A "cross-product" detumbling controller and a robust Kalman filter angular rate estimator are used for the preboom deployment phase. A fuzzy controller and magnetometer full state extended Kalman filter are utilized for libration damping and Z-spin rate control during inactive imager periods. During imaging, when high performance is required, additional fine resolution earth horizon, sun and star sensors plus 3 -axis reaction wheels are employed.

The "rapid prototyping" technique has several advantages including fast implementation and low cost. Moreover, concerning the construction of a small satellite, this technique is very useful thanks to the accuracy achievable in details, which sometimes are difficult and expensive to realize with the use of tools machine. The structure must be able to withstand with the launch loads. For this reason, several simulations using a FEM code and intensive vibration test campaign have been performed in the system development phase. The developed communication subsystem has small dimensions, low power consumption and low cost. The main components of the system are the radios, the antennas (one of them is manufactured inside the ABS structure), the amplifiers and the microcontroller. It has been implemented a communication protocol used mainly by radio amateurs, the AX. 25 protocol.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the synchronization of multiple dynamical systems using contraction theory, with applications to cooperative control of multi-agent systems and synchronization of interconnected dynamics such as tethered formation flight. Inspired by stable combinations of biological systems, contraction nonlinear stability theory provides a systematic method to reduce arbitrarily complex systems into simpler elements. One application of oscillation synchronization is a fully decentralized nonlinear control law, which {{eliminates the need for}} any inter-satellite communications. We use contraction theory to prove that a nonlinear control law stabilizing a single-tethered spacecraft can also stabilize arbitrarily large circular arrays of tethered spacecraft, as well as a three-spacecraft inline configuration. The convergence result is global and exponential {{due to the nature of}} contraction analysis. The proposed decentralized control strategy is further extended to robust adaptive control in order to account for model uncertainties. Numerical simulations and experimental results validate the exponential stability of the tethered formation arrays by implementing a tracking control law derived from the reduced dynamics. (cont.) This thesis also presents a new synchronization framework that can be directly applied to cooperative control of autonomous aerospace vehicles and oscillation synchronization in robotic manipulation and locomotion. We construct a dynamical network of multiple Lagrangian systems by adding diffusive couplings to otherwise freely moving or flying vehicles. The proposed tracking control law synchronizes an arbitrary number of robots into a common trajectory with global exponential convergence. The proposed control law is much simpler than earlier work in terms of both the computational load and the required signals. Furthermore, in contrast with earlier work which used simple double integrator models, the proposed method permits highly nonlinear systems and is further extended to adaptive synchronization, partial-joint coupling, and concurrent synchronization. Another contribution of the dissertation is a novel nonlinear control approach for underactuated tethered formation flight spacecraft. This is motivated by a controllability analysis that indicates that both array resizing and spin-up are fully controllable by the reaction wheels and the tether motor. This work reports the first propellant-free underactuated control results for tethered formation flight. (cont.)

This dissertation work has evolved based on the research philosophy of balancing theoretical work with practicality, aiming at physically intuitive algorithms that can be directly implemented in real systems.

Peak-to-peak jitter was estimated to be 0. 0073 (10 s^- 1) - 0. 0183 (10 s^- 1) (26 " (10 s^- 1) - 66 " (10 s^- 1), 3 σ). The system was capable of <b>dumping</b> <b>momentum</b> until an altitude of 185 km. We found small amounts of sensor degradation in the star tracker and coarse sun sensor. Our mission profile did not require high-agility maneuvers so we are unable to characterize this metric. Without a GPS receiver, it was necessary to periodically upload ephemeris information to update the orbit propagation model and maintain pointing. At 400 km, these uploads were required once every other week. At ∼ 270 km, they were required every day. We also characterized the power performance of our electric power system, which includes a novel pseudo-peak power tracker [...] a resistor that limited the current draw from the battery on the solar panels. With 19 30 % efficient solar cells and an 8 W system load, the power balance had 65 % of margin on orbit. We present several recommendations to other CubeSat programs throughout.
