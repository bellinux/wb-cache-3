5|$|Harveys Lake (also {{known as}} Harvey Lake or Harvey's Lake) {{is a natural}} lake in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. It has a surface area of {{approximately}} 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. The lake is situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake. By volume, {{it is the largest}} natural lake in Pennsylvania, and by surface area, is the second-largest lake. It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a stone <b>masonry</b> <b>dam.</b> The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself, and the lake is surrounded entirely by a paved road.|$|E
25|$|Searsville Dam is a <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> in San Mateo County, California {{that was}} {{completed}} in 1892, {{one year after the}} founding of Stanford University, and impounds Corte Madera Creek (in the San Francisquito Creek watershed) to form a reservoir known as Searsville Lake. Searsville Dam is located in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and is owned and operated by Stanford University. Neighboring cities include Woodside and Portola Valley, California.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} places for {{building}} a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley; the valley sides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dam's structure is to fill the gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel. The sites are usually those where the gap becomes a minimum for the required storage capacity. The most economical arrangement is often a composite structure such as a <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> flanked by earth embankments. The current use of the land to be flooded should be dispensable.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{structure}} and material used, dams {{are classified as}} easily created without materials, arch-gravity dams, embankment <b>dams</b> or <b>masonry</b> <b>dams,</b> with several subtypes.|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} {{in recent years}} has focused on the seismic analysis of concrete and earthfill dams, and few works have addressed the case of <b>masonry</b> <b>dams.</b> The structural behaviour of <b>masonry</b> <b>dams</b> is controlled essentially by its discontinuous nature, which may induce significant non-linear response during an intense earthquake. In this paper a numerical tool based on the Discrete Element Method is presented, aimed at the static, dynamic and hydromechanical analysis of <b>masonry</b> gravity <b>dams.</b> The use of discontinuous models is mandatory for the study of failure mechanisms involving the masonry discontinuities, the dam-rock interface or the rock mass joints. The Discrete Element Method is able to assemble continuous and discontinuous meshes simultaneously in the same model, providing a versatile tool to consider various assumptions and levels of analysis, ranging from simplified to detailed structural representations. A comprehensive study of the seismic behaviour of Lagoa Comprida Dam, located in Portugal, is presented. Both continuous and discontinuous models were developed to assess the main failure mechanisms, including overstress, partial and global sliding and overturning.

50|$|Because of {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} in the region the rivers of the Harz Mountains were dammed from an early date. Examples of such <b>masonry</b> <b>dams</b> are the two largest: the Oker Dam and the Rappbode Dam. The clear, cool water of the mountain streams was also dammed by early mountain folk to form the various mountain ponds of the Upper Harz waterways, such as the Oderteich.|$|R
25|$|The era {{of large}} dams was {{initiated}} {{with the construction}} of the Aswan Low Dam in Egypt in 1902, a gravity masonry buttress dam on the Nile River. Following their 1882 invasion and occupation of Egypt, the British began construction in 1898. The project was designed by Sir William Willcocks and involved several eminent engineers of the time, including Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Aird, whose firm, John Aird & Co., was the main contractor. Capital and financing were furnished by Ernest Cassel. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted; on completion, it was the largest <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> in the world.|$|E
25|$|The longest gravity dam, and longest dam overall, impounds the Lake of Homs in Syria. Built in 284AD by emperor Diocletian for irrigation, the 2,000m {{long and}} 7m high <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> {{consists}} of a concrete core protected by basalt ashlar. The lake, 6miles long by 2.5miles wide, had a capacity of 90millionm³, making it the biggest Roman reservoir in the Near East and possibly the largest artificial lake constructed up to that time. Enlarged in the 1930s, {{it is still a}} landmark of Homs which it continues to supply with water. Further notable dams in this category include the little-studied 900m long Wadi Caam II dam at Leptis Magna and the Spanish dams at Alcantarilla and at Consuegra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century, {{significant}} advances in the scientific theory of <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> design were made. This transformed dam design from an art based on empirical methodology to a profession based on a rigorously applied scientific theoretical framework. This new emphasis was centered around the engineering faculties of universities in France and in the United Kingdom. William John Macquorn Rankine at the University of Glasgow pioneered the theoretical understanding of dam structures in his 1857 paper On the Stability of Loose Earth. Rankine theory provided a good understanding of the principles behind dam design. In France, J. Augustin Tortene de Sazilly explained the mechanics of vertically faced masonry gravity dams, and Zola's dam was the first to be built on the basis of these principles.|$|E

500|$|On February 25, 1901, Governor Murphy {{dedicated}} {{the permanent}} Capitol building, and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on February 18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler. [...] The National Reclamation Act {{was signed by}} President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, which allowed for dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes. [...] The first dam constructed under the act, Salt River Dam #1, began in 1903. It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multi-purpose dam, and Roosevelt himself attended the official dedication on May 18, 1911. At the time, {{it was the largest}} <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> in the world, forming a lake in the mountain east of Phoenix. The dam would be renamed after Teddy Roosevelt in 1917, and the lake would follow suit in 1959.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{construction}} on the New Waddell Dam began with the excavation of its foundation. A diversion tunnel was constructed along with another to divert water releases from the Old Waddell Dam to the Beardsley Canal. Construction on the dam's intakes continued through 1991, {{and by the end}} of 1992, a controlled breach was performed on two arches of the Old Waddell Dam, allowing its reservoir to fill freely behind the New Waddell Dam, which was already mostly inundated. By 1994, the reservoir was filled and had nearly tripled the size of the Old Waddell Dam reservoir. In that same year, the dam's pump-generating plant (New Waddell Pump-Generating Plant) began operation. The dam's cost was in excess of $625 million. Large sediment releases from the New Waddell Dam deteriorated the Camp Dyer Diversion Dam [...] downstream. This <b>masonry</b> <b>dam</b> had to be rehabilitated by the Bureau in 1992.|$|E

50|$|Steel dams use {{relatively}} thin {{steel plates}} {{in contact with}} the water body, with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the load to the ground. The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow, so that the weight of the water puts compressive forces on the girders holding the plates up. This transmits force to the ground without the bending moment that a vertical wall of plates would engender. It was believed at the time that these dams could be constructed faster and more cheaply than <b>masonry</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
