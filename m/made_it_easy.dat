5|$|During the war Zinn {{allowed it}} to be run around the clock, and its design <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to conduct experiments. This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that {{might be used to}} construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E
5|$|More than 60 Catsuits were {{designed}} in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each. The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{for him to get}} into character. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because {{he knew she was}} capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E

5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought that Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to learn.|$|E
5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus {{is believed to be}} descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for them to accept it.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{agriculture}} was {{the mainstay}} of the economy {{of this part of}} Wales, but with the Industrial Revolution, the North Wales Coalfield was developed and parts of eastern Clwyd around the Dee estuary and Wrexham became industrialised. The advent of the railway running from Chester along the North Wales coast in the mid-nineteenth century <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> for urban dwellers from Lancashire and Cheshire to visit the seaside towns of North Wales, and nowadays, tourism is the main source of income in Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|The M3 saw {{action for}} the first time during the defense of the Philippines in December 1941. It {{went on to become a}} factor in the Guadalcanal Campaign, where it was {{successfully}} employed against both Japanese armor and infantry. Throughout the war it remained effective against Japanese vehicles, which were thinly armored and were rarely committed in large groups. The light weight of the gun <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to move through difficult terrain; for example, when attacked by Japanese tanks on Betio during the Battle of Tarawa, Marines were able to heave the M3 over the -high seawall. While high-explosive and canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks, against enemy fortifications the M3 was only somewhat effective because of its small high-explosive projectile. Its overall effectiveness and ease of use meant the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps and with some army units in the Pacific until the end of the war. Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. These extensions sometimes had a scalloped top edge, intended to improve camouflage. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.|$|E

5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E
