5|$|<b>Monaco</b> {{has been}} {{ruled by the}} House of Grimaldi since 1297. From 1793 until 1814, <b>Monaco</b> was under French control; the Congress of Vienna {{designated}} <b>Monaco</b> as being a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1815 until 1860, when the Treaty of Turin ceded the surrounding counties of Nice and Savoy to France. Menton and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, part of <b>Monaco</b> until the mid-19th century before seceding in hopes of being annexed by Sardinia, were ceded to France in exchange for 4,000,000 French francs with the Franco-Monegasque Treaty in 1861, which also formally guaranteed <b>Monaco</b> its independence. Until 2002, <b>Monaco</b> would {{have become part of}} France had the house of Grimaldi ever died out; in a treaty signed that year, the two nations agreed that <b>Monaco</b> would remain independent even in such a case. The current monarch is Albert II.|$|E

Although <b>Monaco</b> acquired the services of German striker Jürgen Klinsmann, the club could not regain the championship and concluded the subsequent seasons in third and ninth positions. <b>Monaco</b> did reach the semi-finals of the Champions League in April 1994, but lost to eventual winners Milan. As a result of his work at <b>Monaco,</b> Wenger was sought after by German club Bayern Munich, who wanted him to be their next manager. <b>Monaco</b> refused to let him leave and Wenger chose to stay, but a poor start to the 1994–95 season meant he was dismissed on 17 September 1994, with the team in 17th spot in the table. In 2001, Wenger said that the impact of bribery and corruption had influenced his decision to leave France, as Marseille were found guilty of match fixing in 1994.|$|E

The diamond's journey to <b>Monaco</b> took three weeks, {{with the use of}} three men with identical briefcases, of which only one held the actual diamond. The men flew from New York to Nice in France, and upon entering <b>Monaco</b> an armed guard with a machine gun gave further protection to the diamond. The couple were in <b>Monaco</b> to celebrate Princess Grace's fortieth birthday at the 'Scorpio Ball', a gala ball held at the Hermitage Hotel in Monte Carlo. The briefcase that contained the diamond also held three 50¢ pairs of stockings that Taylor would buy in New York and were unavailable elsewhere, and Taylor was just as excited to receive the stockings as the diamond.|$|E

5|$|Honoré III was {{a soldier}} who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave <b>Monaco</b> to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honoré III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at <b>Monaco.</b> The sick duke was {{allocated}} the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, <b>Monaco</b> sent scout Arnold Catalano {{to watch}} Henry, {{then at the}} age of 13 in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join <b>Monaco</b> without even {{attending}} a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger's <b>Monaco</b> as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with <b>Monaco,</b> and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.|$|E

The completion of the deal saw Ocampos become the most expensive Ligue 2 signing of all-time. He made his debut for the club on 31 August 2012, coming on as a second-half substitute for Emir Bajrami in a 2–1 loss against Le Havre. Ocampos then scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance in the third round of the Coupe de la Ligue as <b>Monaco</b> beat Valenciennes 4–2. The goal, a spectacular bicycle kick in extra-time, was later chosen by <b>Monaco</b> supporters as the club's Goal of the Season. His first league goal for the club came on 18 January 2013 when he scored one and recorded an assist for Gary Kagelmacher in a 2–0 win over Istres. Ocampos ultimately featured in 29 appearances across the league campaign, scoring four goals as <b>Monaco</b> secured their return to Ligue 1.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of flags {{that could be}} confused with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions: Cantabria, Spain; Kranj, Slovenia; Thuringia, Germany; Upper Austria and Tyrol, Austria; as well the city of Honda, Colombia.
