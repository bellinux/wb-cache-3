5000|$|Legion is more musically ambitious {{than most}} other Deicide albums, {{incorporating}} more technical riffing and song structures. The band considers this album to be its most difficult, and claims it is too chaotic. When the Hoffman brothers quit the band, Eric Hoffman stated it is simply that Glen Benton refused to play longer sets and could not do technical riffing on his bass. Though the album has been praised by fans, [...] "Dead But Dreaming" [...] was the only track of this album that remained in their live set, though as recently as 2010 the band has begun playing [...] "Trifixion" [...] and [...] "Holy Deception" [...] as well. Unlike Deicide's first album, this release did not use any pitch shifters or harmonizers on Benton's vocals. However, delay, reverb, and <b>multi</b> <b>tracking</b> were among the studio manipulations used to get the vocal effects on the album.|$|E
50|$|As a result, in 1975 Earplay {{sent its}} new {{executive}} producer, Howard Gelman to the BBC for secondenment. He {{worked in the}} script department alongside another newcomer to audio, John Madden and {{under the direction of}} Martin Esslin, BBC head of drama, and Richard Imison, BBC head of scripts. John and Howard returned to Earplay in 1976 to bring a new approach to radio drama, one that did not rely on real time production, that is, recording dramas in real time with sound effects and music. Their idea was to produce radio as if it were film, that is, in segments in several takes without additions such as effects and music. This meant that they could be totally portable and fast, They could record voices in a day in a Los Angeles studio or a New York studio, wherever the best talent could be convinced to work on new and vibrant dramas written and acted by the best new talent anywhere in the country. Then they took the raw tapes back to Madison for post production. Given the technology at the time, they worked with <b>multi</b> <b>tracking</b> 2-inch tapes on a 24-track control board. They transferred the finished dramas onto long playing records and later switched to cassette tapes for distribution to the public broadcasting network throughout the country. Now Earplay was a full NPR distributed national program.|$|E
