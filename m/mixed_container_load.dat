As the end of logistics in manufacturer, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> intellectualization has attracted {{more and more}} focuses. Harmonious coordination between planning and execution ground high performance of the <b>container</b> <b>loading.</b> Several challenges exist in business operations. Firstly, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> planning is time-consuming. Several case-based constraints exist in the optimization defined by different customers and the Customs. Secondly, execution driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> is inefficient. Operators may use unclear or unreadable paper-based guidance during execution which is inconvenient to handle. Besides, due to various situations, shipping documentations are complex. Afterwards Order-picking, a critical part in executions, is a costly activity. Thirdly, coordination during whole <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> process is another challenge. Information sharing between planning and execution is delayed and inaccurate. The whole procedure usually cannot be monitored by managers in a remote office. Problems cannot be addressed without timely provision of data. This research targets to establish a smart <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> platform based on real life practices and constraints. Unlike common warehouse operation, warehouse executions are driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading.</b> To overcome the challenges, an integrated solution is proposed with three main parts. The first one is to establish RFID-enabled real-time smart environment where device-level data is collected timely with bidirectional communications under Wi-Fi occasionally connected situation. Secondly, Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is applied in rule-based computation and heterogeneous information sources integration. In rule-based computation, constraint is computed and wrapped as rule. It {{is a kind of}} service which is restored in service repository according to its properties. Under different cases, several rules are addressed and invoked in a specified sequence to realize different business logics. And the platform should communicate with heterogeneous sources within short time. Systems wrap application programming interfaces (API) as web services which can be invoked flexibly at any time. Data fetch process is divided into several threads which extract data concurrently. Thirdly, <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> optimal model is provided based on practical constraints. Based on various rules, shipments are clustered as groups before <b>loading.</b> To <b>load</b> <b>containers</b> more equally, heuristic algorithm is provided with reducing container capacity continuously until other constraints are violated or more shipment groups are separated. Four contributions have been made in this study. Firstly, a five-layer system architecture is proposed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) applications especially in occasionally connected network environment, rule-based computations, and efficient data exchanges. Secondly, several practical constraints of loading planning are addressed and a heuristic algorithm is designed. Shipments can be equally loaded while satisfying most conflicted constraints. Thirdly, a solution for auto-ID enabled warehouse execution is provided. The solution is driven by <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> equipped with real-time information capturing and processing. Fourthly, a guidance can be refereed for real life implementations in SME. The guidance summarizes system customization procedures with reengineered resources. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> and contends that {{combining}} <b>Container</b> <b>Loading</b> Algorithms (CLAs) with Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is a feasible and useful way of analyzing trade-offs between loading efficiency and various practical considerations {{in relation to}} the cargo- such as its stability, fragility, or possible cross-contamination between items over time. The latter perspective is used to demonstrate the merits of the approach. More specifically, the paper considers a situation where the items involved have differing degrees of perishability and badly deteriorated items can affect others (e. g., through mold spreading). The output of the CLAs is used to create agents that simulate the spread of mold through proximity-based interactions. The results show the trade-offs between container utilization and the propagation of mold and demonstrate that there is not necessarily any correlation between these two factors.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University ofBedford shireThis work investigates new approaches to the <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem which {{address the issue of}} how to load three-dimensional, rectangular items (e. g. boxes) into the container {{in such a way that}} maximum utilisation is made of the container space. This problem occurs in several industry sectors where the loading approach places cargo effectively into aeroplanes, ships, trailers or trucks in order to save considerable cost. In carrying out this work, the investigation starts by developing a new heuristic approach to the two-dimensional bin packing problem, which has lower complexity than <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> in the aspects of constraints and geometry. A novel approach, including the heuristic strategies and handling method for remaining areas, is developed that can produce good results when testing with benchmark and real world data. Based on the research for two-dimensional bin packing, a novel heuristic approach is developed to deal with the <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem with some practical constraints. The heuristic approach to <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> also includes heuristic strategies and the handling of remaining spaces. The heuristic strategies construct effective loading arrangements where combinations of identical or different box types are loaded in blocks. The handling method for remaining spaces further improves the loading arrangements through the representation, partitioning and merging of remaining spaces. The heuristic approach obtains better volume utilisation and the highest stability compared with other published heuristic approaches. However, it does not achieve as high a volume utilisation as metaheuristic approaches, e. g. genetic algorithms and tabu search. To improve volume utilisation, a new hybrid heuristic approach to the <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem is further developed based on the tabu search technique which covers the encoding, evaluation criterion and configuration of neighbourhood and candidate solutions. The heuristic strategies as well as the handling method for remaining spaces developed in the heuristic approach are used in this new hybrid tabu search approach. It is shown that the hybrid approach has better volume utilisation than the published approaches under the condition that all loaded boxes with one hundred per cent support from below. In addition, the experimental results show that both the heuristic and hybrid tabu search approaches can also be applied to the multiple <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem...|$|R
40|$|Efficient <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> has the {{potential}} to considerably reduce logistics and transportation costs. The <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem is computationally complex and, despite extensive academic effort, there remains room for algorithm improvement. Real-world problems are not always addressed satisfactorily primarily due to the large number of complex constraints and objectives. The problem addressed by this work is an unsolved multiple <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> problem introduced by Renault {{on the occasion of the}} 2014 / 2015 ESICUP challenge, organized by the EURO Special Interest Group on Cutting and Packing (ESICUP). Renault's problem requires a large number of different items to be packed into containers of different types and sizes. Items must be grouped into stacks and respect the `this side up' constraint. The primary objective is to minimize the volume of shipped containers. The smallest volume container may be left behind for the next shipment and is excluded from the main objective. Nevertheless, only a limited percentage of each product may be packed into this container. Additionally, a set of secondary objectives is considered. This work presents a decomposition approach embedded in a multi-phase heuristic for the problem. Feasible solutions are generated quickly, and subsequently improved by local search and post-processing procedures. Experiments revealed that the approach generates optimal solutions for two instances, in addition to good quality solutions for those remaining from the Renault set. The algorithmic contribution is, however, not restricted to the Renault instances. Experiments on less constrained <b>container</b> <b>loading</b> instances from the literature demonstrate the approach's general applicability and competitiveness. status: publishe...|$|R
