40|$|One of the {{standard}} methods for {{the determination of the}} size distribution of wood chips is the oscillating screen method (EN 15149 - 1 : 2010). Recent literature demonstrated how image analysis could return highly accurate measure of the dimensions defined for each individual particle, and could promote a new method depending on the geometrical shape to determine the chip size in a more accurate way. A sample of wood chips (8 litres) was sieved through horizontally oscillating sieves, using five different screen hole diameters (3. 15, 8, 16, 45, 63 mm); the wood chips were sorted in decreasing size classes and the mass of all fractions was used to determine the size distribution of the particles. Since the chip shape and size influence the sieving results, Wang’s theory, which concerns the geometric forms, was considered. A cluster analysis on the shape descriptors (Fourier descriptors) and size descriptors (area, perimeter, Feret diameters, eccentricity) was applied to observe the chips distribution. The UPGMA algorithm was applied on Euclidean distance. The obtained dendrogram shows a group separation according with the original three sieving fractions. A comparison has been made between the traditional sieve and clustering results. This preliminary result shows how the image analysis-based method has a high potential for the characterization of wood chip size distribution and could be further investigated. Moreover, this method could be implemented in an online detection <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> <b>chips</b> size characterization. An improvement of the results is expected by using supervised multivariate methods that utilize known class memberships. The main objective of the future activities will be to shift the analysis from a 2 -dimensional method to a 3 - dimensional acquisition process...|$|R
40|$|Chip size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} quality variable not only for buyers of forest fuels, but also <b>for</b> <b>chipping</b> contractors as it influences both fuel consumption and productivity of chippers. Studies of disc chippers and of drum chippers with closed drums have shown that increased chip target length increases chipper productivity and decreases fuel consumption per ton of <b>chips</b> produced. <b>For</b> open drum chippers, chip length is partly controlled by the mesh size in the sieve. In order to evaluate how this sieve affects productivity and fuel consumption of chippers, two open drum <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> professional <b>chipping</b> of forest fuels were studied. Small chippers were represented by a Kesla 645, and larger ones by an Eschlböck Biber 92. The Kesla 645 was studied with 25, 50, and 100 mm sieves and the Biber 92 with 35, 50, and 100 mm sieves. With the 100 mm sieve the Kesla chipper produced 14. 5 oven dry ton (odt) of chips per effective hour and the Biber 30. 0 odt per effective hour. Fuel consumption per odt was 3. 0 l for the Kesla and 2. 1 l for the Biber. A reduction of sieve mesh size decreased productivity and increased fuel consumption <b>for</b> both <b>machines.</b> Reducing the mesh size decreased the size of produced <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> the Kesla, {{but not for the}} Biber. The sieve on the Biber seems to be a safety measure against oversized pieces whereas chip size is, as on a closed drum chipper, mainly controlled by the cut length of the knives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} our {{investigations}} into the performance limits of CMOS datapaths. We have used a combination of single phase clocking, reduced voltage swing logic, moderate pipelining, and custom layout to achieve dramatic speed improvements over conventional design techniques. We have also used a novel fast adder structure and register file. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these techniques and circuits, we have designed a test chip including a 64 -bit integer datapath and a PLA-based finite state <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> testing. The <b>chip</b> layout was generated using MOSIS design rules and fabricated in the HP CMOS 34 1. 2 -¯m process. It has been tested and is fully functional at 180 MHz. 1 High-speed circuit techniques Industry circuit designers commonly use complementary CMOS gates and multi-phase clocking with level-sensitive latches or single phase clocking with edge-triggered flip-flops.

40|$|Soil erosion {{take place}} in {{degraded}} ecosystem where the lack of vegetation, drought, erodible parent material and deforestation take place (Borelli et al., 2013; Haregeweyn et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013). Agriculture management developed new landscapes (Ore and Bruins, 2012) and use to trigger non-sustainable soil erosion rates (Zema et al., 2012). High erosion rates were measured in agriculture land (Cerdà et al., 2009), {{but it is also}} possible to develop managements that will control the soil and water losses, such as organic amendments (Marqués et al., 2005), plant cover (Marqués et al., 2007) and geotextiles (Giménez Morera et al., 2010). The most successful management to restore the structural stability and the biological activity of the agriculture soil has been the organic mulches (García Orenes et al; 2009; 2010; 2012). The straw mulch is also very successful on bare fire affected soil (Robichaud et al., 2013 a; 2013 b), which also contributes to a more stable soil moisture content (García-Moreno et al., 2013). The objective of this research is to determine the impact of two mulches: wheat straw and <b>chipped</b> <b>branches,</b> on the soil erosion rates in a rainfed vineyard in Eastern Spain. The research site is located in the Les Alcusses Valley within the Moixent municipality. The Mean annual temperature is 13 ºC, and the mean annual rainfall 455 mm. Soil are sandy loam, and are developed at the foot-slope of a Cretaceous limestone range, the Serra Grossa range. The soils use to be ploughed and the features of soil erosion are found after each thunderstorm. Rills are removed by ploughing. Thirty rainfall simulation experiments were carried out in summer 2011 during the summer drought period. The simulated rainfall lasted during 1 hour at a 45 mmh- 1 intensity on 1 m 2 plots (Cerdà and Doerr, 2010; Cerdà and Jurgensen 2011). Ten experiments were carried out on the control plots (ploughed), 10 on straw mulch covered plots, and 10 on <b>chipped</b> <b>branches</b> covered soil. The results show that the soil erosion is reduced by 10 on straw mulch covered soils and by 4 on <b>chipped</b> <b>branches</b> covered soil.
