25|$|Traditional sailboats are monohulls, but <b>multi-hull</b> {{catamarans}} and trimarans {{are gaining}} popularity. Monohull boats generally rely on ballast for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in {{boats designed for}} racing, {{be as much as}} 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or air tanks, if a monohull fills with water, it will sink.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{precedent}} {{set in the}} 1988 America's Cup where the San Diego Yacht Club defended against a monohull yacht with a catamaran, any non mutual-consent challenger must specify the largest <b>multi-hull</b> possible {{under the terms of}} the Deed of Gift, if it is to have any chance of winning. Consequently, GGYC specified its yacht as having a 90-ft length-waterline, and 90-ft beam. However, GGYC also stated that they wanted [...] "consensual negotiations in the spirit of the Deed of Gift toward a Protocol comparable in scope, and similar in terms, to that used for the 32nd America's Cup." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two yachts raced {{under the}} simple {{terms of the}} deed in September, 1988. New Zealand predictably lost by a huge margin. Fay then took SDYC back to court, arguing that the race had been unfair, {{certainly}} not the [...] "friendly competition between nations", envisaged in the Deed of Gift. Ciparick agreed and awarded New Zealand the Cup. However, Ciparick's decision was overturned on appeal and SDYC's win was reinstated. Fay then appealed to New York's highest court and lost. Thus SDYC successfully defended the cup in what observers described as the most controversial cup match to that point. (The 2010 America's Cup was a direct descendant of the 1988 cup, as it featured two gigantic <b>multi-hull</b> yachts and generated even more legal activity and controversy [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|The 33rd America's Cup between Société Nautique de Genève {{defending}} {{with team}} Alinghi against Golden Gate Yacht Club, and their racing team BMW Oracle Racing {{was the subject}} of extensive court action and litigation, surpassing in acrimony even the controversial 1988 America's Cup. Since the two parties were unable to agree otherwise, the match took place as a one-on-one deed of gift match in gigantic, specialized <b>multi-hull</b> racing yachts with no other clubs or teams participating. The Golden Gate Yacht Club won the match 2–0 as their yacht USA 17 powered by a [...] rigid wing-sail proved to be significantly faster than Société Nautique de Genève's yacht Alinghi 5. The litigation leading up to the match included which club would be the challenger, the dates and venue for the regattas, certain rules governing the regattas (in particular the measurement rules), and the construction of the boats.|$|E

40|$|Investigations into hydroelasticity {{of ships}} {{commenced}} in the 1970 s. Since then the {{theory has been}} employed to predict the responses {{of a wide range}} of marine structures, such as mono- and <b>multi-hulled</b> ships, offshore structures and VLFS. In recent years, with increasing market demands for new buildings of slender ocean going carriers and the continuously updated high speed and unconventional <b>multi-hulled</b> designs, the maritime industry began to notice the advantage of assessing the usefulness and applicability of hydroelasticity in ship design. At first instance, the aim of this paper is to illustrate some of the applications of hydroelasticity theory to ships, with particular reference to recent and ongoing developments focussing on ship design applications and the effects of non-linearities and viscous flows. The paper also discusses the longer term potential use of weakly and fully non-linear fluid-structure interaction, as well as Navier Stokes based fluid dynamic methods, for the improved modelling of ship dynamic response problems...|$|R

40|$|Application of hydroelasticity {{analysis}} {{in various stages}} of the design process can provide improved predictions of global wave-induced loads, such as torsional moments for mono-hulled vessels and splitting and torsional moments for <b>multi-hulled</b> vessels, by modelling the physical problem more accurately. The complexities involved in generating the data for the fluid-flexible structure interaction (FFSI), on the other hand, can be considered as a disincentive to its extensive use by designers. This particular issue led to the work described in this paper on the application of 3 D hydroelasticity analysis tool for the dynamic behaviour of ships in waves through the use of the G-Hydroflex portal. This web-enabled application allows users to solve FFSI problems by utilising large Grid based computer resources. The portal also allows geographically dispersed designers to work together with ease and security. Following the description of the portal architecture, applications to a range of mono- and <b>multi-hulled</b> vessels are illustrated and further improvements discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} high speed tests {{carried out on}} three geosim models of a {{catamaran}} hull and of its hard chine demihull, of a trimaran hull and of its round bilge main hull. The current scaling procedures ITTC 57 and ITTC 78 were applied with the aim to provide {{a better understanding of}} appropriate resistance breakdown and scaling for high speed single hulls and <b>multi-hulled</b> vessels. The approach used for the ITTC 78 procedure consists in obtaining a form factor for each Fn by iso-Froude method, then, for each scale, by direct measurement of the wave pattern resistance by a longitudinal cut method, by examining the Ct- Cwp curves at high Froude numbers. This approach was carried out with the goal to obtain validation of form factor determined by running the model bow down (transom emerged) with Prohaska and/or Hughes methods, by enveloping versus Rn the curve of Ct obtained by low speed model tests. In the case of <b>multi-hulls</b> the form factors should include also the interaction among the hulls. A numerical method based on Rankine sources for the evaluation of the wave resistance and of the wave pattern analysis was also applied and a comparison with the experimental results was carried out in terms of wave resistance...|$|R

50|$|The {{unconventional}} {{challenge was}} met with an unconventional response. As the challenge used the original Deed of Gift as its basis, there were no explicit class or design requirements other than that the boat was to be 90 ft or less at the waterline if it had one mast.

50|$|One {{variant of}} this {{patented}} hull concept has three vertical struts that pierce the water surface, {{much like a}} <b>multi-hull</b> SWATH design. The two transversely separated aft struts provide the stability {{that is needed to}} resist the torque reacted by the single turbine/generator unit. The configuration of the struts also ensure that the device weathervanes about its midwater mooring buoy such that it always points into the direction of the current.|$|E
5000|$|A {{catamaran}} (...) (informally, a [...] "cat") is a <b>multi-hulled</b> watercraft featuring {{two parallel}} hulls of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide beam, {{rather than from}} a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat. Being ballast-free and therefore lighter than a monohull, catamarans often have a shallower draft (draught) than comparably-sized monohulls. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.|$|R

The 2 D transient free-surface Green function is used to formulate the integral equation on the body surface. Numerical predictions are compared with experimental results associated with a NPL catamaran ship and a trimaran ship, as well as the theoretical results derived by strip theory. In contrast to strip theory, it is found that the proposed method produces satisfactory predictions of the motion response characteristics of <b>multi-hulled</b> vessels at high forward speed in head sinusoidal waves...|$|R

50|$|Traditional <b>multi-hull</b> vessels such as {{catamarans}} and outrigger canoes {{benefit from}} increased lateral stability without sacrificing speed, and these advantages {{have been successfully}} applied in twin hull kayaks. Outrigger kayaks attach one or two smaller hulls to the main hull to enhance stability, especially for fishing, touring, kayak sailing and motorized kayaking.Twin hull kayaks feature two long and narrow hulls, and since all their buoyancy is distributed {{as far as possible}} from their center line, they are stabler than mono hull kayaks outfitted with outriggers.|$|E
50|$|The Hobie 14 {{is known}} for its forward mast and very bent banana shaped hull. The forward mast and odd shaped hulls make the boat quite {{sensitive}} to weight placement fore and aft. If the helm sits too far forward, he or she can cause the leeward bow to dig in, resulting in a pitchpole. Hobie 14s are great for younger sailors who want a solo-able <b>multi-hull</b> that can be held down without much weight.

5000|$|The craft used {{vary from}} single sailor windsurfers or kitesurfers, to <b>multi-hulls</b> with crews of fifteen people. Many short course record {{attempts}} are made with boats based on the classic proa boat layout. Recent developments include hulls that rely on hydrofoils or planing hulls, which allow the hull to lift out of the water, and thereby increases speed by reducing friction. An example of a multihull hydrofoil design is the Hydroptère, designed by Alain Thébault. The design is based on experience {{from a range of}} hydrofoil sailcraft that Thébault built in cooperation with the late Eric Tabarly since the 1990s.

40|$|Pacific pavilions The Oceanic way of {{building}} boats involves duplicating hulls “One {{would imagine that}} a contrivance so simple and practical for pro- curing stability and increased carrying capacity would have been adopted everywhere, but {{as a matter of}} fact it belongs almost exclusively to the Indo-Pacific area. ” Until very recently no one would have thought that the America’s Cup, the premier global yachting contest, would be sailed in <b>multi-hulled</b> craft originating from the Pacific. In the same way that we can characterise the Oceanic canoe as uniquely <b>multi-hulled</b> there are a number of generalisations that can be made about Pacific Island buildings. The first is that they are universally single-celled pavilions. Small or large, Pacific buildings are always unicellular, and free-standing in open space. Differentiation and separation are achieved not by walls and partitions, but by space, much as islands are separated by sea. This term for this spacing is va, an Oceanic word, that, with numerous complex variations and translations, is applied to both the social and physical worlds. Fundamentals In the Pacific the gabled house form, which goes under variants of the term fale and which is known in New Zealand as the whare, is also standard. The gable cross section is, surprisingly, an inherently unstable form and it is, of course, a form that is not confined to the Pacific. The characteristic of the gable in Oceania is that posts support the ridge pole, which has the structural benefit of eliminating outward thrust on the wall posts; in the West this lateral load is usually resisted by trusses or buttresses. Sometimes this ridge post is truncated to become a king post, but always the ridge is propped. These props have all manner of symbolic associations. In the Māori whare the ridge post, or poutokomanawa, is the heart of the named ancestor who is the house. This identification is detailed and literal. The gable house form, in all its variations, is utterly fundamental to Pacific architecture...|$|R
