25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, {{about sixty}} miles from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on the receipt of the news. Bad weather {{for the next few days}} slowed the move, however, the work of moving the squadron nevertheless went on, no easy job, as it was a two-day haul. It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, made everyone happy (or homesick, as the case <b>may</b> <b>be),</b> <b>just</b> to look at if.|$|E
25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the CHMSL may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's deck lid or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the spare wheel carrier. Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset CHMSL for this reason. The height of the CHMSL is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right stop lamps. Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the CHMSL <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E
25|$|Engaging this dialogical {{process of}} {{communicating}} is how human beings {{come to be}} composed of multiple voices (which constitute their horizons) that are in constant flux and always incomplete. This implies that Dasein's self-interpretations are never complete; ergo, the establishing of Dasein's identity is never finished and {{his knowledge of the}} world and others is never complete. If Dasein's identity and knowledge is never complete, then human beings are never complete. Bakhtin referred to this as human beings always being unfinalized. In other words, Dasein is never complete because his understanding of himself (i.e. his self-interpretations) remains open to future re-interpretation as his knowledge increases via ongoing dialogue with others and the world. Furthermore, the number of possibilities of who Dasein may become is infinite so long as Dasein remains unfinalized. And, who Dasein is at any given moment <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> one voice, or may be one temporarily aligned hierarchy of voices (dialogical positions) that will realign the next moment. More to the point, Dasein’s identity never exists as an immaterial entity in his mind, rather it emerges through his embodied acts while relating to others. Philosophers and hermeneutic psychotherapists who reject the mind-body dualism state that is another significant contrast between ontological hermeneutics and mainstream counseling.|$|E

25|$|Naultinus are preyed on by {{a number}} of {{invasive}} mammalian species including cats, rodents (3 species of rat and the house mouse) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as stoats and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and weasels <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the '90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does serious harm to native reptile populations. Mice can squeeze into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become torpid and can't defend themselves against attack. This would mean that Naultinus sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, Naultinus are also preyed on by introduced bird species - mynas have been observed plucking Naultinus from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and magpies have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known Naultinus sites in the South Island.|$|E

The lyrical content present on the song was compared to her compositions during her previous albums, Like a Prayer (1989) and Ray of Light (1998), especially [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] from the latter. The song received positive reviews from most music critics, who commended her raw vocals, the revelatory lyrics that matched with the album's thematic and noted it for being a highlight on the record. It charted in some European territories, peaking inside the top-twenty in Hungary and the top-forty in Spain and Sweden. Madonna performed the track in an acoustic version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where the performance received acclaim from critics, who noted an improvement on her vocals.|$|E
500|$|Many issues {{remain in}} Erythranthe taxonomy. E. guttata is highly complex, with many {{variations}} apparently reflecting differences in geographic environment and elevation. Molecular geneticists regard the species broadly as including both perennial and annual populations, {{but there is}} rationale for treating this complex as several distinct species (perennials are E. guttata, E. grandis, and E. corallina; annuals are E. microphylla and others). [...] The perennials and annuals differ as groups from each other by an inversion sequence on chromosome 8. Evidence tentatively indicates that the perennials evolved from annual ancestors, although some evidence has been interpreted to indicate that E. nasuta evolved from E. guttata in central California between 500,000 and 200,000 years ago and since then become primarily a self-pollinator. [...] Relationships among the apparently closely related E. tilingii, E. minor, and E. caespitosa are not clearly understood. [...] Some currently recognized species <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> variants of other species: E. arenicola, E. brachystylis, E. regni. [...] Chromosomal issues may affect the classification of some species: E. corallina, E. guttata, E. nasuta, E. tilingii, and E. utahensis.|$|E

Nick lies to Dot that he had promised to send money to Sandy {{on the condition that}} she named their daughter Dorothy after her grandmother, so that Dot will trust him and bond with his daughter; Dot does not know Dotty's real name. After spending the night, Dotty begs Dot to let them stay longer. Dot soon discovers that Nick is unemployed and he and Dotty have been living rough. Nick says he will either put Dotty into care or sell her to Dot. After serious consideration, she buys Dotty to get her away from Nick. Dotty learns that Dot has left all her money to Dotty in her will, and tells Nick. They plan to kill Dot to inherit the money, and trick her into thinking she is suffering from dementia. Eventually, Dotty is told by Nick to give Dot an overdose of her medication, but, Dotty has {{had a change of heart}} and gives the pills to Nick in his beer. When Nick learns of Dotty's double-crossing, he drags her to the café and holds everyone inside hostage. [...] Dotty escapes along with most of the others, but the café explodes, and in the commotion, Nick escapes. Dot suspects Dotty <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as evil as Nick, so plants some tablets on the kitchen table whilst Dotty has her back turned.
