5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega <b>Man</b> series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut <b>Man,</b> Ice <b>Man,</b> Fire <b>Man,</b> and Elec <b>Man)</b> come from the {{original}} Mega <b>Man.</b> A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of these first four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick <b>Man,</b> Bubble <b>Man,</b> Flash <b>Man,</b> and Heat <b>Man)</b> are taken from Mega <b>Man</b> 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E

5|$|Mega <b>Man</b> 2 is a {{platform}} and action game like its predecessor, Mega <b>Man.</b> The player controls Mega <b>Man</b> as he traverses eight stages {{to defeat the}} bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal <b>Man,</b> Air <b>Man,</b> Bubble <b>Man,</b> Quick <b>Man,</b> Crash <b>Man,</b> Flash <b>Man,</b> Heat <b>Man,</b> and Wood <b>Man.</b> Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon's power.
