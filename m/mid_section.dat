The third wheel station {{on the left side}} is missing. Zimmerit was applied to approximately 2 meters high on the superstructure and the Balkenkreuz was painted in the <b>mid</b> <b>section.</b> An earlier 18 tooth sprocket ring is found on this vehicle.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{provided}} concrete samples, {{the data}} suggest that the observed differences in dynamic E at top and <b>mid</b> <b>sections</b> of the core samples are not caused by plastic concrete temperature conditions. The distributed microscopic damage state caused by high concrete plastic temperatures, within those samples, is not notably different at the top and bottom sections.|$|R
30|$|Based on a 95  % {{statistical}} confidence level, {{the test}} results obtained from the provided field concrete samples show no meaningful differences between hot and cooler temperature cast sites {{in terms of both}} dynamic modulus and permeable void volume data. Furthermore, statistically significant differences between the top and <b>mid</b> <b>sections</b> of the field core samples, owing to the temperature variation with depth of the plastic concrete, are not seen.|$|R

50|$|The holotype {{specimen}} {{was recovered}} from Poço Azul, an underwater cave system in Nova Redenção, Bahia state. (The same cave that another extinct sloth species Ahytherium was found) The specimen was well preserved, consisting {{of both the}} front and back half of the skull (but missing the <b>mid</b> <b>section),</b> the mandible, most of the spine, and some elements from the limbs. Additionally, a nearly identical almost complete skull from Rondônia can be referred to this species.|$|E
50|$|Tissamaharama stupa had {{developed}} a series of vertical cracks right round {{the dome of the}} stupa and in some other parts around in 1990. The department of Archeology of Sri Lanka and State Engineering Co-operation intervened on the request of chief incumbent of the temple and prevented further cracking of the stupa by using galvanized steel cables tied around the circumference of the dome in the <b>mid</b> <b>section.</b> This final repair works were completed in February 1998 at a total cost of 6 million Sri Lankan rupees.|$|E
50|$|The Minami-Chitose - Oiwake and Shin-Yūbari - Kami-Ochiai Junction (on the Nemuro Main Line) {{sections}} {{opened in}} 1981, becoming the two {{ends of the}} Sekishō Line. The Yūbari Line was renamed in two sections, the section between Oiwake and Shin-Yūbari becoming the <b>mid</b> <b>section</b> of the Sekishō Line, and the section between Shin-Yūbari and Yūbari becoming the Yūbari Branch Line of the Sekishō Line. The new line shortened the main route to eastern Hokkaido. Previously, passengers to Shintoku and further east had to travel via the Nemuro Main Line.|$|E
40|$|Approximate {{straight}} displacements {{are often}} made using a parallel leaf-spring flexure. This flexure {{serves as a}} typical case for studying the influence of shear and the compliance of the reinforced <b>mid</b> <b>sections</b> of the leaf-springs in the support stiffnesses cz and cy. The conclusions drawn, however, hold true for the rotational stiffness crx also, while the stiffness in the ry and rz direction can be approximated based on cz and cy. It turns out that shear {{plays an important role}} for short relatively wide leaf-springs at small deflections. The compliance of a reinforcement needs {{to be taken into account}} for determining the support stiffness at small deflections...|$|R

5000|$|Later {{the same}} year, Simove faced trouble when {{a page from}} one of his {{products}} ‘The Cock-A Doodle Pad’ which featured line drawings of naked men with spaces in their <b>mid</b> <b>section,</b> was wrongly printed in an origami pad. A customer who bought the origami pad from Hampton Court Palace gave it as a gift to her young nephew who opened it to find a line drawing of a naked man, which happened to be Simove. Simove apologised to the woman involved for the ‘unfortunate factory mix up’.|$|E
50|$|Rothschild's {{porcupine}} is {{a medium}} sized porcupine with a head-and-body length of between 332 and 420 mm and a tail length of between 290 and 413 mm. A fully grown adult weighs {{in the region}} of 2 kg. The nose is pink and large, and the eyes are small. The body is spiny all over, the evenly spaced spines being dark with yellowish tips in the animal's <b>mid</b> <b>section.</b> The tail tapers from a broad base and is prehensile. This porcupine could be confused with the Mexican hairy dwarf porcupine (Sphiggurus mexicanus), but that species has long black hair which largely conceals the spines while Rothschild's is more obviously spiny.|$|E

She was {{subsequently}} lengthened using part of the <b>mid</b> <b>section</b> of another T2 tanker, the Fruitvale Hills, and rebuilt by Newport News Shipbuilding into one of seven Seatrain Lines multi-purpose cargo ships capable of carrying general bulk and palletized cargo, intermodal containers, vehicles and rail cars. Upon completion of the conversion and delivery in March 1967 Seatrain Florida, IMO 6119807, was chartered to the MSTS in support of overseas U.S. military operations, including the transport of material, equipment and aircraft to Vietnam. The ship {{was transferred to the}} National Defense Reserve Fleet (James River) in October 1974 and on August 8, 1978 her name was changed to just Florida.

50|$|The shop front {{has a wide}} awning {{that extends}} out over the footpath. Two doors {{fronting}} Grafton Street, which are set off centre, provide access to each shop. Next to each door is a large display window. The front window on the southern shop has been replaced with a window incorporating louvres but the northern shop moulded outer timber window frame remains original but has been modified from four panes to a single pane. Above each door is another smaller window, possibly originally a hopper. A brick parapet was made prior to 1927 and the <b>mid</b> <b>section</b> of the parapet raised at the front sometime after. There are 2 steeply pitched corrugated iron gabled roofs over each shop, of uniform height. The gabled roof on the northern shop has remained the same but the southern shop has been altered to a similar pitch. There is patchy flat metal flashing against the parapet. The rear skillion and framing is old and slightly bowed.|$|E

50|$|Roy's {{map of the}} mid 18th century {{marks the}} ferry as being in the Ferrydyke and Donald's Quay {{location}} without recording a name. Two sizeable buildings are shown amidst a group of trees; the canal is not marked as it was yet to be built. The Ferry House on the Erskine side is shown standing at the same location that it did when the ferry closed in 1971.The 1860 OS map shows a dwelling at Ferrydyke on the northern side of the canal {{that may have been}} associated with the canal. On the southern side a complex of buildings is shown consisting of the stables and the bridge and stable keepers' cottages with a substantial stone quay running out from the river bank at right angles to it. The end of the approximately 170 foot long quay is slightly wider than the <b>mid</b> <b>section</b> and it leads to a lane that accesses the stables area directly as well as running up to the Ferrydyke Wharf on the canal above. Donald's Quay reached the open river allowing boats to call at all stages of the tides. At this date the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway had yet to be built. An enclosed area of land runs from the cottage/s a short distance to the east.|$|E

A heavy {{downfall}} of hail occurred {{at the time when}} the porter of the Sailors' Home came out to close the outer gate, which was a solid and heavy iron structure, opened and shut by being wheeled across the opening. The constable, it appears, had left his waterproof cape at another part of his beat, and had stood inside the entrance of the Sailors' Home to shelter from the storm. Seeing the porter unable to pull the <b>mid</b> <b>section</b> of the gate into place, the officer went to his assistance but had evidently given so strong a pull that the gate had run sharply and snapped the hold back chains, one of which was tied with rope. The gate overshot the guide and toppled outwards from the top. The porter during the operation was inside and the policeman outside the gate. Seeing it begin to fall over, the porter made a grab at it, but was overpowered by the heavy mass, and sustained some injury in being carried with it, while the officer, being beneath, sustained the whole impetus of the downfall. Being a mass of metal weighing about half a tonne, the gate crushed the officer so severely that he was at once rendered unconscious.” ...|$|E
