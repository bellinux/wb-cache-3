500|$|In his {{much later}} book, Maitreya, Raël says {{the road to}} a world without money is {{capitalism}} and globalisation, as opposed to communism. [...] Capitalism would allow those who contribute much to society to also contribute to its scientific and technological development. Under capitalism, society would produce as much money as it can.

500|$|On Saturday, May 1, {{thousands}} of workers went on strike and rallies were held throughout the United States, with the cry, [...] "Eight-hour day with no cut in pay." [...] Estimates {{of the number of}} striking workers across the U.S. range from 300,000 to half a million. In New York City the number of demonstrators was estimated at 10,000 and in Detroit at 11,000. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, some 10,000 workers turned out. In Chicago, the movement's center, an estimated 30,000-to-40,000 workers had gone on strike and there were perhaps twice as <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> on the streets participating in various demonstrations and marches, as, for example, a march by 10,000 men employed in the Chicago lumber yards. Though participants in these events added up to 80,000, it is disputed whether there was a march of that number down Michigan Avenue led by anarchist Albert Parsons, founder of the International Working People's Association , his wife Lucy Parsons and their children.|$|E
500|$|In early 1774, he was {{appointed}} military governor of Massachusetts, replacing Hutchinson. He arrived from Britain in early May, first stopping at Castle William on Castle Island in Boston Harbour. He then arrived in Boston on 13 May 1774, having been carried there by HMS Lively. His arrival was met with little pomp and circumstance, but was generally well received at first as Bostonians were happy to see Hutchinson go. [...] Local attitudes toward him rapidly deteriorated as he began implementing the various acts, including the Boston Port Act, which put <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> of work, and the Massachusetts Government Act, which formally rescinded the provincial assembly's right to nominate members of the Governor's Council, though it retained the elected General Court. [...] Gage dissolved the assembly in June 1774 after he discovered the Massachusetts representatives were sending delegates to the extralegal Continental Congress. [...] He called for new elections to be held as per the Massachusetts Government Act, but his authority was undermined by the representatives who refused {{to meet with the}} new, appointed Governor's Council. [...] He attempted to buy off political leaders in Massachusetts, notably Benjamin Church and Samuel Adams. With the former he was successfulChurch secretly supplied him with intelligence on the activities of rebel leadersbut Adams and other rebel leaders were not moved.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a hearing}} before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, [...] "eople are quite unhappy {{with the state of}} the economy and what’s happening. They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E

However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

[...] The magazine drew large amounts of criticism for the flattering photo of Tsarnaev used for the issue's cover. Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote that the cover [...] "rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment". Massachusetts State Police sergeant Sean Murphy stated that [...] "glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine." [...] The New York Times used the same photo on their front page in May 2013, but did not draw criticism. Rolling Stone columnist Matt Taibbi criticized those who took offense at the cover, arguing that their offense-taking was the result of their associating Rolling Stone with glamor instead of news, stating that The New York Times did not draw the criticism that Rolling Stone did, [...] "because everyone knows the Times is a news organization.

60|$|Soon {{after the}} union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the border chiefs found it {{profitable}} to adopt upon their estates that system, of agriculture to which their hills were adapted, rather than to continue the maintenance of military retainers. Instead of keeping garrisons, with small armies, in a district, they decided to keep only so many as could profitably cultivate the land. The effect of this, of course, was like disbanding an army. It threw <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> of employ, and forced them to seek for a home elsewhere. Like many other movements which, in their final results, are beneficial to society, this was at first vehemently resisted, {{and had to be}} carried into effect in some cases by force. As I have said, it began first in the southern counties of Scotland, soon after {{the union of}} the English and Scottish crowns, and gradually crept northward--one county after another yielding to the change. To a certain extent, as it progressed northward, the demand for labor in the great towns absorbed the surplus population; but when it came into the extreme Highlands, this refuge was wanting. Emigration to America now became the resource; and the surplus population were induced to this by means such as the Colonization Society now recommends and approves for promoting emigration to Liberia.|$|E
60|$|How <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>out</b> of {{the suit}} Jarndyce and Jarndyce has {{stretched}} forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt {{would be a very}} wide question. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks' Office who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that eternal heading, no man's nature has been made better by it. In trickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under false pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never come to good. The very solicitors' boys who have kept the wretched suitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle, Mizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments until dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle, Mizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter and see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and sharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the ill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history from the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go right.|$|E
