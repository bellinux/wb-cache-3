50|$|It {{was from}} her life of {{privilege}} that Douglass decided to dedicate {{her life to}} helping less fortunate people. Douglass and her daughter Sarah met and developed a close friendship with Lucretia Mott and the Grimké sisters, Angelina and Sarah. This friendship eventually led them to create the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society after they were not permitted to become members of the Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia because they were women. The society was involved in different social issues and the abolitionist movement. They fought against slavery and racial and gender discrimination. The society's constitution was signed in December 1833 by eighteen women, including Douglass. The society raised <b>money,</b> <b>spread</b> antislavery texts, and started antislavery petitions in Washington D.C. The society also supported the then radical idea that women {{should be allowed to}} vote, speak in public, and become leaders. Another cause that was important to the society was education. Due in large part to Grace and Sarah Douglass' dedication to educating African-American children, the society formed an education committee, which looked after educational facilities for black children around the Philadelphia area. After the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were ratified in 1865 and 1870, respectively, the society was dissolved by the members, since they believed that their goal of ending slavery had been achieved.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} effects of {{commodity}} index rolls on nearby commodity futures returns and futures term structure. More specifically, I examine the impact of commodity index investors' and speculators' positions on roll yields of nearby futures contracts during the "Goldman roll". In addition, I study the futures returns in the post-rolling period. Furthermore, by employing daily dollar volumes, my objective is to calculate the effect of liquidity in the rolling period. Finally, I conduct a sub-period analysis and show how the anticipation of index rolls has moved earlier within the rolling period and that the index rolls affect futures term structures in more deferred maturities. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The dataset consists of 4337 individual futures contracts and contains daily futures price, open interest and volume observations on each contract from January 1995 to December 2012. My sample is divided to 19 index commodities and 18 non-index commodities. In addition, I use the breakdown of weekly positions provided by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). To test the hypotheses, I estimate several panel regressions with varying set-ups. The regressions have been conducted by using Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation robust standard errors. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Commodity index rolls depress roll yields between nearby and second nearby futures contracts during the rolling period. In addition, net index trader positions {{have a negative impact on}} roll yields and managed <b>money</b> <b>spread</b> positions have a positive impact on roll yields. Furthermore, as a new evidence I find that roll yields tend to revert after the rolling period to better reflect the fundamentals, supply and demand after the rolling period. Unlevered excess returns of 80 - 110 basis points can be earned each month by anticipating index rolls and reversing the position after the index rolls. No such effect exists in non-index commodities. The anticipation of index rolls by speculators and new indices with dynamic rolling methodologies have resulted in earlier timing of the rolls. In addition, due to increased investor attention the price impact anomaly is slowly disappearing and moving to other maturities outside the traditional rolling period of 5 th- 9 th business days in each month...|$|E

This approach allows for an accurate modelling of the persistence properties of the data, and to decompose the EURIBOR-OIS spreads into three components bearing an economic interpretation. We find that the increasing trend in the spreads after August 2007 was broken and reversed in December 2008. This coincides with the timing of a large ECB policy rate cut which, together with other policy measures, paved the way for a gradual reversal in market sentiment, and reduction in credit and liquidity risks.
