40|$|The Internet-of-things (IoT) {{has been}} heralded {{as the third}} {{industrial}} revolution combining disruptive technological change and a radical restructuring of the traditional ICT ecosystem. Technological diversification allows companies in the information and communication technology (ICT) industries {{to participate in the}} IoT by transplanting their existing know-how to new application domains. In using the ICT ecosystem perspective, this paper examines the diversification of 1323 ICT companies into IoT by investigating 86, 159 <b>main</b> <b>patents</b> in the IoT area using the USPTO database. The paper examines {{the extent to which the}} existing knowledge base allows ICT firms to diversify into the new technological area, that is, IOT. It utilizes an entropy measure to characterize the extent to which ICT firms diversify into IoT. We propose that a firm's knowledge position in a new emerging technological has an important strategic value in terms of competitiveness. It characterizes a few new application domains in neighboring industries like health or transport. The paper concludes that due to technological pervasiveness Iot provides for new innovative activities and technological opportunities for ICT companies to grow in emerging sectors like wearables, industrial automation, smart energy and smart mobility...|$|R

The success of this merchandise occurs at the chagrin of several influential insurance companies, chiefly the La Suisse Assurance in Geneva, who see their winnings from one of their most profitable income niches dwindling, and they attempt to gain the patent to the invention and then get rid of it altogether. As it so happens, Guido lives enstranged from his wife Petula, the other patent holder to the glass, who would be more accessible to the insurance companies' offers. Her condition for the divorce from Guido would be that he should transfer all his exclusive rights to the production of the Quiller glass - and thereby his whole fortune - to her, whereupon she would sell them to the Swiss Assurance and gain a princely monetary compensation in return.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how {{the patent}} laws and {{intellectual}} property rights (IPR) system in China have affected innovation during the reform period. Subject to criticism due to imperfect enforcement, the patent law system has produced a stock of patents which has grown rapidly alongside economic growth. Despite significant regional disparities in income {{and the level of}} innovation, the success rates of patent applications are similar across the country. The application of the patent laws alone seems insufficient to explain these differences. We thus present a simple model of patent production in China derived from the patent law system. We find the <b>main</b> determinants of <b>patents</b> to be R&D expenditure and foreign direct investment (FDI), but not the number of researchers, though the level of human capital matters. We conclude that the policies governing FDI and R&D are the <b>main</b> determinants of <b>patents,</b> as the IPR system is fairly uniform across provinces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spinal cord {{injuries}} devastate {{the lives}} of those affected. Normally, acute injury leads to chronic injury in the spinal cord, although this has a variable impact on normal sensory and motor functions. Currently the only drug used to treat acute spinal cord injury is methyl-prednisolone, administered in order to prevent secondary inflammatory neural damage. Thus, it is time that alternative and complementary pharmacological, cell and gene therapies be developed. In order to achieve this, several approaches to stimulate spinal cord repair must be considered. Indeed, the main lines of research that have been established in different animal models of spinal cord regeneration are now beginning to produce encouraging results. Several patents have been derived from these studies and hopefully, they will lead to the development of new treatments for human spinal cord injuries. Here is presented a review of the <b>main</b> <b>patents</b> that have been generated by this research, and that can be classified as:- Patents involving the use of different factors that promote axonal regeneration. - Patents aimed at overcoming the activity of glial scar inhibitory molecules that hinder axonal regeneration. These approaches can be further subdivided into those that block Nogo and other myelin components, and those that involve the use of chondroitinase against glial scar chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans. - Patents concerning glial cell therapy, in which glial cells are used to mediate axonal repair in the spinal cord (Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing cells or astrocytes) ...|$|R

500|$|The {{problem was}} that the beams {{interfered}} with each other, producing a series of oscillations called hash. An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference, resulting in reasonably good beams being produced, in September 1942. Robert Oppenheimer and Stan Frankel invented the magnetic shim, a device used to adjust the homogeneity of a magnetic field. These were sheets of iron about [...] in width that were bolted to {{the top and bottom of}} the vacuum tank. The effect of the shims was to slightly increase the magnetic field in such a way as to help focus the ion beam. Work would continue on the shims through 1943. The <b>main</b> calutron <b>patents</b> were Methods of and apparatus for separating materials (Lawrence), Magnetic shims (Oppenheimer and Frankel), and Calutron system (Lawrence).|$|R

A survey is then presented based on patent documents involving 278 native Brazilian plants. The object of this survey was to verify how the patent system is used by Brazilian companies, universities and research institutions to protect the results of research on these plants. The survey also served to identify the <b>main</b> <b>patent</b> applicants, both Brazilian and foreign, the main plants whose derivatives are objects of protection (forms of Hypericum, Allium, Eucalyptus and Aloe are the top 4, for instance) and the types of inventions protected. The results showed that, inter alia, 66. 9 % of these Brazilian plants are the object of patent documents. This article also verified that the <b>main</b> <b>patent</b> holders of these patents documents are foreign applicants (94. 2 %).

40|$|The patent system {{focuses on}} the actions of two players: the {{patentee}} and its competitor. It assumes that the competitor will represent {{the interests of the}} end user. But, end users are increasingly becoming significant players in the patent system, with their interests sometimes diverging from those of competitors.

40|$|The inventive {{capacity}} of South African universities and researchers is investigated through analysis of university patent applications. Patent applications to the South African Patent office from 1996 to 2006 {{are used as}} an indicator of inventive capacity. The investigation determines, for the first time, patenting activities of local universities at the South African Patent Office for the past 10 years and it identifies the performance of faculties and departments. We suggest that patent analysis of local patent offices in developing countries provides a more comprehensive picture of inventive activity than the analyses in the <b>main</b> <b>patent</b> offices in USA and Europe. The assertion that industrial experience affects the inventiveness of academic staff is also investigated. The study finds that most inventors or co-inventors held at least one position in industry, or in some cases, specialized parastatals (non-university institutions) prior to patent application. The study supports the idea that experience and the professional trajectory of scientists through migration from industry to university leads to an increase of researchers ’ scientific and technical human capital which is convertible into high performance or inventive capacity. We argue that this linkage is valid equally in developed and developing countries (like South Africa) and that universities internationally wishing to improve their entrepreneurial character should aim to employ academic with industrial prior experience...|$|E
