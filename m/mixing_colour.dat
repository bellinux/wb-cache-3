Sant, approaching more nearly, was surprised to see the colour in question was as harsh and brilliant an emerald green as it is possible to imagine. Having cultivated an extreme sensibility to colour from his earliest years, he drew the air in sharply between his teeth at the very first glimpse of this brew. Mr Watkins turned round. He looked annoyed.|$|E

40|$|In my diploma thesis Colour in spatial design I {{focused on}} two key issues in art, colour and space. First, I {{introduced}} colour {{as a physical}} phenomenon and explored the use of colour in art. In the theory of colour I looked at two ways of <b>mixing</b> <b>colour</b> and later talked about the colour wheel and different contrasts. In the theoretical part I followed colour through three areas of art where I studied its relationship with space and different motives for use of colour in design. I presented specific art works {{in the field of}} painting, sculpture and architecture, where the authors have approached this issue from various angles. I have also presented some of my own attempts to use colour in spatial design. In practical-pedagogical work I examined this subject with elementary school students through making models. Through their individual work students have gained a new experience in connection with space and colour...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this research}} is based on how artists mix and print colour by traditional means (painting and printmaking) and how these differ from colour picker tools, slider bars and methods developed for digital printing, and whether {{it is possible to}} incorporate both? Artists have been expert at <b>mixing</b> <b>colour</b> for centuries, yet although the artist and designer has access {{to a wide range of}} digital imaging tools and technologies, that on first glance, are dedicated to the creation of colour mixtures, the resulting colours are often disappointing. It appears that hardware, software tools and methods for digital printing are not necessarily suited to the specific requirements of the artist. In fact, they are too generalised to obtain a high degree of quality and too inflexible to allow artists to obtain precision and predictability. Based on existing hardware and software, the paper suggests alternative approaches to custom colour ink mixing and printing. Through the development of alternative ink colours specifically mixed for inkjet printing the paper demonstrates specially designed charts for printing and double printing of custom mixed inks...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{explored}} the importance that colour models have for teaching colour systematics in primary school. In the theoretical part history and theoretical nature of colour models are explored. We analyzed which colour models clearly illustrate significant colour {{problems such as}} colour mixing, contrasts, harmony and colour chords and dimensions, and in particular, how these problematics are illustrated. Based on {{the analysis of the}} curriculum and textbooks for art education in Slovenian elementary school, we also identified which colour models are used for teaching colour systematics, how they are used and which ones are not used at all. In the empirical part we first conducted an online survey among art teachers in Slovenian primary schools and identified how they teach some particular problematics of the colour systematics, which colour models they use while teaching and how they use them. Then we carried out an action research, in which I, by using different colour models, taught 8 th grade students these contents in a specific way. Colour <b>mixing,</b> <b>colour</b> dimensions as well as colour harmony are included in the curriculum, but they are not taught in a way to illustrate the difference between artistic (RYB) and scientific (CMY) primary colours; also the discussion of colour dimensions does not include 3 D colour models, and in the discussion of colour harmony coloured chords are not used. In action research, we therefore identified the impact of such illustration on the students' understanding. Based on the research we derived some guidelines for the use of colour models in the elementary art education...|$|E
40|$|In my thesis, I {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} understanding <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> through a so-called Land art at 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd graders. <b>Colour</b> <b>mixing</b> is usually based and on prepared industrial tube colours bought at usual shops. However, nature is an immense source of dyes and colours that offer <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> in the art. In the past the artists prepared pigments from natural substances by themselves. Nowadays various artists in landscape art exploit the potential of natural materials in <b>mixing</b> <b>colours.</b> I have explored this issue through the theoretical and empirical research approach. In the theoretical part, I have analysed the problem of <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> {{in conjunction with the}} appearance of colours in nature (natural pigments, various colour phenomena in nature, the natural materials of different colours, etc.) considering descriptive methods and field literature to establish the advantage of <b>mixing</b> <b>colours</b> in the visual arts. I take into account the analysis of the various contemporary artists who exploit the colours of nature in its landscape art. In the empirical part, I investigated the ability of pupils’ understanding the <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> through the Landscape Art in action survey in three steps. The first step was to present the <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> on an established way of industrial tube paints to students. In a second step, I included the teacher of chemistry; we conducted a cross-curricular link, on the subject of <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> and extraction of natural dyes by extraction. In the third step, students <b>mixed</b> <b>colours</b> using substances found in nature near their school, and this leads to certain characteristics of landscape art. Students created a variety of natural materials available in near school location (the school, where I conducted research is located in the countryside). The study will contribute to art didactics innovative methods of teaching <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> in conjunction with the nature and landscape art. Emphasis was on an open and creative functioning of students {{in a wide range of}} materials and ideas. This will help the students to strengthen environmental awareness and awareness of coexistence with nature...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{documented in}} this thesis {{is based on a}} practice-led PhD study funded by the AHRC, supported also by LCR Hallcrest, manufacturers of thermochromic dyes. In addition to the written thesis, the research outcomes also include a range of fabric samples and prototype pieces that explore the design potential of thermochromic dye systems on textiles when used in combination with electronic heat-profiling circuitry. A particular ambition of the research was to highlight and exploit the complexity {{of a wide range of}} thermochromic dye systems within the area of textile design. The research was multidisciplinary in nature, bridging design, colour chemistry and power electronics. A number of electronic heating systems, some digitally-controlled, were designed and constructed as a means to activate and control the colour change effects on thermochromic fabrics. Both leuco and liquid crystal types of thermochromic systems were explored. However, a significant focus developed on liquid crystal dye systems which offered particular opportunities in their application to textiles, including the previously unexploited design potential of their ability to change through a spectrum of colours, facilitated further by access to some unique materials made available by the industrial collaboration. The research contributes to knowledge in several ways: • it demonstrates the additive colour mixing properties of liquid crystal dye systems when layered on textiles, which have not previously been exploited in textile design. • the electronic systems that have been developed within the research offer tools for visualising colour-change, controlling, and <b>mixing</b> <b>colour</b> on a textile surface. • the approach through textile design exploited combinations of thermochromic effects with pattern, for example using laser technology, to enhance further the colour changing surfaces. It demonstrates a diverse range of thermochromic effects. The research described {{in this thesis}} not only adds significantly to knowledge and practice-led exploitation of design using thermochromic dye systems on textiles but also presents a diverse range of opportunities for new design research directions...|$|E
40|$|Considerable advancements {{have been}} made in aqueous inkjet {{technology}} for the fine art market, yet there are still significant opportunities to investigate ulterior digital printing methods that specifically address the working methods of artists. This research investigates multi-channel inkjet printing methods, which deviate from standard colour management workflows by reflecting on art historical processes, including the construction of colour in old master works, to reproduce specific colour pigment mixes in print. This is approached by incorporating artist colour mixing principles relevant to traditional art making processes through direct n-channel printing and the implementation of multiple pass printing. By demanding specific ink colourants to be employed in print, as well as the application of <b>mixing</b> <b>colour</b> though layering, we can mimic the effects of the traditional processes. These printing methods also generate colour through a variety of colour mixtures that may not have been employed or achieved by the printer driver. When printing with multiple passes, utilising a single ink colour with each pass, the print order can be controlled, which has shown to have considerable effects on the final colour produced. For example, the result of a multi-pass, layered yellow and cyan print produces a different final colour when printed cyan over yellow compared to yellow over cyan, or even a single pass combination of the two. The objective of this research is to explore colour mixing and layering techniques in the printing of inkjet reproductions of original artworks that will maintain subtle colour transitions in dark shadow regions. Details in the darker regions of original works are maintained by slight colour distinctions, which are barely decipherable except upon close inspection. While these colours are lost in traditional inkjet reproduction, by using direct n-channel editing capabilities to reproduce a painted original with high dynamic range we can improve colour variation in the shadow regions. By limiting the use of black ink we aim to better reproduce more saturated dark colours, controlling the mixture to create these dark colours with increased density. This research will be jointly undertaken with the National Gallery, London, where the application of developed methodologies will be applied in colour matching historic artists’ pigments for print reproduction. The aim of this research is to lead to better methods of reproducing traditional artists’ colour pigments utilising current and expanding technologies. The objective is to create novel approaches for the inkjet printing process to address current limitations of digital reproduction, and open up new avenues of inkjet production...|$|E
