By then, I was a technical editor for IE and I reread the Hotson articles. First I read them through, realizing I was missing a lot. Then I studied them, trying to see the justification for each assertion and came to the con-clusion that Billie Westergard was probably right and these articles might be the best <b>material</b> <b>written</b> in physics; <b>I</b> went on to state this in an editorial (IE # 69).

Not knowing that the amnesty was a sham, Fieldorf outed himself to the authorities. He was then placed under investigatory arrest in Warsaw. In prison he refused to collaborate with the Communist security services, even under torture. General Fieldorf's brutal interrogations were personally supervised by MBP colonel Józef Różański. Kazimierz Gorski, Polish secret police, the UB interrogator, testified in 1997: [...] "Józef Różański would stop by frequently during many of my interrogations of general August Fieldorf, {{and he would have}} conversations with him on many subjects. The prosecuting attorney Benjamin Wajsblech would show up frequently as well, and would, on many occasions, give me verbal instructions.

The AIDA formula well sums up the purposes of commercial advertising, and is said to consist of attracting Attention, arousing Interest, creating Desire, and motivating Action. In commercial advertising the desired action is the sale of a product or service. This calls for strategies of persuasion, which can be described rhetorically or thematically. I prefer the thematic approach, and have decided that least following strategies will be discovered: recognition and surprise, riddle and puzzle, wit and humour, patriotism, famous persons, myth, ethnicity, Bible and Christian tradition, and nature, environment and ecology. These are not listed hierarchically and a given ad may employ several of these strategies. KEYWORDS: Emblems; Advertising; Advertising Strategies...|$|R

My <b>writing</b> <b>materials</b> (which <b>I</b> had given the servant instructions never to meddle with) were scattered over the table much as usual. The only circumstance in connection with them that at all struck me was that the seal lay tidily in the tray with the pencils and the wax. It was not in my careless habits (I am sorry to say) to put it there, neither did I remember putting it there. But as I could not call to mind, on the other hand, where else I had thrown it down, and as I was also doubtful whether I might not for once have laid it mechanically in the right place, I abstained from adding to the perplexity with which the day's events had filled my mind by troubling it afresh about a trifle.

He must be able to select or organize the technique and material that are effective for the students. By choosing the appropriate technique and teaching materials, the teacher can create an interesting class situation and stimulate the students to study hard. This study focuses on finding the answer what technique and instructional are used by one of the lecturers of <b>writing</b> <b>I</b> for the third semester students at English Department of Muhammadiyah University of Malang. The design of this study was descriptive. It was conducted to describe the technique and instructional <b>material</b> of teaching <b>writing</b> <b>I</b> used by the lecturer at the third semester students of English Department of Muhammadiyah University of Malang. The research subject of this study was one of the lecturers of writitng I at English Department of Muhammadiyah University of Malang. Classroom observation was the main instrument and interview was a supporting instrument to collect the data. The result from the finding shows that the techniques that were applied were lecturing, discussion, practicing and commenting on the students writing. Lecturing was the first step; it just took fifteen or twenty minutes. The next step was discussing the materials that was still confusing for the students. Practicing was the next step that took longer time than lecturing and discussing. The last was commenting on the student’s writing covering grammar, punctuation and cohesive links. The materials were taken from The Writers Workbook, writing: College Handbook, Sentence Skill, Let’s Write English, and The Informed Writer. The conclusion of the study is that the lecture always used four steps for teaching process that is lecturing, discussion, practing, and commenting on the students <b>writing.</b> The instructional <b>materials</b> that are taken from the next books...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} to develop a model for {{quantitative}} assessment of written text complexity. This will be the basis for developing an instrument for health literacy assessment, as neither the readability formula nor the health literacy assessment instrument exist yet for Croatian language. Adequate readability of <b>written</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>i.</b> e. text complexity tailored to a specific target population, is important for collection of patient data, for patient educational materials, and for documents which will gurantee the active role of patients in making healthcare decisions. Contrastive analysis of texts in English and their existing translations in Croatian language provided an insight into text variables necessary for readability assessment by readability formulas. The existing readibility formulas validated for English language may be used for Croatian texts provided the formulas are modified or their scores converted as presented here, because the score trends are comparable. Readability formulas are recommended here as rough estimates of the difficulty of <b>written</b> <b>materials</b> for patients since reading tests applied to test comprehension are not applicable for Croatian language because of its orthographic transparency, and readability formulas correlate well with comprehension tests. The importance of this study lies in the potential practical application of its results in the preparation of <b>written</b> <b>materials</b> for patients since it may contribute to decreasing the health inequalities in the use of healthcare services from the aspect of communication. This should result in a more dominantly patient-centred health care, increased quality of health care, and reduced health care costs...|$|R
