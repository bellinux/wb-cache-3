50|$|A Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient {{accelerator}} (FFAG) is {{a circular}} particle accelerator concept on which development {{was started in}} the early 50s, {{and that can be}} characterized by its time-independent magnetic fields (fixed-field, like in a cyclotron) and the use of strong focusing (alternating gradient, like in a synchrotron). Thus, FFAG accelerators combine the cyclotron's advantage of continuous, unpulsed operation, with the synchrotron's relatively inexpensive small <b>magnet</b> <b>ring,</b> of narrow bore.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{generation}} of accelerators used [...] "strong focusing", and required much smaller apertures, and thus much cheaper magnets. The CERN PS (Proton Synchrotron, 1959) and the Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, 1960) were the first next-generation machines, with an aperture roughly {{an order of magnitude}} less in both transverse directions, and reaching 30 GeV proton energy, yet with a less massive <b>magnet</b> <b>ring.</b> For comparison, the circulating beams in the Large Hadron Collider, with ~11,000 times higher energy and enormously higher intensity than the Bevatron, are confined to a space on the order of 1 mm in cross-section, and focused down to 16 micrometres at the intersection collision regions, while the field of the bending magnets is only about five times higher.|$|E
50|$|Two {{years later}} in 1964 he joined CERN for researching the {{anomalous}} magnetic moment of muons, which was a precision test for the quantum electrodynamics. The so-called g minus 2 experiment was an idea of Leon Lederman. Picasso worked in a collaboration with physicists John Bailey, Francis Farley, Simon van der Meer, Guido Petrucci and Frank Krienen. At this experiment a 10GeV beam of protons is ejected by the Proton Synchrotron. This beam is headed on target {{inside one of the}} Muon Storage rings, which were built for this experiment. There 70% of the protons interact with each other producing a burst of particles, among other things many negative pions. The pions, which have the right momentum (about 1,3GeV/c), turn in the magnetic field so that they can orbit the ring. There the pions decay rather quickly, in the first turn around one fifth of them change to negative muons. Some of these muons which are emitted at small angles to the direction of the pions have slightly lower momentum than the pions and therefore move to an orbit of smaller radius. So they miss the target {{at the end of the}} first turn and are kept orbiting in the <b>magnet</b> <b>ring.</b> The measurement needed 15 years and at the end, they calculated the g-factor and the magnetic momentum of a muon.|$|E

40|$|As the NEXT ion {{thruster}} progresses towards higher technology readiness, {{it is necessary}} to develop the tools that will support its implementation into flight programs. An {{ion thruster}} thermal model has been developed for the latest prototype model design to aid in predicting thruster temperatures for various missions. This model is comprised of two parts. The first part predicts the heating from the discharge plasma for various throttling points based on a discharge chamber plasma model. This model shows, as expected, that the internal heating is strongly correlated with the discharge power. Typically, the internal plasma heating increases with beam current and decreases slightly with beam voltage. The second is a model based on a finite difference thermal code used to predict the thruster temperatures. Both parts of the model will be described in this paper. This model has been correlated with a thermal development test on the NEXT Prototype Model 1 thruster with most predicted component temperatures within 5 - 10 °C of test temperatures.
