40|$|There is a {{considerable}} degree of heterogeneity in the way how European banks present their financial instruments in IFRS financial statements. In a sample of 109 European banks, we identify three major presentation formats that are currently applied: a presentation by <b>measurement</b> <b>category,</b> by product, and by purpose. We find {{the use of the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>categories,</b> which were originally designed by IAS 39 for measurement purposes, as line items to be the prevalent choice across countries. We analyze the factors that could explain this disclosure choice. We find that a corresponding regulatory recommendation has a strong effect on the choice. We further find that the disclosure of <b>measurement</b> <b>categories</b> is negatively associated with the relative book value of financial assets measured at fair value. This finding suggests discretionary disclosure management by banks. We conclude, based on behavioral theory, that banks expect investors to have a negative bias in the risk perception of assets measured at fair value...|$|R

40|$|It is contended {{in a body}} of {{management}} accounting literature that financial performance measures are being rendered less relevant than non-financial measures {{in the management of}} companies. Such a management trend towards non-financial performance measures is particularly applicable to manufacturing companies due to the prevalence of technological change and customer-focused strategies. This cross-country empirical study ranks and categorizes financial and non-financial measures used by CEOs of manufacturing companies in a developed country, Australia, and a developing country, Mauritius. It also gives evidence of contingency and agency factors influencing the relative reliance of CEOs on such <b>measurement</b> <b>categories.</b> The analysis is confined to 24 quantitative measures (12 financial and 12 non-financial). Contingency and agency theories are invoked to consider the impact of production technology, perceived environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry on the CEOs' extent of use of financial and non-financial performance measures. Through data from a questionnaire survey of CEOs, drawn from Australian and Mauritian manufacturing companies, results reveal considerable differences between the countries in CEO's reliance on financial versus non-financial measures. Taking the combined countries' sample, factor analysis of CEO's usage patterns results in five categories of measures. Hypotheses about the impact of contingency and agency factors on these <b>measurement</b> <b>categories</b> are tested. These tests indicate that the extent of use of performance <b>measurement</b> <b>categories</b> by CEOs is driven to some extent by environmental uncertainty and technological change, but not by internal information asymmetry. <br/...|$|R

Current industry insight holds that programmable network processors are of lower performance than their hard-coded counterparts, such as Ethernet chips. This represents a roadblock to SDN adoption. In this paper we argue that contrast to the common view, the overhead of programmability is relatively low. We also argue that the apparent difference between programmable and hard-coded chips today is not primarily due to programmability itself, but because the internal balance of programmable network processors is tuned to more complex use cases. These arguments are backed with calculations and real-life <b>measurements.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

Therefore a new multifunctional thin film sensor system is in development. This multilayer system combines thermoresistive sensor structures with piezoresistive ones and exists out of wear resistant carbon based layers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

40|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of {{reporting}} choices when presenting and disclosing financial instruments under IFRS. Behavioral theory suggests that the label under which a financial instrument is presented affects the risk perception of investors. We analyze in an experimental setting how and why the reporting choices under IAS 39 and IFRS 7 affect an investor's risk perception. We find that companies presenting the fair value category are perceived to be of a particularly high risk but that the perceived risk decreases when investors learn that the fair value category does not contain derivatives. We conclude that investors cognitively view each <b>measurement</b> <b>category</b> to be representative for a certain type of financial instrument and that they base their risk evaluation on this representativeness heuristic. This conclusion is also suggested by the statistical association of the risk evaluation with behavioral variables describing how familiar an investor is with financial investments and how strongly he is aware of past negative outcomes of certain investments. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{the most}} rapidly growing {{economic}} entity in the world, China, a new logistics operation called the indirect cross-border supply chain model has recently emerged. The primary {{idea of this}} model is to reduce logistics costs by storing goods at a bonded warehouse with low storage cost in certain Chinese regions, such as the Pearl River Delta (PRD). This research proposes a performance measurement system (PMS) framework to assess the direct and indirect cross-border supply chain models.

Decision-making on the course of service quality improvement {{is based on the}} current status of the measurable service quality attributes. The aim of the paper is to describe the IT service quality attributes that could be measured to improve IT service quality. We report on a systematic literature review of IT service quality measurement. The review was based on 134 relevant journal articles related to IT service quality management. Of these, 91 articles were selected for analysis. We propose a detailed and comprehensive quality measurement framework for IT services using the results of the systematic literature review to extend previous work. The framework presents six common issue areas with their associated <b>measurement</b> <b>categories,</b> measures, and indicators. IT service providers can choose the measures to satisfy their specific information needs from the proposed IT service quality measurement framework.
