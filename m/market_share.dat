We identify a few stylised facts regarding the change in Frances <b>market</b> <b>shares,</b> relatively to that of the five other exporting countries considered: - In industrialized markets, the relative <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> are relatively well explained, in the structural model, by the industry-size and price-competitiveness effects.

Even if there is a general incentive to form a monopolistic cartel, BT was too small for it to be worth its while to join it; {{it is not necessary to}} exchange information directly to coordinate <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> and prices effectively; all partial cartels are unlikely. 2) We then considered that the non-uniform <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> are explained by the costs in Cournot competition which can be deduced from the observed <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> by assuming that the costs are kept the same when switching from Cournot competition to any form of cartel. We deduced that <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> cannot be other than stable and non-uniform; any monopoly is unlikely to come about, because FT has negative incentives to form a monopolistic cartel; no partial cartels of two operators are viable because at least one member would lose out.
