It sits in the saddle between Sierra Negra and its much larger companion Pico de Orizaba, also known as Citlaltépetl. Sierra Negra, a <b>minor</b> <b>flank</b> cone of that larger volcanic system, may now be extinct, but Pico de Orizaba ([URL] absolutely is not. It is dormant at best, having erupted as recently as 1846. To compound the issue, the photograph shows that the observatory site is built squarely in front of an obviously young lava flow. Now, I’m sure that site selection was done with due attention to natural hazards, but as long as astronomers insist on building expensive observatories on top of volcanoes, there needs to be clear understanding and common vocabulary between astronomers and geologists. “Extinct” is a troublesome word when applied to a volcano...|$|E
40|$|Chip {{control and}} tool wear {{estimation}} {{are two major}} concerns in automated machining systems. Chip control {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined part, the convenience of chip disposal, and possible power reduction; while tool wear estimation is vital to an effective tool change policy and quality control strategy, especially in finish-machining. This thesis first presents a new method for quantifying chip breaking and chip shapes with a fuzzy rating system, and further for predicting the chip breakability for arbitrary combinations of machining conditions through a fuzzy-set mathematical model. A predictive expert system for off-line assessment of machining performance, with chip control as a major criterion and due consideration to surface finish and power consumption, is then developed. A knowledge-based system for designing optimum chip breakers is set up with a criterion of efficient chip breaking at reduced power consumption. The method is based on the analysis of three-dimensional chip flow in oblique machining for a wide range of work materials, cutting conditions, tool geometries, chip breaker styles/sizes and restricted contact lengths. Experimental results of tool wear patterns in finish-machining show that estimation of more than one type of tool wear is required to assure the quality of a finished product. In order to achieve this, a dispersion analysis algorithm, derived from the established multivariate time series models, is used for the overall estimation of tool wear, including major flank wear, crater wear, <b>minor</b> <b>flank</b> wear and groove wear at the minor cutting edge. Finally, neural network techniques are used for modelling the dynamic interrelationship between the chip forming behaviour and different tool wear states. By integrating the developed methods for predicting chip breakability/shapes and for estimating comprehensive tool wear, the initially-predicted chip forming/breaking patterns can be updated with tool wear progression during the machining process through the use of neural network techniques. The results show that the methods developed in this thesis, for predicting chip breaking and shapes, and for evaluating machining performance, including chip control, surface finish and power consumption, m a y be used to form a basis for the off-line assessment of 2 ̆ 2 total machinability 2 ̆ 2 for automated machining systems. The strategy of comprehensive tool wear estimation provides a feasible means for on-line tool wear monitoring to assure product quality, especially under finish-machining conditions. The results also show that by using neural networks, chip forming behaviour with tool wear progression can be evaluated in-process, thus providing a feasible approach for achieving the on-line assessment of machining performance including chip forming patterns, surface finish and overall tool wear progression...|$|E

40|$|The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of {{progesterone}} receptor (PR) is bipartite {{containing a}} zinc module core that interacts with progesterone response elements (PRE), {{and a short}} flexible carboxyl terminal extension (CTE) that interacts with the <b>minor</b> groove <b>flanking</b> the PRE. The chromosomal high-mobility group B proteins (HMGB), defined as DNA architectural proteins capable of bending DNA, also function as auxiliary factors that increase the DNA-binding affinity of PR and other steroid receptors by mechanisms that are not well defined. Here we show that the CTE of PR contains a specific binding site for HMGB that is required for stimulation of PR-PRE binding, whereas the DNA architectural properties of HMGB are dispensable. Specific PRE DNA inhibited HMGB binding to the CTE, indicating that DNA and HMGB–CTE interactions are mutually exclusive. Exogenous CTE peptide increased PR-binding affinity for PRE as did deletion of the CTE. In a PR-binding site selection assay, A/T sequences flanking the PRE were enriched by HMGB, indicating that PR DNA-binding specificity is also altered by HMGB. We conclude that a transient HMGB–CTE interaction alters a repressive conformation of the flexible CTE enabling it to bind to preferred sequences flanking the PRE...|$|R
40|$|Tetraloop-receptor {{interactions}} are prevalent structural units in RNAs, and include the GAAA/ 11 -nt and GNRA-minor groove interactions. In this study, we have compiled {{a set of}} 78 nonredundant loop-helix interactions from X-ray crystal structures, and examined them for {{the extent of their}} sequence and structural variation. Of the 78 interactions in the set, only four were classical GAAA/ 11 -nt motifs, while over half (48) were GNRA-minor groove interactions. The GNRA-minor groove interactions were not a homogeneous set, but were divided into five subclasses. The most predominant subclass is characterized by two triple base pair interactions in the <b>minor</b> groove, <b>flanked</b> by two ribose zipper contacts. This geometry may be considered the "standard" GNRA-minor groove interaction, while the other four subclasses are alternative ways to form interfaces between a minor groove and tetraloop. The remaining 26 structures in the set of 78 have loops interacting with mostly idiosyncratic receptors. Among the entire set, a number of sequence-structure correlations can be identified, which may be used as initial hypotheses in predicting three-dimensional structures from primary sequences. Conversely, other sequence patterns are not predictive; for example, GAAA loop sequences and GG/CC receptors bind to each other with three distinct geometries. Finally, we observe an example of structural evolution in group II introns, in which loop-receptor motifs are substituted for each other while maintaining the larger three-dimensional geometry. Overall, the study gives a more complete view of RNA loop-helix interactions that exist in nature...|$|R
40|$|ETS {{transcription}} factors mediate a {{wide array}} of cellular functions and are attractive targets for pharmacological control of gene regulation. We report the inhibition of the ETS-family member PU. 1 with a panel of novel heterocyclic diamidines. These diamidines are derivatives of furamidine (DB 75) in which the central furan has been replaced with selenophene and/or {{one or both of the}} bridging phenyl has been replaced with benzimidazole. Like all ETS proteins, PU. 1 binds sequence specifically to 10 -bp sites by inserting a recognition helix into the major groove of a 50 -GGAA- 30 consensus, accompanied by contacts with the <b>flanking</b> <b>minor</b> groove. We showed that diamidines target the minor groove of AT-rich sequences on one or both sides of the consensus and disrupt PU. 1 binding. Although all of the diamidines bind to one or both of the expected sequences within the binding site, considerable heterogeneity exists in terms of stoichiometry, site–site interactions and induced DNA conformation. We also showed that these compounds accumulate in live cell nuclei and inhibit PU. 1 -dependent gene transactivation. This study demonstrates that heterocyclic diamidines are capable of inhibiting PU. 1 by targeting the flanking sequences and supports future efforts to develop agents for inhibiting specific members of the ETS family...|$|R
40|$|Factor XI (FXI) is the zymogen of FXIa, which cleaves FIX in the {{intrinsic}} pathway of coagulation. FXI {{is known to}} exist as a dimer and interacts with multiple proteins via its 4 apple domains in the “saucer section” of the enzyme; however, to date, no complex crystal structure has been described. To investigate protein interactions of FXI, a large random peptide library consisting of 106 to 107 peptides was screened for FXI binding, which identified a series of FXI binding motifs containing the signature Asp-Phe-Pro (DFP) tripeptide. Motifs containing this core tripeptide were found in diverse proteins, including the known ligand high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), {{as well as the}} extracellular matrix proteins laminin and collagen V. To define the binding site on FXI, we determined the crystal structure of FXI in complex with the HK-derived peptide NPISDFPDT. This revealed the location of the DFP peptide bound to the FXI apple 2 domain, and central to the interaction, the DFP phenylalanine side-chain inserts into a major hydrophobic pocket in the apple 2 domain and the isoleucine occupies a <b>flanking</b> <b>minor</b> pocket. Two further structures of FXI in complex with the laminin-derived peptide EFPDFP and a DFP peptide from the random screen demonstrated binding in the same pocket, although in a slightly different conformation, thus revealing some flexibility in the molecular interactions of the FXI apple 2 domain.

5000|$|The [...] (G.A.F.) {{attacked}} at 5:30 a.m. on 28 September, with 12 Belgian divisions, 10 British {{divisions of}} the Second Army and 6 French {{divisions of the}} Sixth Army {{under the command of}} King Albert I of Belgium with the French General Jean Degoutte as Chief of Staff. The British attacked without preliminary bombardment on a 4.5 mi front up to the Ypres-Zonnebeke road, from where the Belgian army attacked on a line north to Dixmude. The Allied attacks quickly penetrated the German defences and advanced up to 6 mi. The German defence was conducted by fewer than five divisions which were swiftly driven back. Much of the ground west of Passchendaele which had been abandoned during the withdrawal of early 1918 was recaptured. Rain began to fall but by the evening the British had taken Kortewilde, Zandvoorde, Kruiseecke and Becelaere; Belgian troops had captured Zonnebeke, Poelcappelle, Schaap Baillie and Houthulst Forest. On the southern <b>flank,</b> <b>minor</b> operations by three British divisions advanced to St.Yves, Messines and the ridge from Wytschaete to Hollebeke. Messines, Terhand and Dadizeele fell on 29 September and by 30 September, despite the captured ground becoming another slough, all of the high ground around Ypres had been occupied by the Allies. By 1 October the left bank of the Lys had been captured up to Comines and the Belgians were beyond a line from Moorslede to Staden and Dixmude. The advance continued until 2 October, when German reinforcements arrived and the offensive outran its supplies. Due to the state of the ground, 15,000 rations were delivered by parachute, from 80 Belgian and British aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a {{well known}} technique that is routinely used to investigate the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids. EPR requires incorporation of paramagnetic centers at specific sites, called site-directed spin labeling (SDSL). Spin labeling of nucleic acids {{can be carried out}} by two approaches, either by forming a covalent bond between spin label and the nucleic acid or by noncovalent binding of the spin label to the nucleic acid. This PhD dissertation is focused on advancing noncovalent and site-directed spin labeling (NC-SDSL) of nucleic acids. Our approach is based on ligand-receptor interactions, where the spin label binds to an abasic site of nucleic acids through formation of Watson-Crick base pairing with an orphan base on the opposing strand and pi- stacking interaction. A series of purine-based spin labels were prepared. Both 1, 1, 3, 3 - tetramethylisoindolin- 2 -yloxyl and 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine- 1 -oxyl (TEMPO) were conjugated with either the C 2 - or C 6 -position of the purines, yielding nitroxide derivatives of guanine, adenine or 2, 6 -diaminopurine. The binding of these spin- labeled purines to abasic sites in duplex nucleic acids was evaluated by EPR spectroscopy. The isoindoline-derived spin labels showed full binding to abasic sites in RNA duplexes and emerged as superior binders when compared to TEMPO-derived spin labels. The guanine-derived Ǵ bound fully to both DNA and RNA duplexes at lower temperature when paired with cytosine (C). Ǵ bound much more efficiently to RNA than DNA and showed even extensive binding at 20 °C (Kd = 6. 15 x 10 - 6 M). Adenine-derived spin label 28 was also bound fully at low temperature (- 30 °C) to abasic sites in both DNA and RNA duplexes when paired with T and U, respectively, but showed only minor binding at 20 °C (< 5 %). Thus, Ǵ and 28 allow noncovalent and site directed spin labeling of abasic sites in nucleic acids, using any of the pyrimidines as orphan bases on the opposing strand. The spin label that bound with the highest efficiency (Ǵ) was chosen to investigate further various aspects of noncovalent spin labeling. Ǵ was found to bind to abasic sites in DNA/RNA hybrids, either to the DNA- or the RNA-strand. Ǵ showed only a <b>minor</b> <b>flanking</b> sequence effect upon binding to abasic sites in RNA, with binding affinities within a factor of two of each other. For a given base on the 5 ’-end, the highest binding was observed when a U was on the 3 ’-side. When the abasic site was placed close to the duplex end, the affinity of the spin label was reduced, presumably due to the increased flexibility at base pairs {{in the vicinity of the}} duplex terminus. Abasic sites in the fourth position from the duplex end had the same affinity as abasic sites towards the middle of the duplex. A distance measurement between two spin labels was performed on a Ǵ- labeled 22 -mer RNA duplex using pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy in collaboration with Prof. Thomas Prisner (Goethe University, Germany). The PELDOR data showed a strong orientation dependence and a distance of 31. 3 ± 3. 5 Å, similar to the distance of ca. 29 Å, obtained by molecular modelling. The noncovalent binding of purine-derived spin labels to the DNA triplex containing one nucleotide gap as binding site in phosphate- as well as magnesium containing-buffer was also evaluated by EPR spectroscopy. The nitroxide connected to N 6 -position of purine (28 - 31) had less binding to triplex DNA (IV-VI), whereas Ǵ bound almost fully to the triplex DNA V and VI in magnesium containing buffer. This project was pursued in collaboration with Prof. Clemens Richert’s research group at University of Stuttgart, Germany who provided the triplex DNA motifs. Rafeindaspunalitrófsgreining (e. electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy) er vel þekkt aðferð sem er reglubundið beitt í rannsóknum á byggingu og hreyfingu kjarnsýra. EPR mælingar grundvallast á því að koma meðseglandi kjarna fyrir á ákveðnum stað innan kjarnsýra, þ. e. staðbundnum spunamerkingum (e. site directed spin-labeling, SDSL). Spunamerkingaraðferðin sem hér er lýst byggist á víxlverkun milli tengils og viðtaka, þar sem spunamerkið binst við basalausa stöðu (basaeyðu) í tvíþátta kjarnsýrum, annars vegar með Watson-Crick basapörun við staka basann á mótstæða strendingnum og hins vegar með pí-stöflun við aðliggjandi basa. Safn púrín-tengdra spunamerkja var útbúið með bæði 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetrametýlísóindólín- 2 -ýloxýl og 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetrametýlpiperidín-N-oxýl (TEMPO) merkihópum, sem voru tengdir inn á C 2 - eða C 6 -stöðuna á púríni. Þannig fengust nítroxíð afleiður gúaníns, adeníns eða 2, 6 -díamínópúríns. Tengigeta þessara spunamerktu púrína við basaeyðu í tvíþátta kjarnsýrum var mæld með EPR mælingu. Afleiður ísóindólín spunamerkjanna tengdust fullkomlega við slíkar eyður í tvíþátta RNA og mun betur en TEMPO afleiðurnar. Gúanín afleiðan Ǵ tengdist að fullu við bæði tvíþátta DNA og RNA við lágt hitastig, þegar hún var pöruð við sýtósín (C). Ǵ tengdist betur við RNA en DNA og sýndi jafnvel mikla bindingu við 20 °C (Kd = 6, 15 ∙ 10 - 6 M). Adenín-afleidda spunamerkið 5 sýndi einnig hámarks tengingu við lágt hitastig (- 30 °C) við basaeyðuna á tvíþátta DNA og RNA á móti T annars vegar og U hins vegar. Spunamerkið Ǵ var síðan valið til að rannsaka nánar ýmsa þætti spunamerkingar án samgildra tengja. Í ljós kom að Ǵ tengdist basaeyðum í DNA/RNA blendingum, annaðhvort við DNA- eða RNA strendinginn. Basarnir við hliðina á basalausu stöðunni höfðu aðeins lítil áhrif á tengingu Ǵ við eyðuna í RNA. Þegar slík eyða var staðsett nálægt endandum á tvíþátta kjarnsýrunni, minnkaði sækni spunamerkisins, væntanlega vegna aukins hreyfanleika basapara sem staðsett eru í nánd við endann. Fjarlægðamæling milli tveggja spunamerkja var framkvæmd á Ǵ-merktu tvíþátta RNA með notkun PELDOR (e. pulsed electron-electron double resonance) í samvinnu við Prof. Thomas Prisner við Goethe Háskólann í Frankfurt, Þýskalandi. PELDOR mælingarnar voru háðar innbyrðis afstöðu (e. orientation dependence) spunamerkjanna og gáfu fjarlægðina 31, 3 ± 3, 5 Å, sem reyndist í góðu samræmi við fjarlægðina í líkönum (29 Å).
