When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} similar sites along the Swahili Coast.

5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence <b>most</b> <b>attention</b> has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E

His career did not develop much further, and he had difficulty finding enough work late in his career. Kelly, who was prone to epilepsy, died {{in a hotel room}} in Canada following a seizure, aged 39.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the <b>most</b> <b>attention</b> to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E

5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's Futurist painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the <b>most</b> <b>attention</b> and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E
5|$|Stephen responded {{quickly to}} the revolts and invasions, paying <b>most</b> <b>attention</b> to England rather than to Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and {{resources}} from Boulogne, {{with the task of}} retaking the key port of Dover, under Robert's control. A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the Battle of the Standard. Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of Gloucestershire, first striking north into the Welsh Marches, taking Hereford and Shrewsbury, before heading south to Bath. The town of Bristol itself proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area. The rebels appear to have expected Robert to intervene with support, but he remained in Normandy throughout the year, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself. Dover finally surrendered to the Queen's forces later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Although pest insects {{attract the}} <b>most</b> <b>attention,</b> many insects are {{beneficial}} {{to the environment and}} to humans. Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species, they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate, which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture. As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants. This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity. This leads to an overall better environment. A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, orchard or greenhouse at bloom time. Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers. The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade established relationships between China {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
