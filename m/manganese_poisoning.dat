50|$|Nutrient {{processing}} {{is somewhat}} {{different from one}} forest to another. In the Gilbertiodendron forests there is low availability of nitrogen due to the low levels in the leaves that {{fall to the ground}} and the slow decomposition.

40|$|Abstract: Increased signal in T 1 -weighted images was {{observed}} in the experimental <b>manganese</b> (Mn) <b>poisoning</b> of the non-human primate and a patient with Mn neurointoxication. However, our study showed that the increased signals in magnetic resonance images (MRI) were highly prevalent (41. 6 %) in Mn-exposed workers. Especially 73. 5 % of the welders showed increased signal intensities. Blood Mn concentration correlated with pallidal index. These changes in MRI tend to disappear following the withdrawal from the source of Mn accumulation, despite permanent neurological damage. Thus increased signal intensities on a T 1 -weighted image reflect exposure to Mn, but not necessarily manganism. Our study also showed that the concentration of Mn required to produce increased signal intensities on MRI is {{much lower than the}} threshold necessary to result in overt clinical signs of manganism. Increased signal intensities in the globus pallidus were determined by Mn accumulation in the animal experiment. All these results strongly suggest that signal intensities in T 1 -weighted MRI reflect a target site dose in a biologically-based dose-response model. At which increase of signal intensity, the progression of manganism from Mn exposure occurs, however, remains to be solved...|$|R

Radioactive 54 Mn(II) {{was used as a}} tracer to measure the precipitation (binding and oxidation) of Mn(II) [i. e., the 54 Mn(II) trapped on 0. 2 -μm membrane filters] in the presence and absence of biological poisons. A variety of antibiotics, fixatives, and metabolic inhibitors were tested in laboratory control experiments to select poisons that did not interfere in the chemistry of <b>manganese.</b> The <b>poisons</b> were deemed suitable if (i) they did not complex Mn(II) more strongly than the ion-exchange resin Chelex 100, (ii) they did not interfere in the adsorption of 54 Mn(II) onto synthetic δMnO 2 (manganate), (iii) they did not cause desorption of 54 Mn(II) which had been preadsorbed onto synthetic manganate, and (iv) they did not solubilize synthetic 54 manganate. In addition, several known chelators, reducing agents, and buffers normally added to microbiological growth media or used in biochemical assays were tested. Most additions interfered to some extent with manganese chemistry. However, at least one inhibitor, sodium azide, or a mixture of sodium azide, penicillin, and tetracycline was shown to be appropriate for use in field studies of 54 Mn(II) binding. Formaldehyde could also be used in short incubations (1 to 3 h) but was not suitable for longer time course studies. The method was applied to studies of Mn(II) precipitation in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. Bacteria were shown to significantly enhance the rate of Mn(II) removal from solution in the manganese-rich particulate layer which occurs just above the oxygen-hydrogen sulfide interface in the water column...|$|R

40|$|Od 1949. - 1953. godine promatrano je 10 slučajeva profesionalnog manganizma u jednoj tvornici manganskih legura, gdje su radnici bili izvrgnuti manganskom dimu i prašini. Uz povremeno prekidanje rada sveukupna je ekspozicija trajala od 18 mjeseci do 12 godina. Klinička slika je odgovarala simptomima laganog parkinsonizma. Kod 2 radnika se intoksikacija manifestirala slikom hemiparkinsonizma: jedan od ta dva bolesnika pokazivao je i »pijetlov hod«. Kod jednog bolesnika nađeni su i simptomi lezije piramidnog puta, a kod drugog opet hemihipeslezija. Česti simptom bili su mišićni grčevi (krampi) i prisilni smijeh, dok je samo jedan bolesnik pokazivao prisilni plač. U krvnoj slici nađena je umjerena leukopenija (4. 200 - 4. 700 leukocita) kod 5 bolesnika. Funkcionalne jetrene probe dale su normalne nalaze. Biopsija jetre izvršena je kod 5 bolesnika.

Ten {{cases of}} occupational <b>manganese</b> <b>poisoning</b> having {{occurred in a}} plant producing manganese alloys (ferromanganese, spiegeleisen, silicomanganese and silicospiegel) are reported. All of these patients were engaged on the same work {{in which they were}} highly exposed to the inhalation of manganese are dust and manganese fumes. The manufacturing method of the plant is briefly described. The total length of exposure to manganese varied between 18 months and 12 years. The most prominent neurological signs corresponded to a mild form of parkinsonian syndrome, in two cases with prevailing unilateral manifestations. The main neurological features were disturbances of gait, present in all cases: patients gave a history of weakness in the legs (and some of them in the arms); the gait was found to be slapping and in one case the so-called »cock-walk« was observed; retropulsin and propulsion, masklike face. increased muscle tone. inconstant tremor of the hands and of extended tongue, disturbances in speech with palialic and slow, monotones voice, and micrographia were often noted. Nearly all patients complained of muscular cramps. Uncontrollable laughter less frequently weeping, were also noticed. Symptoms of the affection of the pyramidal tract were also seen in one patient and hemihypaesthesia in another. In blood picture only a slight leucopenia (4, 2 - 4, 7 WBC) in 5 patients was found. Liver function tests revealed no abnormalities. Liver biopsy performed in 5 cases showed no histological changes; in one of these, however a pigment which did not give positive iron reaction, was discovered in large quantities in liver tissue. Cerebrospinal fluid, examined in 8 cases, gave normal findings in 3 and slight abnormalities in others: globulin reactions were in one case clearly positive and in subsequent three slightly positive; in five patients there were small changes in mastix and collargol reactions. Pneumoencephalography was performed in two cases: there was a normal finding in one and a slight diffuse cerebral atrophy in the other. Six patient were submitted to electroencephalographic examination: one record was of explicity low voltage, another one exhibited an abnormality consisting of bursts of generalised medium voltage slow and fast activity; all older records were normal. Treatment with 2. 3 -dimcrcaplopropanol (B. A. L.) was tried in seven cases following the dosage which Thompson suggested for the treatment of hepatolenticular degeneration. ln another case pyridoxine was also tried.

The content of Mn examined in muscle of M. armatus was several folds higher than the maximum permissible limits (1.0 ppm) of Mn set by FAO/WHO (1989).
