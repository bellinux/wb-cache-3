40|$|Higher {{rates of}} uptake of dibasic acids by weak base anion {{exchange}} resins, {{in comparison to}} those of <b>monobasic</b> <b>acids,</b> have been satisfactorily explained {{on the basis of}} dual site adsorption of divalent anion on the protonated resin sites. Due to dual site sorption, divalent anions are strongly bound to the resin matrix, thereby neutralizing the positive charges on the protonated pore surface. Hence, there is practically no exclusion of co-ions from the pores of the resin. The extent of reversibility of sorption is considerably less as a result of less repulsion of H+ ions from the pore surface than that observed in <b>monobasic</b> <b>acids.</b> A theoretical model is developed and successfully validated using the experimental data of our work and those in the literature on batch sorption dynamics of sulfuric acid on weak base resins...|$|R

40|$|Differences in acid {{separation}} behaviour on {{weak base}} {{ion exchange resins}} have been investigated in this work. Experimental data has been obtained on sorption equilibrium using various types of weak base resins and both inorganic and organic <b>monobasic</b> <b>acids.</b> A detailed analysis has been presented using the experimental data of present work and also that reported in the literature. Apart from acid concentration and type of acid, other factors such as resin type and basicity are also discussed.

For resins with medium and weak basicity, large variation in the sorption capacity with concentration was observed. A new theoretical approach incorporating effect of resin basicity has been proposed and examined qualitatively and quantitatively using the sorption data.

With the aid of these various equations the occurrence of several plateaus in the polarisation curves of unbuffered and buffered solutions has been discussed. Furthermore equations have been derived for the current density and the overvoltage at the inflexion points of the curves. Applying the theory to some actual solutions, it has been calculated that the presence of the hydrogen sulphate ion in acidic and neutral sulphate solutions causes a considerable increase in the current density at the inflexion point of the curve.

We show that the pH-dependence of any property of HnA is also represented by the sum of one-site titration curves, characterized by these same titration constants. Since one such property is the degree of dissociation of one of the dissociating groups, a fraction of each group shows each of the various titration pK values, so that the group partitions among them. The n groups therefore share the same n titration pK values but differ in the fractions belonging to each. The one H+ ion per molecule that titrates with each pK is thus made up of the fractions, one from each group, that share this pK value. A group may possess a single pK value, in that it contributes virtually all of this pK and almost nothing to the others, only if either (1) in titrates in a different pH range from the other groups or (2) its affinity for H+ is unaffected by their ionization state...|$|R

Comparison of amino <b>acids</b> {{around the}} <b>monobasic</b> cleavage sites {{suggests that these}} cleavages follow certain sequence motifs and {{can be described as}} the rules that govern monobasic cleavages: (i) a basic amino acid it present at either 3, 5, or 7 amino acids N-terminal to the cleavage site, (ii) hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, or methionine) are never present in the position C-terminal to the <b>monobasic</b> amino <b>acid</b> at the cleavage site, (iii) a cysteine is never present {{in the vicinity of the}} cleavage site, and (iv) an aromatic amino acid is never present at the position N-terminal to the <b>monobasic</b> amino <b>acid</b> at the cleavage site. In addition to these rules, the monobasic cleavages follow certain tendencies: (i) the amino acid at the cleavage site tends to be predominantly arginine, (ii) the amino acid at the position C-terminal to the cleavage site tends to be serine, alanine or glycine in more than 60 % of the cases, (iii) the amino acid at either 3, 5, or 7 position N-terminal to the cleavage site tends to be arginine, (iv) aromatic amino acids are rare at the position C-terminal to the <b>monobasic</b> amino <b>acid</b> at the cleavage site, and (v) aliphatic amino acids tend to be in the two positions N-terminal to and the two positions C-terminal to the cleavage site, except as noted above. When compared with a large number of sequence containing single basic amino acids, these rules and tendencies are capable of not only correctly predicting the processing sites, but also are capable of excluding most of the single basic sequences that are known to be uncleaved. Many or these rules can also be applied to correctly predict the dibasic and multibasic cleavage sites suggesting that the rules and tendencies could govern endoproteolytic processing at the monobasic, dibasic and multibasic sites...|$|R

40|$|Thermo- and chemo-thermo-mechanical pulping induce {{different}} chemical {{changes in}} wood {{leading to the}} formation of different water soluble compounds like mono- and oligosaccharides, <b>monobasic</b> <b>acids</b> such as formic and acetic acid. Moreover, simple reactive compounds like formaldehyde and furfural are also formed. The paper focuses on the influence of removing water soluble compounds from thermo-mechanical and chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps on some bonding relevant chemical properties of fibres such as pH-value, buffering capacity towards alkali and consequently on the properties of the boards made therefrom. The results of comprehensive investigation reveal that removal of water soluble compounds from thermo-mechanical pulps made from beech wood increase their pH-value, decrease their alkaline buffering capacity and their formaldehyde emission. Moreover, it impairs the internal bond strength of boards made by using acid curing resins like UF- and MUF-resins. On the contrary, washing out the fibres made by thermo-mechanical pulping enhance their bondability towards alkaline curing binders such as phenol-formaldehyde (PF) and tannin-formaldehyde (TF) resins. The formaldehyde release as well as the release of volatile organic acids from the boards decreases enormously due to removal of water soluble compounds from thermo-mechanical pulps used for PF- and TF-boards. Chemo-thermo-mechanical pulping (CTMP) deacetylates wood to a much higher extent than thermo-mechanical pulping. The CTMP-process leads to fibres of higher wettability and accessibility towards bonding by PF-, TF-resins and PMDI binders. Therefore, CTMP-pulps are predestined for making moisture resistant boards. Nevertheless, washing out chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps also improves their bonding behaviour and leads to boards with much higher mechanical strength and lower formaldehyde emission than that of boards made from unwashed fibres. This applies for boards made from beech and pine wood...|$|R

Recently, we have shown that these chelators are highly cytotoxic, but show selective activity against cancer cells. Particularly interesting was the fact that cytotoxicity of the HPKIH analogues is maintained even after complexation with Fe. To understand the potent anti-tumor activity of these compounds, we have fully characterized their chemical properties. This included examination of the solution chemistry and X-ray crystal structures of both the ligands and Fe complexes from this class and the ability of these complexes to mediate redox reactions. Potentiometric titrations demonstrated that all chelators are present predominantly in their charge-neutral form at physiological pH (7. 4), allowing access across biological membranes. Keto-enol tautomerism of the ligands was identified, with the tautomers exhibiting distinctly different protonation constants. Interestingly, the chelators form low-spin (diamagnetic) divalent Fe complexes in solution. The chelators form distorted octahedral complexes with Fe-II, with two tridentate ligands arranged in a meridional fashion. Electrochemistry of the Fe complexes in both aqueous and non-aqueous solutions revealed that the complexes are oxidized to their ferric form at relatively high potentials, but this oxidation is coupled to a rapid reaction with water to form a hydrated (carbinolamine) derivative, leading to irreversible electrochemistry. The Fe complexes of the HPKIH analogues caused marked DNA degradation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. This observation confirms that Fe complexes from the HPKIH series mediate Fenton chemistry and do not repel DNA. Collectively, studies on the solution chemistry and structure of these HPKIH analogues indicate that they can bind cellular Fe and enhance its redox activity, resulting in oxidative damage to vital biomolecules...|$|R

Both peptides are synthesized as larger precursors containing paired basic and <b>monobasic</b> amino <b>acids</b> at their processing sites, which upon cleavage generate either somatostatin- 14 or - 28, respectively. In some species of fish two distinct, but homologous, precursors (prosomatostatin-I and -II) give rise to somatostatin- 14 and - 28, respectively. Whereas anglerfish prosomatostatin-II was previously shown to release exclusively somatostatin- 28, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteolytically matures the homologous prosomatostatin-I precursor to somatostatin- 28 and - 14 as well as to a lysine-extended form of somatostatin- 14. The Kex 2 endoprotease appears to be essential for the formation of lysine somatostatin- 14 and is involved either directly or indirectly in the release of mature somatostatin- 14. The isolation of yeast mutants defective in somatostatin- 28 expression (sex mutant) allowed the cloning of a non-essential gene, which encodes an aspartyl protease, whose disruption severely affects the cleavage of mature somatostatin- 28 from both somatostatin precursors.

The increased histamine release is not due to a qualitative change in the time course of histamine release, is not the result of increased histamine formation, and cannot be attributed to an effect on the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The enhancement seems to be due to potentiation of some step activated by the antigen-antibody interaction and common to both the release of histamine and slow reacting substance. The structural configuration required for a dibasic acid to enhance the anaphylactic reaction in guinea pig lung is quite specific; the carboxyl groups should be separated by a two carbon chain, and must be free or fixed in the cis position. The <b>monobasic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> from valeric to dodecanoic inhibit the anaphylactic release of histamine, and the concentration needed to produce 50 per cent inhibition decreases with increasing chain length. The introduction of a polar group, amino or carboxyl, into the hydrocarbon residue diminishes or abolishes inhibitory capacity. The inhibition produced by the fatty acids is neither due to calcium binding nor due to prevention of effective antigen-antibody interaction; the fatty acids probably inhibit by acting on an antigen-antibody-activated step. The inhibition of the anaphylactic release of histamine and slow reacting substance produced by caproic or decanoic acid can be reversed by the enhancing effect of succinic acid, and vice versa. Thus, compounds normally present in mammalian tissue can greatly influence the intensity of the in vitro anaphylactic reaction in the guinea pig...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{filamentous}} fungi are saprophytes and they secrete {{a wide spectrum}} of enzymes to degrade their complex substrates. Many secreted proteins enter the secretory pathway as proproteins and need some form of proteolytic processing before they obtain their mature active state. As described in this thesis we have cloned the genes encoding two proteases involved in such proteolytic processing events occurring in the secretory pathway of Aspergillus niger. In addition, we have characterized both proteases. We have cloned kexB and characterized the kexin maturase. KexB matures by hydrolysation of propeptides from proproteins and {{plays an important role in}} the processing of proteins produced in the secretory pathway of A. niger. We found that A. niger strains with a disrupted kexB gene have a hyper-branching morphology at pH 6 (Chapter 3). This morphology is pH dependent, because at pH 4 there are no apparent morphological differences between the kexB disrupted strain and wild-type A. niger. KexB is a modular protein (Chapter 2). In addition to a subtilisin­like protease domain, which in yeast functions in the late Golgi, KexB contains a transmembrane domain and putative cytoplasmic Goigi retention signal. To enable a biochemical characterization of KexB a truncated soluble secreted form of the protease was constructed, by removal of the C­terminal transmembrane domain and Goigi retention signal. (Chapter 3). Using fluorogenic substrates we were able to show that this soluble form of KexB can efficiently process both dibasic and <b>monobasic</b> amino <b>acid</b> cleavage sites. This is in remarkable contrast to Kex 2, the KexB homo log of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which only cleaves dibasic amino acid cleavage sites efficiently. Furthermore we have demonstrated that KexB is responsible for the in vivo processing of endopolygalacturonase I, and is a likely candidate for processing of endopolygalacturonase 11. Both enzymes are naturally secreted by A. niger and enter the secretory pathway as proproteins. We have also cloned dapB and characterized A. niger DapB, a possible ortholog of S. cerevisiae DPAP A (Chapter 4). DPAP A is a Goigilocated exoprotease, which plays a role in the processing and activation of secreted proteins. DP AP A is a type IV dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPP IV). Phylogenetic analysis showed that DapB is part of a novel subfamily of DPP IV proteases in filamentous fungi with a transmembrane domain. DPPIV proteases remove dipeptides at the N-terminus with an alanine or proline residue at the penultimate position. We were able to confirm the DPP IV­like activity of DapB by overexpression of the protease, resulting in 5 to 7 times higher DPPIV like activity on artificial substrates in cell extracts from DapB transformants. Although we could predict the presence of a transmembrane domain, we were not able to determine the location of the mature protease. Currently we do not know whether DapB plays a role in protein maturation. DapB is a proline specific protease. Currently not much is known about the role of proline residues in the protection and regulation (delay of activation) of enzymes produced. by filamentous fungi. However in other organisms proline is often found at the termini of secreted enzymes to protect against exoprotease activity. To make a study into the role of proline in protein degradation and regulation feasible we have started with the identification and characterization of proline specific proteases In addition to the A. niger kexB and dapB genes, we have cloned pepP and characterized the proline specific dipeptidase (PepP) of Aspergilllus nidulans (Chapter 5). Publicly available EST sequences of A. nidulans led to the identification and cloning of the prolidase encoding gene of this fungus. A prolidase overexpressing A. nidulans strain was constructed. The protease purified from such an overexpressing strain was used for a biochemical characterization of the protein. The protein is a manganese 2 + dependent metallo protease and in vitro cleavage studies showed that it only hydrolyses dipeptides with aC-terminal proline residue. DapB, the A. niger DPP IV protease releases such dipeptides from the N­terminus of a polypeptide chain. In summary, we have cloned the kexB gene and characterized the A. niger endoprotease KexB. KexB removes the propeptide of proteins traveling through the secretory pathway. In addition, we have cloned dapB and characterized the A. niger exoprotease DapB, a possible ortholog of S. cerevisiae DP AP A. DP AP A also plays a role in the maturation of proteins. Furthermore, the A. nidulans prolidase gene has been cloned and PepP characterized. PepP is a proline specific dipeptidase, its substrates are dipeptides like those released by DapB. With our research we have gained insight into proteolytic processing in the secretory pathway of Aspergillus niger, and more specifically we have obtained detailed knowledge about propeptide processing of proproteins destined for secretion...|$|R
