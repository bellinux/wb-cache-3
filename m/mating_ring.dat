40|$|Ring springs are {{frictional}} devices {{consisting of}} {{inner and outer}} ring elements assembled to form a spring stack. External load applied to the spring produces sliding action across <b>mating</b> <b>ring</b> interfaces. Large amounts of energy, as much as 60 - 70 % of the total cycle energy, may be absorbed in overcoming frictional forces. This thesis details the characteristics and dynamic behaviour of ring spring systems and describes the design and testing of a seismic isolation system that uses ring springs. Initially the characteristics and fundamental dynamic behaviour of single-degree-of-freedom mass/ring spring systems are studied. This study uses a model based upon the non-linear force/deflection characteristics of the ring spring. A prototype ring spring cartridge that enables dynamic inputs {{to be applied to}} a ring spring was then designed and subjected to short duration shock excitation. Experimental results are compared with those given by computer simulation and are seen to be in good agreement. Ring springs have been identified as suitable devices for use in earthquake-resistant structures. A particularly attractive candidate for use of ring springs is in protecting columnar structures during earthquakes. To enable further study, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was developed. So that computational analyses of these systems could be undertaken, the ring spring model has been incorporated within the computer program RUAUMOKO. Dynamic analyses using RUAUMOKO show that pivotal rocking isolation systems can significantly reduce structural loads during short period type earthquakes. Subsequently, a pivotal rocking seismic isolation system was designed and manufactured. Shaker table tests were then carried out on the rocking system for a range of earthquake inputs. The experimental results show that for columnar structures with fundamental periods in the range of dominant spectral accelerations, structural loads can be significantly reduced during short period type earthquakes. Experimental results compare well with those given by computer simulation, thus confirming the effectiveness of the isolation system. The work outlined in this thesis has established a basis from which further research can be undertaken. The pivotal rocking seismic isolation system developed has potential application to protecting a wide range of columnar structures during short period type earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{relationship}} between inelastic deformation and energy dissipation in structures that are subjected to earthquake ground motions. Thus, if seismic energy dissipation {{can be achieved by}} means of a separate non-load bearing supplementary damping system, the load bearing structure can remain elastic with continuing serviceability following the design level earthquake. This research was carried out to investigate the advantages of using added damping in structures. The control system consists of passive friction dampers called ring spring dampers installed in the ground floor of the structure using a tendon to transmit the forces to the other parts of the structure. The ring springs dampers are friction devices consisting of inner and outer ring elements assembled to form a spring stack. External load applied to the spring produces sliding action across <b>mating</b> <b>ring</b> interfaces. The damping forces generated by the dampers and transferred in the supplemental system to the structure by the tendon and horizontal links oppose the internal loads. A four storey-two bay steel frame structure was used in the study. Experimental and analytical studies to investigate the effectiveness of a supplemental control system are presented. The model was subjected to a series of earthquake simulations on the shaking table in the Structural Laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department, at the University of Canterbury. The earthquake simulation tests have been performed on the structure both with and without the supplemental control system. The earthquake simulations were a series of gradually increasing intensity replications of two commonly used earthquake records. This thesis includes detailed description of the structural model, the supplemental control system, the ring springs dampers and the data obtained during the testing. Analyses were then carried out on a twelve storey framed structure to investigate the possible tendon arrangements and the size and type of dampers required to control the response of a real building. Guidelines for determining the appropriateness of including a supplemental damping system have been investigated. The main features of the supplemental control system adopted in this research are: • It is a passive control system with extreme reliability and having no dependence on external power sources to effect the control action. These power sources may not be available during a major earthquake. • Ring springs are steel friction devices capable of absorbing large amounts of input energy. No liquid leakage can occur and minimal maintenance is required for the ring spring dampers. • With a damper-tendon system, the distribution of the dampers throughout the structure is not so critical. Only one or two dampers are used to produce the damping forces needed, and forces are then transferred {{to the rest of the}} building by the tendon system. • It is a relatively inexpensive control system with a long useful life...|$|E

The first is where the geometry of the cross section is selected so that thermal radial taper of both the primary and <b>mating</b> <b>rings</b> {{is essentially the same}} so that the faces remain parallel at various operating conditions. The second is where one of the rings is made axially very short so that it becomes radially self-aligning.

Wear profiles show that the seal readily contacts across the entire face width test data shows that the zero-net seal design has very low leakage in a water environment. The seal has been tested for more than a thousand hours and has been shown to give reliable and consistent performance. The zero-net face seal is expected to give longer, low-leakage life in field service than conventional rigid designs. The zero-net seal is now ready for field testing...|$|R
40|$|The new ARES {{space flight}} program has {{presented}} many challenges to aerospace engineers and designers.

40|$|Females mated to {{attractive}} {{males are}} predicted to produce male-biased broods. Previous studies on zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which colored leg rings {{were used to}} alter male attractiveness, support this hypothesis. However, because molecular sexing techniques were not available, it was not known when during development this bias arose. Also, because both attractive (red-ringed) and unattractive (green-ringed) males were within the same aviary, assortative mating between treatments may have confounded the results. Using two different experimental designs, we tested whether the sex ratio of zebra finch eggs and chicks differed in response to paternal ring color whilst controlling for assortative mating between treatments. In the aviary experiment, birds could interact socially, but all males in an aviary had the same leg ring color. In the cage experiment, each female was randomly assigned a red- or green-ringed mate, thus also eliminating assortative mating within treatments. Offspring were sexed based on plumage or using a molecular method. The sex ratio at laying did not differ between treatments in either the aviary (n = 313 eggs) or cage (n = 151 eggs) experiments, suggesting that female zebra finches do not manipulate the primary sex ratio in response to their <b>mate's</b> <b>ring</b> color.

40|$|Lecturepg. 31 Dual {{mechanical}} seals are operated on pressurized barrier fluid systems when the pump product properties {{do not support}} reliable single seal operation. This provides added protection against environmental release of the pumped product. Traditionally, many dual seal arrangements for pressurized barrier fluids consisted of two standard rotating flexible unit single seals mounted in a back to back orientation. Reliability concerns with the traditional designs include component unseating due to pressure reversal, inadequate provisions for heat removal, and collected debris causing damage to the inboard seal faces. The draft version of API 682 specifies standard pressurized barrier fluid dual seal designs (API 682 Arrangement 3) with two rotating elements and two <b>mating</b> <b>rings</b> in series (tandem arrangement). In addition, it includes design provisions for flush arrangements and component design to prevent unseating due to pressure reversals. The successful design and test validation of two dual seal series designs is described. One design is of the multiple spring type rotating flexible element (API 682 Type A), and one design uses a rotating welded metal bellows (API 682 Type B) with 0. 008 in thick heavy plate construction.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the film stiffness of dry gas seal, and keep a low leakage rate at the same time, {{a great deal of}} numerical and experimental study on groove structure and parameter optimization of DGS under varying operation conditions have been carried out. The effect of geometry parameters of groove, such as spiral angle, groove-dam ratio and groove depth, on the performance of a S-DGS, such as opening force, film stiffness, leakage rate and stiffness-leakage ratio, are numerically analyzed by Zirkelback et al. [8], Liu et al. [9], Peng et al. [10]. The optimum structural parameters of groove with different objective functions in different operating conditions are presented. In recent years, the effect of groove structural optimization on performance improvement of DGS has attracted more and more researchers’ attention because the limitation of performance enhancement by optimum design of groove geometry parameters of S-DGS simply. Recently, a parametric study and performance evaluation of typical bidirectional dry gas seals with modified surface were presented by Su et al. [11, 12] and Blasiaka and Zahorulko [13]. Hashimoto and Ochiai [14 – 16] presented an entirely new optimum design methodology, in which the groove geometry can be flexibly changed by using the spline function, {{to maximize the}} stiffness of gas films for grooved thrust bearings. The film stiffness and load-capacity of the optimized bearing are higher than that of common spiral groove bearing and herringbone bearing, which were both theoretically and experimentally verified. The sealing performance of the spiral groove DGS with an inner annular groove (AS-DGS) [17] was numerically analyzed by Peng et al. [18], which was invented by Flowserve Corporation. The results show that the opening force and film stiffness of AS-DGS is larger than that of the common S-DGS at the condition of low-speed and high-pressure, while the leakage is a little larger. Dresser-Rand Corporation presented a patented pattern of short grooves in combination with the longer grooves to provide excellent lift-off effect and optimum gas film stiffness at low speed as well as high speed. During operation, the short grooves could create obvious high pressure to separate the <b>mating</b> <b>rings</b> at slow speed, while the longer grooves contribute to creating a stable gas film between the two rings at high speed. The uni-directional V groove with the combined radial-circumferential tapered groove bottom [19], which was invented by Burgmann Corporation, causes a reduction in the opening force and leakage rate. Despite that there are only few researchers pay attention to the experiment of the sealing performance test of DGS, most of the researchers only focus on the numerical simulation and analysis of groove structure and geometry parameters optimization as the subject to improve the gas film stiffness and reduce the fluid leakage of DGS.|$|R
