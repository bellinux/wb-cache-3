40|$|Introduction: Bipolar vessel-sealing devices (VSDs) have {{advantages}} in urological surgeries (less hemorrhage, shorter operating time). However, these instruments can cause thermal injuries, which {{can result in}} neural damage and necrosis. The objectives {{of this study were}} to establish a reproducible in vitro model for standardized assessment of electrosurgical devices and to evaluate whether optimized placement of surgical instruments can reduce the thermal spread. Methods: We evaluated thermal spread of two VSDs in vitro using thin bovine muscle strips. Thermal injury was measured using an infrared camera, temperature probes and histology. The recordings were made with the VSD alone and with a rectangular clamp next to the VSD. Results: Both instruments showed a significant temperature spread of 2. 5 mm lateral to the VSD. The placement of a <b>metal</b> <b>clamp</b> next to the VSD significantly reduced the temperature spread. Histological examinations were able to underline these findings. Conclusions: In this study we describe a straightforward clinically relevant in vitro model for the evaluation of future electrosurgical instruments. We demonstrated that the thermal spread of VSD could be further reduced by optimized placement of an additional surgical instrument. Our results could help surgeons protect sensitive structures like nerves {{in the vicinity of the}} VSD...|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} used in surgery for spinal deformity has progressed rapidly in recent years. Commonly used fixation techniques may include monofilament wires, sublaminar wires and cables, and pedicle screws. Unfortunately, neurological complications can occur {{with all of}} these, compromising the patients’ health and quality of life. Recently, an alternative fixation technique using a <b>metal</b> <b>clamp</b> and polyester belt was developed to replace hooks and sublaminar wiring in scoliosis surgery. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the pull-out strength of this new construct with sublaminar wiring, laminar hooks and pedicle screws. Forty thoracic vertebrae from five fresh frozen human thoracic spines (T 5 – 12) were divided into five groups (8 per group), such that BMD values, pedicle diameter, and vertebral levels were equally distributed. They were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate and anchored with metal screws and polyethylene bands. One of five fixation methods was applied to the right side of the vertebra in each group: Pedicle screw, sublaminar belt with clamp, figure- 8 belt with clamp, sublaminar wire, or laminar hook. Pull-out strength was then assessed using a custom jig in a servohydraulic tester. The mean failure load of the pedicle screw group was significantly larger than that of the figure- 8 clamp (P =  0. 001), sublaminar belt (0. 0172), and sublaminar wire groups (P =  0. 04) with no significant difference in pull-out strength between the latter three constructs. The most common mode of failure was the fracture of the pedicle. BMD was significantly correlated with failure load only in the figure- 8 clamp and pedicle screw constructs. Only the pedicle screw had a statistically significant higher failure load than the sublaminar clamp. The sublaminar method of applying the belt and clamp device was superior to the figure- 8 method. The sublaminar belt and clamp construct compared favorably to the traditional methods of sublaminar wires and laminar hooks, and should be considered as an alternative fixation device in the thoracic spine...|$|E
40|$|U radu se analiziraju izvorni fragmenti portretne stele otkrivene godine 1826. na zapadnoj salonitanskoj nekropoli te se uspoređuju s prikazima u crtežima, napose onim kojeg je izradio dubrovački slikar Rafael Martini. Temeljem oblikovnih i strukturalnih karakteristika utvrđuje se tipološka pripadnost stele i definira njezina grupa u Saloni i bližoj okolici. Zaključuje se kako je riječ o grupi od pet stela s tzv. prekinutim zabatom i portretnom školjkom, nastaloj prihvaćanjem italskoga oblika koji je vrlo rano uveden u repertoar salonitanskih radionica, a potom je postupno doživio značajne transformacije i na kraju drukčiju tipizaciju. Na taj je način nastala prepoznatljiva lokalna shema u funkciji skupne prezentacije. Za vrijeme izrade predmetne stele predlaže se razdoblje od kraja Tiberijeva do početka Klaudijeva doba. In 1826, at the Salona 2 ̆ 7 s western necropolis, {{next to the}} Lollius family mausoleum, K. Lanza {{discovered}} a funerary stele showing portraits of five diseased persons (Archaeological Museum in Split inventory number D 2). It was published by his son, Frane (Francesco), in 1856, in the book Monumenti Salonitani inediti. Its publishing brought no details on the circumstances {{and the state of}} the find. It is only stated that the stele is made of lime stone, that it shows five busts in low relief, below lions, and that it is of a medium quality. Presented is also a drawing made by an unknown author, but of quite generalised details (Fig. 1). There is another, much better, drawing of the stele (Fig. 2), kept in the Archaeological Museum in Split. It is made by the painter of Dubrovnik, Nikola Rafael Martini (1771 - 1846), one of the best known representatives of the Neo-Classicistic painting in Dalmatia and a renowned portraitist of his time. The drawing is a superb document of development of technical (graphic) documentation of the time, but also of Martini 2 ̆ 7 s activities in general, because not many of his works have been preserved. The quality of the drawing is allowing us to watch details of the monument that have been destroyed almost out of recognition in the meantime. Namely, due to numerous relocations of the Museum and its collections and their inadequate storing, occasionally even in former salt warehouses, the stele was heavily damaged already {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century. This is why it has not been placed in the newly built Museum 2 ̆ 7 s lapidary, but its remains have been placed, and then even lost, in its back courtyard. In the early 1970 s, a photograph was made showing its upper part (Fig. 3), and during the recent arranging of the courtyard both it parts were {{discovered a}}gain (Figs. 4, 5). They have never been analysed or published. The smaller (upper) part (Fig. 4) demonstrates two original dimensions of the stele: 0. 82 m in width, and 0. 40 m in thickness. Traces of the monument 2 ̆ 7 s original structure are better visible in the 1970 s photograph (Fig. 3). Autopsy, however, shows the portraits to be made of about a half life size of an adult person, wherefore there is no doubt that the figures shown are of a boy and a girl, their heads slightly turned towards each other. Comparison with the drawings (Figs. 1, 2) shows the external form and all elements of internal composition of the upper part of the stele to be presented exactly and in adequate format. The details seen in the drawings - especially the one by Martini - that are not preserved on the very monument, are lateral acroteria, shaped like lions, and the base of the central one, a smaller figure of a winged erot in the area below the gable and the shell, a beam with two fascias and peak profile, and architectural apparatus presented at both sides. Preserved is only a remain of the central base shaped like a smaller canal for the <b>metal</b> <b>clamp</b> that fixed the element that was placed here (Fig. 6). The distribution of the figures by sex corresponds to that in the lower field. The girl is undoubtedly shown palliata, and the boy, depending on the status, could be wearing both a pallium and a toga, probably the latter (toga praetexta?). The larger fragment shows in traces preserved half-figures of three adult deceased, and belonges to the former lower part of the stele (Fig. 5). If now the amorphous piece is compared with the drawings (Fig. 1, 2), it is noticed that it is structurally well positioned into the monument as a whole, particularly well being presented the deceased persons portraits and habitus. The drawings in the centre show a middle aged man (Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing), to his right side being a younger woman, and far left a younger man. In the Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing the men 2 ̆ 7 s heads are presented slightly turned towards the woman, this posture also being marked by shading the eyes. The rest of the relief is supporting such posture. It is reasonable to assume that on the right are shown portraits of spouses and parents to at least some of other figures. The woman is shown palliata (Fundilia or Eumachia type). The men wear identically draped cloaks over tunics, however here too a certain identification of the toga is lacking the umbus. Mild bending of the drapes above the central man 2 ̆ 7 s arm may indicate that this element was envisaged but, due to the height of the image, not made. If this is so, this would be the most frequent early imperial type of toga, with balteus, umbus and sinus, but covering the right shoulder. In the Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing, between the two fields, clearly visible is a deeper cut in which there are two plates by their position appearing like consoles (Fig. 2). Such details not being known of in the portrait stelai of Salona, but also wider, this is probably a hidden indication that at the moment the drawing was made the stele was already broken into two pieces. It is possible that it was discovered in this condition. This supports the assumption that the different ways of showing the frame also result from a reconstruction made in a typically romantic-neo-classicistic way. Anyway, the Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing is presenting a more complete situation, the other one already showing deterioration of some parts (central and left acroteria, seated erot). According to the external form and the internal composition, this Salonitan stele belongs to the architectonic type, and the variant thereof known as the aedicula-form stelai with interrupted (open) gable. It is conceived as a flat imitation of large tomb aediculae and similar structures without an architrave. Its distant origin is in the Hellenistic east, whereas the origin of the type with integrated shell within the niche canopy is certainly in the northern Italy. It was developed with the only intention to carry the portraits of the deceased, because it has not been noticed among plain, inscription, stelai. The aedicula-form stelai with interrupted gable appear in two variants in Dalmatia. In the first variant, in the gable area inserted is a niche canopy sheltering one portrait of half-figure height. The transition from the niche into the canopy is usually marked with a moulded beam, whereas the very niche can be added a moulded arch in front. In the other variant, in the niche and gable space integrated is a portrait shell. It is also found in single portrait stelai (Fig. 7), but much more often as representative background of a pair of portraits. So far, four such stelai are known of, as many as three of them certainly from Salona: the fragment with the head of an older man from the last decades of the 1 st century BC (here no. 1, Fig. 8), the stele of the Attius family of the late Claudian or Neronian periods (no. 2, Fig. 10), and the stele that is being discussed here (no. 5). Possibly of Salnitan origin is also the stele shown in the drawing kept in the State Archives in Turin from the mid 1 st century (no. 3, Fig. 9), whereas the stele of Marco Pytha, a soldier of the 2 nd cohort Cyrrhestarum, and his freedman, Felix, dated to the early Flavian period, was discovered in Gornji Rakićani near Gardun (no. 4, Fig. 11). The above listed stelai make a homogenous and by their origin almost closed group of monuments, created in the period from the very end of the 1 st century BC till the Flavian period. It is reasonable to claim that this visual expression appeared and developed in Dalmatia within the Salonitan workshop circle. The portrait shell motif will appears occasionally also later, in the 2 nd and the 3 rd centuries, but obviously as a retardation of this, at that time already outmoded, element, often within a newly designed composition and with a changed role or orientation of the shell. The assumed north-Italic origin of the stele type with interrupted gable and portrait shell can be proved by the facts that the actual architectural characterisation of Hellenistic stelai in Dalmatia is practically unknown of, and that they do not practice the interrupted gable. Hence the conclusion that the interrupted gable with the inserted niche and shell was introduced as a significant novelty in the beginning of the Roman provincial style. Since in the northern Italy (especially in Altinum) relatively numerous exact typological comparisons have been found, a reasonable assumption is that this was the source of this form. A more detailed analysis shows that Italic samples and solutions were not automatically adopted in the Salonitan workshops repertoire, but that they underwent significant modifications. The links between the stelai of the two Adriatic shores are evident in the overall proportions, interior structure of the aedicula, function of the shell and distribution of the human figures. The differences are in designing of the architectural apparatus, the way in which the gable is positioned on top of it, orientation of the shell and appearance of the inscription field. In the north-Italic stelai, the load bearing architectonic apparatus is formed of pilasters or columns, but most often of pilasters, sometimes with vegetative decoration. In Dalmatia, however, these are helical columns (the only exception is the stele dealt with here!). Furthermore, stelai in Dalmatia have only one tier of supports, whereas in Italy they often have a second (back) tier. In the north-Italic stelai, the gable is laid directly on capitals, whereas in the Dalmatian ones between the capital and the gable normally visible are ends of an interrupted architrave, manifested as one or two straight stripes. Only in the stele of M. Pytha, that is the youngest one, the architrave ends remained hidden behind the capitols. On the Apennine side of the Adriatic, the shell is almost always positioned with its back side (heart) upwards, whereas all the stelai of the Dalmatian group and the stele of M. Pytha are characterised by the shell being turned with its back side down. It is to be pointed out that the Salonitan stelai too show this practice of the opposite side of the Adriatic, but only where this is about individual presentation! Finally, in the Dalmatian stelai the inscription field is conceived as a separate field that supports the aedicule, whereas in the Italic ones the inscription seldom has a moulded edge and is subordinate to the architecture! This makes it evident that Salonitan workshops developed a recognisable style of their own, aimed to group presentation. Although at the first sight they apear very much like the north-Italic stelai (especially those from Altina and Aquilea) and obviously are making a branch of the same developmental tree, the Salonitan, architecturally designed, stelai with interrupted gable and shell - including the stele of M. Pytha - are of a different make and typology. Male portraits with short hair falling to the forehead indicate general fashion characteristics of the Julian-Claudian period, but have nothing in common with the Neronian period fashion. Hairstyle of the girl in the upper field (Mittelscheitelfrisur) and the similar but more sumptuous hairstyle of the woman in the lower field, with the hair waves reaching down half the ears (Wallenfrisur) and the spirally formed locks (presented as long braids) make characteristics of women fashion of the Tiberian period. However, in the Salonitanian sculptural heritage they are also reflected in monuments until and including the Claudius 2 ̆ 7 principate. Since their promoters, Antonia Minor and Agripina Minor, were honoured also during the Caligula 2 ̆ 7 s and the Caludius 2 ̆ 7 principates, and since with the older woman in the stele 2 ̆ 7 s lower field two such massive locks can be recognised on each side of the neck, of the length and direction comparable to the Claudian creations, it appears reasonable dating the stele to the period from the end of the Tiberian to the early Claudian principates. In Dalmatia, however, numerous female heads with this hairstyle type are known, dated from the 20 s to the 50 s AD. This proposed dating is supported also by the possibility of noticing some worn out independent locks above the woman 2 ̆ 7 s left ear, but this is not perfectly certain. Important is also the fact that leaf-shaped decoration of columns in the Salonitan sculptural heritage appears most rarely, and one of such examples, potentially directly comparable, is the stele of Q. Fabius Pacatus, a soldier of the 11 th legion C. p. f., obviously created after the year 42 AD...|$|E

Armazi II is noted for a temple with an apse. Armazi III is the richest layer constructed of elegantly cut stone blocks, joined together with lime mortar and <b>metal</b> <b>clamps.</b> Among the surviving structures are the royal palace, several richly decorated tombs, a bathhouse and a small stone mausoleum.|$|R
