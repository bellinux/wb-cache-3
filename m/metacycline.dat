40|$|Isolation of doxycycline, 6 -epidoxycycline and 2 -acetyl- 2 -decaboxamidometacycline from {{commercial}} <b>metacycline</b> {{was achieved by}} preparative column liquid chromatography on silica gel, previously impregnated with edetate (EDTA). Careful control of the pH of EDTA allowed fine tuning of the separation. The mobile phases were composed of dichloromethane, methanol and. 1 mM EDTA at pH 9. 0 or 6. 0. Structures were confirmed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The presence of doxycycline and its 6 -epimer in commercial <b>metacycline</b> has not previously been described. The presence of the 2 -acetyl derivative was not surprising since analogous 2 -acetyl derivatives {{have been identified in}} other tetracyclines. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Isocratic column liquid {{chromatography}} on poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) copolymer allowed complete separation of <b>metacycline,</b> 4 -epimetacycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and 6 -epidoxycycline. 2 -Acetyl- 2 -decarboxamidometacycline was eluted {{on the tail}} of <b>metacycline.</b> The mobile phase was 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol- 0. 2 M phosphate buffer (pH 9. 0) - 0. 01 M sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (pH 9. 0) -water (2. 5 : 10 : 10 : 77. 5, m/v/v/v). The flow-rate was 1. 0 ml/min and detection was performed at 254 nm. Official standards were compared {{and a number of}} commercial bulk samples and specialties were analysed. 2 -Acetyl- 2 decarboxamidometacycline, 6 -epidoxycycline and doxycycline were the main impurities, while 4 -epimetacycline and oxytetracycline were minor impurities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) method {{involving}} UV and fluorescence densitometry {{is described}} for the assay and purity control of <b>metacycline.</b> With a mobile phase dichloromethane-methanol-water (58 : 35 : 7, v/v/v) and a silica gel thin-layer, previously sprayed with 10 % sodium edetate solution adjusted to pH 9. 0, all the potential impurities of <b>metacycline</b> were well {{separated from the}} main component and from each other. Results obtained with UV densitometry (TLC-UV) and fluorescence densitometry (TLC-F) were compared with those obtained by a liquid chromatography (LC) method using a poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) stationary phase. The correlation coefficients (r) for TLC-UV and LC or TLC-F and LC were better than 0. 9999. For TLC-UV the relative standard deviation (RSD) for the assay of the main component was less than 2 %, for TLC-F less than 3. 0 % and for LC less than 1. 0 %. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The serine proteinase tissue-type {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) and the metalloproteinase gelatinase B (MMP- 9) {{have recently}} been demonstrated in MS lesions. Both enzymes are interconnected in an enzyme cascade which contributes to destruction of the blood brain barrier and demyelination and both enzymes are inhibited by D-penicillamine. <b>Metacycline</b> was shown in in vitro experiments to inhibit gelatinase B. The combination of peroral D-penicillamine plus <b>metacycline</b> was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled way in two groups of 10 patients suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The major objectives of this pilot trial were to examine the safety of this combination {{and the possibility of}} blinding, while the effect on disease progression was considered as a secondary endpoint. Over a follow-up period of 1 year and in this selected patient group, there was no significant improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale score (EDSS) as compared with that of the placebo-control group. Toxicity was too high to consider additional trials with this combination of metalloproteinase inhibitors. Although peroral treatment is by most MS patients acknowledged as a major improvement in treatment compliance, one has to await the development of more selective and efficacious protease inhibitors than those used in the combination therapy described here. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Tetracycline {{possesses}} a great tendency to form complexes {{with a number}} of chemical species, particularly with Eu(3 +) ions. in this work we investigate the europium optical properties of three tetracyclines europium complexes: <b>Metacycline</b> (MTc), Oxytetracycline (OTc), and Chlortetracycline (CTc), in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide (HP). the results show that the emission band of EuOTc have enhancement in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A calibration curve was shown for this complex with the best molar ratio obtained.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} dissociation constants of tetracycline antibiotics in acetonitrile-water binary mixtures {{is very important}} for several separation techniques such as liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis that use these solvent mixtures. In this study, the pKa values of five tetracyclines (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline and <b>metacycline),</b> have been determined in water and acetonitrile-water binary mixtures (10 %, 20 % and 30 % (v/v)) by potentiometry and liquid chromatography (LC). The obtained results show a similar trend for the pKa 1 values of five tetracycline antibiotics as they increase with increasing concentration of organic modifier, which allows a linear relationship between pKa 1 values and mole fraction of acetonitrile to be obtained. The pKa values obtained in aqueous medium have been compared with the values predicted by the SPARC on-line pKa calculator...|$|E
40|$|Doxycycline is a semi-synthetic broad {{spectrum}} antibiotic with improved serum half-life. Potential impurities are 4 -epidoxycycline, 6 -epidoxycycline, 4, 6 -epidoxycycline, <b>metacycline</b> and 2 -acetyl- 2 -decarboxamidodoxycycline. Method {{development has been}} undertaken to investigate the potential of capillary electrophoresis {{for the analysis of}} doxycycline. The influence of buffer type, buffer pH and concentration was systematically examined, then that of capillary temperature and applied voltage.

40|$|Thin layer chromatographic (TLC) {{methods are}} {{described}} for rapid and simple {{control of the}} purity of chlortetracycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, <b>metacycline,</b> oxytetracycline, and tetracycline. The methods are based on those previously developed for the identification and quantitative assay of tetracyclines. The stationary phase is silica gel, previously sprayed with 10 % disodium EDTA solution adjusted to pH 8. 0 or 9. 0. The mobile phase is dichloromethane - methanol - water water (59 + 35 + 6, v/v) or (60 + 35 + 5, v/v). After development the plates are dipped in a 30 % solution of liquid paraffin in hexane and inspected under UV light at 365 nm. The fluorescence is stable {{for long periods of}} time. The detection method is sensitive (< 0. 05 %) and the method is suitable for rapid control of purity, e. g. in the pharmacy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A CE {{method for}} <b>metacycline</b> (MTC) {{determination}} {{was investigated in}} an inter-laboratory experiment. Many problems were encountered in this study, {{most of which were}} related to the transfer of the method to different CE equipment. The reported problems could be classified into different categories: problems related to the precision, to the parameters in the protocol, and to the MTC peak shape. As the peak shape problem was partially responsible for the poor precision, a new CE method was developed in order to obtain a good MTC peak shape on all equipment. The precision of this new method for MTC determination was examined in an intermediate precision study, where the influence of the factors "time" and "equipment" was investigated. Although the new method could be transferred to different instruments, the precision remained poor mainly due to the contributions of the between-replicate and the between-injection variances.

40|$|The {{development}} and validation of an optimized capillary electrophoresis method for {{the determination of}} <b>metacycline</b> {{in the presence of}} its related substances by capillary electrophoresis is shown. The influence of methanol as organic modifier, buffer pH, buffer concentration, capillary length, column temperature, Triton X- 100 and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin was investigated. A central composite design was performed in order to optimize the method. The optimal separation conditions were: uncoated fused-silica capillary (39 cm total length, 31 cm effective length, 50 microm ID); as background electrolyte a solution of 160 mM sodium carbonate and 1 mM EDTA (pH 10. 35) /methanol (89 : 13 v/v); temperature, 15 degrees C; voltage, 12 kV. The method showed good selectivity, repeatability, linearity, and sensitivity. The limits of detection and quantitation are 0. 024 % and 0. 06 %, respectively, relative to a 2. 5 mg/mL solution. Six commercial samples were analyzed quantitatively. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} nonisotopic solution assay for gelatinases and inhibitors {{was developed}} using biotinylated gelatin as enzyme substrate. In this assay, residual biotinylated substrate is sandwiched between avidin-coated plates and streptavidin-peroxidase and is quantified by the peroxidase reaction. This assay was useful for measuring gelatinase activities and defining {{the activities of}} gelatinase inhibitors. When 23 tetracycline analogues were compared, significant differences in gelatinase B inhibition were found between various compounds. 4 -epioxytetracycline base, 4 -epichlortetracycline, meclocyclinesulfosalicylate, and unmodified <b>metacycline</b> and minocycline {{proved to be the}} most potent gelatinase B (EC 3. 4. 24. 35) inhibitors. The gelatinase B inhibitory activity of tetracyclines was clearly dissociated from their antimicrobial activity. The effect of high-molecular-weight inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies, was also demonstrable in the microtiter plate assay. In view of the pathophysiological function of gelatinases, the definition of gelatinase inhibitors with known efficacy, safety, and side effects is crucial for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Particular tetracyclines fulfil these criteria and the described assay is useful for defining other gelatinase-inhibiting lead compounds. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} oxytetracycline (OTC) in nasal secretions of healthy pigs after intramuscular injection of OTC at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg bodyweight, an original method based on ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) {{was developed and}} fully validated. Sample preparation consisted in protein precipitation preceded {{by the addition of}} a releasing protein reagent. <b>Metacycline</b> (MTC) was used as internal standard. Separation was carried out at 65 degrees C in the gradient elution mode on a short analytical column filled with Acquity BEH C(18) stationary phase. The mobile phase consisted in a mixture of water and acetonitrile containing 1 mM of oxalic acid and 0. 1 % (v/v) of formic acid. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode; OTC and MTC were detected using multiple reaction monitoring. The pre-study and in-study validation of this bioanalytical method was performed by applying a novel strategy based on total measurement error and accuracy profiles. The maximum risk of observing future measurements falling outside the acceptance limits during routine as well as the measurements uncertainty were also estimated. Peer reviewe...|$|E
