40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{framework}} to identify all the feasible disassembly sequences for a <b>multi-component</b> <b>product</b> and to find an optimal disassembly sequence, according to specific criteria such as cost, duration, profit, etc. Design/methodology/approach - Taking into account topological and geometrical constraints of a product structure, an AND/OR disassembly graph is built. Each graph node represents a feasible subassembly. Two nodes i and j are connected by an arc (i,?j), called a transition, if the subassembly j can be obtained from the subassembly i by removing one or several connectors. Constraint programming approach is used to generate the feasible subassemblies and related transitions. Findings - If a cost zij is incurred to perform a transition (i,?j), an optimal disassembly sequence can be generated for a given subassembly, using the shortest path algorithm or a linear programming model. Research limitations/implications - The proposed approach performs very well compared to other approaches published in the literature, even when applied to products requiring parallel disassembly and including a large number of parts. Practical implications - This approach has been successfully applied to assess the wheelchair maintainability at the design stage and will be implemented in CAD systems. One other application, regarding the disassembly process and total revenue maximization for product recycling, is now under consideration.

40|$|Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Bestimmung der ökologisch optimalen Nutzungsdauer von Produkten und ihren Komponenten. Um ein genaues Bild über die ökologisch optimale Nutzungsdauer von verschiedenen Produkten mit unterschiedlichen Merkmalen und Komplexitätsgraden zu gewinnen, wird daher ein Modell entwickelt, welches die optimale Nutzungsdauer produkttypenspezifisch bestimmt. Das Modell basiert auf einem progressiven Optimierungsprozess, in welchem sich die Berechnung auf das bereits existierende Produkt bezieht, und auf der ökologischen Break-even-Point Analyse der Substitution. Dadurch wird das Problem des festgelegten Betrachtungszeitraums vermieden, der das Ergebnis beeinflussen könnte. Für die Modellentwicklung werden Determinanten der ökologisch optimalen Nutzungsdauer ermittelt und ihre Wechselwirkungen quantitativ beschrieben. Aufgrund der vier erfassten unterschiedlichen zeitlichen Verläufe der produktspezifischen Umweltbelastung in Abhängigkeit von der Nutzungsdauer (konstant, linear, exponentiell, konkav) werden entsprechend vier Produkttypen hergeleitet, die eine differenzierte Bestimmung der ökologisch optimalen Nutzungsdauer erfordern. Die vier Produkttypen werden sowohl als Mono- als auch als Multibaugruppen-Produkte betrachtet, so dass die baustrukturbezogene Produkteigenschaften in das Modell heranfließen. Im Gegensatz zu Monobaugruppen-Produkten unterteilen sich die Multibaugruppen-Produkte in austauschbare Baugruppen. Die Multibaugruppen-Produkte werden über vier Baugruppentypen charakterisiert, die den einzelnen Produkttypen entsprechen. Im Modell für Monobaugruppen-Produkte wird mit Modellgleichungen bestimmt, wann ein nur wenig komplexes Gut komplett durch ein neues optimal substituiert werden sollte. Im Modell für Multibaugruppen-Produkte wird die ökologisch optimale Nutzungsdauer von komplexen Produkten aus der Produkt-, Baugruppen- und Systemperspektive betrachtet. Das Beispiel der Waschmaschine, die ein Multibaugruppen-Produkt repräsentiert, belegt, dass bei geringer innovationsbedingter Reduzierung der produktspezifischen Umweltbelastung eine Substitution des gesamten Produktes ökologisch nicht sinnvoll ist. Hingegen kann die Umweltbelastung durch eine Optimierung aus der Baugruppen- oder Systemperspektive reduziert werden. The goal of {{this thesis}} is the {{determination}} of the optimal ecological lifetime of products and their components. In order to get an exact picture of the optimal lifetime of products with different characteristics and complexity, a model determining the product type specific optimal ecological lifetime is developed. The model is based on a progressive optimization process, in which the calculation refers to the already existing product, and on the ecological break-even-point analysis of substitution. This avoids the problem of the fixed calculation period known to influence the results. For the model development, determinants of the ecologically optimal lifetime are investigated and their interactions quantitatively described. The dependency between the product specific environmental impact and the product life time was found to be well-described through four different behaviours: constant, linear, exponential and concave. This resulted in the development of four different product types, each requiring specific calculation to assess the optimal ecological lifetime. The four product types are regarded as products consisting of one component (mono-component product) or multiple components (<b>multi-component</b> <b>product),</b> so that the product structure characteristics are included in the model. Unlike mono-component products, multi-component products are made of exchangeable components. Multi-component products are characterized with four component types corresponding to four product types. The model for mono-component products calculates the optimal ecological time to replace a relatively simple product by a totally new one. The model for multi-component products determines the optimal ecological lifetime from three different perspectives: the product, component and system perspective. The application case of the washing machine, that represents a <b>multi-component</b> <b>product,</b> demonstrates that if innovation causes only a small reduction of the product specific environmental impact, the substitution of the entire product is ecologically unreasonable. However, the environmental impact could be reduced through a component or system perspective optimization...|$|E

40|$|In idea sketches, {{there are}} a number of {{ambiguous}} shapes. Designers will associate and transform some shapes into others (Liu, 1993). Then, they evaluate these shapes in terms of functions and design requirements, furthermore, they would have generated other shapes that certified the design requirements (Huang, 1999). However, not only is the idea of design composed of one element, but also consisted of varied components. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how designers generate ideas of multi-component products, and to simulate this phenomenon by neural networks. At the same time, this paper attempts to study the design cognitive behaviour of idea-generating stages, and explores the designers'cognitive phenomenon. Therefore, there are two stages in this paper: First, I conduct a cognitive experiment to realize how designers generate the <b>multi-component</b> <b>product</b> and acquire the sketches that designers generated.  Second, I train the neural networks to simulate the behaviour of idea generation and explore the cognitive phenomenon in design sketches. As a result, networks associate one shape that trained before, and then generate a complete idea.  This phenomenon is similar to the cognitive behaviour of designers who saw the ambiguous shape as one shape, which was retrieved from LTM. Moreover, the neural network is examined by a rectangle, which is totally different from the training patterns.   The network will associate a confused shape. But the network will associate different shapes by adjusting some critical parameters. Designers can generate variable shapes from one shape, but the signal neural network can't simulate this kind of behaviour. On the contrary, this paper proposes five sequential networks to generate variable shapes from the same shape and simulates how designers develop ideas. ...|$|E

One of the motives for the crea-tion of such methods is the "Resource saving" of technological equipment developers intellectual work. Possibilities {{of implementing}} of such approaches are {{largely due to the}} successes in the field of neuro-computers, allowing to some extent to simulate intelligent processes of the human brain that allows you to use not only the original data to create a new model of equipment but a developer's existing experi-ence in this field in solving the tasks given. Such methods are of particular relevance for the develop-ment of equipment for food productions. But often it is due to poor "number" of certain parameters specified in designing. The method used for simulation allows analysis in a subjective evaluation of empirical data and the absence of a clear numerical form of the result, which is typical in development of new food types. Especially clearly the advantages of these systems are shown in designing <b>multi-component</b> food <b>products,</b> where the uncertainty of input and output parameters is high, and quality is assessed by sensory analysis. The advantage of the model is also the possibility of its obtaining in the selection of a minimum set of regularities.

The research reported in this thesis {{is focused on the}} creation of a CAE system to support Reverse Engineering. It is centred around the computational representation of products (Product Model) and manufacturing capabilities (Manufacturing Model). These models are essential for modem and future software systems aimed to assist the design process, enabling data sharing among the participants who use various computational tools. Reverse Engineering is employed as a particular context and motivation for exploring the application of the models. The research builds on the achievements of the recently finished Model Oriented Simultaneous Engineering System (MOSES) project, undertaken jointly by Leeds University and the Department of Manufacturing Engineering of Loughborough University. MOSES' work on information modelling was analysed and combined together with the original proposals of the author to elaborate a suitable support to Reverse Engineering, applicable to redesign in general. A process for Reverse Engineering is proposed and documented and a data model driven CAE system to support it is specified. The CAE system includes a Product Model, a Manufacturing Model and two software application environments. The Product Model of the system is based on the information requirements of the Reverse Engineering process and is suitable for representing <b>multi-component</b> <b>products,</b> from different perspectives through its life cycle.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{research}} {{is to develop a}} test rig for ceramic-lined steel pipes production by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) technique or combustion synthesis (CS). SHS is an advanced approach for production high temperature materials including refractory materials, intermetallics, and cermets. SHS process is characterized by extremely fast heating rates, high temperatures, and short reaction times. The products of SHS process are usually porous. Therefore, densification is one step of dense material processing. One of the methods of densification is employing centrifugal force to produce ceramic lined steel pipes and functionally graded materials (FGM). The centrifugal force is the main parameter in combustion of powder reactants and melts formation. It facilitates phase separation of <b>multi-component</b> <b>products</b> during the process. In this research the SHS-centrifugal machine is fabricated to produce ceramic-lined steel pipes from (Fe 2 O 3 +Al) mixture. Fe 2 O 3 and Al powders were mixed based on reaction stoichiometry. The process is based on thermite reaction of Fe 2 O 3 and Al under centrifugal force to produce Al 2 O 3 ceramic in the inner-most layer and molten Fe that diffuses in the steel pipe. The complete combustion reaction was occurred at a distance of 20 - 30 mm from the head of the pipe to produce two layer ceramic lined steel pipes with a complete phase separation and structure formation. Multilayer phase and structure formation, followed by phase separation occurred in this process. Products were characterized by XRD, SEM, LOM, EDX and micro-hardness. Two and three layers formed inside the steel pipe in various points of the product. Vickers Hardness on the inner-most surface measured reached up to 26 times greater than micro-hardness of a typical pipe.

Knowledge of the microstructure and its relation to water mobility is necessary to develop stable products. This paper describes a study that uses X-ray microtomography (XRT) for the characterisation and visualisation of the 3 D structure of crackers with different porosity, coated biscuit shells and soup inclusions. XRT was used for imaging the inner cellular structure of the cereal matrix or to analyse the integrity of moisture barriers applied on the cereal product. 3 D image analysis methods were developed to obtain quantitative information about the cellular matrix which can be used as input for simulation models for moisture migration. The developed 3 D image analysis method maps the open cellular structure onto a network (graph) representation in which the nodes correspond to the pores and the vertices to the pore-to-pore interconnection. The pores (nodes) have properties such as volume, surface area and location whereas the vertices have properties such as direct (open connection) and indirect (separated by a single lamella) area. To check the segmentation and network description a model for pore to pore resistance was used.

However, few researches on the quality control have been conducted to interpret the holistic characteristics of the traditional medicine in terms of dissolution/release. In this study, the multi-component release kinetics of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) dosage forms was characterized and mapped by multivariate analysis techniques {{in the field of}} “-omics”. The Liuweidihuang pill was used as a model formulation. The multi-component release kinetics of the concentrated and water-honeyed Liuweidihuang pills at rotation speeds of 50 and 100 rpm were analyzed by chemomic release kinetic theory and modified LC/MS/MS method. Mass features of 103 (concentrated pills) and 101 (water-honeyed pills) were selected with a linear correlation coefficient ≥ 0. 99 between mass responses and concentrations. To compose the chemomic standard spectrum, the relative abundance of both mass features was no less than 1 % as compared with an internal standard. The correlation coefficients between six samples of various solutions were in line with analytical requirements of precision (r≥ 0. 985). The score plots of principal component analysis showed that the concentrated Liuweidihuang pills presented better chemomic release reproducibility than the water-honeyed pills. Conversely, the impact of rotation speed on the chemomic release was less obvious. The heat maps of hierarchical clustering analysis did not show significant changes in individual clusters of mass features along different time intervals, reflecting the release integrity of the mass features. Therefore, both multivariate analysis methods, the principal component analysis and the hierarchical clustering analysis, seemed to be effective techniques to demonstrate the multiple component release performance of TCM.

The Moon is rich in mineral resources, but it is almost devoid of chemical reducing agents, therefore, molten oxide electrolysis is ideal for extraction, since the electron is the only practical reducing agent. MOE has several advantages over other extraction methods. First, electrolytic processing offers uncommon versatility in its insensitivity to feedstock composition. Secondly, oxide melts boast the twin key attributes of highest solubilizing capacity for regolith and lowest volatility of any candidate electrolytes. The former is critical in ensuring high productivity since cell current is limited by reactant solubility, while the latter simplifies cell design by obviating the need for a gas-tight reactor to contain evaporation losses as would be the case with a gas or liquid phase fluoride reagent operating at such high temperatures. Alternatively, MOE requires no import of consumable reagents (e. g. fluorine and carbon) as other processes do, and does not rely on interfacing multiple processes to obtain refined products. Electrolytic processing has the advantage of selectivity of reaction {{in the presence of a}} <b>multi-component</b> feed. <b>Products</b> from lunar regolith can be extracted in sequence according to the stabilities of their oxides as expressed by the values of the free energy of oxide formation (e. g. chromium, manganese, Fe, Si, Ti, Al, magnesium, and calcium). Previous work has demonstrated the viability of producing Fe and oxygen from oxide mixtures similar in composition to lunar regolith by molten oxide electrolysis (electrowinning), also called magma electrolysis having shown electrolytic extraction of Si from regolith simulant. This paper describes recent advances in demonstrating the MOE process by a joint project with participation by NASA KSC and MSFC, and Ohio State University and MIT. Progress in measuring cell efficiency for oxygen production, development of non reacting electrodes, and cell feeding and withdrawal will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWithin {{the scope}} of the PhD thesis “Continuous dynamic mixing of {{cohesive}} powders” (V. Kehlenbeck, TU Munich, 2006) a new approach of applying Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was developed to study the mixing performance of powder mixers. For the in-line use of a BRUKER FT-NIR spectrometer in a continuous GERICKE powder mixer an attachment to clean the probe tip of the spectrometer with compressed air was developed. In parallel, this prototype was optimised for the in-line application in a batch mixer from LÖDIGE as well as for an automatic and dust-free off-line analysis of powder samples in a self-developed apparatus. Besides the in-line applications, the FT-NIR spectrometer was also used to analyze samples taken from a batchwise working PRODIMA mixer. For two-component powder mixtures (calcium carbonate and maize starch) {{it has been shown that}} FT-NIR spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study powder mixing processes in batch and continuous mixers as well as for the in- and off-line determination of the mixer performance. Due to the risk of encrustation, the complex calibration and the missing robustness of the calibration method as well as the analytical device, the academic findings were so far not applied to the production of bouillon <b>products</b> (<b>multi-component</b> mixes with powders and liquids). In the framework of a Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative the use of NIR spectroscopy for an industrial application will be studied...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} <b>multi-component</b> and multi-technology <b>products,</b> firms {{are obliged to}} seek {{knowledge}} for new product development (NPD) from external sources. Supplier firms are one such external source. The thesis aims {{to contribute to the}} development of a theory on supplier involvement in new product development (NPD) by advancing understanding of the motives and conditions for the utilization of supplier information and knowledge in the fuzzy front end (FFE) of NPD. The term ‘fuzzy front end’ (FFE) refers to the activities that the firm undertakes prior to a NPD project. The FFE ends when the NPD project is launched, or rejected. The FFE of NPD is information intensive: it requires seeking, accessing and selecting different types of information from both internal and external sources. Previous research focused mostly on the external source of consumers and how ideas from consumers can lead to the generation of new product concepts. By comparison, the suppliers’ contribution to the FFE of NPD has received less attention. The thesis examines the exchange and utilization of supplier information and knowledge at the micro-social level of the firm between the individuals who work in the FFE of NPD. Three functional areas have been selected for the study, namely: (Design) Engineering and Purchasing of the customer firm and Sales Engineering of the supplier firm.

The CCC column {{was used as the}} first dimensional isolation and a preparative ODS column operated in reversed-phase (RP) mode as the second dimension. The CCC was operated at a controlled flow rate to ensure that each fraction eluted within one hour, corresponding to the isolation time of the 2 nd dimensional preparative HPLC. The eluent from the 1 st dimensional CCC was diluted using a makeup pump and trapped onto holding column, before been eluted and transferred to the 2 nd dimensional HPLC. The performance of the holding column was evaluated, in terms of column size, dilution ratio and diameter-height ratio, as well as system pressure, for the solution to the issue of online trapping of low pressure eluent from a CCC column. Satisfactory trapping efficiency and tolerable CCC pressure can be achieved using a commercially available 15 mm x 30 mm i. d. ODS pre-column. The present integrated system was successfully applied in a one-step preparative separation of 12 compounds, from the crude methanol extract of venom of Bufo bufo gargarizans. Compounds 1 - 12 were isolated in overall yield of 1. 0 %, 0. 8 %, 2. 0 %, 13 %, 2. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 1. 9 %, 3. 6 %, 6. 1 %, 4. 8 %, 3. 5 % and 4. 1 %, with HPLC purity of 99. 9 %, 99. 7 %, 90. 6 %, 99. 9 %, 77. 0 %, 99. 9 %, 90. 4 %, 99. 9 %, 52. 0 %, 99. 9 %, 99. 3 %, and 85. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|Vaccines {{are complex}} <b>multi-component</b> <b>products,</b> {{in which an}} interdependent {{relationship}} among constituents exists: the concomitant inclusion of antigens, adjuvants, and excipients is essential to guarantee {{the efficacy of the}} final product. The selection of adjuvants and formulation criteria is a fundamental aspect, having implications towards efficacy, safety and stability of vaccines. In this field, the work was aimed at the design, formulation and characterization of novel vaccines suitable for intradermal delivery and able to induce earlier onset of immune response as well as more potent and longer lasting immune responses in comparison to conventional vaccines. With this purpose two different model antigens were used to evaluate the intradermal route as immunological target for vaccination: MenC-CRM_ 197 glycoconjugate and CRM_ 197 protein (detoxified diphtheria toxin). Moreover different adjuvants were tested to potentiate and modulate the immune responses towards a desired quality profile. The impact of adjuvant-antigen conjugation on immune response against the antigen was investigated in comparison to the adjuvant/antigen co-delivery. For the first time, the intradermal delivery was evaluated as route for the administration of a MenC-CRM_ 197 glycoconjugate vaccine. LT mutant (LTK 63), MPL (TLR 4 a), Toll like receptor 7 agonist (TLR 7 a), αGalCer analog, Dectin- 1 receptor agonist (β-(1 - 3) glucan hexasaccharide) and an oil in water (o/w) emulsion have been chosen to target the skin-resident antigen-presenting cells and to enhance the immune response against the antigen. The in vivo evaluation of such novel formulations provided encouraging results with respect to quantity, quality and functionality of the induced immune responses. Notably, the intradermal delivery of MenC-CRM_ 197 glycoconjugate showed superiority in term of immunogenicity and serum bactericidal titers compared to the intramuscular administration, highlighting the power of the intradermal route for glycoconjugate vaccine delivery. Moreover, the addition of LTK 63, TLR 4 a, TLR 7 a, αGalCer analog adjuvants allowed the reduction of the number of doses administered and especially LTK 63, TLR 4 a, TLR 7 a adjuvants were able to modulate the quality of the immune response towards a more beneficial, for the model antigen used, Th 1 response. No adjuvant effect was observed when formulations were combined with (β-(1 - 3) glucan hexasaccharide. When MenC-CRM_ 197 +TLR 4 a formulation was intradermally delivered in combination with the o/w emulsion adjuvant no additional improvements in immunogenicity were observed in comparison to the single adjuvant effect. The immune system activation was also investigated using a protein model antigen 〖(CRM〗_ 197) intradermally; however no improvements in term of immunogenity were observed in comparison to the intramuscular administration. This finding has specified the interest in selecting a glycoconjugate antigen to exploit the advantages of the intradermal route in terms of immunogenicity. To further investigate the role of adjuvant and to ensure codelivery of adjuvant/antigen, the conjugations of TLR 7 a to the glycoconjugate model antigen have been investigated. Two different approaches were developed: the conjugation of TLR 7 a to MenC polysaccharide and to CRM_ 197 carrier protein. When the conjugation of TLR 7 a to CRM_ 197 carrier protein was tested in vivo, results clearly showed that conjugation of the TLR 7 a enhances the anti-carbohydrate response. This effect was less pronounced than after co-administration of a commercial glycoconjugate with a standard dose of TLR 7 a adsorbed on AlumOH. Conjugation of the small immunopotentiator molecule was particularly suited for vaccination via intradermal delivery, where insoluble salts of aluminum cannot be used because of their reactogenicity. These findings have opened the path to the rational design of improved adjuvanted glycoconjugate vaccines for intradermal routes. Regarding the conjugation of TLR 7 a to MenC polysaccharide tested in vivo, the obtained results have shown a negative impact of the conjugation to MenC polysaccharide receptor recognition and consequently a reduction of the anti-MenC carbohydrate response. In order to investigate the potential use of a short β-glucan chain as adjuvant for intradermal vaccination toward the CRM_ 197 protein model antigen, in comparison to the previously presented glycoconjugate model antigen, the results obtained by the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the β-glucan conjugation to the CRM_ 197 protein were reported. The results have demonstrated that receptor activation was significantly impacted by the presentation of the glucan conjugated to the protein antigen. Considering that glycoconjugate vaccines are some of the safest and most effective vaccines for reducing, even eradicating, infectious diseases, the conjugation of well-defined synthetic glucans could represent a useful strategy for developing new glycoconjugate vaccines for intradermal delivery, with inherent adjuvant properties. The combination of antigens and adjuvants needs to be rationally defined to develop stable formulations and to give the safest and most efficient response with respect to the considered pathogen and route of administration. In the present work, formulation science has been proposed as a key element of novel vaccine development suitable for intradermal delivery. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Vaccines {{are complex}} <b>multi-component</b> <b>products,</b> {{in which an}} interdependent {{relationship}} among constituents exists: the concomitant inclusion of antigens, adjuvants, and excipients is essential to guarantee {{the efficacy of the}} final product. To stimulate the immune system and raise immunogenicity against highly purified vaccine components most likely adjuvants are required, thus becoming more and more crucial elements of modern vaccine formulations. Physico-chemical and functional attributes of all components and of the whole vaccine formulation have to be controlled before injection. However, often characterization challenges are experienced with the currently available analytical techniques, also because of interferences with adjuvants. In this thesis adjuvants were evaluated with the aim to improve quality and immunogenicity of combination vaccines, in which the inclusion of multiple antigenic components contributes to enhanced complexity of the final product. In detail, three virulence factors of the Gram negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis (pertussis toxin PT, filamentous heamagglutinin FHA, and pertactin 69 K) were chosen as model antigens. Currently licensed acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids in the DTaP/TdaP vaccine, which is considered a cornerstone of combination vaccines. This vaccine is typically adjuvanted with aluminum salts, known to induce mainly a humoral immune response which has been associated with recent pertussis outbreaks reported in many countries. This suggests that existing vaccines may not be ideal to provide protection against the disease. Thus, a pharmaceutical sciences approach focusing on adjuvants was applied to investigate the potential improvement of acellular pertussis vaccines through promotion of the analytical characterization and rational polarization of the quality of immune responses. Improved in vitro characterization assays for combination vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide: Vaccines in vitro characterization is required to identify optimal formulation conditions to ensure physical, chemical, and biological integrity of antigens and adjuvants. Analytical methods currently in use are mostly suitable for the characterization of unformulated antigens – requiring the complete desorption from aluminum-based adjuvants - and are not always able to reveal individual antigens in vaccine combinations. Here, the Luminex technology is proposed as proof of concept for the development of an improved analytical method for vaccine characterization, based on the use of specific antibodies bound to magnetic microspheres presenting unique digital signatures for simultaneous recognition of respective antigens in the entire formulation. TdaP combination vaccines were chosen as a model to develop an assay able to quantify acellular pertussis antigens and their levels of adsorption to adjuvant at the same time. This assay was directly applicable on the commercial vaccine product, avoiding any laborious procedures for separation of the antigens from the adjuvant. Accurate and reproducible quantification of aP antigens in TdaP vaccine has been achieved in a range between 0. 78 and 50 ng/mL, providing information on antigen identity, quantity, and degree of adsorption to aluminum hydroxide. Importantly, the Luminex characterization method {{has the potential to be}} further evaluated as correlate of in vitro potency assays - ideally allowing reducing in vivo animal studies. In vivo evaluation of novel adjuvants for improved aP-containing combination vaccines: The successful approach of combining diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens into a single vaccine has become the cornerstone of pediatric and adults immunization programs. Yet, even if vaccination coverage is high, a resurgence of pertussis has been recently reported in many countries suggesting that current vaccines may not provide adequate long-lasting protection. In order to develop pertussis-containing vaccines able to induce a more durable and better tailored immune response different approaches have been proposed, including the use of novel adjuvants. Currently licensed pertussis vaccines contain aluminum salts, which are the most common adjuvants for human use. By inducing mainly humoral immune responses aluminum salts might not be ideal for providing protection against pathogens which require a more cellular immune response, such as Bordetella pertussis. Therefore, alternative adjuvants that induce more balanced T-helper profiles or even Th 1 -prone responses might be more adequate. In this project, we tested three different adjuvants: MF 59 emulsion adjuvant – that induces a mixed Th 1 / 2 response - as well as the combination of a Toll-Like Receptor 4 agonist (TLR 4 a) or a Toll-Like Receptor 7 agonist (TLR 7 a) with aluminum hydroxide to induce even further Th 1 polarization. The adjuvants were evaluated for their ability to improve immune responses against a TdaP vaccine containing three B. pertussis antigens: genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (PT- 9 K/ 129 G), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (69 K). The quicker onset of serum antibody titers and the changed quality of the antibody responses induced by the adjuvants evaluated here fully support the potential replacement of aluminum salts with alternative adjuvants to enhance pertussis immunogenicity in aP-containing combination vaccines. Conclusions: Overall, the collected results suggested the possibility to modulate quality and efficacy of a complex vaccine product by carefully working on the adjuvant component. Improving the analytical characterization of vaccines while addressing a rational polarization of immune responses are proposed as effective strategies to be pursued for the development of next generation combination vaccines...|$|R
