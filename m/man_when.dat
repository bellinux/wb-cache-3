He was placed on the supplementary reserve list on 12 February 1931.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} series' run, Blair grapples with {{a number}} of changes within her family. Two years prior to the opening novel, Blair's parents {{divorced}} after her father ran off with another <b>man.</b> <b>When</b> her mother remarries, and her father leaves the country, Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather, Cyrus Rose. In addition, her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships. However, Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold, who she often turns to for comfort. By contrast, she maintains a somewhat tenser relationship with her mother Eleanor. It is also revealed that Blair has struggled with bulimia.|$|E
5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first {{came up with an}} old <b>man.</b> <b>When</b> the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E

5|$|Gervase of Canterbury wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of Canterbury {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young <b>man</b> <b>when</b> he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with <b>man</b> <b>when</b> they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one <b>man</b> <b>when</b> a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black <b>man,</b> <b>when</b> playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} the {{courtroom}} where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton {{is seen as a}} reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, which dealt with issues of {{separation of church and state}} and the debate between creationism and evolution. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown <b>Man.</b> <b>When</b> Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Crean {{remained}} an extremely modest <b>man.</b> <b>When</b> {{he returned to}} Kerry, he put all of his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press. It has been speculated that {{this may have been}} because Kerry was a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an epicentre of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black and Tan raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.|$|E

5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured <b>man.</b> <b>When</b> we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|Although Igor steered well {{clear of}} the Caribbean, large swells of 15–20ft (4.6–6.1m) {{propagated}} from the storm, drowning one person in St. Croix and another in Puerto Rico. Large waves affected the East Coast of the United States, and one person drowned in Surf City, North Carolina. In Bermuda, sustained winds of 91mph (146km/h) and gusts up to 117mph (188km/h) downed trees and power lines, cutting power to approximately 28,000 residents. Rainfall was largely insignificant, peaking at 3.19in (81mm). Impacts near the storm's landfall in Newfoundland were more severe. Rainfall amounts of more than 2in (50mm) were widespread, with a peak of 9.37in (238mm) in St Lawrence; as such, Igor ranks as the third wettest tropical cyclone to impact Atlantic Canada. Run-off from the torrential rainfall damaged or destroyed structures, killed a <b>man</b> <b>when</b> his driveway was washed out and he was swept away, and isolated approximately 150 communities. Sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) with gusts to 107mph (172km/h) in Cape Pine downed trees and power lines while damaging or destroying many homes. Approximately 50,000 households lost power during {{the peak of the}} storm. The overall damage total reached $200 million across Newfoundland, making Igor the costliest hurricane on record there. It was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit Newfoundland since 1935.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black <b>man,</b> <b>when</b> playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E
