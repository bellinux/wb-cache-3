5|$|After {{ownership}} of the <b>Meridian</b> Main Street {{was transferred to the}} Alliance for Downtown <b>Meridian</b> in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the <b>Meridian</b> Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The <b>Meridian</b> Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the <b>Meridian</b> Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One <b>Meridian</b> Plaza's owners E/R Partners {{to pay more}} than US$13 million for the site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One <b>Meridian</b> Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of the}} One <b>Meridian</b> Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One <b>Meridian</b> Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One <b>Meridian</b> plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One <b>Meridian</b> Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of Lauderdale County before <b>Meridian</b> was established, the nearby town of Marion was the largest {{settlement}} in the area. The families of Abraham Threefoot, Isaac Rosenbaum, Leopold Rosenbaum, E. Lowenstein, and Jacob Cohen lived in Marion during these early years. These families, along with other Jews in Marion, worked with Jews from the up-and-coming <b>Meridian</b> to build a temple halfway between the two towns. After the American Civil War, <b>Meridian</b> began to grow rapidly and Marion began to decline. As a result, many of Marion's Jews elected to move to <b>Meridian.</b> In 1868, the Jewish community established the first Jewish congregation in Lauderdale County, Beth Israel, and bought the lot which is now the Beth Israel Cemetery for $100 (today $).|$|E
5|$|Known {{for more}} than a century of arts, <b>Meridian</b> {{contains}} many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events. One of the first art organizations in the city, The <b>Meridian</b> Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown <b>Meridian,</b> but after a name change to <b>Meridian</b> Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the <b>Meridian</b> Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Meridian</b> Council for the Arts (MCA) {{was founded}} as Meridian's and Lauderdale County's {{official}} arts agency in 1978. MCA operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual Threefoot Festival, several workshops, {{and other special}} events each year. MCA is partnered with many arts organizations {{in the city and}} county including the <b>Meridian</b> Museum of Art, the <b>Meridian</b> Little Theatre, and the <b>Meridian</b> Symphony Orchestra. <b>Meridian</b> Little Theatre, one of the South's oldest subscription-based community theatres, was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to <b>Meridian</b> and Lauderdale County, entertaining over 22,000 guests each season, making it Mississippi's most-attended community theatre. The <b>Meridian</b> Symphony Orchestra (MSO) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963. In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist, Elena Nikolaidi, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the <b>Meridian</b> Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the <b>Meridian</b> Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who has been with the orchestra since 1991. The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman.|$|E
40|$|In present study, the database, CHM-DATA, with 1127 Chinese herbal {{medicines}} mainly having recorded {{chemical composition}}, involving 7 taste attributes, 5 medicinal properties, 1 toxicity attribute, 22 chemical composition categories, 12 <b>meridians</b> and collaterals (Gui Jing), and 78 medicinal functions (Gong Xiao), {{was used to}} calculate point correlations between these 125 attributes. Totally four relational networks, i. e., the networks for medicinal attributes and functions, for chemical composition and <b>meridians</b> and collaterals, for <b>meridians</b> and collaterals and medicinal functions, and for <b>meridians</b> and collaterals were constructed based on the significant point correlations. Network analysis indicated that the former three ones are scale-free complex networks {{and the last one}} tends to be a random network. Node degrees of the four networks follow power-law distribution. Detailed between-attribute relationships and medicinal mechanisms were revealed. For example, concerning chemical composition categories, alkaloids and amines have positive correlation / correspondence. More alkaloids correspond to more amines. Alkaloids negatively correlate with volatile oils / ordinary oils, carbohydrates / starch, ketones / flavonoids, and olefins. Alkaloids mainly function in decrease internal heat, dry dampness, etc. Organic acids and alkaloids have negative correlation. More organic acids mean the less alkaloids. Organic acids mainly act on large intestine <b>meridians</b> and collaterals, and function in moisten dryness. As for <b>meridians</b> and collaterals, kidney <b>meridians</b> and collaterals negatively correlate with lung <b>meridians</b> and collaterals, stomach <b>meridians</b> and collaterals, and large intestine <b>meridians</b> and collaterals. Kidney <b>meridians</b> and collaterals positively function in consolidate or warm kidney, invigorate male impotence (Yang) or strengthen male essence, strengthen bones and muscles, stop diarrheal, regulate menstruation or promote blood flow, relieve rheumatism or lubricate the joints, and negatively function in clear away heat, and detoxification...|$|R

5|$|The area {{is served}} by two {{military}} facilities, Naval Air Station <b>Meridian</b> and Key Field, which provide over 4,000 jobs. NAS <b>Meridian</b> {{is home to the}} Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA) and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{mechanisms}} of acupuncture <b>meridians</b> by determining characteristics of the tissue fluid flow in the connective tissue along <b>meridians.</b> Based on deep dissection of acupoints on {{the upper and lower}} limbs of the human body and micro and macro observation and measurement, a mathematical model of the flow of tissue fluid in interosseous membranes is constructed. It is shown that the signal transmission along acupuncture <b>meridians</b> may be determined by unique anatomical and physiological factors that govern the flow of tissue fluid in the connective tissue and involve mast cell degranulation.
