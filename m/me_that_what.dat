Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is a love letter to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] it struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we’re seeing here may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] is more about who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was all my fault, I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> she told me was all true." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, writing {{that while there}} had been a [...] "self-congratulatory quality" [...] to Glee since its mid-season break, [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] was a return to [...] "the Glee [...] fell in tormented love with." [...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> I like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2008 {{article in}} Vanity Fair magazine, the {{journalist}} David Rose published confidential documents, apparently originating from the US State Department, which would {{prove that the}} United States collaborated with the Palestinian Authority and Israel to attempt the violent overthrow of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and that Hamas pre-empted the coup. The documents suggest that a government with Hamas should {{meet the demands of}} the Middle East Quartet, otherwise President Mahmoud Abbas should declare a state of emergency, which effectively would dissolve the current unity government, or the government should collapse by other means. Rose quotes former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief Middle East adviser David Wurmser, accusing the Bush administration of “engaging in a dirty war in an effort to provide a corrupt dictatorship [...] with victory.” He believes that Hamas had no intention of taking Gaza until Fatah forced its hand. “It looks to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happened wasn’t so much a coup by Hamas but an attempted coup by Fatah that was pre-empted before it could happen” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we’re here {{to do is to}} learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
