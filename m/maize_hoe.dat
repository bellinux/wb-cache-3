40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in 2005 at Karaj, northern of Iran, to evaluate the efficacy of Sulfonyl Urea (SU) herbicides on weed control in maize and compare them with other herbicides at single and double row planting patterns. The treatments were three SU herbicides, nicosulfuron, rimsulfuron, foramsulfuron and most commonly used herbicides in <b>maize.</b> <b>Hoe</b> weeded and unweeded treatments also were included. The {{findings of this study}} showed that at both planting patterns all plots that received nicosulfuron had significantly higher maize grain yield than other two SU herbicides. At Double Row (DR) planting pattern, all the treatments controlled weeds more effectively than at Single Row (SR) planting pattern and increased maize grain yield by mean of 1. 0 t haG 1. At both planting patterns herbicidal mixture of atrazine and alachlor was the best treatment in controlling weeds. The hoe weeded control and all herbicidal treatments had lower weed dry matter than the untreated control at crop harvest period. In addition the lowest weed dry matter was obtained from the hoe weeded control. Results of this study revealed that nicosulfuron and rimsulfuron were the best and the weakest SU herbicide at both planting patterns, respectively...|$|E

Farmers in the Eastern Woodlands tended fields of <b>maize</b> with <b>hoes</b> and digging sticks, while their neighbors in the Southeast grew tobacco as well as food crops. On the Plains, some tribes engaged in agriculture but also planned buffalo hunts in which herds were driven over bluffs.|$|R
