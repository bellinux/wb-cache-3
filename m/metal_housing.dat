25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the power control module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower rudder control module's cast <b>metal</b> <b>housing</b> had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the twin hose regulator is packaged in a usually circular <b>metal</b> <b>housing</b> mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver's neck. The demand valve component of a two-stage twin hose regulator is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The supply hose is connected {{to one side of the}} regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a non-return valve, and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a non-return valve on the other side of the mouthpiece and usually through another non-return exhaust valve in the regulator housing - often a [...] "duckbill" [...] type.|$|E

50|$|After {{the last}} of Marumiya's key sources of business, Horikawa, closed in the late 1980s, <b>Metal</b> <b>House</b> was {{established}} in 1989. Many of Horikawas designs were carried over by <b>Metal</b> <b>House</b> including the Super Space Giant and Star Strider, {{both of which are}} in still in production today. The latter is notable for being Horikawa's last all-tin toy robot design. Both company names, Horikawa and <b>Metal</b> <b>House,</b> appear on the boxes for Star Strider robots produced during this transitional period. Additional products such as Space Evil* (packaged for but never actually sold under the brand name Bliking) share many things in common with their Horikawa ancestors from the 1960s/early 1970s.|$|R

50|$|However {{the metal}} reflectors {{needed to be}} fairly heavy gauge, and if the size was reduced then the <b>metal</b> <b>housing</b> would get too hot to be safe. In the mid-20th century the {{cheapest}} heaters were radiative, but with the heating wires stretched relatively closely across a larger thin metal reflector separated from a thin <b>metal</b> <b>housing.</b> A small fan blew just enough air between the housing and the reflector to cool them; the main output to the room was the radiative heat and not the heated air. Having the heating wires stretched across a larger area meant that fewer expensive ceramic insulators were needed, and the small fan was cheaper than a larger or heavier housing.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{communications}} between posts and controls were made using former Army-issue head-and-breast communication sets via above-ground telephone lines, these being manually switched by telephone engineers prior to use. Army head-and-breast sets were replaced in 1964 by <b>metal</b> <b>housed</b> “Teletalk” units which only permitted one-way communications when the push-to-talk switch was depressed. The Teletalk units also used manually switched telephone lines, but with integral transistorisation to boost transmission and reception power. In 1981 a new design of Teletalk (AD8010) {{was introduced by}} British Telecom together with underground, permanently wired, landline connections that were hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear bursts.|$|R
