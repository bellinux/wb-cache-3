Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF – Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen – ambulances staffed {{with a doctor}} in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen – regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW – Krankentransportwagen) and a <b>Mobile</b> <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Unit</b> (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross in order to organise transportation of non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross the Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs (Labor-Samaritan-Alliance), the Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria (the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps) and the Grünes Kreuz (Green Cross) operate various non-emergency ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transportation. In addition to the land-ambulances there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, which is also staffed with an emergency doctor in addition to regular personnel.|$|E

Evacuation time was 5–10 minutes in urban areas and 15–20 minutes in rural areas. In most cases, victims were evacuated to multiple facilities.

40|$|Cardiopulmonary arrest is {{a medical}} {{emergency}} in which the lapse of time between event onset and the initiation of measures of basic and advanced support, {{as well as the}} correct care based on specific protocols for each clinical situation, constitute decisive factors for a successful therapy. Cardiopulmonary arrest care cannot be restricted to the hospital setting because of its fulminant nature. This necessitates the creation of new concepts, strategies and structures, such as the concept of life chain, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation courses for professionals who work in emergency medical services, the automated external defibrillator, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and <b>mobile</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> among others. New concepts, strategies and structures motivated by new advances have also modified the treatment and improved the results of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the hospital setting.

25|$|The {{evolution}} from physician-staffed <b>mobile</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> to paramedic-staffed {{units in the}} United States occurred independently and almost simultaneously in several communities. Two communities that led the way were Miami and Seattle, but others included Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, and Columbus, Ohio. These communities were a major evolutional advance compared to the Belfast or New York City programs. Not only were paramedics used instead of physicians, but from their inception the programs were established {{to deal with the}} problem of sudden cardiac arrest. Pantridge's program was established primarily to reach the victim of MI fast and thereby prevent mortality in the vulnerable early stage of this event. Thus cardiac arrest was successfully treated only if it occurred as a complication of MI and only if the ambulance was already at the scene or en route. The new paramedic programs were far more nimble than physician-based programs and were specifically designed not only to treat the early stages of MI, but also to attempt resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest wherever and whenever it occurred. Reversal of death itself would be a major purpose and goal of the new paramedic programs.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to describe noninvasive ventilation (NIV) practices (pressure support ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure) in French out-of-hospital <b>mobile</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> (SMUR) and their compliance with national consensus guidelines. METHOD: Online inquiry into practices of NIV among managers of French SMUR. Analyzed data include types of NIV devices and use of NIV. RESULTS: Upon 218 SMUR referenced within the SAMU de France database, 118 questionnaires (54 %) were processed. Noninvasive ventilation equipment: 91 % of the SMUR {{with at least one}} type of NIV device (continuous positive airway pressure only = 82 %; pressure support ventilation only = 59 %; both = 50 %) but frequently not with recommended devices. Use of NIV: for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, practices were compliant with recommendations in 80 % of cases, although there was still room for improvement. For other pathologies, practices were very heterogeneous, not always properly assessed, and frequently not compliant with recommendations. CONCLUSION: To conclude, NIV use in the out-of-hospital setting in France seems to meet current recommendations for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema but not for other pathologies. This could be improved by the use of written procedures, conduction of further studies, and promotion of compliance through education...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{concern of}} this paper is the development of procedures for adjusting the criteria currently being used for federally-legislated health planning activities. These procedures would enable the planner to account for the demographic, geographic and health-system conditions which cause variations in the need for health-care services in local communities. A case-mix method, hospital chart-abstract data and demographic, geographic and health-system data from New Jersey were used to: create a list of diagnoses eligible for treatment in a Cardiac-Care Unit (CCU); select a sample of hospitals for study, and conduct a step-wise regression analysis of CCU utilization in these hospitals. It was concluded that CCU utilization was affected by factors such as the in-hospital availability of CCU beds, the type of hospital, CCU-patients' clinical severity, and the availability of ambulances and <b>mobile</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> Procedures for adjusting planning criteria to account for local conditions have yet to be developed. However, a method for using the types of results presented in this paper to develop such adjustment procedures was presented and illustrated. It is recommended that this method be used to create such adjustment procedures for the planning criteria for all hospital services and hence to assist Health Systems Agencies in rationalizing the distribution of our hospital care. ...|$|R
