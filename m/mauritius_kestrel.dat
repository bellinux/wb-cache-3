50|$|Isolated {{on various}} islands around the Indian Ocean, kestrel populations evolved into {{different}} species, like Darwin's finches. Behaviour remains {{similar to other}} small species of Falco (such as the common kestrel, Falco tinnunculus) except on (originally) forested <b>Mauritius</b> where <b>kestrels</b> hunt arboreally more like hawks. Due to the scarcity of mammals on oceanic islands, several species have adopted a diet containing many Phelsuma and other geckos. The species can be distinguished by coloration, but all except the banded kestrel share rich brown wings with black spotting. Sexes are alike in color except in the spotted kestrel, where differences are minor. As usual in birds of prey, females are larger than males; considerably so {{in some of these}} species as this assists resource partitioning.|$|R

50|$|Further species {{restoration}} {{work was}} undertaken with the pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri), {{of which the}} population had declined to just 10 individuals by 1990. Population estimates of about 400 birds in seven subpopulations (six in the national park and one on Ile aux Aigrettes) in 2015 have resulted from Jones' leadership in the intervention, following similar methods to the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> project.|$|E
5000|$|It {{can reach}} a size between 26 and 30.5 cm. The weight {{is up to}} 250 grams. The males are {{slightly}} smaller than the females. Wingspan is approximately 45 cm and wings are rounded, unlike those of other falcons. The lifespan is 15 years in captivity. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> hunts by means of short, swift flights through forests. It is carnivorous, eating geckos, dragonflies, cicadas, cockroaches, crickets, and small birds.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that {{in the absence of the}} locally extinct Mauritius olive white-eye, Trochetia blackburnianas main pollinator in the area of Le Pétrin is the blue-tailed day gecko (Phelsuma cepediana). Interestingly, the pollination efficiency of these geckos depend on the proximity to dense patches of Pandanus, which are a favourite microhabitat for the geckos - possibly because the spiky leaves of Pandanus protect them from their main predator, the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco punctatus).|$|E
50|$|The Trust {{began working}} in Mauritius during the 1970s. In 1998 it {{announced}} that the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> - a species once reduced to only four birds - had been saved from extinction. Durrell is also working to save critically endangered species such as the pink pigeon, echo parakeet, Round Island boa (Casarea dussumieri) and Mauritius fody. It has also helped in the restoration of Round Island - a small island about 12 miles north east of Mauritius.|$|E
50|$|Since 1970, The Peregrine Fund has hatched {{and raised}} 20 species of rare birds and pioneered {{propagation}} and releasing techniques for numerous species.

Overall, the organization has monitored, surveyed and worked with more than 100 raptor species in the wild around the world.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco punctatus) is a {{bird of prey}} {{from the}} family Falconidae endemic to the forests of Mauritius, where it is {{restricted}} to the southwestern plateau's forests, cliffs, and ravines. It is the most distinct of the Indian Ocean kestrels. It colonized its island home to evolve into a distinct species probably during the Gelasian (Late Pliocene).It is the most distant living species among the western Indian Ocean kestrels (Groombridge et al. 2002, qv Réunion kestrel).|$|E
50|$|The Gerald Durrell Endemic Wildlife Sanctuary is {{an animal}} {{sanctuary}} founded in 1984, in Western Mauritius. It {{is an area}} closed off to the public, in the Black River Gorge region, which is densely forested, and is used for breeding rare, endemic Mauritian species. Among the endangered species in the sanctuary is the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> once the rarest bird {{in the world with}} only 4 members left. It has been successfully bred and the population has now reached the capacity of Mauritius.|$|E
50|$|The Mauritian Wildlife Appeal Fund was {{established}} in 1984 under the initiative of naturalist Gerald Durrell and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust principally {{to raise funds for}} the conservation of endemic Mauritius wildlife. The conservation work in Mauritius began as a species orientated program concentrating on a few critically endangered species, including the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> and the pink pigeon. The initiation of the conservation program in 1976 was popularized by Gerald Durrell in his book Golden Bats and Pink Pigeons.|$|E

Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
50|$|Over 100 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Mauritius. There are seven or eight surviving endemic species on the main island depending on taxonomy. The Mauritius grey white-eye {{is the most common}} of these, being widespread across the island including in man-made habitats. The others are less common and are mainly restricted to the Black River Gorges National Park in the south-west of the island. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> Mauritius parakeet and pink pigeon all came close to extinction but are now increasing thanks to intensive conservation efforts.|$|E
50|$|The park protects {{most of the}} island's {{remaining}} rainforest {{although much}} {{of this has been}} degraded by introduced plants such as Chinese guava and privet and animals such as rusa deer and wild pigs. Several areas have been fenced off and invasive species have been eradicated from them to preserve native wildlife. Many endemic plants and animals still occur in the park including the Mauritian flying fox and all of the island's endemic birds: <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> pink pigeon, Mauritius parakeet, Mauritius cuckoo-shrike, Mauritius bulbul, Mauritius olive white-eye, Mauritius grey white-eye and Mauritius fody.|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{started working}} in Mauritius in 1979, whilst {{working for the}} International Council for Bird Preservation (now known as Birdlife International). Upon arrival, Jones’ focus was to run and {{establish}} the captive breeding project and {{to work on the}} conservation of the most threatened species in the wild. Carl worked on the pink pigeon and the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco punctatus), which was considered the world's rarest bird. The species had reached an all-time low in 1974 with only four known wild birds. Despite the prevailing opinion that F. punctatus was doomed to extinction, he took over the recovery project that had been initiated in 1973 [...] and began to implement captive breeding techniques such as [...] "double-clutching", which is the removal of the first clutch of eggs (for captive rearing) which encourages the birds to lay a second clutch, thereby increasing the fecundity of breeding pairs, along with dietary supplementation for parents, fostering of captive reared young to wild pairs and hacking of captive raised birds to ensure maximum recruitment of juvenile birds. Between 1983 and 1993, 333 Mauritius kestrels had been reared, a third of these were captive bred and the remainder were derived from wild harvested eggs, most of these were returned to the wild. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> has subsequently been down-listed from Critically Endangered in the late 1970s, to Endangered in 1994 and Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List by 2000.|$|E
50|$|No predators or parasites are {{recorded}} for Brazza's martin, but Mascarene martins will mob the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> {{suggesting that it}} {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Mascarene martins may host a variety of parasites. On Mauritius they may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the Mascarene martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5000|$|The Malagasy kestrel (Falco newtoni), {{also known}} as the Madagascar kestrel, Malagasy spotted kestrel, Newton's kestrel, Madagascar spotted kestrel, katiti (Creole) or hitsikitsika (Malagasy), is a small bird of prey of the genus Falco. It is named after British ornithologist Edward Newton. It occurs in two {{subspecies}} on Madagascar and at Aldabra. The race from Aldabra is also called Aldabra kestrel (Falco newtoni aldabranus). Its closest living relative is the Seychelles kestrel; they were at one time considered conspecific. Their common ancestors appear to have diverged very recently, probably less than 1 million years ago during the Early or Middle Pleistocene.The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> is more distantly related.(Groombridge et al. 2002) ...|$|E
50|$|Falcons and {{caracaras}} have {{a complicated}} relationship with humans. In ancient Egypt they were deified {{in the form}} of Horus, the sky and sun god who was the ancestor of the pharaohs. Caracaras also formed part of the legends of the Aztecs, and are today the national emblems of Mexico. Falcons were important in the (formerly often royal) sport of falconry. They have also been persecuted for their predation on game and farm animals, and that persecution has led to the extinction of at least one species, the Guadalupe caracara. Several insular species have declined dramatically, none more so than the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> which at one time numbered no more than four birds. Around five species of falcon are considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN, including the saker falcon.|$|E
50|$|Reintroductions of captive bred populations {{can occur}} to {{replenish}} wild populations of an endangered species, {{to create new}} populations or to restore a species after it has become extinct in the wild. Reintroductions helped bring the wild populations of Hawaiian geese (nene) from 30 birds to over 500. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> was successfully reintroduced into the wild after its captive breeding programme. Reintroductions can be very difficult and often fail if insufficient preparations are made, as species born in captivity may lack {{the skills and knowledge}} needed for life in the wild after living in captivity. Reintroductions can also fail if the causes of a birds decline have not been adequately addressed. Attempts to reintroduce the Bali starling into the wild failed due to continued poaching of reintroduced birds.|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{was born}} in Carmarthen, Wales in 1954. During his youth he was fascinated with animals, and bred kestrels in his back yard. He credits both his initial {{excitement}} and subsequent success in restoring the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> to the experience gathered during this time. Speaking of his decision to pursue conservation as a career, Jones has stated: [...] "I have always known what I wanted to do {{for as long as}} I can remember. I wanted to work with wildlife, to visit remote areas and to contribute to the conservation of the most endangered species. But dreaming is not enough and I realised that I needed some higher qualifications." [...] Subsequently he has spent his career conserving and studying species and systems and helping others to become conservation biologists.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> F. punctatus, is more distantly {{related to}} the {{preceding}} two, having diverged from ancestral Madagascar region kestrels {{some time in the}} Gelasian (Groombridge et al. 2002). It is found only on Mauritius. It usually snatches arboreal prey, typically geckos or small birds. Habitat loss and DDT poisoning pushed this species to the brink of extinction, down to possibly as few as six individuals (and an even smaller effective population size) in the mid 1970s. The conservation effort was initially unsuccessful but results improved when new approaches were tried by Carl Jones in 1979. Chicks hatched at a sanctuary run by Gerald Durrell were released to new areas, and the population has now almost reached the carrying capacity of the island; intensive conservation activity has ceased for some time, with the last captive bred birds released in 1994.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} birds seems to hold clues as to why (Groombridge et al. 2002): Mauritius is a volcanic island, and although the colonization of the island by kestrels cannot be dated with high precision, it was almost certainly some time before volcanic activity died down. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> population seems to have survived a prolonged period of volcanic activity, which must have kept the population small and fluctuating as habitat, food, and kestrels were destroyed by volcanic eruptions time and again. As near-panmictic conditions were sustained for many generations, alleles that might cause inbreeding depression were steadily removed by means of natural selection. The phenomenon that effective population sizes as low as 4-5 can be tolerated without pronounced inbreeding depression is also known from other small-island birds, such as Petroica traversi or the Laysan duck.|$|E
50|$|The {{family has}} a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution across the world, absent only from the densest forest of central Africa, some remote oceanic islands, the high Arctic and Antarctica. Some species have exceptionally wide ranges, particularly the cosmopolitan peregrine falcon, which ranges from Greenland to Fiji and has the widest natural breeding distribution of any bird. Other species have more restricted distributions, particularly island endemics like the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel.</b> Most habitat types are occupied, from tundra to rainforest and deserts, although they are generally more birds of open country and even forest species tend to prefer broken forest and forest edges. Some species, mostly in the genus Falco, are fully migratory, with some species summering in Eurasia and wintering entirely in Africa, other species may be partly migratory. The Amur falcon {{has one of the}} longest migrations, moving from East Asia to southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{there were}} at least 800 mature birds; it is {{estimated}} that the remaining habitat allows for a carrying capacity of maybe 50-150 more (BirdLife International 2006a,b). They occur in the remaining forests of the island, especially in the Black River Gorges region. The species was downlisted to vulnerable by the IUCN in 1994 as releases of captive-bred birds became unnecessary. Little conservation action was deemed necessary only two decades - in <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> terms, a long lifetime or maybe 4-5 generations - after the species had stood at the very brink of extinction. Today, apart from routine monitoring to be able to assist individual couples that fail to establish breeding territories for lack of nesting facilities - a major limiting factor, the ongoing control of introduced predators is basically all that is being done to assist the species' survival (BirdLife International 2006a,b).|$|E
50|$|But {{with the}} team of Carl Jones (of <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> and Last Chance to See fame) taking over, a {{dedicated}} research and conservation effort was launched to save the birds. By the late 1980s, the situation had stabilized - though at a precariously low level - and more young birds were being hatched. By the mid-1990s, some 50-60 individuals were known altogether (including young birds) and an intensive management of the wild population by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation could begin. These efforts paid off handsomely; by January 2000, the population had exceeded 100 birds total.Since then, the rapid recovery has continued. The total wild population is presently some 280-300 individuals of which some 200 are adult, half of which being breeding pairs {{and most of the}} other half single males. A captive fall-back population was originally held at the Gerald Durrell Endemic Wildlife Sanctuary, however only one individual male remains of the collection.|$|E
50|$|Captive breeding, or ex-situ conservation, {{has been}} used in a number of {{instances}} to save species from extinction. The principle is to create a viable population of a species in either zoos or breeding facilities, for later reintroduction back into to the wild. As such a captive population can either serve as an insurance against the species going extinct in the wild or as a last-ditch effort in situations where conservation in the wild is impossible. Captive breeding {{has been used}} to save several species from extinction, the most famous example being the California condor, a species that declined to less than thirty birds. In order to save the California condor {{the decision was made to}} take every individual left in the wild into captivity. From these 22 individuals a breeding programme began that brought the numbers up to 273 by 2005. An even more impressive recovery was that of the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel,</b> which by 1974 had dropped to only four individuals, yet by 2006 the population was 800.|$|E
50|$|Monitoring of {{population}} changes through genetic means {{can be done}} retrospectively, through analysis of 'historical' DNA recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It {{can also be used}} as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations. Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. heterozygosity and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for Beringian bison, Galapagos tortoise, houting, Atlantic salmon, northern pike, New Zealand snapper, steelhead trout, greater prairie chicken, <b>Mauritius</b> <b>kestrel</b> and Hector's dolphin and is the subject of many ongoing studies, including Danish and Swedish brown trout populations. Measuring absolute population changes (e.g. effective population size (Ne)) can be carried out by measuring changes in population allele frequencies (‘Ftemporal’) or levels of linkage disequilibrium over time (‘LDNe’), while changing patterns of gene flow between populations can also be monitored by estimating differences in allele frequencies between populations over time. Subjects of such studies include grizzly bears, cod, red deer, Leopard frogs and Barrel Medic.|$|E

In 1974 she teamed up with Colin Groves in the Tana River floodplain where they studied the endangered Tana River red colobus and the Tana River mangabey. In 1978 she married ornithologist Lester L. Short. As research associate and later senior research fellow in the National Museums of Kenya {{she and her husband}} took part in an ornithological project which lasted from 1985 to 1999.
