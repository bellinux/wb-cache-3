5|$|In 2009, a fan-made <b>mod</b> called The Nameless <b>Mod</b> (TNM) was {{released}} by Off Topic Productions. The game's protagonist is a user of an Internet forum, with digital places represented as physical locations. The <b>mod</b> offers roughly {{the same amount of}} gameplay as Deus Ex and adds several new features to the game, with a more open world structure than Deus Ex and new weapons such as the player character's fists. The <b>mod</b> was developed over 7 years and has thousands of lines of recorded dialogue and two different parallel story arcs. Upon its release, TNM earned a 9/10 overall from PCPowerPlay magazine. In ModDB's 2009 <b>Mod</b> of the Year awards, The Nameless <b>Mod</b> won the Editor's Choice award for Best Singleplayer <b>Mod.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{handful of}} pub rock acts managed to achieve {{mainstream}} success after {{the advent of}} punk rock, often being re-categorised as new wave music, including Graham Parker and the Rumour, Nick Lowe, Squeeze and Elvis Costello. London-based R pub rock bands received a major boost when The Jam kicked off the <b>mod</b> revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City, which mixed R standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading <b>mod</b> revival band with their third album All <b>Mod</b> Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. Pub rock bands like Red Beans and Rice, The Little Roosters, The Inmates, Nine Below Zero and Eddie and the Hot Rods, became major acts in the growing <b>mod</b> revival scene in London. Other bands grew up to feed the desire for <b>mod</b> music, often combining the music of 60s <b>mod</b> groups with elements of punk music, including The Lambrettas, The Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early 80s. Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed The Style Council, who abandoned most {{of the elements of}} punk to adopt music much more based in R and early soul. Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood, re-emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s, being as defined as blue-eyed soul singers.|$|E

50|$|Minecraft <b>mods</b> are independent, user-made {{additions}} {{and changes}} to the 2011 Mojang video game. Thousands of these <b>mods</b> exist, and users can download them from the internet for free. Utilizing additional software, several <b>mods</b> are typically able to be used concurrently {{in order to enhance}} the gameplay and create an entirely different gaming experience when compared to standard issue Minecraft. <b>Mods</b> are credited as one of the foremost reasons why Minecraft became as successful as it did, with the Minecraft <b>modding</b> community mentioned {{as one of the most}} active <b>modding</b> communities in gaming.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{stance of}} Mojang {{with regards to}} the <b>modding</b> phenomenon is that they do not officially support <b>modding,</b> but in 2012 they claimed to be working on a repository for Minecraft <b>mods.</b> Their help website does list video tutorials that teach the player how to install and play Minecraft <b>mods.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>mod</b> was {{developed}} by Long War Studios, a team that came to include four core members, with assistance from 29 contributors, 20 voice actors, and three members of Firaxis Games, the developer of Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. According {{to one of the}} mod's core developers, Amineri, the <b>mod</b> started as a series of changes to the base game's configuration file, and grew more expansive as the team's capabilities grew. By the end of the mod's development, the team was working directly with the Unreal Development Kit, and had created a Java-based tool to help manage the changes that the <b>mod</b> was making.|$|E
50|$|Grand Theft Auto fan {{communities}} have been {{essential to the}} growth of the <b>modding</b> scene. Modders were able to exchange knowledge and team up in order to create new tools, <b>mods</b> and documentation. GTA communities, forums, and fan sites have also been essential, as they serve as hosts for <b>mods.</b> Besides the video-sharing site YouTube, sites such as GTANet, GTAinside, GTA V <b>Mods</b> and The GTA Place served as platforms for content exchange, and discussion about <b>modding</b> and the Grand Theft Auto in general.|$|R

40|$|Video game <b>modding</b> {{is a form}} of fan {{productivity}} in contemporary participatory culture. We see <b>modding</b> as an important way in which modders experience and conceptualize their work. By focusing on <b>modding</b> in a free and open source software video game, we analyze the practice of <b>modding</b> and the way it changes modders' relationship with their object of interest. The modders' involvement is not always associated with fun and creativity. Indeed, activities such as play testing often undermine these dimensions of <b>modding.</b> We present a case study of <b>modding</b> that is based on ethnographic research done for The Battle for Wesnoth, a free and open source software strategy video game entirely developed by a community of volunteers...|$|R
