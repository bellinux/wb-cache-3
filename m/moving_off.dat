5|$|In early August, a {{disturbance}} {{was observed in}} satellite images <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa on August 4. Moving westward along the Intertropical Convergence Zone at a forward speed of roughly , the disturbance {{showed no signs of}} development until a cloud mass broke away from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E
5|$|On May24, the low {{pressure}} area reorganized as spiral rainbands became more evident on radar, and Alma was re-classified as a tropical depression. As the depression approached the Florida coast, radar imagery indicated the system remained well-organized, with a spiral band structure around an eye feature; however, wind shear limited convection and strength, and Alma moved ashore as a depression near Cedar Key on May25. It turned northeastward and moved across the southeastern United States, becoming extratropical in North Carolina on May27. After <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Virginia, the remnants of Alma were absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E

The 211th Battery, 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery then arrived at LZN {{equipped}} with eight 75mm Pack Howitzers and were engaging German targets less than thirty minutes after landing. The 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, who were the furthest away at LZW, crossed the Caen canal and River Orne bridges. These had been captured twenty-one hours earlier by their own 'D' Company who were now headed towards Herouvillette and Escoville. By midnight, the 6th Airborne Division was the only Allied formation to have seized all of its D-Day objectives.|$|E
5|$|This {{time the}} 27th Battalion {{was to play}} a key role. <b>Moving</b> <b>off</b> from {{positions}} around La Boiselle in the afternoon, the battalion advanced with two companies forward and two back in reserve {{under the cover of}} an intense artillery barrage. Due to congestion around the assembly trenches, the battalion arrived at its objective late. Nevertheless, the first wave managed to capture the first line of German trenches and although the follow-up waves became lost amidst thick smoke, the two assault companies began to consolidate their position during the night. In the early morning of 5 August, a heavy German counterattack was launched. This was turned back with considerable cost, with the Germans suffering an estimated 100 men killed and 60 men captured. Following this, the battalion sent out patrols into No Man's Land as reinforcements were brought up. Later during the day their positions were subjected to heavy shellfire from German guns positioned around Thiepval. Although successful, the attack proved costly with the battalion reporting the following casualties: 40 killed, 289 wounded and 67 missing. Afterwards they were relieved by the 48th Battalion and were eventually transferred to Belgium where they were rested in a 'quiet' sector south of Zillebeke.|$|E

5|$|When Tropical Storm Laura first {{passed the}} Cayman Islands, it {{produced}} up to 3inches (7.5cm) of rainfall. As it was slowly <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> {{of the coast}} of Cuba, Laura dropped heavy rainfall, including nearly 20inches (50cm) across most of the Isle of Youth; one station on the island reported 14inches (36cm) in 24hours. The highest total in the country was 32.5inches (83cm), and overall the storm impacted four provinces, including Isle of Youth, Pinar del Río, La Habana, {{and the city of}} Havana. On the Isle of Youth, Laura produced winds of 70mph (120km/h), with gusts to 80mph (130km/h). On the mainland, the storm destroyed 20homes and several tobacco sheds, with damage also reported to the coffee, sugar, fruit, and vegetable crops. Due to the flooding, officials forced 26,000people from their homes in Pinar del Río, and one person in that province drowned while crossing a river. The storm's passage was believed to have diverted a flock of great black-backed gulls toward Central America and north-coastal South America; the species is usually found in the Mid-Atlantic states, and were migrating to the Gulf Coast or Cuba when they were affected by the storm.|$|E

25|$|Peterborough has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with four distinct seasons. It {{lies in a}} transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's Hardiness zone is 5b. Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly {{from one part of}} the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.|$|E
25|$|Earl {{formed in}} a well-organized area of low {{pressure}} {{and moved into}} the Atlantic Ocean as a vigorous tropical wave on early August 22. After <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> the west coast of Africa, a surface low started to develop near the area of thunderstorms. The surface low was able to organize the area of thunderstorms, allowing deep convection to occur near it. Because of the area's increasing thunderstorm organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated on August 24 that the system had a 90% chance of becoming a tropical depression within the next 48 hours. 18 hours later, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Seven at around 1500UTC on August25, while it was located about 430mi (690km) west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands. Six hours later, at about 2100 UTC, the system's maximum sustained winds were estimated to be 40mph (65km/h). Accordingly, the depression was declared to have become the fifth tropical storm of the season, and received the name Earl.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, {{less than}} twelve {{hours after the}} Israeli-PLO ceasefire had gone into effect, it fell apart, and heavy {{fighting}} erupted around Khalde. As the fighting raged, an IDF armored unit struck northeast, attempting to bypass Khalde and advance on Baabda, which overlooked the airport and {{could be used as}} another staging point to cut the Beirut-Damascus highway. By June 14, Syrian forces were being deployed to Khalde. Syrian units in Beirut and three commando battalions armed with anti-tank weaponry took up defensive positions southwest of the airport to block any Israeli attempt to capture it. The Israelis attempted to flank these defenses by <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> the road past Shuweifat, up a narrow, steep, and winding road towards Baabda, but were ambushed by a Syrian commando battalion. The Syrians attacked Israeli armor with rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles at close range. Israeli infantry dismounted and engaged the Syrians. Fierce fighting took place, with the Israelis calling in artillery at very close range to themselves. The Israelis advanced relentlessly, and after fourteen hours of fierce combat that raged up through Ain Aanoub and Souq el-Gharb, they broke through the Syrian positions and entered Baabda. The IDF then immediately sent reinforcements to the column in Baabda to enable it to carry out further operations. From Baabda, the Israeli force split into three columns, one of which struck across the highway and entered the mountainous area to the northeast, one swung west and took up positions in the steep hills west of Beirut, and one turned toward Kahale, which was further down the highway. To the south, the IDF drove PLO forces out of Shuweifat, but no major battles occurred. The Israelis had now cut the Beirut-Damascus highway, cutting off all PLO and Syrian forces in the city.|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Charley [...] was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to threaten the East Coast of the United States since Hurricane Gloria the previous year. The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Charley formed as a subtropical low on August13 along the Florida panhandle. After <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> the coast of South Carolina, the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone and intensified into a tropical storm on August15. Charley later attained hurricane status before moving across eastern North Carolina. It gradually weakened over the north Atlantic Ocean before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August20. Charley's remnants remained identifiable for over a week until after crossing the British Isles and dissipating on August30.|$|E

Haryanto made a good start, moving from seventh to third by running on the outside line, while Berthon made a slow getaway and dropped to seventh. King lost the most positions, moving from fifth to 13th, which he attributed to driving conservatively on the formation lap, and having no grip while <b>moving</b> <b>off</b> his starting position. Leal pulled out to the lead over the rest of the field by pushing hard.
