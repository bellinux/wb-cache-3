In addition to the luxury skyscrapers, the development will include 24 ultra-luxury town homes in the $2 million price range.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial. Many marine organisms, particularly those on coral reefs, are brightly coloured or patterned, including sponges, corals, molluscs and fishes, {{with little or}} no connection to chemical or physical defenses. Caribbean reef sponges are brightly coloured, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> chemically defended, but there is no relationship between the two factors.|$|E

5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms, so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen heptafluorides. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> powerful sources of fluorine atoms, and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine.|$|E
5|$|In late 1809, a MrJ. Drakard {{released}} The life of {{that wonderful}} and extraordinary heavy man, the late Danl. Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> preserved in museums today.|$|E
5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> from {{the nineteenth century}} – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by {{what was once a}} typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|There are 33 {{scheduled}} monuments in Taunton Deane. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> Neolithic {{through to}} the Bronze and Iron Ages such as bowl barrows, cairns along with hill forts such as Norton Camp. Castle Neroche was an Iron Age hill fort which was reused as a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. Burrow Mump shows evidence of Roman use but is better known as a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, and later church. It was presented, in 1946, by Major Alexander Gould Barrett, to the National Trust {{to serve as a}} memorial to the 11,281 Somerset men who lost their lives during the first and second world wars.|$|E
5|$|There are {{hundreds}} of clubs and student organizations at the university. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> centred around McGill's student union building, the University Centre. There are student-run teams located in the McConnell building such as the McGill Racing Team, McGill EV and McGill Baja. In 1992, students held a referendum which called for the University Centre to be named for actor and McGill alumnus William Shatner. The university administration {{refused to accept the}} name and did not attend the opening. Traditionally, the administration names buildings in honour of deceased members of the university community or for major benefactors—Shatner is neither.|$|E
