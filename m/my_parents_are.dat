However, later, in an interview for the Ukrainian version of the Vogue magazine, Milla stated she doesn't actually consider herself Ukrainian. Expressing her disagreement with several newspapers that presented Jovovich as a [...] "Ukrainian actress", her mother Galina said, [...] "They may say whatever they want. <b>My</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> Russian, from Tula. Milla is half Russian, half Montenegrin. But, I think, she considers herself of Russian descent".|$|E
500|$|On {{joining the}} cast of Holby City, Lewington commented: [...] "I've been on cloud nine since {{receiving}} that all-important phone call. <b>My</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> surprised to suddenly have a doctor in the family but are thrilled nonetheless! I'm just {{really looking forward to}} being part of an incredible cast in such a successful show – I can't wait!" [...] A spokesperson for BBC Publicity added: [...] "We are delighted to have Nadine on board to play the part of Maddy, she's a great addition to the show and her character will be involved in some dramatic storylines." [...] Discussing her casting a year into her time on the show, Lewington assessed: [...] "I enjoy it more as I wade through the years. As with any ensemble work, the more time spent as a team, working together and discovering each others rhythms, dynamics and struggles, the better. And because of that, more fun. I certainly feel more settled and confident. Part of something. It was all a bit daunting for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. <b>My</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, if I can help, that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|The allusive {{literary}} references used in Fun Home are {{not merely}} structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, [...] "I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> most real to me in fictional terms. And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the Arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison." [...] Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. As a child, she confused her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family seen in the cartoons of Charles Addams. Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to Albert Camus' novel A Happy Death and essay The Myth of Sisyphus. His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the narrator suggests that Bruce Bechdel modeled elements of his life after Fitzgerald's, as portrayed in the biography The Far Side of Paradise. His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the Henry James novels Washington Square and The Portrait of a Lady. Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress, and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage. She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of The Taming of the Shrew, and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was [...] "a harbinger of my parents' later marriage". Helen Bechdel's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of The Importance of Being Earnest is shown in some detail; Bruce Bechdel is compared with Oscar Wilde. His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. The father and daughter's artistic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to E. H. Shepard's illustrations for The Wind in the Willows. Bruce and Alison Bechdel exchange hints about their sexualities by exchanging memoirs: the father gives the daughter Earthly Paradise, an autobiographical collection of the writings of Colette; shortly afterwards, in what Alison Bechdel describes as [...] "an eloquent unconscious gesture", she leaves a library copy of Kate Millett's memoir Flying for him. Finally, returning to the Daedalus myth, Alison Bechdel casts herself as Stephen Dedalus and her father as Leopold Bloom in James Joyce's Ulysses, with parallel references to the myth of Telemachus and Odysseus.|$|E
2500|$|Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 {{years his}} bandmates' senior, wrote songs expressing {{his desire for}} {{stability}} and individuality. [...] "I'm Not a Punk" [...] reflected his disinterest in {{being part of the}} anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: [...] "That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it as best I could and I {{had a lot of fun}} doing that [...] It's like 'I'm Not a Punk'. I want to be my own person." [...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't live in a place where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality because my mother was an alcoholic, <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> divorced, I just don't need that assault on my emotions and psyche." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto {{were invited}} by Ono to remix the song [...] "Talking to the Universe" [...] for a Rising remix EP Rising Mixes. They met Lennon and {{invited him to}} join them on tour as a bass player. This {{eventually}} led to Lennon's contributing to their side-project Butter 08 and to his becoming {{a member of the}} group. He continued to play with them on tour, joining them on television and providing bass guitar and vocals on their EP Super Relax. Through his association with Cibo Matto, Lennon was approached by Adam Yauch (of Beastie Boys), who expressed an interest in his music and persuaded him to sign a record contract with Grand Royal Records. Regarding Grand Royal, Lennon has said:I think I found the only label on the planet who doesn't care who <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> and what my name is. It's a good feeling to know that I wouldn't have gotten the offer if they wouldn't have liked my songs. That's pretty rare in the music business! ...|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{began by}} writing tracks for {{artists such as}} Alesha Dixon, Chipmunk, Professor Green, Devlin, Preeya Kalidas, Cheryl Cole, and Tinie Tempah. While {{trying to get into}} the music {{industry}} she was studying Medicine at the University of Glasgow, but she decided to stop in her fourth year. Sandé always said that her education was the most important thing to her, stating if her music career was to fail, she would have her education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently since she was 16, saying [...] "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me. He also knows <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> keen that I finish university." [...] Sandé first performed publicly when she provided guest vocals on Chipmunk's hit single, [...] "Diamond Rings" [...] which she also wrote in 2009. A year later she returned again to the public's attention when she teamed up with Wiley on his comeback single, [...] "Never Be Your Woman", the song became Sandé second top-ten single on the UK Singles Chart. It was later announced that [...] "Never Be Your Woman" [...] was a trail for Sandé with EMI Records to see how well the song charted, with the success the song had, Sandé later signed a record deal with Virgin Records.|$|E

Some one got me {{a job with a}} big cattle company, and sent me to Marysvale, southward over the bleak plains. It was cold; I was ill when I reached Lund. Before I even knew what my duties were for at Lund I was to begin work--men called me a spy. A fellow named Chance {{threatened}} me. An innkeeper led me out the back way, gave me bread and water, and said: 'Take this road to Bane; it's sixteen miles. If you make it some one'll give you a lift North.'

60|$|The {{haunting}} {{thought that}} occasionally, notwithstanding his strong will, would perplex {{the soul and}} agitate the heart of Tancred; the haunting thought that, all this time, he was perhaps the dupe of boyish fantasies, was laid to-day. Sometimes he had felt, Why does no one sympathise with my views; why, though they treat them with conventional respect, is it clear that all I have addressed hold them to be absurd? <b>My</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> pious and instructed; they are predisposed to view everything I say, or do, or think, with an even excessive favour. They think me moonstruck. Lord Eskdale is a perfect man of the world; proverbially shrewd, and celebrated for his judgment; he looks upon me as a raw boy, and believes that, if my father had kept me at Eton and sent me to Paris, I should by this time have exhausted my crudities. The bishop is what the world calls a great scholar; he is a statesman who, aloof from faction, ought to be accustomed to take just and comprehensive views; and a priest who ought {{to be under the}} immediate influence of the Holy Spirit. He says I am a visionary. All this might well be disheartening; but now comes one whom no circumstances impel to judge my project with indulgence; who would, at the first glance, appear to have many prejudices arrayed against it, who knows more of the world than Lord Eskdale, and who appears to me to be more learned than the whole bench of bishops, and he welcomes my ideas, approves my conclusions, sympathises with my suggestions; develops, illustrates, enforces them; plainly intimates that I am only on the threshold of initiation, and would aid me to advance to the innermost mysteries.|$|E
