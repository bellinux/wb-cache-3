RT-PCR expression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between EFS mRNA expression with EFS <b>methylation</b> in UM. EFS <b>methylation</b> was tissue-specific with full <b>methylation</b> in peripheral blood cells, but no <b>methylation</b> in other tissues such as fetal muscle, kidney and brain.|$|E

In the case of the O-methylated flavone tangeritin, all of the five hydroxyls are methylated, leaving no free hydroxyls of the phenol group. <b>Methylations</b> can also occur on directly on a carbon of the benzene ring like in the case of poriol, a C-methylated flavonoid.|$|R
5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of <b>methylation</b> of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA <b>methylation</b> and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E

25|$|High {{intensity}} exercise {{has been}} shown to result in reduced DNA <b>methylation</b> in skeletal muscle. Promoter <b>methylation</b> of PGC-1α and PDK4 were immediately reduced after high intensity exercise, whereas PPAR-γ <b>methylation</b> was not reduced until three hours after exercise. By contrast, six months of exercise in previously sedentary middle-age men resulted in increased <b>methylation</b> in adipose tissue. One study showed a possible increase in global genomic DNA <b>methylation</b> of white blood cells with more physical activity in non-Hispanics.|$|E
25|$|Whereas DNA <b>methylation</b> is not {{necessary}} per se for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a “locked” state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA <b>methylation</b> appears critical {{for the maintenance of}} mono-allelic silencing in the context of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their <b>methylation</b> status, and loss of DNA <b>methylation</b> results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their <b>methylation</b> status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. DNA <b>methylation</b> appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA <b>methylation</b> is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA <b>methylation</b> appears to directly regulate {{only a limited number of}} genes, how precisely DNA <b>methylation</b> absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.|$|E

40|$|Ribosomal RNAs contain {{numerous}} modifications {{at specific}} nucleotides. Despite their evolutionary conservation, the functional role of individual 2 ′-O-ribose <b>methylations</b> in rRNA is not known. A distinct family of small nucleolar RNAs, box C/D snoRNAs, guides the methylating complex to specific rRNA sites. Using a high-resolution phenotyping approach, we characterized 20 box C/D snoRNA gene deletions for altered growth dynamics under {{a wide array}} of environmental perturbations, encompassing intraribosomal antibiotics, inhibitors of specific cellular features, as well as general stressors. Ribosome-specific antibiotics generated phenotypes indicating different and long-ranging structural effects of rRNA <b>methylations</b> on the ribosome. For all studied box C/D snoRNA mutants we uncovered phenotypes to extraribosomal growth inhibitors, most frequently reflected in alteration in growth lag (adaptation time). A number of strains were highly pleiotropic and displayed a great number of sensitive phenotypes, e. g., deletion mutants of snR 70 and snR 71, which both have clear human homologues, and deletion mutants of snR 65 and snR 68. Our data indicate that individual rRNA ribose <b>methylations</b> can play either distinct or general roles in the workings of the ribosome...|$|R
25|$|A {{function}} that appears even more conserved than transposon silencing is {{positively correlated with}} gene expression. In almost all species where DNA <b>methylation</b> is present, DNA <b>methylation</b> is especially enriched {{in the body of}} highly transcribed genes. The function of gene body <b>methylation</b> is not well understood. A body of evidence suggests that it could regulate splicing and suppress the activity of intragenic transcriptional units (cryptic promoters or transposable elements). Gene-body <b>methylation</b> appears closely tied to H3K36 <b>methylation.</b> In yeast and mammals, H3K36 <b>methylation</b> is highly enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. In yeast at least, H3K36me3 recruits enzymes such as histone deacetylases to condense chromatin and prevent the activation of cryptic start sites. In mammals, DNMT3a and DNMT3b PWWP domain binds to H3K36me3 and the two enzymes are recruited to the body of actively transcribed genes.|$|E
25|$|QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a {{quantitative}} approach to quantify <b>methylation</b> difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide <b>methylation</b> profiles by adapting Shannon entropy /bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/qdmr>.

25|$|In {{plants and}} other organisms, DNA <b>methylation</b> {{is found in}} three {{different}} sequence contexts: CG (or CpG), CHG or CHH (where H correspond to A,T or C). In mammals however, DNA <b>methylation</b> is almost exclusively found in CpG dinucleotides, with the cytosines on both strand being usually methylated. Non-CpG <b>methylation</b> can however be observed in embryonic stem cells, and has also been indicated in neural development. Furthermore, non-CpG <b>methylation</b> has also been observed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and it occurred mainly in a CpApC sequence context.|$|E

50|$|Modifications to histones such as <b>methylations</b> and acetylations {{can change}} gene {{expression}} patterns by activating or deactivating {{a region of}} DNA for transcription. The H3K9 position has been shown by several studies to be altered by chronic cocaine use.|$|R
50|$|After transcription, nascent rRNA {{molecules}} (termed pre-rRNA) {{undergo a}} series of processing steps to generate the mature rRNA molecule. Prior to cleavage by exo- and endonucleases, the pre-rRNA undergoes a complex pattern of nucleoside modifications. These include <b>methylations</b> and pseudouridylations, guided by snoRNAs.|$|R
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the mean percent <b>methylation</b> of H19 CpGs at sites 13 and 14, after the transcription start site, is insignificant between normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals. This is because <b>methylation</b> of CpGs after the transcription start site is assumed to interfere with RNA polymerase II during transcription. Another point of interest is the significant difference in CpG <b>methylation</b> at site 11 between normal and hyperplasia adrenals. The mean percent CpG <b>methylation</b> at site 11 for hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals is significantly different from that of normal adrenals and carcinoma adrenals, leading Gao et al. to suggest that site 11 is the initial methylated CpG that eventually leads to widespread <b>methylation</b> of the H19 promoter.|$|E

25|$|Epigenetics {{describes}} {{a variety of}} features {{of the human genome}} that transcend its primary DNA sequence, such as chromatin packaging, histone modifications and DNA <b>methylation,</b> and which are important in regulating gene expression, genome replication and other cellular processes. Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA <b>methylation</b> is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression {{and one of the most}} highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA <b>methylation</b> profile experiences dramatic changes. In early germ line cells, the genome has very low <b>methylation</b> levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased <b>methylation</b> activity.|$|E
40|$|Ribosomal RNAs {{contain a}} number of {{modified}} nucleotides. The most abundant nucleotide modifications found within rRNAs fall into two types: 2 ′-O-ribose <b>methylations</b> and pseudouridylations. In eukaryotes, small nucleolar guide RNAs, the snoRNAs that are the RNA components of the snoRNPs, specify the position of these modifications. The 2 ′-O-ribose <b>methylations</b> and pseudouridylations are guided by the box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, respectively. The role of these modifications in rRNA remains poorly understood as no clear phenotype has yet been assigned {{to the absence of}} specific 2 ′-O-ribose <b>methylations</b> or pseudouridylations. Only very recently, a slight translation defect and perturbation of polysome profiles was reported in yeast for the absence of the Ψ at position 2919 within the LSU rRNA. Here we report the identification and characterization in yeast of a novel intronic H/ACA snoRNA that we called snR 191 and that guides pseudouridylation at positions 2258 and 2260 in the LSU rRNA. Most interestingly, these two modified bases are the most conserved pseudouridines from bacteria to human in rRNA. The corresponding human snoRNA is hU 19. We show here that, in yeast, the presence of this snoRNA, and hence, most likely, of the conserved pseudouridines it specifies, is not essential for viability but provides a growth advantage to the cell...|$|R
