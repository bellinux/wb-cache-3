40|$|India – {{the country}} of rich {{heritage}} and culture is pictured through its traditional textiles which are kept alive through generations by the craftsman and his workmanship. Patola of Patan known as a double ikat silk textile, manifests the richness of heritage craft in dazzling colours and admirable motifs, but is a time consuming yarn resist textile. It cannot be duplicated anymore, since the GI recognition is served for its products under the name Patan Patola. The low cost variants of the celebrated Patan Patola have emerged in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat since last four decades as a single ikat craft. These handloom clusters were generally making weft ikat, {{but some of them}} had expertise in double Ikat too. The product which they were making since years was a Saree; the Indian draped garment for women. In the dynamic world of continuous changes, where the power looms are replacing the traditional handlooms, the craft is struggling to be alive in the world of technology and changing tastes of consumers. A design intervention was planned to adapt the product as per the current market. The present study thus aimed to understand the design practice of these craftsmen and build new layouts for yardages which could be developed into specific styles of garments; catering to the demand of the contemporary markets. Pattern layouts for yardages were engineered using traditional as well as contemporary <b>motifs</b> <b>and</b> <b>colours.</b> The producers of the engineered textiles were craftsmen and master craftsman who were keen to venture into making new product in cotton as well. The constructed garments were showcased at different platforms for feedback. The craftsmen adopted this new concept to bring variety in their produce and thus enhance the market penetration...|$|E
40|$|In 1984, {{among the}} {{proposals}} for the redecoration of the British Museum {{was a plan}} to reinstate the decorative scheme for the Entrance Hall created in 1847 by Sydney Smirke. The controversy that ensued is the departure point for this thesis. Sydney Smirke's decorative scheme proved {{to be much more}} than simple embellishment of the space. It was a polychromatic scheme based on ancient Greek <b>motifs</b> <b>and</b> <b>colours</b> and their archaeological manner of use manifested the period's preoccupation with architectural historicism, and also final recognition that the Greeks had used bright colours on their buildings and sculpture. This thesis examines the architectural context of Smirke's scheme, and the development of architectural polychromy as a prominent feature of British architecture between 1840 and 1870. Although previous historical studies have been made of colour in the work of individual architects, and of the relation between the practice of polychromy and architectural thought (especially that of John Ruskin), there exists no comprehensive study of the practice of polychromy in mid-nineteenth century Britain. In particular, existing studies have not sufficiently stressed the great diversity of the sources for British polychromy. Part of the purpose of this thesis is to show that the development of polychromy by British architects was indebted not only to medieval sources, but also to antiquity, and to Islamic sources; and furthermore to show that the emergence of an architectural discourse about polychromy emerged not only out of the study of ecclesiology, and the writings of John Ruskin, but also from classical archaeology, and from contemporary European architectural thought. Of the various figures whose work is studied, Owen Jones emerges as the person who more than any other provided a connection between these diverse sources and ideas...|$|E

40|$|The {{region of}} Gujarat {{in the west}} has been an {{important}} textile export zone of India and remains an important source of printed cloth, in terms of both volume and quality. Early evidence of Gujarat’s involvement in international trade of colourful block printed textiles comes from the fragments found at the Fostat excavations in Egypt. These have been dated back to the fifteenth century and have been printed by the resist printing technique. The designs, <b>motifs</b> <b>and</b> <b>colours</b> are typical of the hand block printed textiles characteristic of the region today. Khavda and Dhamadka villages in Kutch were known for printing the exotic rich blue and red cloth known as Ajrakh. These cloths were printed in a complicated sequence that involved both resist and mordant techniques. The deep blue sheen was derived from repeated dipping in indigo followed by vigorous beating and polishing. The most highly prized Ajrakh textiles were bipuri, i. e. the ones printed identically on both sides. Traditionally these were used by men as turbans, lungis (sarongs) and shoulder cloths and also as yardages for women’s skirts and veils. The last fifty years has witnessed a tremendous change in every sphere of life, be it economic, social, technological or aesthetic. More and more, old techniques, design structures and patterns are disappearing or losing integrity as a result of transition into other regional or cultural contexts. Ajrakh, with its rich visual vocabulary {{is in a state of}} transition, as traditional processes, raw materials, designs, product categories and markets are evolving within the worldwide phenomenon called globalization. In spite of the omnipresent changes that have occurred over the last millennium, the printers of Ajrakh in Kutch continue to print some of the same design motifs that have been popular since very earlier times. The origin of Ajrakh can be traced to Sind, Pakistan. Although the name Ajrakh has many legends as to its origin but more popularly the term seems to be derived from Azrak, which means blue in Arabic. The artisans who made these textiles belonged to the Khatri community (both Hindus /Muslims) and have had artisans from the Gajjar community making the blocks in a place called Pethapur, near Ahmadabad. Ajrakh (a term thought to be derived from azraq, the Arabic for blue) has a multitude of uses. Always made in a rectangular format (about 2. 5 x 1. 8 m), Ajrakhs may be used as turbans, shawls, or lungis by men and in certain areas of Kutch, as odhnies by women, not to mention the many household uses to which a large rectangular cloth can be put (Charpai-cover, curtain, floorspread). The designs are restricted to a range of geometrical patterns based on squares, with stars, circles and ellipses arranged symmetrically within them. The traditional colouring of Ajrakh is deep blue and red, with a small amount of white and black. According to popular legend, this textile tradition was started in the family of late Mohammad Siddiki when in the year 1586, Raja Bharmal I, invited his forefathers, to migrate from Sind and settle in Dhamadka, Kachchh. The printers amongst the crafts persons who migrated to Dhamadka from Sind were printing the true Azrak – blue, red and white, used by men of the Maldhari community...|$|E

We conducted a study to identify these and to estimate their pertinence in actual product conception. Word-based techniques like retrospective verbalization and mind mapping were employed.

The same low occurrence was seen for production procedures among the concrete dimensions.
