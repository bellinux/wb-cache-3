40|$|The hypophysial homomeric peptide beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH-[1 - 91]) has no morphinomomimetic {{activity}} in a bioassay (myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig's ileum) or binding assays with stereospecific opiate-receptors of rat brain synaptosome preparations. Incubating beta-LPH-[1 - 91] at neutral pH with the supernatant aqueous extracts of rat brain generates (fragments of beta-LPH with) <b>morphinomimetic</b> {{activity in}} the same assay systems. These results {{are related to the}} recently recognized structural relationships between beta-LPH, the newly isolated peptides met-enkephalin (beta-LPH-[61 - 65]) and alpha-endorphin (beta-LPH-[61 - 76]) and also to the biologically active fragments of analogs: beta-LPH-[61 - 64], beta-LPH-[61 - 65 [-NH 2, (Met(O) 65) -BETA-LPH-[61 - 65], beta-LPH-[61 - 69], and beta-LPH-[61 - 69]. Enzymatic biogenesis of these <b>morphinomimetic</b> peptides would preclude localizing them as such in cellular or subcellular elements with currently available methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} and primary structure of two peptides with <b>morphinomimetic</b> activity, obtained from an extract of porcine hypothalamus-neurohypophysis, are described. The {{amino acid sequence}} of the two peptides, named α-endorphin and γ-endorphin, was determined by mass spectrometry and densyl-Edman methods to be H-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Thr-Ser-Glu-Lys-Ser-Gln-Thr-Pro-Leu-Val-Thr-OH and H-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Thr-Ser-Glu-Lys-Ser-Gln-Thr-Pro-Leu-Val-Thr-Leu-OH, respectively. These correspond to the amino acid sequences present between residues 61 and 76 and residues 61 and 77 of the various β-lipotropins. A third peptide also obtained in pure from in these studies {{was found to be}} an unstable salt of α-endorphin...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundRadiofrequency Atrial Fibrillation (AF) {{ablation}} is now currently performed. It {{is sometimes}} long, complex and painful when not made under general anaesthesia. ObjectiveTo determine the optimal management of pain during AF ablation procedures, by {{bringing back the}} analgesic practices of centers realizing this procedure in France. MethodNational survey realized {{by means of a}} questionnaire containing several items related to analgesia and addressed by mail way in 54 major french centers performing AF ablation. Results 30 on 54 centres answered the questionnaire. In seventeen centers AF ablation is performed under general anaesthesia, in five centers under <b>morphinomimetic</b> (for exemple alfentanyl) +/- sédation (midazolam) taken care by an anaesthetic team (4 centers on 5 are satisfied), in eight centers under analgesia with morphine or nalbuphine +/- sédation (midazolam) taken care by nurses not specialized in anesthesia (4 centers are satisfied, 3 unsatisfied and 1 fairly satisfied there). ConclusionPain management differs according to centers but is made according to 3 main different methods. The analgesia with <b>morphinomimetic</b> +/-sédation taken care with an anaesthetic team seems to be an interesting alternative to the general anaesthesia while analgesia with only morphine or nalbuphine +/- sedation taken care by nurses not specialized in anesthesia is quite unsatisfactory in many cases. Based on this results, a new protocol of analgesia must be settled and will be assessed in the next months...|$|E
40|$|In the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle bioassay, beta-endorphin, i. e., beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) -[61 - 91], has a {{potency of}} 450 with {{confidence}} limits of 281 - 966 when Met 5 -enkephalin {{is used as}} a reference standard with a potency of 100. The primary amide and the ethylamide of Met 5 -enkephalin have potencies statistically overlapping with that of beta-endorphin. The primary amide of alpha-endorphin has twice the potency of the free acid form of alpha-endorphin. An intact NH 2 -terminal tyrosine is not necessary for full intrinsic activity. The shortest fragment of beta-LPH with <b>morphinomimetic</b> activity is beta-LPH-[61 - 64]...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{isolation}} and identification of alpha-N-acetyl {{forms of the}} C-Fragment of lipotropin (beta-endorphin, residues 61 - 91) and the C'-Fragment (residues 61 - 87) [Smyth, D. G., Massey, D. E., Zakarian, S. & Finnie, M. (1979) Nature (London) 279, 252 - 254] {{has led to a}} study of their distribution in the pituitary and brain of the rat. Regions were mapped by the method of immunofluorescent staining and the reactive peptides were determined by immunoassay after extraction, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. The major immunoreactive peptides in both lobes of the pituitary were found to be C'-Fragment and N-acetyl C'-Fragment, which are weakly active or inactive as opiates; the C-Fragment and its N-acetyl derivative represented minor components. This indicates that in the rat the circulating "endorphins" released from pituitary would have little <b>morphinomimetic</b> activity. The same four immunoreactive peptides were observed in rat brain. In the hippocampus the C'-Fragment was the principal component in the midbrain there was more C-Fragment but C'-Fragment predominated; in the hypothalamus the C-Fragment was the major peptide, almost to the exclusion of the other peptides. The results demonstrate that the processing of lipotropin is under differential control in anatomically distinct regions of the central nervous system. The processing of lipotropin in the hypothalamus is directed specifically to the production of lipotropin C-Fragment...|$|E
