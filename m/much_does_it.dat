500|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 October 2010, Glentoran player Matty Burrows {{scored a}} back heel goal against Portadown, which won Burrows the ESPN {{goal of the}} season and Sky Sports goal of the season. The goal also {{achieved}} millions of views on YouTube and went up against world-famous player Lionel Messi for the FIFA goal of the season award. Burrows narrowly lost out on the award with many saying he didn't win because he wasn't a high-profile player. When José Mourinho saw the goal he was quoted as saying [...] "how <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> cost to buy this guy", whilst Cristiano Ronaldo said that the goal deserved to win and would be very difficult for him to attempt.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Deming {{suggested}} [...] "There's {{just one}} problem with the gay agenda: it's based on a lie. Homosexuals are not like heterosexuals, nor is the practice of homosexuality innocuous. The single largest problem for the gay agenda is medical science. [...] The fact that about two-thirds of syphilis and AIDS cases occur amongst {{one percent of the}} population tells us something that is immediate and unambiguous: that homosexuality is not an innocuous choice. What gay men do behind closed doors is fundamentally different from what heterosexuals usually do in their bedrooms. [...] We are informed, endlessly, of the costs of gun violence, cigarette smoking, and obesity. What is the cost of homosexuality? How <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> cost to treat syphilis, AIDS, and a whole host of other diseases? What cost will we bear for the reemergence of syphilis, a disease that was almost eradicated? Neither are these plagues limited to gays. Bisexual men spread them into the heterosexual population." ...|$|E

60|$|Verse of {{this kind}} may be justly praised for the {{sustained}} strength and vigour of its metrical scheme. Its purely technical excellence is extraordinary.

Five francs the stake had been, and you got seven times your stake. And you got your stake back. He was nearly forgetting that. Forty francs in all, then.

60|$|Strictly speaking, {{there is}} no such thing as an English Peasant. Indeed, the type can only exist in community, so <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> depend on {{cooperation}} and common laws. One must not think primarily of a French Peasant; any more than of a German Measle. The plural of the word is its proper form; you cannot have a Peasant till you have a peasantry. The essence of the Peasant ideal is equality; and you cannot be equal all by yourself.|$|E

"How {{much more}} picturesque would it be, and even christian-like in appearance, at least," [...] said Paul, could these good people consent to unite in worshipping God!--and how <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> bring into strong relief, the feebleness and ignorance of man, {{when you see}} him {{splitting}} hairs about doctrines, under which he has been told, in terms as plain as language can make it, that he is simply required to believe in the goodness and power of a Being whose nature and agencies exceed his comprehension." ...|$|E

On the white cross-stripes there are no lovely colored flowers of rose and green and magenta: the three favorite Sardinian colors: nor are there any of the fantastic and griffin-like beasts.

60|$|A {{boat on the}} sea is beautiful. Yet it is {{not built}} for beauty. Every graceful line {{of it is a}} utility, is {{designed}} to perform work. It is created {{for the express purpose of}} dividing the water in front of it, of gliding over the water beneath it, of leaving the water behind it--and all with the least possible wastage of stress and friction. It is not created for the purpose of filling the eye with beauty. It is created for the purpose of moving through the sea and over the sea with the smallest resistance and the greatest stability; yet, somehow, it does fill the eye with its beauty. And in so far as a boat fails in its purpose, by that <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> diminish in beauty.|$|E
60|$|And now <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> grieve me that I {{must leave}} the gallant Peter in this {{imminent}} jeopardy; but it behooves us to hurry {{back and see}} {{what is going on}} at New Amsterdam, for greatly do I fear that city is already in a turmoil. Such was ever the fate of Peter Stuyvesant; while doing one thing with heart and soul he was too apt to leave everything else at sixes and sevens. While, like a potentate of yore, he was absent attending to those things in person which in modern days are trusted to generals and ambassadors, his little territory at home was sure to get in an uproar--all which was owing to that uncommon strength of intellect which induced him to trust to nobody but himself, and which had acquired him the renowned appellation of Peter the Headstrong.|$|E
6000|$|Others {{claimed to}} {{themselves}} the appellation of Conquerors, from their gallant achievements in New Sweden and their {{victory over the}} Yankees at Oyster Bay. Such was that list of warlike worthies heretofore enumerated, beginning with the Van Wycks, the Van Dycks, and the Ten Eycks, and extending to the Rutgers, the Bensons, the Brinkerhoffs, and the Schermerhorns; a roll equal to the Doomsday Book of William the Conqueror, and establishing the heroic origin of many an ancient aristocratical Dutch family. These, after all, are the only legitimate nobility and lords of the soil; these are the real [...] "beavers of the Manhattoes;" [...] and <b>much</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> grieve me in modern days to see them elbowed aside by foreign invaders, and more especially by those ingenious people, [...] "the Sons of the Pilgrims;" [...] who out-bargain them in the market, out-speculate them on the exchange, out-top them in fortune, and run up mushroom palaces so high, that the tallest Dutch family mansion has not wind enough left for its weathercock.|$|E
