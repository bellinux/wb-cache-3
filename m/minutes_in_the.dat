5|$|Bosanquet's {{final season}} for Oxford {{was his best}} statistically. He scored his maiden {{first-class}} century against London County and, against Sussex, he recorded what were {{to be the best}} bowling figures of his career, taking nine for 31 in the second innings and a total of 15 wickets in the game for 65 runs. His final match for Oxford was the 1900 University match, in which he scored 42 and 23. For the remainder of the season, Bosanquet re-joined Middlesex, and in his second match, against Leicestershire, achieved the rare distinction of a century in each innings: 136 in 110 <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings, followed by 139 in 170 <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second. He scored three further fifties for Middlesex and once took five wickets in an innings, but bowled comparatively rarely, only once bowling more than 13 overs in an innings. In all first-class matches in the season, Bosanquet scored 1,026 runs at 34.20 and took 50 wickets at 23.20.|$|E

5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within <b>minutes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event of complications or other conditions being present, ascending is always the correct initial response.

5|$|To the north, at Central Front headquarters, {{reports of}} the {{anticipated}} German offensive came in. At around 02:00 5 July, Zhukov ordered his preemptive artillery bombardment to begin. The hope was to disrupt German forces concentrating for the attack, but the outcome was less than hoped for. The bombardment delayed the German formations, but failed in the goal of disrupting their schedule or inflicting substantial losses. The Germans began their own artillery bombardment at about 05:00, which lasted 80 <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern face and 50 <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern face. After the barrage, the ground forces attacked, aided by close air support provided by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Cabral was {{the second}} slowest runner on the soccer team. He tried out for track {{to work on his}} speed. At first he ran the 400 meters in 68 seconds.

5|$|At Euro 2000, Lokvenc made a {{substitute}} {{appearance in the}} Czech Republic's opening game against the Netherlands, replacing Pavel Nedvěd after 89 minutes as the match resulted in a 1–0 win for the Dutch. He replaced Radek Bejbl in the second group match, against France, coming on after 49 <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2–1 loss. Lokvenc appeared in the third group match against Denmark, although due to both teams having lost both of their previous matches, neither team could advance to {{the next round of}} the competition. He came on after 79 minutes, replacing Vladimír Šmicer in a 2–0 win for his nation.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} nation's {{official}} censors ordered scenes {{cut from the}} film. According to Xinhua, the state news agency of the People's Republic of China, ten minutes of footage containing Chow Yun-fat's portrayal of Singaporean pirate Sao Feng were trimmed from versions of the film which may be shown in China. Chow is onscreen for twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uncensored theatrical release of the film. No official reason for the censorship was given, but unofficial sources within China have indicated that the character gave a negative and stereotypical portrayal of Chinese people.|$|E
5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E
50|$|Mohammed Ghaddar {{has been}} a very {{important}} member of the national team since his debut for <b>the</b> national team <b>in</b> 2005.

5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven <b>minutes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|Changing the bogies on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another {{in as little as}} 47 <b>minutes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E
5|$|Engen {{started off}} 2014 at a {{national}} team training camp from January 8 to 15 at U.S. Soccer's National Training Center in Carson, California.
