25|$|After World War II, work by {{politicians}} {{led to the}} agreements of the Bretton Woods Conference, in which major governments laid down the framework for international monetary policy, commerce, and finance, and the founding of several international institutions intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering trade barriers. Initially, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) led {{to a series of}} agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the World Trade Organization (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001. The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreements,</b> such as the 2011 South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, changes and {{developments}} in world politics required Turkey to make <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> {{to improve its}} security. Mustafa Kemal strongly believed that a close cooperation between the Balkan states {{based on the principle}} of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries, and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. Benito Mussolini had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean Mare Nostrum. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of a}} European tour, Nixon visited France in 1969.

5000|$|In the past, {{there have}} been several {{initiatives}} {{for the establishment of a}} more multilateral approach to international investment rulemaking. These attempts include the Havana Charter of 1948, the United Nations Draft Code of Conduct on Transnational Corporations in the 1980s, and the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Investment (MAI) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the 1990s. None of these initiatives reached successful conclusion, due to disagreements among countries and, in case of the MAI, also in light of strong opposition by civil society groups. Further attempts of advancing the process towards establishment of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> have since been made within the WTO, but also without success. Concerns have been raised regarding the specific objectives that such a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> is meant to accomplish, who would benefit in what way from it, and what impact such a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> would have on countries' broader public policies, including those related to environmental, social and other issues. Particularly developing countries may require [...] "policy space" [...] to develop their regulatory frameworks, such as in the area of economic or financial policies, and one major concern was that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on investment would diminish such policy space. As a result, current international investment rulemaking remains short of having a unified system based on a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement.</b> In this respect, investment differs for example from trade and finance, as the WTO fulfills the purpose of creating a more unified global system for trade and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) plays a similar role with respect to the international financial system.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a 3 country {{world in which}} each country's import market is served by competing exporters from its 2 trading partners. We assume that weak multilateral enforcement mechanisms prevent governments from implementing efficient trade policies through a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> requiring tariffs {{to conform to the}} most-favored-nation (MFN) principle. We then ask whether ex- ceptions from MFN for the purpose of forming preferential agreements can lead to lower external tariffs, and thereby to a more efficient tariff structure under the <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement.</b> We identify 3 opposing effects of prefer- ential <b>agreements</b> on the <b>multilateral</b> tariff structure in this setting. The tariff complementarity effect works to reduce the desired external tariffs of countries that join together in a preferential agreement. Two additional effects of preferential agreements arise only when enforcement issues at the multilateral level are considered. One of these, the punishment effect, weakens the ability of the member countries of a preferential agreement to punish deviations from the <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> thereby interfering with the ability of countries to sustain low tariffs under the <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement.</b> The tariff discrimination effect lets countries to discriminate against those who would external tariffs of countries that join together in a preferential agreement. The relative strengths of these 3 effects determine the impact of a prefer- ential agreement on the tariff structure under the <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement.</b> Our findings suggest that preferential agreements can have their most desirable effects on the multilateral system when the degree of multilateral cooperation is low. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper models a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> on {{investment}} (MAI) as a coordination device. Multinational enterprises can invest {{in any number}} of countries. Without a <b>multilateral</b> investment <b>agreement,</b> expropriation triggers an investment stop by the single MNE. Under a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agreement,</b> expropriation leads to a joint reaction by all MNEs. Switching to such a regime increases worldwide FDI and raises the world interest rate. Distinguishing three groups of countries, we show that industrialized countries experience an outflow of capital but benefit overall due to an increase in repatriated profits. Middle income countries are likely to gain from increased inward FDI, whereas least developed countries lose because they receive less FDI. Our results explain the stylized fact that a <b>multilateral</b> investment <b>agreement</b> was opposed by least developed nations and certain groups in rich countries. ...|$|R
