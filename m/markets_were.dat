5|$|Stephen {{set up a}} territory-based {{administrative}} system, establishing counties. Each county, {{headed by}} a royal official known as a count or ispán, was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the pricing {{behaviour}} of print media firms when consumption on reader <b>markets</b> <b>is</b> addictive or habituated. However, not only the reader but also the advertising <b>market</b> has to <b>be</b> considered by a publisher optimising profits. Because print media <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> highly concentrated a monopoly-monopoly model is built, where both <b>markets</b> <b>are</b> of monopolistic structure. Moreover, a monopoly-duopoly model is considered, where only the reader <b>market</b> <b>is</b> monopolistic but the advertising <b>market</b> <b>is</b> of duopolistic structure. To compare the results from the models regarding habit effects, simple static models are presented as a benchmark. ...|$|R

However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).|$|E

5|$|In {{supplying}} this demand, the ice trade increasingly shifted north, {{away from}} Massachusetts and towards Maine. Various factors contributed to this. New Englands' winters became warmer during the 19th century, while industrialisation {{resulted in more}} of the natural ponds and rivers becoming contaminated. Less trade was brought through New England as other ways of reaching western US <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> opened up, making it less profitable to trade ice from Boston, while the cost of producing ships in the region increased due to deforestation. Finally, in 1860 there {{was the first of}} four ice famines along the Hudson-warm winters that prevented the formation of ice in New England-creating shortages and driving up prices.|$|E

5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards {{the end of the}} Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets {{played a central role in}} medieval Chinese nightlife. These <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E

By 1953 the British sf market was going through a metamorphosis similar to the one going in the US at the same time: poor quality sf <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> failing, and the result was a reduced but active market, with four magazines: Authentic, New Worlds, Science Fantasy, and Nebula Science Fiction.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant ice was still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural ice was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural ice for the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E

5|$|At 1200UTC on October23, about 24hours before Wilma {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to the archipelago, the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many failed to fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through {{the region as a}} tropical storm. Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters, as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. As most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, hardware stores and food <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> generally well-stocked.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{incorporated}} by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation as a borough constituency began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870, {{when the original}} borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. From 4 July 1870 the town {{was incorporated}} within the county constituency of West Somerset. When Parliamentary seats were redistributed for the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created. A variety of <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> granted to the town during the Middle Ages including a Midsummer fair (on 24 June), one {{at the beginning of}} Lent was added in 1468, and one at Michaelmas. The importance of these markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine, and later of cloth, declined after medieval times. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The <b>markets</b> <b>were</b> not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town.
